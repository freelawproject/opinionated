We conclude that none of his arguments is persuasive and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-23\">A jury in the United States District Court for the Central District of California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>convicted the appellant Solomon Tekle on fourteen counts of a fifteen-count indictment for conspiracy to import heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 963, 952; attempt to import heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 963, 952; participating in, and aiding and abetting, the structuring of financial transactions to avoid currency reporting requirements, in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5324(a)(3) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a); attempted tax evasion, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201; subscribing to a false tax return, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1); and money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(B)\u00ae. He was sentenced to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. His wife, the co-defendant Lily Tekle, was convicted of the money-laundering and attempted tax evasion counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\">Tekle filed various post-trial motions, which we discuss in Parts II-IV below. The district court denied all of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-6\">The record reveals a sophisticated, well-organized and well-operated scheme to import substantial amounts of heroin from Thailand to the United States. Tekle had couriers who carried a locked suitcase from Los Angeles to Bangkok, where they checked in at a pre-arranged hotel and were visited by a man named \u201cMorrison,\u201d to whom they turned over the suitcase and who procured for them airline transportation from Bangkok to Europe. Another person then visited the courier and delivered a hard suitcase containing slightly more than four kilograms of heroin concealed in a hidden compartment. The hard suitcase itself was contained in a larger suitcase, both of which the courier received. The courier put his or her clothes into the hard suitcase. The courier flew to Europe, from which he returned to Los Angeles on a different airline and delivered the heroin to Tekle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-7\">Tekle arranged the couriers\u2019 trips, obtained airline tickets and made hotel reservations for them, and paid all of their expenses. ' He paid each courier $5,000 or $10,000 for each trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-9\">Couriers then transported the heroin from Los Angeles to Chicago, where they delivered it to Tekle\u2019s customers. They were paid $500 to $1,500 for the Chicago trips.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-10\">Between November 1992 and September 1994, there were seven such importations into the United States and one into Ethiopia. In addition, couriers twice were arrested, once in Bangkok and once in Athens, Greece, on their return to the United States with suitcases containing heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-11\">Tekle does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support his narcotics convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-13\">A. Acting under arrest and search warrants, the police arrested Tekle at the doorway to his residence and placed him in a police car. The arresting agent showed Tekle the first page of one of the warrants but did not give him a copy of either warrant. The agent testified that he did not give Tekle a copy because it would have been taken from him at the time of booking and Tekle did not request it. Further, it was police policy not to give a copy of the search warrant where the occupant of the place to be searched was to be arrested. The agent left a copy of the search warrant, affidavit and inventory at the Tekle residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-14\">During the search, the officers seized approximately sixty boxes of materials from Tekle\u2019s residence and business. The government introduced a significant amount of the seized material at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-15\">The first sentence of Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(d) (amended 2002), as it read at the time of the search, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1161-16\">The officer taking property under the warrant shall give to the person from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>whom or from whose premises the property was taken a copy of the warrant and a receipt for the property taken or shall leave the copy and receipt at the place from which the property was taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1162-4\">Fed. R. Ceim. P. 12 (amended 2002), as it read at the time of trial, provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1162-5\">(b) PRETRIAL MOTIONS. Any defense, objection, or request which is capable of determination without the trial of the general issue may be raised before trial by motion.... The following must be raised prior to trial:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1162-6\">(3) Motions to suppress evidence; ... (f) EFFECT OF FAILURE TO RAISE DEFENSES OR OBJECTIONS. Failure by a party to raise defenses or objections or to make requests which must be made prior to trial, at the time set by the court pursuant to subdivision (c), or prior to any extension thereof made by the court, shall constitute waiver thereof, but the court for cause shown may grant relief from the waiver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1162-7\">Under these provisions, a motion to suppress must be made before trial, and failure to do so constitutes a waiver of the objection unless, for good cause shown the district court vitiates the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-8\">Tekle did not move before or at trial to suppress the evidence seized from his house, based on the police\u2019s failure to give him a copy of the warrant. He first raised the issue in motions for a new trial. The district court rejected the claim. It ruled that although the police had deliberately violated Rule 41(d), Tekle had waived the contention by not raising it before trial and had not shown good cause for relief from the waiver under Rule 12(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-9\">In his appeal Tekle offers no justification or excuse for his failure to move to suppress the seized evidence before trial, as Rule 12(f) required him to do. Instead, he contends that, at the hearing on his post-trial motion to suppress, the district court considered the merits of his motion and that, \u201c[i]n hearing the motion on its merits, the district court \u2018implicitly concludes that there is adequate cause to grant relief from waiver of the right to seek suppression.\u2019 \u201d He relies on <em>United States v. Vasquez, </em>858 F.2d 1387, 1389 (9th Cir.1988), where we held that \u201c[w]hen a court rules on the merits on an untimely suppression motion, it implicitly concludes that there is adequate cause to grant relief from a waiver of the right to seek suppression.\u201d (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-11\">The premise of Tekle\u2019s contention is incorrect. Contrary to his contention, the district court did not rule on the merits of his suppression motion, i.e., it did not hold that the seized evidence should have been suppressed. Instead, the court held that because Tekle had not shown good cause for relief from his waiver, he was precluded from raising the issue. The court therefore denied his motion to suppress\u2014 not on the merits, as he contends, but because he had waived the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-12\">To be sure, the district court stated in its post-trial order that \u201cthe agent\u2019s failure to serve the search warrant on Solomon Tekle was violative of the Fourth Amendment under <em>McGrew </em>and, therefore, a fundamental violation of Rule 41(d).\u201d That statement was made, however, in rejecting Tekle\u2019s contention before the district court, which he does not repeat here, that \u201ca new trial is warranted because of a change in the law based on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Gantt, </em>194 F.3d 987 (9th Cir.1999).\u201d The district court held, however, that <em>\u201cGantt </em>did not change the law. In fact, the <em>Gantt </em>court acknowledged as much.\u201d In light of that ruling, the district court concluded that \u201cno good cause exists for considering the merits of Defendants\u2019 motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>The decision whether to grant an exception to a Rule 12 waiver lies in the discretion of the district court. <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>749 F.2d 1329, 1336 (9th Cir.1984); <em>cf. United States v. Wilson, </em>895 F.2d 168, 172-73 (4th Cir.1990) (per curiam). The district court did not abuse its discretion in upholding Tekle\u2019s waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-4\">B. Tekle contends that his lawyer\u2019s failure to move to suppress before trial violated his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. To establish this claim, Tekle must show both that (1) \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d and that (2) \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Tekle has made neither showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-5\">The record does not show why counsel failed to move to suppress before trial. It could have reflected counsel\u2019s strategies or tactics in conducting the defense. It also could have reflected counsel\u2019s assumption that the motion was unlikely to succeed because of the language of Rule 41(d) that the officer seizing property must give the person whose property was seized a copy of the warrant \u201cor shall leave the copy ... at the place from which the property was taken.\u201d Since the police officer left a copy of the warrant at the Tekle residence, counsel may have concluded that Rule 41(d) had not been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-6\">To be sure, <em>Gantt </em>subsequently rejected \u201cthe government's] suggestion that] the rule was satisfied because the agents left the complete warrant at the apartment after the conclusion of the search and Gantt\u2019s arrest. We rejected] the government\u2019s reading of Rule 41(d). Absent exigent circumstances, Rule 41(d) requires service of the warrant at the outset of the search on persons present at the search of their premises.\u201d 194 F.3d at 1001. Tekle has not shown, however, that in failing to move to suppress before trial, his counsel\u2019s performance \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>St\u00f1ckland, </em>466 U.S. at 688,104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-9\">Nor has Tekle established that if his counsel had moved to suppress, \u201cthe result\u201d of his criminal trial \u201cwould have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. In rejecting Tekle\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the district court found that most of the seized evidence was \u201ccorroborative or cumulative,\u201d or had a \u201cminimal substantive impact.\u201d Wholly apart from the seized evidence that was introduced at trial, there was abundant proof of Tekle\u2019s guilt. Tekle has not shown that if his counsel had moved before trial to suppress the seized evidence, the jury would have reached a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-11\">The only counts for which Tekle contends there is insufficient evidence to support a conviction are the money-laundering charges. He argues that the government failed to prove one of the three necessary elements of that offense, which we summarized in <em>United States v. Marbella, </em>73 F.3d 1508, 1514 (9th Cir.1996) (citations omitted), as follows: that the defendant \u201c(3) intended the transaction ... to conceal the nature, source, or ownership of the illegal proceeds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-12\">The government asserted that the funds Tekle used to make payments toward the purchase of a Los Alimos home and a grocery store came from his narcotics trafficking. Tekle contends that the government did not prove that he intended to conceal the illegal nature of those funds because the \u201ctransactions in question were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>open, notorious, and did not disguise defendant\u2019s identity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\">The necessary concealment, however, is that of the source of the funds, not the identity of the money-launderer. Two other circuits have so recognized. <em>See, e.g., Hollenback v. United, States, </em>987 F.2d 1272, 1278-80 (7th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Lovett, </em>964 F.2d 1029, 1034 (10th Cir.1992). ' Although we have not decided that question under the money-laundering provision at issue here, we have held under the closely related intent requirement of another money-laundering provision, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(3) that the fact that the defendants did not attempt to disguise their identity did not \u201cnegate their intent to conceal.\u201d <em>United States v. Manarite, </em>44 F.3d 1407, 1416 (9th Cir.1995). We distinguished <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>928 F.2d 940 (10th Cir.1991), as a case where \u201cthe defendant engaged in ordinary commercial transactions with cash that happened to be the proceeds of drug dealing,\u201d rather than in transactions that were \u201cengaged in for the <em>purpose </em>of concealing assets.\u201d <em>Manarite, </em>44 F.3d at 1416 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-5\">The government submitted extensive evidence that Tekle and his wife concealed the nature and source of the funds derived from the narcotics business. Their actions were those that money-launderers typically take to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-6\">Tekle and his wife maintained eight separate bank accounts. They deposited $1.6 million in cash during the two-year period involved in this case. No cash deposit exceeded $10,000. When the proposed deposit exceeded that amount, they made multiple deposits of less than $10,000 on the same day in different banks. Further, as the district court stated, \u201c[i]n addition[ ] to this evidence suggesting concealment or disguise of the source and nature of the funds via a complicated web of interbank transactions, the government presented evidence that on the loan application for their home, Defendants provided false information as to their income and indicated that the funds used to purchase the home were their legitimate savings rather than the proceeds of drug sales.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-8\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the government, <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), the evidence fully supports the money-laundering convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-10\">Tekle\u2019s remaining contentions need not detain us long.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-11\">A. Tekle contends that, contrary to the requirements of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), the prosecution failed before trial to disclose to him exculpatory evidence and that he therefore is entitled to a new trial. The alleged exculpatory evidence related to one of Tekle\u2019s couriers, Dorton, who was arrested in Thailand for heroin possession and imprisoned there. He subsequently was transferred to the United States to serve his sentence, pursuant to a prisoner-transfer treaty between the United States and Thailand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-12\">Dorton testified for the government at trial and was extensively cross-examined about his confinement and treatment in Thailand. In his trial testimony Dorton stated that conditions in the Thai prison were \u201clivable.\u201d In contrast, prior to the trial, while he was temporarily in this country and attempting to be transferred here to serve his sentence, he made statements to a deputy probation officer complaining about and describing bad living conditions in the Thai prison. Tekle contends that the government should have disclosed the latter statement to him, which he could then have used to cross-examine and impeach Dorton.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>To establish a <em>Brady </em>violation, Tekle \u201cmust show (1) that the material was exculpatory; (2) that the exculpatory material was not produced when it should have been; and (3) that the failure timely to produce the exculpatory material\u201d \u201cwas material.\u201d <em>United States v. Steinberg, </em>99 F.3d 1486, 1489-90 (9th Cir.1996) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). A new trial is warranted \u201conly if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1490 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-5\">Dorton\u2019s earlier statement about the deplorable living conditions in the Thai prison was not exculpatory, since it had nothing directly to do with Tekle\u2019s guilt or innocence. At most, it could have been used to cross-examine Dorton in the hope of weakening his credibility. Moreover, it related to only a peripheral point in Dorton\u2019s direct testimony. There is no reason to believe that, had the jury been aware of this earlier statement, it would have rejected Dorton\u2019s testimony. As the district court stated, \u201cDorton\u2019s testimony was corroborated with not one, but two other couriers as well as hotel, airline and telephone records.\u201d [Exc 54] It cannot be said that if this statement had been disclosed to Tekle and used to cross-examine Dorton, the jury verdict \u201cwould have been different.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1165-6\">B. Tekle argues that the government denied him due process by constructively amending his indictment with respect to the money-laundering offenses. \u201cAn amendment of the indictment occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are altered, either literally or in effect, by the prosecutor or a court after the grand jury has last passed upon them.\u201d <em>United States v. Adamson, </em>291 F.3d 606, 614 (9th Cir.2002) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-7\">Tekle was charged with three money-laundering counts, and also with structuring financial transactions to avoid currency reporting requirements. He contends that by introducing evidence and arguing that Tekle and his wife had violated the anti-currency structuring laws through carefully ensuring that cash bank deposits were below $10,000 and that they had committed tax evasion, the government broadened the scope of the money-laundering charges in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-8\">The government did not constructively amend the indictment\u2019s money-laundering charges. The three money-laundering counts (Counts 5, 7 and 13) each charged that the Tekles \u201cconducted ... a financial transaction ... involving the proceeds of the felonious\u201d heroin dealings \u201cknowing that the transaction was designed in whole and in part to conceal and disguise the nature and source of such proceeds\u201d \u2014 the three \u201cfinancial transaction^]\u201d being payments made toward the purchase of the Los Alimos residence and the retail business. The currency structuring and other offenses to which Tekle refers were the means by which the Tekles carried out the money-laundering and for which they were specifically charged in other counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-9\">Tekle contends that the \u201cholding\u201d in <em>Stirone v. United States, </em>361 U.S. 212, 80 S.Ct. 270, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960), \u201cis applicable to the instant case\u201d and supports his argument that the government here constructively amended the indictment. <em>Stirone, </em>however, undermines rather than supports Tekle\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-10\">In that case Stirone was indicted for violating the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 by obstructing interstate commerce in sand through extortion. 361 U.S. at 213, 80 S.Ct. 270. The government introduced evidence of an effect on interstate commerce in both sand and steel. <em>Id. </em>at 214, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>80 S.Ct. 270. The Supreme Court reversed Stirone\u2019s conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 219, 80 S.Ct. 270. It noted that although the indictment charged only interference with interstate commerce in sand and not steel, the district court permitted the jury to consider the latter form of commerce. Therefore, \u201cit cannot be said with certainty that with a new basis for conviction added, Stirone was convicted solely on the charge made in the indictment the grand jury returned. Although the trial court did not permit a formal amendment of the indictment, the effect of what it did was the same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217, 80 S.Ct. 270. The Court held: \u201c[WJhen only one particular kind of commerce is charged to have been burdened a conviction must rest on that charge and not another, even though it be assumed that under an indictment drawn in general terms a conviction might rest upon a showing that commerce of one kind or another had been burdened.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218, 80 S.Ct. 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-4\">The difference between <em>Stirone, </em>and the present case is clear. In <em>Stirone </em>the indictment charged only obstructing interstate commerce in sand, but the conviction could have rested on obstructing such commerce in steel. In the present case, however, the additional charges that Tekle asserts constructively amended the money-laundering counts were themselves charged in other counts of the indictment and were integral parts of the money-laundering scheme itself. Tekle\u2019s conviction under the money-laundering counts could not have rested upon a crime not charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-5\">C. Finally, Tekle contends that he was denied a fair trial by ethnic references made by a government expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-6\">In explaining the pricing of heroin in Chicago, the witness referred to \u201cvariables.\u201d Asked to explain what that meant, he stated: \u201cOne variable is, if the buyer and the seller are both West Africans, then the sale of the heroin is \u2014 the sale is \u2014 the price paid is much cheaper. If it\u2019s a West African individual who may be selling it to an African American individual, the price is quite a bit higher.\u201d Since Tekle did not object at trial to the witness\u2019s statements, we review them for plain error. <em>United States v. Cabrera, </em>222 F.3d 590, 595 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-8\">Tekle relies on the statement in <em>Cabrera </em>that \u201c[a]ppeals to racial, ethnic, or religious prejudice during the course of a trial violate a defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594. That case involved the testimony of the government\u2019s lead witness, Detective Brooks, who had had undercover drug dealings with the two defendants, Cabrera and Mulgado. <em>Id. </em>at 591. Brooks testified at length.... Throughout his testimony, Detective Brooks made references to Cabrera and Mulgado\u2019s Cuban origin. For example, when asked why he failed to contact Cabrera for three months, Brooks responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1166-9\">Well, we were currently doing other investigations. At this time period, <em>we were working a lot of Cubans in the area.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1166-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 591-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-11\">The court pointed out that Brooks \u201cinitiated all of his improper comments \u2014 about \u2018working Cubans,\u2019 the way Cubans package their drugs in wafers, and that resident aliens tend to be flight risks \u2014 on direct examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597. The court held that \u201cthe admission of Detective Brooks\u2019s improper references to Cubans was plain error\u201d and required reversal of the convictions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1166-12\">The present case is a far cry from <em>Cabrera. </em>Here, the witness was not the government\u2019s lead witness but an expert on drug pricing. His references to West African drug dealers were not gratuitous but were an explanation of how heroin dealers in Chicago priced the drugs and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>how differences in their ethnicity and that of their customers would affect the price. His statements about West Africans were a necessary part of his explanation of drug pricing in Chicago and, unlike Brooks\u2019s gratuitous comments about Cubans in <em>Cabrera, </em>were not \u201cimproper references to [West Africans].\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 597. They were not \u201c[a]ppeals to ... ethnic ... prejudice,\u201d as in <em>Cabrera. See id. </em>at 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-5\">Finally, unlike <em>Cabrera, </em>where the witness\u2019s statements about Cubans were made in a case in which the defendants themselves were Cuban, so that the prejudicial impact was serious, here the statements about West Africans did not directly affect Tekle, who was from Ethiopia, which is in East Africa.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
