Appellants brought this action seeking a declaration that Fla. Stat. \u00a7 39.401(1), which purportedly authorized the removal of the children, is unconstitutional both facially and as applied to them. They also asserted a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim for money damages against O\u2019Brien in her individual capacity, alleging that she violated their constitutional rights by taking their children without judicial authorization and in the absence of a true emergency. For the reasons explained herein, we conclude \u00a7 39.401(1) is not unconstitutional, and Appellants have not demonstrated a violation of their constitutional rights. Furthermore, in the absence of any constitutional violation, Appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>cannot prevail on their \u00a7 1983 claim against O\u2019Brien. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-5\">On January 18, 2000, DCF officials in St. Augustine, Florida, were informed that T.O., John Doe\u2019s nine-year-old niece, had recently reported being abused by John Doe approximately four years earlier, when T.O. was five. T.O., who is deaf, reportedly accused John Doe of making her touch his penis and perform oral sex. DCF officials in St. Augustine investigated the report and discovered that John Doe was residing in Hillsborough County, Florida, with his wife, Jane Doe, and their three minor children, D.M. (age 13), N.O. (age 9), and B.O. (age 6).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On January 21, 2000, the St. Augustine office forwarded the report to DCF\u2019s Hillsborough County office, where the case was assigned to O\u2019Brien at approximately 12:30 P.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-6\">Soon after receiving the report, O\u2019Brien commenced an investigation and discovered that John Doe had previously been investigated by DCF in 1995. In the 1995 case, John Doe had been accused of placing his penis in the rectum of a three-year old boy whom Jane Doe was babysitting. According to O\u2019Brien, DCF believed the allegation to be true but had not pressed charges due to lack of cooperation from the victim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1340-7\">O\u2019Brien also discovered during her investigation that John Doe had a criminal record involving crimes of a sexual nature.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to a report she received from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE), John Doe was convicted in 1989 of two counts of lewd and lascivious behavior stemming from an incident in which he exposed and fondled himself in front of children at a school bus stop.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The report also indicated that John Doe had previously been charged with solicitation of prostitution and had been accused of, but not charged with, rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-12\">At approximately 2.T0 P.M., O\u2019Brien met with her supervisor, Wanda Rios. Rios recommended sheltering all three of Appellants\u2019 children, but advised O\u2019Brien to first contact DCF\u2019s legal department. Following Rios\u2019 recommendation, O\u2019Brien consulted with DCF legal counsel at approximately 2:45 P.M., and was advised to take the children into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-13\">At approximately 3:30 P.M., O\u2019Brien proceeded to D.M.\u2019s school. She interviewed the child and explained that she was going to talk to D.M.\u2019s parents and siblings and \u201cmake sure everybody was okay.\u201d O\u2019Brien then arranged for D.M. to be taken into custody, and attempted to summon a deputy sheriff to accompany her to Appellants\u2019 residence. For reasons unexplained, however, the deputy never arrived and, after waiting approximately one hour, O\u2019Brien proceeded to Appellants\u2019 residence alone. She arrived there at approximately 5:20 P.M. and, after explaining that she was there to investigate a report of child abuse, was invited inside by Appellants. O\u2019Brien then proceeded to interview John Doe, Jane Doe, N.O., and B.O.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number>At approximately 6:00 P.M., after she had interviewed each member of the Doe family, O\u2019Brien concluded the children were in danger of abuse from John Doe. She also concluded that Jane Doe was incapable of protecting the children and that the children would need to be temporarily removed for their safety.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The children were subsequently taken to their maternal grandparents\u2019 home, where they remained for the night. The following morning, a state judge concluded there was a lack of probable cause to keep the children apart from their parents, and ordered that all three children be immediately returned to Appellants. Appellants subsequently commenced this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-7\">Section 39.401(1) governs the state\u2019s emergency removal of children who are believed to be in danger of child abuse. It provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1341-8\">(1) A child may only be taken into custody:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1341-9\">(b) By a law enforcement officer, or an authorized agent of the [DCF], if the officer or authorized agent has probable cause to support a finding:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1341-10\">1. That the child has been abused, neglected, or abandoned, or is suffering from or is in imminent danger of illness or injury as a result of abuse, neglect, or abandonment[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1341-13\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 39.40K1).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1341-14\">Consistent with \u00a7 39.401(1), DCF\u2019s policy is to remove a child from a parent or legal guardian without prior judicial authorization when there is probable cause to believe the child has been abused or is in imminent danger of abuse. Appellants maintain that DCF routinely removes children believed to be in danger of abuse without first attempting to determine whether there is time to obtain a court order before effecting the removal without exacerbating the risk to the child. O\u2019Brien acknowledges that she did not attempt to determine whether there was time to obtain a court order before she removed the Doe children from their parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-15\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-16\">Appellants asserted in their complaint that \u00a7 39.401(1) violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and violates the Fourth Amendment (as made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth) by authorizing the warrant-less removal of their children. They also asserted that O\u2019Brien violated their constitutional rights when she took their children into custody without prior judicial authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-17\">On January 22, 2001, Appellants filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking: (1) a declaration that \u00a7 39.401(1) is unconstitutional; (2) a determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>that O\u2019Brien violated their Fourteenth and Fourth Amendment rights; and (3) a determination that O\u2019Brien was not entitled to qualified immunity. On April 9, 2001, the district court issued an order denying Appellants\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment. In its order, the court concluded \u00a7 39.401(1) comports with due process requirements and comports with the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As to the \u00a7 1983 claim against O\u2019Brien, the court concluded the central issue was whether there were emergency circumstances warranting her removal of the children without prior judicial approval, and that genuine issues of material fact existed as to that issue. On June 19, 2001, the case proceeded to trial on the \u00a7 1983 claim against O\u2019Brien. At the conclusion of Appellants\u2019 case in chief, the district court granted O\u2019Brien\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law on the basis of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-4\">Appellants challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal <em>of </em>their constitutional claims and the court\u2019s judgment as a matter of law in favor of O\u2019Brien on the issue of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-6\">Before turning to the substantive issues raised on appeal, we first consider whether Appellants have standing to challenge \u00a7 39.401(1). The district court determined Appellants had standing to sue, notwithstanding the fact that their children had been returned to them prior to the commencement of this lawsuit. We review that determination <em>de novo. See Maiz v. </em>Virani, 253 F.3d 641, 654 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-8\">Article III standing requirements preclude claims in which the plaintiff has failed to make out a case or controversy between himself and the defendant. <em>Lynch v. Baxley, </em>744 F.2d 1452, 1455-56 (11th Cir.1984). A plaintiff will generally have standing where three criteria are met: (1) the plaintiff has experienced injury in fact; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s conduct; and (3) the plaintiffs harm is likely to be redressed should the court order relief. <em>See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). Appellants\u2019 claims in this case easily satisfy the first two criteria. Parents have a fundamental right to the custody of their children, and the deprivation of that right effects a cognizable injury. <em>See Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 758-59, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 1397, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982). Furthermore, the injury in this case is clearly traceable to Florida\u2019s enactment and enforcement of \u00a7 39.401(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-9\">The third criterion \u2014 redressability \u2014 presents a greater hurdle for Appellants. The alleged injury \u2014 Florida\u2019s temporary removal of their children\u2014 has already occurred and will not necessarily occur again. <em>See Los Angeles v. Lyons, </em>461 U.S. 95, 105-06, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 1667, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983) (no redressability in the absence of \u201ca real and immediate threat\u201d that challenged state action will re-occur). Nevertheless, the redressability requirement will usually be satisfied where there is evidence that the plaintiff is likely to encounter the same injurious conduct in the future. <em>See City of Houston v. Hill, </em>482 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>451, 459 n. 7, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 2508 n. 7, 96 L.Ed.2d 398 (1987); <em>see also Lynch, </em>744 F.2d at 1456-57 (recognizing that \u201c[p]ast wrongs do constitute evidence bearing on whether there is a real and immediate threat of repeated injury which could be averted by the issuing of an injunction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-4\">Though a close issue, we conclude the redressabiiity requirement is satisfied in this case. DCF has classified John Doe as fitting a \u201cpattern of sexual offenders\u201d and has now investigated him on two separate occasions. Given this classification and history, it seems reasonably likely that Appellants could encounter future state action under \u00a7 39.401(1). Moreover, the Supreme Court has recognized an exception to the basic standing requirement in cases where a plaintiffs claims are \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d <em>Gerstein v. Pugh, </em>420 U.S. 103, 110 n. 11, 95 S.Ct. 854, 861 n. 11, 43 L.Ed.2d 54 (1975); <em>see also Lynch, </em>744 F.2d at 1457. Pretrial detention falls into this category because it is \u201cby nature temporary, and it is most unlikely that any given individual could have his constitutional claim decided on appeal before he is either released or convicted.\u201d <em>Gerstein, </em>420 U.S. at 110 n. 11, 95 S.Ct. at 861 n. 11. The removal of Appellants\u2019 children \u2014 though not a criminal detention as in <em>Gerstein </em>\u2014 is nevertheless a form of pretrial detention that will typically have ended by the time a legal challenge can be mounted. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 39.401(3) (requiring a hearing within 24 hours of state\u2019s removal of children). Consequently, any constitutional injury will likely be too fleeting to be redressed and hence qualifies as being capable of repetition yet evading review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-5\">We therefore conclude Appellants have standing to challenge \u00a7 39.401(1), and we turn our attention to the merits of that challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-8\">Appellants maintain that \u00a7 39.401(1), both facially and as applied, violates their right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and their Fourth Amendment right to be free from unlawful search and seizure. The constitutionality of a statute is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Ranch House, Inc. v. Amerson, </em>238 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-10\">The Supreme Court has held that parents have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in the care, custody and management of their children. <em>See Santosky, </em>102 S.Ct. at 1397. \u201cAs a general rule, therefore, before parents may be deprived of the care, custody or management of their children without their consent, due process \u2014 ordinarily a court proceeding resulting in an order permitting removal \u2014 must be accorded to them.\u201d <em>Tenenbaum v. Williams, </em>193 F.3d 581, 593 (2d Cir.1999) (citing <em>Stanley v. Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 649, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 1212, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972)). \u201cAt the same time, however, the State has a profound interest in the welfare of the child, particularly his or her being sheltered from abuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593-94. Consequently, courts have recognized that a state may constitutionally remove children threatened with imminent harm when it is justified by emergency circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Mabe v. San Bernardino County, Dep\u2019t of Pub. Soc. Sens., </em>237 F.3d 1101, 1106 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Brokaw v. Mercer County, </em>235 F.3d 1000, 1020 (7th Cir.2000); <em>Tenenbaum, </em>193 F.3d at 593-94; <em>Hollingsworth v. Hill, </em>110 F.3d 733, 739 (10th Cir.1997); <em>Jordan by Jordan v. Jackson, </em>15 F.3d 333, 346 (4th Cir.1994); <em>cf. United States v. Edmondson, </em>791 F.2d 1512, 1514 (11th Cir.1986) (allowing warrantless search and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>seizure in criminal cases where exigent circumstances exist). By limiting warrant-less removals to true emergencies, the law \u201cseeks to strike a balance among the rights and interests of parents, children, and the State.\u201d <em>Tenenbaum, </em>193 F.3d at 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-4\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak8\">Appellants first contend that \u00a7 39.401(1) is facially unconstitutional. In order to prevail on their facial challenge, Appellants must establish that there is <em>no </em>set of circumstances under which \u00a7 39.401(1) may be constitutionally applied. <em>Williams v. Pryor, </em>240 F.3d 944, 953 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cThis \u2018heavy burden\u2019 makes such an attack \u2018the most difficult challenge to mount successfully\u2019 against an enactment.\u201d <em>Horton v. City of St. Augustine, Fla., </em>272 F.3d 1318, 1329 (11th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-6\">Section 39.401(1) authorizes state officials to remove a child without a prior court order only where there is probable cause to believe the child has been abused, neglected, or abandoned, or if there is probable cause to believe the child is in imminent danger of abuse. Appellants complain that DCF routinely removes children on an ostensibly emergency basis without a warrant and without first considering the feasibility of obtaining judicial authorization. In other words, they accuse DCF of treating almost all cases of suspected abuse as emergencies. The effect of this practice, according to Appellants, is the <em>de facto </em>elimination of the warrant requirement in derogation of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-9\">The problem with this argument \u2014 as far as Appellants\u2019 facial challenge is concerned \u2014 is that it is aimed at DCF\u2019s <em>application </em>of \u00a7 39.401(1). Section 39.401(1) authorizes the state\u2019s warrantless removal of children in cases where the child is believed to be in imminent danger of abuse. Although Appellants contend that DCF has artificially inflated the meaning of \u201cimminent danger,\u201d the <em>face </em>of the statute is silent as to what circumstances may reasonably be considered to constitute \u201cimminent danger.\u201d As Appellants have themselves acknowledged, it is <em>possible </em>to apply \u00a7 39.401(1) in a manner that does not offend due process. By definition, then, \u00a7 39.401(1) is not facially unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-10\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-11\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-12\">Appellants\u2019 as-applied challenge\u2014 like their facial challenge \u2014 hinges on their argument that O\u2019Brien\u2019s warrantless removal of their children was not actually supported by emergency circumstances and therefore violated due process. The issue boils down to how we define an emergency.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Appellants assert an emergency must be defined by reference to the feasibility of obtaining a court order before effecting a removal. Stated differently, they argue that if there is time to obtain a court order without exacerbating the risk to the child, then there can never be an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>emergency and the state must obtain a court order no matter how emergent the child\u2019s circumstances otherwise appear. They would have us craft a rule that reads something like this: <em>Due process requires that a state official obtain a court order prior to removing a suspected victim of child abuse from parental custody, unless: (1) the official has probable cause to believe the child is in imminent danger of abuse; </em>and <em>(2) the official reasonably determines that there is insufficient time to obtain judicial permission before temporarily removing the child.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1345-5\">We are not persuaded that due process demands such an inflexible rule. Aside from our concerns about imposing a new and onerous burden on child welfare agencies, many of which already operate under considerable strain, we do not believe that the single focus of a due process analysis ought to be on the court\u2019s schedule. Due process is a flexible concept, and \u201cwhat procedures due process may require under any given set of circumstances must begin with a determination of the precise nature of the government function involved as well as of the private interest that has been affected by governmental action.\u201d <em>Stanley, </em>405 U.S. at 650-51, 92 S.Ct. at 1212 (quotation omitted). In order to properly define the interests at stake and weigh their relative importance, courts should be allowed to consider <em>all </em>relevant circumstances, including the state\u2019s reasonableness <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in responding to a perceived danger <em>as well as </em>the objective nature, likelihood, and immediacy of danger to the child. Having considered all relevant factors, courts may then decide whether an objectively imminent danger justified the state\u2019s removal of a child without prior judicial authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-8\">None of the cases cited by Appellants \u2014 with one exception which we will address \u2014 supports the proposition that a child welfare worker must specifically determine whether there is time to obtain a court order before conducting an emergency removal. To the contrary, these cases simply recognize \u2014 as we do \u2014 that a state may not remove a child from parental custody without judicial authorization unless there is probable cause to believe the child is threatened with imminent harm. <em>See, e.g., Roska v. Peterson, </em>304 F.3d 982, 993 (10th Cir.2002) (recognizing that while \u201cthe mere possibility of danger\u201d does not justify a warrantless removal, \u201cemergency circumstances which pose an immediate threat to the safety of a child\u201d do); <em>Brokaw, </em>235 F.3d at 1020 (observing that due process requires \u201cthat governmental officials will not remove a child from his home without an investigation and pre-deprivation hearing resulting in a court order of removal, absent exigent circumstances\u201d); <em>Wallis v. Spencer, </em>202 F.3d 1126, 1138 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cOfficials may remove a child from the custody of its parent without prior judicial authorization only if the information they possess at the time of the seizure is such as provides reasonable cause to believe that the child is in imminent danger of serious bodily injury and that the scope of the intrusion is reasonably necessary to avert that specific injury.\u201d); <em>Hollingsworth, </em>110 F.3d at 739 (\u201cRemoval of children from the custody of their parents requires pre-deprivation notice and a hearing \u2018except for extraordinary situations where some valid govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>mental interest is at stake that justifies postponing the hearing until after the event.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Weller v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs, for City of Baltimore, </em>901 F.2d 387, 393 (4th Cir.1990) (\u201cDue process does not mandate a prior hearing in cases where emergency action may be needed to protect a child.\u201d). Contrary to Appellants\u2019 position, none of these cases held that imminent danger must be defined by reference to a court\u2019s schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-4\">Only the Second Circuit seems to have taken a position fully consistent with Appellants\u2019 argument. In <em>Tenenbaum v. Williams, </em>a two-to-one panel decision, the court held a social worker could not temporarily remove a child from her parents\u2019 custody without prior judicial authorization unless there was probable cause to believe the child was in imminent danger of abuse <em>and </em>the social worker reasonably determined there was insufficient time to obtain a court order before removing the child from danger. 193 F.3d at 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-5\">In <em>Tenenbaum, </em>an employee of the New York City Child Welfare Administration (CWA) removed five-year-old Sarah Ten-enbaum from school several days after Sarah\u2019s teacher first reported noticing signs of abuse. CWA officials, without consulting legal counsel, took Sarah into custody for the express purpose of physically examining her to rule out the possibility of abuse. <em>Id. </em>at 590. After an examination uncovered no signs of abuse and Sarah was returned home, her parents brought suit against the City and the individual CWA employees responsible for Sarah\u2019s removal. <em>Id. </em>at 591. Their suit alleged a number of constitutional violations, including a violation of their procedural due process rights based on the removal of their daughter without prior court authorization. <em>Id. </em>at 592. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on the procedural due process claim, finding Sarah\u2019s removal was justified by emergency circumstances. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1346-8\">On appeal, the Second Circuit held the district court erred in failing to specifically consider whether CWA workers had enough time obtain a court order before they removed Sarah. <em>Id. </em>at 594-95. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1346-9\">If the danger to the child is not so imminent that there is reasonably sufficient time to seek prior judicial authorization, <em>ex parte </em>or otherwise, for the child\u2019s removal, then the circumstances are not emergent; there is no reason to excuse the absence of the judiciary\u2019s participation in depriving the parents of the care, custody and management of their child. If, irrespective of whether there is time to obtain a court order, all interventions are effected on an \u201cemergency\u201d basis without judicial process, pre-seizure procedural due process for the parents and their child evaporates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApPd\"><em>Id. </em>at 594-95 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-10\">. Consequently, the court held that \u201cit is unconstitutional for state officials to effect a child\u2019s removal on an \u2018emergency\u2019 basis where there is reasonable time safely to obtain judicial authorization consistent with the child\u2019s safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596.</p>\n<p id=\"A9q\">Applying this standard to the facts of <em>Tenenbaum, </em>the Second Circuit observed that CWA employees routinely faded to consider whether there was time to obtain court authorization before taking children \u2014 and did not do so in Sarah\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>at 591, 595. Thus, the court concluded the plaintiffs could demonstrate a violation of their procedural due process rights.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>The dissenting member of the panel in <em>Tenenbaum, </em>argued that the unintended consequence of the majority\u2019s rule would be to force child welfare workers to always obtain a warrant, tipping the constitutional balance away from the state\u2019s paramount interest in protecting children. He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1347-5\">Every time a child welfare worker has reason to suspect child abuse, she will have to consider (i) whether there is reason to believe the child is in imminent danger (which until now has been all that was required) <em>and </em>(ii) whether there is time to get to court and obtain a court order (the majority\u2019s new requirement) <em>as well as </em>(iii) whether a court or jury will second-guess that decision on the basis that more efficient decision-making would have afforded sufficient time to obtain the court order. In terms of litigation, individual liability and damages, an error on the side of removal is risky, while an error on the other side is safe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1347-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 611 (Jacobs, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-7\">The dissent also criticized <em>Tenenbaum </em>as representing a dramatic departure from previous Second Circuit precedent:</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-8\">The majority opinion announces a new and incompatible principle: that there is no such emergency, notwithstanding the exigency, if there is or may be time to obtain a court order. None of our cases has held that the availability of the emergency-removal exception depends on whether there is time to obtain judicial pre-authorization. <em>Each of our pri- or cases requires only that an emergency exist, a fact that is determined by reference to the child\u2019s peril, not the case worker\u2019s schedule or the court\u2019s calendar. </em>This is a sensible formulation, and one that keeps the child welfare worker focused on what matters first in these cases, the child\u2019s precarious welfare. When a child\u2019s safety is threatened, that is justification enough for action first and hearing afterward.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 608 (Jacobs, J., dissenting) (quotation omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-12\">We agree that the sole focus should not be whether there is time to obtain a court order. The Second Circuit\u2019s holding in <em>Tenenbaum, </em>which seems \u201cso measured and reasonable in the pages of a federal appellate opinion, will work serious harm in an exceptionally sensitive area of state responsibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 610 (Jacobs, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As we have previously alluded to, due process is a flexible concept \u2014 particularly where the well-being of children is concerned \u2014 and deciding what process is due in any given case requires a careful balancing of the interests at stake, including the interests of parents, children, and the state. Those interests may be implicated to varying degrees depending on the facts of an individual case, which will necessarily affect the degree of procedural due process required. This kind of subtle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>balancing cannot be properly accomplished when courts blunt the inquiry by simply asking whether there was time to get a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-4\">The only other case we are aware of that even arguably supports tying the definition of emergency to a court\u2019s calendar is the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Mabe. </em>In <em>Mabe, </em>the court upheld a due process challenge to county officials\u2019 warrantless removal of the plaintiffs daughter. 237 F.3d at 1109. The court observed, \u201cAssuming that [a county social worker] could obtain a warrant the same day as the case review committee recommended that MD be removed, it is difficult to understand how the further delay of a few hours necessary to obtain the warrant would have put MD in imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1108 (footnote omitted). But <em>Mabe </em>did not indicate that county social workers had to ascertain specifically whether there was time to get a warrant prior to removing the child from imminent danger. <em>Id. </em>Instead, the court considered <em>several </em>factors before concluding the removal in that case violated due process. These included the county\u2019s unexplained month-long delay in removing the child once it became aware of the danger, its awareness that there had been no abuse for at least a month, and the likelihood that the suspected abuse did not involve violence or penetration. <em>Id. </em>Thus, <em>Mabe, </em>like the majority of other cases that have considered the issue, actually examined all relevant circumstances before concluding due process in that case demanded a pre-deprivation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-5\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-6\">In light of the relevant circumstances in this case, we conclude there is no question but that there was an objectively imminent danger to the Doe children so as to justify O\u2019Brien\u2019s temporary removal of the children without prior court authorization. O\u2019Brien received two documented reports of severe sexual abuse involving John Doe, one of which involved a disabled family member and both of which involved extremely young children. She also received a report from the FDLE documenting John Doe\u2019s criminal past, including a conviction for lewd and lascivious behavior around children.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1348-11\">Furthermore, the record demonstrates that O\u2019Brien responded reasonably and swiftly as soon as she became aware of the possible danger to the Doe children. This is not a case where a social worker manufactured an emergency in order to circumvent judicial participation. <em>Cf. Mabe, </em>237 F.3d at 1105, 1109 (failure to obtain court order could not be excused by emergency circumstances where over one month elapsed between the report of child abuse and social worker\u2019s eventual removal of the child). Here, O\u2019Brien investigated diligently and acted almost immediately after the relevant facts came to her attention. At the same time, she did not rush to judgment or react impulsively. Rather, she consulted with both her supervisor and DCF legal counsel before taking steps toward removing the Doe children. <em>See Hollingsworth, </em>110 F.3d at 741 (suggesting that an emergency removal is more likely to be objectively reasonable where defendant relied on advice of counsel); <em>cf. Tenenbaum, </em>193 F.3d at 591 (noting defendant\u2019s failure to consult with \u201creadily available\u201d legal counsel prior to effecting emergency removal of Sarah Tenenbaum). Even then, O\u2019Brien did not remove the children until after she interviewed both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>the parents and children and determined the children were unsafe. In short, while it is almost always possible to criticize an official\u2019s conduct in hindsight, we conclude O\u2019Brien\u2019s actions in this case were nearly unassailable. We therefore hold O\u2019Brien\u2019s warrantless removal of the children did not violate Appellants\u2019 right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-6\">Appellants also contend that \u00a7 39.401(1) and O\u2019Brien\u2019s application of it violated their Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Appellants acknowledge that their Fourth Amendment claims mirror their procedural due process claims in that the seizure of the children was not unconstitutional if supported by exigent circumstances.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See Wallis, </em>202 F.3d at 1137 n. 8; <em>Tenenbaum, </em>193 F.3d at 605. For the same reasons that Appellants cannot demonstrate a procedural due process violation, neither can they demonstrate a Fourth Amendment violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-8\">Appellants also challenge the district court\u2019s determination that O\u2019Brien was immune from suit. In weighing a state official\u2019s qualified immunity defense, we conduct a two-part inquiry. First, we ask whether the official\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right. Only if it did do we reach the second question of whether the right was clearly established at the time the conduct occurred so as to overcome the immunity defense. <em>See Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 2156, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). We have determined that O\u2019Brien did not violate Appellants\u2019 constitutional rights. We therefore need not engage in the second part of the qualified immunity analysis, and we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of O\u2019Brien.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-11\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-12\">In conclusion, we hold Appellants have standing to challenge \u00a7 39.401(1) because they are reasonably likely to suffer another removal under the statute, and the conduct at issue is capable of repetition yet evading review. As to the merits of that challenge, we hold that \u00a7 39.401(1) is not facially unconstitutional because it permits the removal of children without a court order only in an emergency. Nor was \u00a7 39.401(1) applied to Appellants in this case in an unconstitutional manner. In light of all the relevant circumstances, O\u2019Brien had probable cause to believe the Doe children were in imminent danger of abuse. Therefore, she did not violate the Constitution when she temporarily removed the children from their parents without a court order. Moreover, where plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a violation of their constitutional rights, a defendant government official is entitled to qualified immunity. Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not err in granting O\u2019Brien judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1339-13\">.

O'Brien testified she arrived at this conclusion only after interviewing the Does and in light of the evidence she had gathered up to that point, including T.O.\u2019s allegation of abuse, the 1995 DCF report of abuse, and John Doe's criminal past. O'Brien's conclusion that Jane Doe could not adequately protect the children may have been influenced by the 1995 report of abuse indicating that John Doe had abused a three-year old boy whom Jane Doe was babysitting. O\u2019Brien also testi-fled that she was concerned by Appellants' refusal to make any statements concerning allegations of child abuse, and that she found Jane Doe to be \u201cvery protective of her husband.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1341-19\">.

On April 4, 2002, this Court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the district court had not actually resolved the claims for injunctive relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Subsequently, on June 26, 2002, the district court entered an amended order concluding \u00a7 39.401(1) is facially constitutional and that O'Brien did not apply the statute in an unconstitutional manner when she removed the Doe children. Appellants then commenced the instant appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1344-7\">. The term \"emergency\u201d as used in this context is synonymous with \"exigency\u201d and \"imminent danger.\" We have found that courts use them interchangeably. <em>See, e.g., Mabe, </em>237 F.3d at 1106 (\"Government officials are required to obtain prior judicial authorization before intruding on a parent\u2019s custody of her child unless they possess ... reasonable cause to believe that the child is in imminent danger ....\u201d) (quotation omitted); <em>Brokaw, </em>235 F.3d at 1020 (stating that due process requires \u201cthat government officials will not remove a child from his home without an investigation and pre-deprivation hearing resulting in a court order of removal, absent exigent circumstances\u201d); <em>Tenenbaum, </em>193 F.3d at 594 (\"In emergency circumstances a child may be taken into custody by a responsible State official without court authorization or parental consent.\u201d) (quotation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1345-6\">. We recognize that it is important for courts to scrutinize officials' conduct as well as the objective danger to the child. Otherwise, child welfare workers could conceivably manufacture an emergency by unreasonably failing to act until it became necessary to remove a child from parental custody without prior court authorization. But officials' conduct is only one of several relevant factors that may be considered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1346-6\">. Despite finding evidence of a constitutional violation in <em>Tenenbaum, </em>the Second Circuit upheld the dismissal of the claims against the individual defendants based on qualified immunity. <em>Tenenbaum, </em>193 F.3d at 596.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1347-9\">. We also note some important factual distinctions between <em>Tenenbaum </em>and the instant case. In <em>Tenenbaum, </em>child welfare workers admitted their motivation in removing Sarah was to examine the child in order to <em>rule out the possibility of abuse, </em>rather than to protect her from any imminent danger of abuse. 193 F.3d at 590. Moreover, there was an unexplained day-long delay between the decision to remove Sarah from school and her actual removal. <em>Id. </em>Finally, child welfare workers did not seek legal advice despite the availability of CWA lawyers. <em>Id. </em>Thus, while we disagree with the Second Circuit in terms of how emergency circumstances should be defined, we agree with that court\u2019s conclusion that the circumstances in <em>Tenenbaum </em>did not demonstrate an emergency sufficient to obviate the need for a warrant. In contrast, the record in this case shows that O'Brien removed the Doe children in order to protect them from what she believed to be imminent danger of abuse, consulted with legal counsel, and acted swiftly once the decision was made to remove the children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1348-7\">. Although O'Brien may have misconstrued parts of the FDLE report \u2014 including her apparently erroneous conclusion that John Doe had been convicted of \"child fondling\u201d \u2014 it was not unreasonable for her to infer that John Doe had some dangerous proclivities based on his undisputed criminal record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1349-9\">. Additionally, insofar as Appellants may be challenging O'Brien\u2019s warrantless entry into their home, the record demonstrates that they gave her consent to enter. Under those circumstances, a warrantless entry does not violate the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Illinois v. Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. 177, 181, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 2797, 111 L.Ed.2d 148 (1990). Even if Appellants had not given O'Brien consent to enter their home, the warrantless entry was justified in this case by exigent circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
