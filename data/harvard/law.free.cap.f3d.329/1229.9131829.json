Cleveland (Court-Appointed), Mobile, AL, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1280-5\">Richard H. Loftin, Mobile, AL, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1280-7\">Before TJOFLAT, BARKETT and HULL, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1280-8\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1280-9\">Appellant, a federal prisoner currently serving a 168-month sentence imposed following a plea of guilty to conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, challenges his sentence on the ground that the district court, in applying the Sentencing Guidelines, erred in denying him a minor role adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-10\">Appellant is a career offender. Under the Guidelines, a defendant is a career offender if the following three elements are present (as they are here):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1280-11\">(1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1280-12\">(2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1280-13\">(3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1280-14\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. While a career offender\u2019s criminal history category is always Category VI, \u00a7 4B1.1 indicates that with respect to the defendant\u2019s <em>offense level, </em>as distinguished from his criminal history category, \u201c[i]f an adjustment from \u00a7 3E1.1 (Acceptance of Responsibility) applies, [a court must] decrease the offense level by the number of levels corresponding to that adjustment.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-16\">In contending that the court should have granted him a minor role adjustment under \u00a7 4B1.1, appellant relies on the rule of lenity. The rule of lenity applies if a statute \u2014 in this instance, a sentencing guideline \u2014 is ambiguous. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>155 F.3d 682, 685 (3rd Cir.1998). Because \u00a7 4B1.1, by its express terms, only authorizes an adjustment based on acceptance of responsibility, and does not mention the minor role adjustment, and since \u201cthe inclusion of one implies the exclusion of others,\u201d <em>United States v. Koonce, </em>991 F.2d 693, 698 (11th Cir.1993), the guideline is not ambiguous and the rule of lenity does not apply. <em>Johnson, </em>155 F.3d at 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-17\">Several of our sister circuits appear to hold that the minor role adjustment is not available to a defendant sentenced under the career offender provision. <em>See id. </em>at 684 &amp; n. 4 (citing to the First, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits, all of which have held that mitigating role adjustments do not apply in the career offender scenario). Today we make it clear that minor role adjustments are not available to defendants sentenced under \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-18\">Appellant\u2019s sentence is, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
