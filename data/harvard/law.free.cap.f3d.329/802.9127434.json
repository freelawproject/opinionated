He asserts that the district court\u2019s application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4), which provides for a two-level enhancement for offenses involving stolen firearms, constitutes impermissible double counting. His challenge to the application of subsection (b)(4) presents a matter of first impression in this Circuit, but seven of our sister circuits have addressed the issue. After reviewing the sentencing guidelines, we join the majority of our sister circuits in holding that the application of the two-level enhancement under subsection (b)(4) is appropriate unless the defendant\u2019s base offense level is determined under subsection (a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b853-14\">Adams pled guilty to possession of a stolen firearm after police officers discovered a loaded semiautomatic pistol, which had been reported stolen, during a consensual search of his vehicle. At his sentencing hearing, the district court determined that his base offense level was twenty-four, because he previously \u201csustain[ed] at least two felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). Additionally, the district court applied a two-level enhancement pursuant to subsection (b)(4), because the firearm was stolen. Thereupon, Adams challenged the application of subsection (b)(4), arguing that because he was charged with possession of a stolen firearm, enhancing the offense level based solely upon the stolen nature of the firearm constituted impermissible double counting. The district court rejected his challenge and sentenced him to a prison term of ninety-two months. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-15\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b853-16\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines de novo. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>276 F.3d 1281, 1233 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-17\">Although we never addressed whether the application of the two-level enhancement under subsection (b)(4) constitutes double counting when the offense of conviction involves a stolen firearm, several of our sister circuits have addressed that issue and found that the enhancement is appropriate when a defendant\u2019s base offense level is not determined under subsection (a)(7). <em>See United States v. Goff, </em>314 F.3d 1248, 1249-50 (10th Cir.2003); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number><em>United States v. Raleigh, </em>278 F.3d 563, 566-67 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1119, 122 S.Ct. 2343, 153 L.Ed.2d 171 (2002); <em>United States v. Shepardson, </em>196 F.3d 306, 311-14 (2d Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Hawkins, </em>181 F.3d 911, 911-13 (8th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>169 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Luna, </em>165 F.3d 316, 322-23 (5th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Tumipseed, </em>159 F.3d 383, 385-86 (9th Cir.1998). We agree with the reasoning of our sister circuits and find that the district court\u2019s application of subsection (b)(4) to enhance Adams\u2019s sentence did not constitute impermissible double counting. Our conclusion is based upon the plain language of the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">When, as here, a \u201cdefendant committed any part of the ... offense [of conviction] subsequent to sustaining at least two felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense,\u201d the sentencing guidelines instruct the district court to use a base offense level of twenty-four under subsection (a)(2). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). \u201cIf any firearm was stolen,\u201d the sentencing guidelines also instruct the district court to apply a two-level enhancement. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4). The two-level enhancement, however, cannot be applied</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-5\">[i]f the only offense to which \u00a7 2K2.1 applies is 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(i), (j), or (u), or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(Z) or (m) (offenses involving a stolen firearm or stolen ammunition) and the base offense level is determined under subsection (a)(7).... This is because the base offense level takes into account that the firearm or ammunition was stolen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-6\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1, cmt. n. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Although the sentencing guidelines create an exception for defendants whose base offense level is determined under subsection (a)(7), no such exception is created for defendants whose base offense level is determined under subsection (a)(2). Indeed, subsection (a)(2), unlike subsection (a)(7), is not exempted, because it does not take into account whether the offense of conviction involved a stolen firearm. Subsection (a)(2) is meant to account only for a defendant\u2019s past criminal history; whether the firearm involved was stolen is irrelevant to the district court\u2019s determination that a defendant\u2019s prior felony convictions warrant a base offense level of twenty-four. As such, the sentencing guidelines \u201cclearly permit[] the [district] court to enhance an offense by two levels under subsection (b)(4) if the base offense is not calculated under ... \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(7).\u201d <em>Tur-nipseed, </em>159 F.3d at 386 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">Thus, when the district court determined Adams\u2019s base offense level under subsection (a)(2), it accounted for his past felony convictions, but not the fact that the firearm found in his vehicle was stolen. Consequently, the application of subsection (b)(4) was necessary to account for the fact that the firearm was stolen, and, thus, the district court correctly applied the two-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b854-13\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
