He was sentenced to thirty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment and five years\u2019 supervised release. Rodriguez-Martinez appeals his sentence only and argues that the district court committed plain error by sentencing him to five years\u2019 supervised release, a term in excess of the three year statutory maximum under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(3). This contention was not raised in any form below. He asks this court to vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-23\">The Government concedes plain error. The authorized term of imprisonment for a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii) and (v)(II) is not more than twenty years. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(B)(iii). This makes Rodriguez-Martinez\u2019s offense a Class C felony. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(3). The authorized term of supervised release for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Class C felony is not more than three years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">The sentence of five years\u2019 supervised release meets the plain error standard. <em>United States v. Moreci, </em>283 F.3d 293, 300 (5th Cir.2002). The only disagreement between the defendant and the Government is whether to remand for resentencing, or merely to modify the term of supervised release. There is no need to remand. The district court, having previously imposed the maximum five-year supervised release term (and sentenced to the guideline maximum term of imprisonment), would most likely impose the maximum of three years\u2019 supervised release again on remand. <em>See United States v. Hord, </em>6 F.3d 276, 280 n. 8 (5th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>961 F.2d 1188,1189 (5th Cir.1992). Rodriguez-Martinez\u2019s term of supervised release is accordingly modified to a term of three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
