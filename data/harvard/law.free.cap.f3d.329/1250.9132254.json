McCauley, III, for various offenses. Davis was convicted of conspiring to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846, and distributing cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Ramsey was convicted of conspiring to distribute cocaine base and distributing cocaine base. McCauley was convicted of conspiring to distribute cocaine base, distributing cocaine base, and using and carrying a firearm during the commission of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). Davis, Ramsey, and McCauley were sentenced to 480, 292, and 350 months\u2019 imprisonment, respectively. Appellants raise three issues with respect to their sentencing. First, Appellants contend the district court erred by resentenc-ing them without affording them a new evidentiary hearing. Second, Appellants contend the district court abused its discretion by stacking their sentences to run consecutively rather than concurrently, pursuant to United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 5G1.2. Third, Appellants contend the imposition of consecutive sentences violates their due process rights under the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-18\">Appellants and others participated in a large crack cocaine distribution ring in Lanett, Alabama. Following a jury trial in March, 1994, Appellants were found guilty of conspiring to distribute crack cocaine, as well as possession of varying amounts of crack cocaine. Appellants Davis, Ramsey, and McCauley were sentenced to 211, 169, and 229 months\u2019 imprisonment, respectively. Following an unsuccessful direct appeal, Appellants attacked their sentences pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court granted Appellants\u2019 \u00a7 2255 applications, finding appellate counsel acted ineffectively by failing to require the district court to make individualized findings concerning the scope of the conspiracy and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>the amount of drugs attributable to each defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">On November 29,1999, the district court held an evidentiary hearing and received new evidence to help it determine the quantity of drugs for which each defendant should be held responsible. The court re-sentenced Davis, Ramsey, and McCauley to life, 300 months\u2019, and life imprisonment, respectively. Appellants appealed, and this Court affirmed in part and reversed in part, noting the district court re-sentenced Appellants -without the benefit of the rule announced by the Supreme Court in <em>Ap-prendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">On remand, Appellants argued they were entitled to be sentenced <em>de novo </em>because their previous sentences had been \u201cvacated\u201d by this Court. The Government objected, arguing the Eleventh Circuit mandate restricted the range of issues that could be considered on remand. The district court agreed with the Government, and without the benefit of a new evidentia-ry hearing, sentenced Davis, Ramsey, and McCauley to 480, 292, and 350 months\u2019 imprisonment, respectively. The court interpreted U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d) to require that Appellants\u2019 sentences run consecutively rather than concurrently so that the appropriate guidelines range could be achieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-7\">A. <em>De novo </em>sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-8\">Appellants contend the district court erred by declining to sentence them <em>de novo. </em>They note that the district court did not afford them a new hearing at resen-tencing, despite our opinion vacating their sentences and upholding the district court\u2019s authority to receive new evidence at resentencing. According to Appellants, this violated the court\u2019s obligation to employ a \u201cholistic approach\u201d to sentencing. <em>United States v. Stinson, </em>97 F.3d 466, 469 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-10\">We review a district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Hunerlach, </em>258 F.3d 1282, 1285 (11th Cir.2001). When a criminal sentence is vacated, a district court is generally free to reconstruct the sentence using any of the sentencing components. <em>Stinson, </em>97 F.3d at 469. If the appellate court issues a limited mandate, however, the trial court is restricted in the range of issues it may consider on remand. <em>United States v. Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d 1514, 1520 (11th Cir.1996). A vacation of judgment for consideration in light of a particular decision is \u201c \u2018much more limited in nature\u2019 than a general vacation by an appellate court, and its effect is \u2018not to nullify all prior proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. M.C.C. of Florida, Inc., </em>967 F.2d 1559, 1562 (11th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-11\">In our August 8, 2001, order vacating Appellants\u2019 sentences, we remanded this case to the district court so that it might have the benefit of the intervening rule announced in <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 466, 120 S.Ct. at 2348. We stated, \u201c[i]n that respect we vacate the sentences of Appellants Davis, McCauley, and Ramsey and remand for resentencing or a new trial. In all other respects, however, we find no merit in Appellants\u2019 arguments on appeal and affirm the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>273 F.3d 396, 2001 WL 921301, slip op. at 19 (11th Cir.2001). On remand, the district court determined it could rely on the evidence already presented to resolve the <em>Apprendi </em>issue. This determination obviated Appellants\u2019 entitlement to have new evidence presented prior to resentencing. <em>Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d at 1520. The district court properly declined to hear new evidence at Appellants\u2019 resentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>B. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(c) &amp; (d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">Appellants contend the district court abused its discretion by imposing consecutive sentences pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d). They argue the sentencing guidelines require the court to impose a concurrent sentence where, as here, the total punishment imposed on the \u00a7 841 count was less than or equal to the highest statutory maximum. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(c). Citing cases from other circuits, Appeb lants contend sentencing courts are authorized to exercise alternative sentencing configurations to avoid manifest injustice and prejudice to the defendant. Furthermore, Appellants contend the district court\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences violates the rule in <em>Apprendi, </em>in that the total term of imprisonment exceeds the guideline range for any count for which Appellants were convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-6\">1. <em>Application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.2(d)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1303-7\">The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 provides, \u201cIf multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a defendant at the same time ... the terms may run concurrently or consecutively.... Multiple terms of imprisonment imposed at the same time run concurrently unless the court orders or the statute mandates that the terms are to run consecutively. Multiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different times run consecutively unless the court orders that the terms are to run concurrently.\u201d Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 \u00a7 212(a)(2), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d), however, provides that, when there are multiple counts of conviction,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-9\">[i]f the sentence imposed on the count carrying the highest statutory maximum is less than the total punishment, then the sentence imposed on one or more of the other counts shall run consecutively, but only to the extent necessary to produce a combined sentence equal to the total punishment. In all other respects, sentences on all counts shall run concurrently, except to the extent otherwise required by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1303-12\">Appellants note that despite the clear dictate of \u00a7 5G1.2(d), this Circuit has never <em>directly </em>addressed the question of whether the district court retains the discretion to sentence a defendant to concurrent terms of imprisonment when \u00a7 5G1.2(d) calls for consecutive terms of imprisonment. A majority of other circuits have held that the imposition of consecutive sentences under \u00a7 5G1.2(d) is mandatory. <em>See United States v. Diaz, </em>296 F.3d 680, 684-85 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 43, 154 L.Ed.2d 247 (2002); <em>United States v. Price, </em>265 F.3d 1097, 1109 (10th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1099, 122 S.Ct. 2299, 152 L.Ed.2d 1056 (2002) (mem.); <em>United States v. Kentz, </em>251 F.3d 835, 842 (9th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 933, 122 S.Ct. 1309, 152 L.Ed.2d 219 (2002) (mem.); <em>United States v. Angle, </em>254 F.3d 514, 518-19 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 937, 122 S.Ct. 309, 151 L.Ed.2d 230 (2001) (mem.); <em>United States v. Page, </em>232 F.3d 536, 544-45 (6th Cir.2000). <em>But see United States v. Velasquez, </em>304 F.3d 237, 242-43 (3d Cir.2002) (holding that the district court retained the discretion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3854 to run sentences concurrently without departing even when \u00a7 5G1.2(d) applies); <em>United States v. </em>Vas<em>quez-Zamora, </em>253 F.3d 211, 214 (5th Cir. 2001) (indicating that the application of \u00a7 5G1.2(d) is discretionary).</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-14\">A review of the law of this Circuit indicates that we are inclined to join the majority of our sister circuits. <em>See United States v. Gallego, </em>247 F.3d 1191, 1200 n. 19 (11th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1084, 122 S.Ct. 820, 151 L.Ed.2d 702 (2002) (mem.) (indicating in dicta that no error existed because, if the case were remanded, the district court would be required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>under \u00a7 5G1.2(d) to stack the defendant\u2019s sentences and reach the same result); <em>United States v. Fortenberry, </em>971 F.2d 717, 723 (11th Cir.1992) (finding no error in the district court\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences under the \u201cexpress mandate\u201d of \u00a7 5G1.2(d)). The reason for this is evident: the directive of the Sentencing Reform Act is not inconsistent with the mandates of \u00a7 5G1.2(d). The Sentencing Reform Act simply establishes a default rule of construction for sentences; unless a district court specifically orders otherwise, multiple terms of imprisonment imposed at the same time are to run concurrently. The Act recognizes that a district court may order multiple terms of imprisonment to run consecutively, but (crucially for our decision) it does not give any guidance as to when a district court may or may not order such consecutive sentences. Section 5G1.2(d) does give specific guidance on when a district court should order consecutive sentences \u2014 it mandates such consecutive sentence whenever \u201cnecessary to produce a combined sentence equal to the total punishment.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d). The guideline thus speaks to an issue not directly addressed in the Sentencing Reform Act, and the guideline\u2019s mandate cannot conflict with statutory silence. Just as in every other case, the district court is obligated to follow the requirements of the guidelines. U.S.S.G. Ch.l, Pt.A.2, intro, comment. (\u201cPursuant to the [Sentencing Reform] Act, the sentencing court must select a sentence from within the guideline range.\u201d). We therefore hold that the district court properly interpreted \u00a7 5G1.2(d) to require the imposition of consecutive sentences on Appellants where the sentence imposed on the \u00a7 841 count was less than the total punishment for Appellants\u2019 aggregate convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">2. <em>Application of </em>Apprendi</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">The rule in <em>Apprendi </em>only applies where a defendant is sentenced above the statutory maximum sentence for an offense. <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>269 F.3d 1250, 1268 (11th Cir.2001) (en banc). <em>Apprendi </em>does not prohibit a sentencing court from imposing consecutive sentences on multiple counts of conviction as long as each is within the applicable statutory maximum. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>240 F.3d 927, 930 (11th Cir.2001) (holding there is no <em>Apprendi </em>error where the sentence imposed is less than the aggregate statutory maximum for multiple convictions); <em>see also Sanchez, </em>269 F.3d at 1268 (holding <em>\u201cApprendi </em>has <em>no effect </em>on cases in which a defendant\u2019s actual sentence falls <em>within the range </em>prescribed by the statute for the crime of conviction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-7\">Under the guidelines, Appellant Davis could have been sentenced to life imprisonment. However, the statutory maximum sentence for each count for which Appellant Davis was convicted is 20 years. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). Accordingly, in an attempt to meet the minimum total punishment mandated by the guidelines, the district court imposed a total sentence of 480 months\u2019 imprisonment, consisting of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 1 and 240 months\u2019 imprisonment on count 17, to run consecutively. This sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum for either count. Thus, there was no <em>Apprendi </em>error as to Appellant Davis\u2019 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-8\">Appellant Ramsey could have been sentenced under the guidelines to 292 to 365 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, the statutory maximum sentence per count on the drug charges for which Appellant Ramsey was convicted is 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). In order to satisfy the guidelines, the district court imposed a total sentence of 292 months\u2019 imprisonment, consisting of 232 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 1 and 60 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 23, to run consecutively. Again, this sentence did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>not exceed the statutory maximum for either count. Thus, there was no <em>Apprendi </em>error as to Appellant Ramsey\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-5\">Appellant McCauley could have been sentenced under the guidelines for 324 to 405 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, the statutory maximum sentence per count on the drug charges for which he was convicted is 20 years\u2019 imprisonment and the maximum on the weapons count was 5 years\u2019 imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). In order to satisfy the guidelines, the district court imposed a total sentence of 350 months\u2019 imprisonment, consisting of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 1, 60 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 10, and 50 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 15, to be served consecutively. Again, this sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum for any of the counts. There is no <em>Apprendi </em>error as to Appellant McCauley\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-6\">C. Fifth Amendment due process</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-7\">Appellants contend the district court violated their Fifth Amendment due process rights by subjecting them to consecutive sentences. They challenge the court\u2019s failure to conduct a <em>de novo </em>resentencing hearing, as well as the court\u2019s compliance with our remand order. They also raise issue with the length of the terms of imprisonment to which they have been sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-8\">A defendant\u2019s due process rights may be violated \u201cwhen a sentence is enhanced after the defendant has served so much of his sentence that his expectations as to finality have crystallized and it would be fundamentally unfair to defeat them.\u201d <em>United States v. Watkins, </em>147 F.3d 1294, 1298 n. 5 (11th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>United States v. Lundien, </em>769 F.2d 981, 987 (4th Cir.1985)); <em>see also Burton v. Goodlett, </em>480 F.2d 983, 986 (5th Cir.1973) (due process violated when a heavier sentence is imposed to punish the defendant for getting his original conviction set aside).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1305-12\">Appellants\u2019 present sentences are either significantly shorter or substantially similar to their prior sentences. Moreover, Appellants present no facts suggesting the district court resentenced them to consecutive sentences so as to punish them. Appellants\u2019 due process rights have not been compromised.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1305-9\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this Circuit adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
