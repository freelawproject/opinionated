Steele of the Los Angeles Police Department in order to satisfy their burden as to the legality of the seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">In the course of qualifying Officer Steele as an expert witness, he testified that he had been a police officer for the City of Los Angeles for approximately seventeen and one-half years, and is presently assigned to the Narcotics Division, West Bureau; that he has been assigned to narcotics investigation for more than five years; that he has been qualified in the courts of this state as an expert in narcotics cases; that he has received training from the Los Angeles Police Department in the field of narcotics identification, usage, packaging, and shipping, and on the effects of narcotics on people who use them, and the ways that they are sold, legally and illegally; that he had taken courses in junior college on narcotics identification, and attended seminars conducted by the office of the district attorney, the sheriff\u2019s office, and the Los Angeles Police Department on the subject of narcotics; that he had purchased narcotics in an undercover capacity for the Los Angeles Police Department; and had given classes at the Los Angeles Police Academy on narcotics, narcotics packaging and narcotics identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">After stating that in the course of his experience he had had an opportunity to observe what is commonly referred to as drug paraphernalia, Officer Steele testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-10\">\u201cQ. Would you please relate to the court the various items that you consider to be drug paraphernalia?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 13\">*Supp. 13</page-number>\u201cA. Drug paraphernalia runs a wide varity [.sic] of different items that are used basically for cutting, or ingesting, or preparing narcotics for ingestion or injection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-5\">\u201cFor instance, there are what they call tooters, or coke spoons, small spoons, with which a person would take a quantity of coke on the end, and place it to their nose, and ingest it through the nasal passages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-6\">\u201cAlso, there are straws that are used for the same purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-7\">\u201cThey come in any kind of varity [sic], or sizes, or thing the person wants to use or purchase.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-8\">\u201cThere is cut for narcotics, like Mannitol, Mannite \u2018White Lady\u2019, \u2018Supercut\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-9\">\u201cWe can get into different chemicals, like ether. It is used also with P.C.P., or it can be in freebasing of cocaine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-10\">\u201cYou have different types of papers that your drugs are sold in, cocaine or heroin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-11\">\u201cSmall papers or small seals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-12\">\u201cThere are a varity [szc] of plastic baggies on the market that are zip-loc, which are commonly used to package drugs in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-13\">\u201cThere is scales of different sizes that are used for drug use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-14\">\u201cAlso, there is sifters or grinders that assist them in preparing the drugs for use and sales.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-15\">\u201cThere would be a varity [szc] of different pipes\u2014they call them bongs\u2014 made out of anything\u2014wood, glass, plastic\u2014to ingest your marijuana, or hashish, and cocaine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-16\">Officer Steele further testified that on January 25, 1983, between 11 and 11:30 a.m., he and six other officers entered the Odyssey to serve a search warrant. The store was open for business, with customers present.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-17\">Officer Steele testified that he observed in the store numerous items which he described as \u201cdrug paraphernalia\u201d offered for sale from open shelves and glass-enclosed cases, open to plain view, which items were seized. Prior to such seizure, Steele stated that 10 photographs were taken of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 14\">*Supp. 14</page-number>cases and shelves . .to give everybody a good idea, or fair idea, of how everything was situated at the time we had entered into the Odyssey.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">Steele also prepared a schematic diagram of the location of the 18 display cases and shelves in the Odyssey, which was received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">Following the seizure of the personal property involved in the case at bench, it was placed by the police in 13 lots (cardboard boxes), keyed to the store location (case or shelf) from which it was removed, as designated on the foregoing schematic diagram.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">The personal property seized was also listed in a property report prepared by the police under DR #83-431705, which the parties stipulated set forth <em>all </em>of the personal property seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">In essence, Officer Steele testified that the seizure occurred because defendant had committed a misdemeanor in his presence, namely violation of Health and Safety Code section 11364.7, subdivision (a), by offering items for sale which, in his expert opinion, were used, or intended to be used, with controlled substances. The People rested after the testimony of Officer Steele.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">As its first witness, the defense called Steve Allen who testified that in his presence certain plastic seals, plastic baggies, and scales were seized by the police from locked opaque cabinets under display cases referred to as No. 6 and No. 7 on the schematic diagram prepared by Officer Steele. Allen acknowledged that the police had also seized from cases No. 6 and No. 7 plastic seals, plastic baggies, and scales which <em>were </em>in plain view. He testified that he did not know how many of said items were in each category.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">Defendant then testified. He stated that he was present when the police came to the Odyssey on January 25, 1983, and saw them search \u201cseveral things that were locked.\u201d He testified specifically that he observed an officer remove \u201citems,\u201d from a locked portion of case No. 5 (per the schematic diagram), which was not in \u201copen view to the public.\u201d Defendant stated that the officer \u201c. . . took out items underneath the case, which was\u2014I would estimate, is probably a quarter or a half as much as what was above, or in view.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 15\">*Supp. 15</page-number>Defendant testified that case No. 5 was a vitamin and food additive section, but could not give an accounting of what items were seized from below in the area that was not open to public view, other than to state that \u201c. . . it was approximately one-fourth of what was there on the top.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">The final witness to testify on behalf of defendant was Jeffrey Scott Balin, an employee of the Music Odyssey.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">He testified that he had seen the police seize containers of ether which were located in the chemical counter, case No. 3, in an area not visible to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">Balin was shown People\u2019s exhibit 10, which is a photograph of nine cans of ether and two bottles of ether, and testified that such a display of ether as was depicted in exhibit 10 did not exist in the store. He further testified that the ether that had been out of sight in case No. 3, the chemical counter, was no longer present when the officers left the establishment following their seizure of personal property.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">The court also received in evidence on behalf of defendant the February 23, 1981, version of Senate Bill No. 341, which became section 11014.5 and section 11364.7 of the Health and Safety Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">The Order of the Trial Court</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">Following the taking of testimony and argument by counsel, the trial judge gave his findings and order as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-11\">\u201cThis was conceded by the People, not to be a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. And it was conceded they were not acting on the basis of a valid search warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-12\">\u201cThe court finds that <em>some </em>of the objects seized were concealed from plain view.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-13\">\u201cThe officer has a right to the plain view, and the plain view was achieved by walking into the store and observing those items that were open to the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 16\">*Supp. 16</page-number>\u201cBut, based on the evidence before the court, the court is of the opinion that items were also seized which were not\u2014which were concealed from plain view.\u201d These items were not taken pursuant to either a valid arrest or a search warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-4\">\u201cThere were also items seized that were <em>excluded </em>from the\u2014under the statute. And the items seized also were comingled; and this court has no way to determine what was legally taken and what was not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-5\">\u201cAnd the motion to suppress is granted.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Contentions on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">Appellant raises the following basic contentions in connection with the assertion that the ruling of the trial court should be reversed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-8\">1. The conclusion of the trial court that items which are not <em>specifically listed </em>in Health and Safety Code section 11014.5, in which the term \u201cdrug paraphernalia\u201d is defined, cannot legally be seized, even if in plain view, is erroneous; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-9\">2. The trial court erred in suppressing all of the items of the evidence seized, because a small number of such items may not have been in plain view.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">Our analysis of the trial court\u2019s suppression ruling discloses that it was based on the following findings: The trial court found that certain items were illegally seized for the reason that those items were either not in plain view or they were \u201cexcluded\u201d by the Legislature from the definition of \u201cdrug paraphernalia,\u201d as evidenced by the February 23, 1981, version of Senate Bill No. 341, which became, in pertinent part, section 11014.5 of the Health and Safety Code, which defines \u201cdrug paraphernalia.\u201d The trial court also found that certain items were properly seized for the reason that they were in plain view and were specifically enumerated as \u201cdrug paraphernalia\u201d in section 11014.5, subdivision (a). It made no finding identifying specifically which of the seized items were in plain view, which were not in plain view, and which did not fall within its definition of \u201cdrug paraphernalia.\u201d Instead, the trial court suppressed all the seized items after making the further finding that since the properly seized items were \u201ccommingled\u201d with items illegally seized, i.e., items not within its definition of \u201cdrug paraphernalia\u201d or items not in plain view, it could not determine \u201cwhat was legally taken and what was not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 17\">*Supp. 17</page-number>We conclude that the suppression ruling is erroneous in two significant respects. Initially, we find that the trial court erred in its interpretation of what constitutes \u201cdrug paraphernalia\u201d under Health and Safety Code section 11014.5. We also find that the trial court erred by failing to make specific findings as to which of the seized items were properly seized and which were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">In finding that certain items were \u201cexcluded\u201d from the definition of \u201cdrug paraphernalia\u201d the trial court focused on the fact that those items had been expressly enumerated but subsequently stricken from the February 23, 1981, version of Senate Bill No. 341.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It reasoned that this meant that the Legislature intended the definition of \u201cdrug paraphernalia\u201d to encompass only those expressly enumerated items which were not stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">We disagree. The trial court misconstrued the significance of the stricken items. The plain language of Health and Safety Code section 11014.5 emphatically refutes its conclusion that the definition of \u201cdrug paraphernalia\u201d is limited to those items specifically listed in subsections (1) through (8) of subdivision (a) of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">The term \u201cdrug paraphernalia\u201d in fact \u201cmeans all equipment, products and materials of any kind which are designed for use or marketed for use, in . . . ingesting ... or otherwise introducing into the human body a controlled substance .... It includes, <em>but is not limited to: </em>[the specific items set forth in subdivision (a), subsections (1) through (8)].\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11014.5, subd. (a), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">The clear import of the phrase \u201cbut is not limited to\u201d signifies that the Legislature intended the definition of \u201cdrug paraphernalia\u201d to be expansive and flexible. Thus, the expressly enumerated items are simply exemplary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 18\">*Supp. 18</page-number>of those items which may constitute \u201cdrug paraphernalia\u201d rather than delineating the parameters of the subject.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">We also reject, as unsupported by the record, the trial court\u2019s finding that it could not determine \u201cwhat was legally taken and what was not\u201d for the reason that the properly seized items were \u201ccommingled\u201d with the items illegally seized. At first glance the task appears to be formidable in view of the numerous items seized. We note that there are no reported decisions which offer guidance to a trial court which is confronted with a motion to suppress a large number of diverse items claimed to be \u201cdrug paraphernalia.\u201d Nonetheless, when the items have been segregated into lots according to where they were seized, the task is neither hopeless nor impossible. Apparently, those items not in plain view constitute a relatively small number of the total seized.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that the \u201ccommingling\u201d in the present case does not excuse the trial court from its duty to make specific findings as to those items which must be suppressed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Arketa) </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 122, 126 [89 Cal.Rptr. 316].)</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">These errors mandate the reversal of the suppression order and the attendant orders and compel remand of the matter for further proceedings. On remand it is incumbent on the trial court to determine which of the seized items were in plain view, which were not, and which fall within the parameters of \u201cdrug paraphernalia,\u201d as defined by Health and Safety Code section 11014.5, and to make appropriate findings in that regard.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 19\">*Supp. 19</page-number>The suppression order, the order of dismissal, and the order for return of personal property are reversed, and the matter is remanded with directions that further proceedings be taken, including the taking of additional evidence, if necessary, in conformity with this opinion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Reese, P.
