Because we agree with appellant\u2019s first two contentions, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">Trial Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">The prosecution\u2019s evidence at trial involved principally the testimony of Fred Argosino, a special investigator on his first undercover assignment for the California Employment Development Department. Mr. Argosino testified to going to appellant\u2019s Gardena clinic in order to bring a disability benefit claim form to appellant, a general practitioner, for his certification. Mr. Argosino made various visits to the clinic, the first being on September 30, 1981, when he appeared without a prior appointment and spoke to the receptionist. He told the receptionist at first that there was nothing wrong with him but then changed his story; he told her that he was experiencing \u201cfrequent dizziness.\u201d Because he had no appointment, the receptionist told him to come back in the afternoon. That afternoon, when he returned, Mr. Argosino completed a personal history form on which he falsely listed the name of his employer, as Robert Shaw Controls, listed his job as an assembler, and gave a fabricated residential address with no telephone number. When he first saw appellant, he told appellant that there was really nothing wrong with him, that the only reason for his visit was that he wanted appellant to give him a medical leave, and that the witness had heard that he was going to be laid off from his job. Mr. Argosino told appellant that a coworker had advised him that he could get a medical leave from appellant. Appellant responded, according to the witness, that Mr. Argosino \u201cshould\u201d tell him that there was something wrong with him before appellant could or would fill out a disability form, that Mr. Argosino\u2019s problem was \u201cfinancial,\u201d not medical, and, at one point, that Mr. Argosino \u201cshould tell\u201d appellant that he was \u201cdizzy\u201d or \u201cnervous.\u201d Explaining that the only reason that he had come to see appellant was to \u201cget my medical slip,\u201d and that really there was \u201cnothing wrong,\u201d Mr. Argosino then asked appellant, \u201cWhat if I tell you, doc, that I was dizzy or that I am dizzy, but, you know, I am not?\u201d Appellant, according to the witness, did not respond. Mentioning the strictness of the State of California, appellant told the witness to think the matter over and call him back if Mr. Argosino could think of \u201csomething or anything\u201d that he thought was wrong with him. Mr. Argosino immediately left the clinic. He was not charged for his visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 33\">*Supp. 33</page-number>In his defense, appellant testified with regard to Mr. Argosino\u2019s afternoon visit on September 30 that Mr. Argosino had come in requesting that appellant put him on medical leave of absence. When appellant asked him what his problems were, Mr. Argosino was \u201cvery evasive\u201d and was acting \u201cvery nervous,\u201d was standing up even when told to sit down, was \u201cconstantly rubbing his hands\u201d and had overall facial expressions and mannerisms indicative to appellant of Argosino\u2019s being \u201cextremely nervous.\u201d Upon appellant\u2019s inquiry as to what Mr. Argosino\u2019s problems were, the latter replied that he actually had no problem. Appellant asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you have any problems?\u201d to which Mr. Argosino then replied that he was \u201cdizzy.\u201d When appellant asked him concerning his dizziness, Argosino denied that he was dizzy. At the time of this visit appellant explained that his back office medical assistant had suddenly been taken ill, appellant was all alone in his back office, and that he also had an emergency to see. He explained that Mr. Argosino was taking up \u201ca lot of my time. First he said he was all right. Then he said he wasn\u2019t. He was very evasive ... I had a feeling this was going to go on forever. So, I said, \u2018Don\u2019t you have any problems at all?\u2019 \u201d Because of this evasiveness, appellant told Mr. Argosino to leave. Appellant denied telling him \u201cto think about it or call me back if you have anything wrong with you.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Appellant testified with regard to the September 30 visit that when Mr. Argosino asked, \u201cSuppose I say I\u2019m dizzy\u201d and then said he had no problem, appellant told him \u201cif he didn\u2019t have any valid medical reasons, I couldn\u2019t treat him\u201d and did not give him a certification on September 30. Appellant observed no faintness nor did Mr. Argosino complain of nightmares, diarrhea, blurred vision, insomnia, tingling of his hands or feet, or shortness of breath, which is found in many people with heart conditions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 34\">*Supp. 34</page-number>Appellant, unaware of any history of illness, anything physical, psychological, emotional, mental or of any injuries that Mr. Argosino might have suffered, described as \u201cinaccurate\u201d Mr. Argosino\u2019s testimony that appellant \u201cshould\u201d tell him what was wrong with him. Appellant explained, \u201cNow, I know better. I\u2019m supposed to be treating the patient. It is inaccurate\u2014not a patient treating me. How am I to know what is wrong with him? I have asked him that over and over. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">On the afternoon of the following day, according to Mr. Argosino\u2019s testimony, he returned to the clinic but found it closed. Nonetheless, he repeatedly banged on appellant\u2019s door, which appellant finally opened halfway. Appellant stated to Mr. Argosino, \u201cWe are closed\u201d and pointed to a sign reflecting office hours. The sign was posted on the door; however, Mr. Argosino testified that he had not noticed it. He told appellant, \u201cI am your patient, the day before, and you told me to come back if I could think of something that was wrong with me. I think I have an ulcer or some stomach problems. That\u2019s why I came back.\u201d Mr. Argosino was given an appointment for the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">With regard to this incident appellant testified that he thought Mr. Argosino\u2019s banging on the closed office door was \u201ca little strange\u201d because there was sign very prominently posted right in front of the door with the office hours written on it. Appellant was reluctant to let Mr. Argosino in because appellant, having suffered two prior robberies, was \u201cvery afraid that he might rob me or do bodily harm.\u201d Appellant explained that Mr. Argosino was not then his patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">According to Mr. Argosino, he returned on October 2, 1981. At this tim\u00e9 appellant asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s really wrong with you?\u201d and said, \u201cYou have got to have something wrong with you, now.\u201d Mr. Argosino replied, \u201cI think I got some ulcer or stomach pains, stomach problem.\u201d At this appellant \u201cgrabbed\u201d Mr. Argosino\u2019s right arm and took his blood pressure; Mr. Argosino, though denying that he offered resistance, admitted that he did pull his arm back in response. As appellant was taking his blood pressure, Mr. Argosino again mentioned that there was nothing wrong with him and that he had only come to see appellant in order to get his medical slip for disability. Appellant nonetheless continued to examine Mr. Argosino, rolled up his T-shirt and pressed a stethoscope to his stomach, appellant moving the stethoscope around the stomach. Mr. Argosino testified that it was \u201cas if he didn\u2019t hear me\u201d with regard to his denial that there was anything wrong with him and repeated to appellant that he had only come to get his medical slip.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">According to Mr. Argosino\u2019s testimony, appellant asked if he was nervous, to which Mr. Argosino responded, \u201cNo,, doctor, not really.\u201d At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 35\">*Supp. 35</page-number>end of the five-or six-minute visit, Mr. Argosino asked appellant how his blood pressure was; appellant replied, \u201cYour blood pressure is good. You\u2019re okay.\u201d Appellant told Mr. Argosino to give his disability form to his receptionist. Leaving the forms with her, the witness obtained an appointment for October 23, 1981.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Mr. Argosino testified that he was in good physical and mental health when he visited appellant, denied being nervous at these times but did admit that he made an habitual movement with his hand while waiting for appellant and that he talked continuously while appellant was checking his blood pressure and stomach on October 2. He further testified that appellant never examined his neck area, throat, ears, or reflexes nor did appellant discuss with him his dizziness or other physical or mental symptoms, such as fainting, unusual fatigue, depression, or phobias. Appellant never discussed with Mr. Argosino chest pains, sexual problems, nor the latter\u2019s work at Robert Shaw. Appellant took no X-rays, laboratory tests nor did he prescribe medication or a change in the witness\u2019s way of life. Finally, Mr. Argosino denied standing up while in appellant\u2019s office, talking fast or moving around continuously.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">On the other hand, appellant testified that he had been in general medical practice for 24 years, saw a lot of Hispanic patients and actually saw about 50 patients a day, including 1 to 3 disability patients. His patients represented a \u201ccross-section of Los Angeles,\u201d and included people from Palos Verdes, Chinese and Black patients and many factory workers from Robert Shaw, the canneries and Max Factor. He testified that he had experience with Robert Shaw assemblers as patients. These patients had disability problems and described their work as \u201cvery monotonous\u201d and their working conditions as being \u201cvery noisy;\u201d he described the workers at Robert Shaw as having acute anxiety states, by which he meant to describe a condition occurring \u201cwhen a person is subjected to situational difficulties under constant stress and strain.\u201d He described his Robert Shaw factory patients as being under \u201cconstant stress and strain\u201d and described the acute anxiety state as having an acute onset, like the death of a family member or social problems. He further testified that many minority patients live in substandard housing conditions or suffer illness in the family or other problems with the family, such as unemployment, drinking, child abuse, financial problems or accidents.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 36\">*Supp. 36</page-number>Appellant testified that he frankly was scared of Mr. Argosino and did not want to see him, but had thought that if a person had gone through the trouble to see him, that person might have a \u201cproblem.\u201d Thus, appellant had consented to see Mr. Argosino, who complained of stomach pain on October 2. According to appellant, Mr. Argosino was nervous and said that he had been worrying because he thought he might be laid off. Mr. Argosino told appellant that he had some financial problems. However, Mr. Argosino continued to be very evasive. He was very suspicious and did not answer the doctor\u2019s questions regarding an oral history. For this reason, appellant thought Mr. Argosino might be a drug abuser and, on the pretense of taking his blood pressure, appellant had looked for needle marks on Mr. Argosino\u2019s arm. Mr. Argosino \u201ckind of resisted\u201d the taking of his blood pressure and mumbled very repetitiously, \u201cDoc, I\u2019m OK. I am OK, Doc.\u201d Suspecting that Mr. Argosino was trying to hide something, appellant tried not to listen to him; appellant wanted to concentrate on what he was doing because he thought he might be dealing with a drug addict. Mr. Argosino was not acting \u201clike the normal person, he kept resisting me, his muscles were tight to me, indicative of a nervous person.\u201d After carefully examining for any needle marks or any signs of a scar on Mr. Argosino\u2019s arms, appellant then examined the latter\u2019s stomach because he had complained that he thought that he might have an ulcer. Appellant checked Mr. Argosino\u2019s liver, using his stethoscope and his hand in palpating. Appellant found no pain in the stomach and checked Mr. Argosino\u2019s pancreas. At this point appellant was not \u201cvery convinced\u201d that Mr. Argosino had an ulcer because he did not say anything about pain. Because of his evasiveness, appellant thought that Mr. Argosino might have an alcohol or even have a mental problem. He explained that alcoholics will deny that there is anything wrong with them. Appellant did not know whether Mr. Argosino actually had an ulcer or something else; appellant thought that Mr. Argosino might possibly have had a sexual problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">Appellant did not find anything that was physically wrong with Mr. Argosino, but remained convinced that Mr. Argosino was \u201ccovering up something\u201d because of his evasiveness. Appellant testified: \u201cIt was simply impossible to get any history from him. He was so inconsistent. First, he would say he\u2019s nervous, he\u2019s dizzy. Then, he would say he\u2019s all right. When I am examining him I believe he said, T don\u2019t want to be examined. I am all right.\u2019\u201d Because of Mr. Argosino\u2019s uncooperativeness, inconsistent statements and refusal to reply when questioned about an oral history, appellant had no definite plan of treatment but did put Mr. Argosino on disability for the reason that \u201cI felt that he may have had some problem, maybe not physical but a mental problem or a drinking problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Appellant testified that he did check Mr. Argosino\u2019s heart with a stethoscope and checked for palpitations and for arythmic beats. Although he did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 37\">*Supp. 37</page-number>not take Mr. Argosino\u2019s temperature and did not check his eyes \u201cclose up\u201d nor his ears, appellant did notice sweating but not excessive breathing. Appellant testified that Mr. Argosino was flushed, very fidgety, always moving, was very \u201chyper\u201d like a \u201chyperactive child,\u201d was talking fast but did not complain of inability to concentrate or tightness in his throat. Appellant testified that Mr. Argosino did complain about dizziness on September 30, 1981, and explained, \u201cHow can I treat anyone if they don\u2019t tell me what\u2019s wrong with him?. ...\u201d Appellant denied suggesting, on September 30, dizziness to Mr. Argosino and explained that he did not order tests nor prescribe medication or a special diet for Mr. Argosino or refer him to a psychiatrist or psychologist or for counselling because Mr. Argosino was \u201cso evasive, it was rather hard to actually arrive at the correct diagnosis.\u201d For this reason appellant ordered no blood tests to check for anemia or physical injury or infection. \u201cOftentimes, people will tell you that they don\u2019t want it. I think there is too much emphasis placed on diagnosis, laboratory tests and procedures to arrive at a correct diagnosis.\u201d The reason that appellant did not take a blood test from Mr. Argosino was because he believed he might have a \u201cmental problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">According to Mr. Argosino\u2019s testimony, despite an appointment for October 23 with appellant, he returned to the clinic on October 21. The receptionist refused his request to see appellant for this reason. He then rescheduled the appointment for October 28, when again he reported to appellant\u2019s office. At this time, according to Mr. Argosino, appellant asked him how he was feeling. Mr. Argosino raised two hands and replied, \u201cI\u2019m great, fine.\u201d He told appellant that he had just returned from Las Vegas, where he had been looking for work, and asked appellant for an extension of his medical leave. Appellant asked, \u201cHow about if I give you two weeks?\u201d After Mr. Argosino thanked appellant, he exclaimed, \u201cDoctor, you are beautiful.\u201d Appellant then offered to give Mr. Argosino more than two weeks. Mr. Argosino accepted the offer. Appellant directed him to submit his \u201cpink slip\u201d and appellant would take care of it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The October 28 visit lasted less than three minutes, according to Mr. Argosino.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Nancy Sargent, an employee of the clinic, testified for the defense with regard to the October 28 visit. On Mr. Argosino\u2019s chart for that date, she entered, \u201cIn for checkup. Feels fine\u201d and wrote his blood pressure reading which she had taken. She testified, however, that Mr. Argosino \u201cseemed very nervous, very fidgety in the room, when I went to take his blood pressure; at first he was hesitant to take off his jacket and that I noticed right off the bat.\u201d She stated that she had suspected that Mr. Argosino was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 38\">*Supp. 38</page-number>a drug user, and looked at his forearm to see if there were any needle marks or any tracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Appellant, on October 28, looked at the blood pressure reading taken by Ms. Sargent and asked Mr. Argosino how he was doing. Mr. Argosino stated that he was feeling better, pointed to his stomach and said, \u201cBetter.\u201d Appellant testified: \u201cHe looked better .... I honestly felt that the rest I gave him was really helping him . . . .\u201d According to appellant\u2019s testimony, he told Mr. Argosino that he should be able to work if he was better. Mr. Argosino replied at this point, \u201cNot better.\u201d Appellant asked, \u201cWhat?\u201d and Mr. Argosino repeated, \u201cNot better.\u201d According to appellant, Mr. Argosino was still nervous. Appellant extended his leave of absence for this reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">According to Mr. Argosino, he returned on November 11 to appellant\u2019s clinic. When appellant asked how Mr. Argosino was doing, the latter replied that he was feeling better but wanted more time off. Appellant replied, \u201cNow that you are better, you should be able to return to work.\u201d According to appellant, Mr. Argosino then changed his mind, said he was not better, and displayed inconsistencies again. Appellant felt that Mr. Argosino was still \u201cacting a little strange\u201d and therefore granted him an extension of disability. Appellant testified that Mr. Argosino\u2019s facial expressions appeared very nervous, that he kept constantly rubbing his nose, and there was \u201csomething about him [with] which I was uncomfortable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Ms. Sargent testified in corroboration of appellant: On November 11, she entered on Mr. Argosino\u2019s file, \u201cIn for checkup, needs form filled out, and feels pretty good.\u201d She noted that he was \u201cvery, very fidgety with his hands, always moving them, constantly rubbing them together and . . . you don\u2019t see that too often with patients.\u201d She wrote on the chart exactly what Mr. Argosino had said but did not write down \u201cbecause it\u2019s up to the doctor\u201d that he seemed nervous and very fidgety.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">Mr. Argosino asked for more disability; appellant thought that it was in the latter\u2019s best interests to have this disability. Appellant explained that if he returned Mr. Argosino to work in that condition and if something happened to him, and being mindful of the media coverage on the John Hinckley case, which had occurred during that period, and having seen pictures of Jim Brady, the Press Secretary who was shot, appellant feared Mr. Argosino\u2019s \u201cstrange behavior\u201d and therefore believed he should be kept under \u201cclose observation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">Another appointment was arranged for Mr. Argosino, which he failed to keep. Because appellant was concerned, he called Mr. Argosino\u2019s employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 39\">*Supp. 39</page-number>and found that he did not work at Robert Shaw. Appellant then went over to the place that Mr. Argosino had listed as his residence, which was near appellant\u2019s office and the nursing home where appellant had patients. Appellant could not find Mr. Argosino\u2019s name on the directory at the listed place of residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Appellant admitted that this visit came after he had received a state disability inquiry form on November 17 and that he had gone to the place of residence on December 2, but still thought that Mr. Argosino was a bona fide patient, not an undercover agent for the State Disability Fraud Unit. Appellant testified that his plan was to return Mr. Argosino directly to work if he did not follow appellant\u2019s advice to see another doctor, primarily a psychiatrist. Appellant explained that he would have felt responsible if he had returned the man to work without any psychiatric counseling should something happen to him or should he become a menace to society. Appellant thought it \u201cstrange and inappropriate\u201d that Mr. Argosino had been very repetitious, calling him \u201cDoc, doc, and doc,\u201d being very evasive and, when appellant had extended his leave, saying, \u201cDoc, you are beautiful\u201d and waving his arm \u201clike a hyperactive child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Appellant admitted signing three disability forms for Mr. Argosino. Concerning medical entries on Mr. Argosino\u2019s chart, appellant denied altering the chart (People\u2019s exh. 22) following his arrest, though he did admit to writing additional notations in the chart because of his concern that he might be sued for malpractice should Mr. Argosino do something dangerous to himself or to others. Appellant acknowledged that he had made these notations after learning that Mr. Argosino did not work at Robert Shaw or live where he had indicated. He explained that he was \u201cvery confused\u201d and \u201cannoyed\u201d by Mr. Argosino\u2019s behavior and evasiveness because appellant had \u201creally sick\u201d patients to treat and that it was simply impossible to treat Mr. Argosino.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">Over defense objection, the prosecution was permitted to present evidence concerning a statistical comparison of diagnoses contained on 196 disability claims certified by appellant as compared to the same number of diagnoses on disability claims certified by other health practitioners. Seventy-five percent of these claims came from the Long Beach Disability Insurance Office. These claims were divided into five categories. Category 1 indicated \u201canxiety states\u201d and/or \u201cheadaches\u201d and also included \u201cacute anxiety states;\u201d category 2 included \u201canxiety states\u201d and/or \u201cheadaches;\u201d category 3 included \u201cdepression\u201d or any other mental problem; this grouping was broader than categories 1 or 2.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Category 4 was divided into subparts: category <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 40\">*Supp. 40</page-number>4-A corresponded to category 1 but required a statement of physical injury or illness; 4-B corresponded to category 2 with the addition of a statement indicating a physical injury and/or illness; 4-C corresponded to category 3 plus any statement about physical injury and/or illness. Category 5 included all other diagnoses not covered in categories 1 through 4 and necessarily meant a purely physical injury or illness diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">In category 1 there were 46 claims from Dr. Louie and none from the sampling of other doctors\u2019 diagnoses: Category 2 contained six claims from appellant and none from the other sampling. Category 3 had one claim from appellant; and three from the other sampling. Category 4-A had 41 from appellant and three from the sampling of other doctors\u2019 diagnoses; 4-B had seven claims from appellant, two from the other group; 4-C had three from appellant and nine from the other group sampled; category 5 had 92 from appellant and 179 from the other sampling. The total number of all claims of appellant involving categories 1, 2 and 3 were 53 as compared to three from the other sampling. The total for the first four categories was 104 for appellant, 17 from the other sampling, which converted to 53 percent for appellant and 8.7 percent for the other sampling. As to categories 1 through 3, appellant\u2019s percentage was 23.5 while that for the sample was 1.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">All of the samples of the other doctors\u2019 diagnoses came from the Long Beach office; appellant\u2019s claims came from various offices in the Southern California area, including 25 from Los Angeles offices, one from San Bernardino, 15 from Whittier, two from Van Nuys, three from Santa Ana, and two from Santa Monica. The sample group did not consider Spanish-surname patients, the percentage of black patients, or women, the patients\u2019 histories or their occupations, nor did the sample group include the patients\u2019 areas of residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">In addition, no statistical analysis was conducted concerning the percentage of patients in the two groups compared who worked for Robert Shaw Controls, the percentage of patients who were assemblers in factories, or the percentage of patients who were on disability for pregnancy. In fact, nothing was known about the patients included in the sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">Moreover, no determination was made in the random sample concerning the type of practice or type of the doctors (whether chiropractic or medical) who were certifying people for disability. At least two were chiropractors. There was no percentage breakdown of the doctors who were general practitioners as opposed to doctors in other areas of medical expertise.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 41\">*Supp. 41</page-number>According to a prosecution witness the reason why these factors were not included was \u201cbasically that they were irrelevant. We were testing just what the diagnosis was as stated by the certifying doctor.\u201d This witness testified that there was no way of knowing a patient\u2019s race based on the information on the claims form. With regard to the Spanish-surname patient \u201cit wasn\u2019t felt that whether a person had a Spanish surname or not would make any difference to what the doctor\u2019s diagnosis would be.\u201d He did admit that the kind of work that patients did might affect the diagnosis but explained: \u201cWell, it would depend on their history. The history that they would give the doctor may or may not have a bearing, actually, on the kind of work they do. If the history they gave the doctor was related to their work, they would not or should not be certified for state disability, but, rather, for Worker\u2019s Compensation because if their disability is in any way arising out of [or] in the course of their employment, it would come under the purview of the Worker\u2019s Compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Every 50th disability certification was pulled in numerical sequence based upon the last four digits of the Social Security number shown on the certification. The bulk of the claims were for the period between July, 1981 and June, 1982. Six pregnancies, included in category 5, were shown in appellant\u2019s certifications and 26 on the random sample. Twenty fractures were shown on the random sample and none on any of appellant\u2019s 196 certifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Based upon the foregoing comparison, the prosecution called a mathematics professor, who testified that the likelihood that \u201crandom chance\u201d alone rather than some other factor accounted for the difference of 25 percentage points between the category 1-3 diagnoses of Dr. Louie as compared to the same categories of diagnoses in the other-group sampled was three in 10 million, \u201cwhich is, for a statistician, a zero likelihood.\u201d The witness further testified that the likelihood of \u201crandom chance\u201d alone accounting for a difference between 53 percent and 8.7 percent was \u201coff the tables. I really don\u2019t know what the number is, but it exceeds\u2014probably in many billions, one over many billions, the probability of that happening. One chance in many billions, I would guess. The number is so small I don\u2019t think you are going to find it in any table. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">As to category 1, the comparison of 23.5 percent for Dr. Louie and zero for the other-group sample, the witness testified, \u201cthe probability is less than four times in a million\u201d that that discrepancy would happen \u201cby chance.\u201d Denying that for statistical purposes there could be any variation depending upon the subjective perceptions of the doctors involved, the witness testified \u201cthe samples don\u2019t care who wrote the numbers down. The numbers are there and it doesn\u2019t matter if you had 10,000 different doctors. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 42\">*Supp. 42</page-number>When you pull those numbers out, there is some true of all the files. If 1.5 percent was the correct number, if you took every file and checked you would find 150 of the files would have that category. It\u2019s irrelevant how those files were written and who wrote them.\u201d He further testified that absolutely \u201csome variations\u201d will result if there is any bias between the sample taken and the one against which one is actually checking.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">The prosecution\u2019s witness stated that statistics are not concerned with the subject matter but simply the likelihood of producing certain proportions when one samples. He explained that his testimony concerned only the likelihood that such a difference would be due to \u201crandom chance\u201d and to no other cause. As to appellant, the witness had not the faintest idea what the explanation for the difference was. In his professional opinion, however, the explanation would have to be \u201cother than chance. \u201d He did acknowledge that it was certainly \u201cpossible\u201d that appellant might have a patient population that had, for example, 23.5 percent anxiety states or headaches and that \u201cthere could be any other explanation other than chance.\u201d He further acknowledged that the \u201cnumbers seem to say to me that there is an explanation other than chance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">The defense presented a statistical expert who testified that the methodology used in compiling the randoms suffered from the following errors: (1) there was a mixture of physicians other than physicians in general practice such as appellant; (2) there were no \u201ccontrols\u201d on the patient population of the sample (such as age or occupation) to assure comparability with appellant\u2019s patient population; and (3). there was no statement explaining how cases were selected when there was more than one in a folder. The witness conceded that it would not be necessary to match appellant\u2019s patient population with a sample in every variable or factor, and that as the size of the sample is increased, if done correctly, the laws of chance alone would achieve the representation of that factor correspondingly closer to the actual percentage of the population.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">1. <em>Instructional Errors Require Reversal of the Judgment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">Appellant contends that the trial court was duty bound to instruct the jury that a certification prepared by defendant in good faith and in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 43\">*Supp. 43</page-number>belief that it was true was not a violation of section 2101 of the Unemployment Insurance Code even though the certification was in fact mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Section 2101 of the Unemployment Insurance Code declares that wilfully making a false statement or representation, or knowingly failing to disclose a material fact, to obtain any benefit or payment constitutes a misdemeanor. (See fn. 1.)  Under section 2101 the prosecution must prove two elements beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) An intent to defraud and (2) the wilful making of a false statement or representation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lustman </em>(1970) 13 Cal.App.3d 278, 286 [91 Cal.Rptr. 548] [overruled on another ground by <em>People </em>v. <em>Ruster </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 690, 697 [129 Cal.Rptr. 153, 548 P.2d 353, 80 A.L.R.3d 1269]].) It is, of course, a defense to an allegation of intent to defraud that the accused acted without such intent but in the good faith belief that his conduct was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">It is well settled that in a criminal prosecution, even in the absence of a request, the trial court must instruct on the general principles of law relevant to the issues raised by the evidence. The general principles governing the case are those closely and openly connected with the facts before the court, and which are necessary for the jury\u2019s understanding of the case. Included within the trial court\u2019s duty is the obligation to instruct on defenses and on the relationship of those defenses to the elements of the charged offense, where it appears that the defendant is relying on such a defense or if there is substantial evidence which supports the particular defense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 133, 140 [127 Cal.Rptr. 117, 544 P.2d 1317]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Flannel </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 668, 680-681 [160 Cal.Rptr. 84, 603 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">We agree with appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court failed to discharge its duty to instruct on appellant\u2019s theory of defense. Although the trial court properly instructed the jury in the statutory language of section 2101 and expressly defined the specific intent required in order to convict under the section, the trial court failed to instruct the jury that if appellant possessed a good faith belief in the disability of Mr. Argosino in certifying the latter\u2019s disability claims, appellant was not acting with the required intent to defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Stewart, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 133, our Supreme Court reversed a conviction of nine counts of grand theft based upon prosecution evidence tending to show that the defendant had embezzled funds from his employer. Despite the defendant\u2019s testimony that he thought that he had been authorized to use the funds for his own investments, the trial court failed to give <em>sua sponte </em>an instruction informing the jury that a good faith belief in the authority to appropriate and use property which a defendant is accused of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 44\">*Supp. 44</page-number>embezzling eliminates fraudulent intent, a necessary element of the crime of embezzlement. <em>(Id., </em>16 Cal.3d at pp. 139, 140, 142.) In the case at bench the trial court similarly failed, despite substantial evidence supportive of the theory of this defense, to advise the jury that appellant\u2019s good faith belief in Mr. Argosino\u2019s disability constituted a complete defense to the charge of violating section 2101 of the Unemployment Insurance Code. A finding of such good faith belief would, of course, negate the possibility of finding that appellant acted with the required intent to defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Compounding the trial court\u2019s error, the court below also gave, over defendant\u2019s objection, CALJIC No. 7.22, which derives from Penal Code section 125 and provides that an unqualified statement of that which one does not know to be true is equivalent to a statement of that which one knows to be false. Such an instruction has been held to be improper in a prosecution for perjury because it absolutely eliminates the whole question of criminal intent, which is \u201cthe vital element in every crime of perjury.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Von Tiedeman </em>(1898) 120 Cal. 128, 134 [52 P. 155].) As the <em>Von Tiedeman </em>court aptly observed with regard to the perjury prosecution involved in that case, \u201cUnder the charge as given, a person with the most honest intentions could be convicted. A man honestly mistaken could be guilty of the crime [of perjury].\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 134.)</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">The foregoing analysis applies with equal force to the case at bench. Although, as noted, the trial court properly instructed on the requirement of specific intent, the court\u2019s further instruction based upon CALJIC No. 7.22 effectively permitted the jury to find such specific intent to defraud based only upon appellant\u2019s disability certifications of Mr. Argosino, when appellant himself admitted in his testimony that he did not definitely know what was wrong with the patient. Thus, if appellant\u2019s diagnosis were mistaken, as it was shown to be through the prosecution evidence, the jury could find, based upon CALJIC No. 7.22, the specific intent to defraud solely on account of appellant\u2019s mistake, no matter how honestly made. The instruction under CALJIC No. 7.22, without a good faith instruction accompanying it, in this case deprived appellant of his right to a jury determination of the issue of appellant\u2019s specific intent to defraud. (See CALJIC No. 7.24.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">The People urge that appellant was not prejudiced by the instructional errors committed by the trial court \u201csince all the evidence herein manifestly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 45\">*Supp. 45</page-number>indicates that appellant obviously knew that quick and facile certifications of the undercover agent\u2019s \u2018disability\u2019 was utterly without any medical basis other than totally unfounded and unprofessional speculation put to rest (and belied) by the candor of the undercover agent himself.\u201d We disagree. Unless instructional error is otherwise cured by other properly given instructions which enable the trier of fact properly to resolve the factual issue in dispute, it cannot be concluded that such instructional error which goes to the heart of the defense case is harmless. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Stewart, supra, </em>16 Cal. 3d 133, 141-142.)</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">The People\u2019s reliance on <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 105, 119 [60 Cal.Rptr. 234, 429 P.2d 586] is wholly misplaced. In <em>Hill </em>the trial court erroneously gave both a specific and a general intent instruction. Under the evidence presented in that case, however, the jury could only conclude that the defendant had the required specific intent. By contrast, the evidence at bench does not point irresistibly to the conclusion that appellant acted with the required fraudulent intent. Under proper instructions the jury could well have reasonably acquitted him on the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">2. <em>The Introduction of Statistical Probability Evidence Based Upon Comparative Diagnoses of Other Health Practitioners Constituted Prejudicial Error.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">Appellant contends that the trial court improperly admitted evidence concerning the comparative diagnoses of appellant vis-a-vis 196 other health practitioners, and that the admission of this evidence, accompanied by the statistical probability testimony of the prosecution\u2019s expert, constituted prejudicial error. Appellant is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">Over defense objection, the evidence complained of was admitted following an oral offer of proof by the prosecution. The court held no evidentiary hearing out of the jury\u2019s presence, as the court was authorized to do under Evidence Code section 403, subdivision (a)(1).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Instead, the court be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 46\">*Supp. 46</page-number>low admitted the statistical comparison evidence solely upon the prosecutor\u2019s representation that the evidence came within the exception of Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision (b) with regard to other-acts evidence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The prosecution contended that it was proper to admit the statistical comparison evidence arid to adduce statistical expert testimony to eliminate the possibility that chance could have caused the discrepancies in diagnoses of anxiety states by Dr. Louie and those diagnoses of other health practitioners. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">The admissibility of evidence is, of course, governed by the provisions of the Evidence Code. Evidence Code section 350 provides that no evidence is admissible unless it is relevant.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Relevant evidence \u201cmeans evidence having any tendency in reason to prove or disprove any disputed fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 210.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In the case at bench the crucial issue for the jury\u2019s determination was the question whether Dr. Louie had certified Mr. Argosino for disability with the specific intent to defraud. Evidence which tended to prove or disprove this issue was clearly relevant under section 210 of the Evidence Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">Having reviewed the complained of evidence in light of the prosecution\u2019s offer of proof, we fail to perceive how the evidence of statistical comparison and the prosecution\u2019s expert opinion based thereon had any tendency in reason to prove the issue of specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">As the proponent of the evidence the prosecution had the burden of establishing preliminarily that appellant fraudulently diagnosed his other pa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 47\">*Supp. 47</page-number>tients for whom disability claims were submitted (Evid. Code \u00a7 403, subd.(a)(1), see fn. 11, <em>ante). </em>The prosecution made no such showing and therefore the evidence that appellant\u2019s diagnosis in the present case was fraudulent was not capable of proof by the means which the prosecution employed. Simply stated, the statistical probability evidence that \u201crandom chance\u201d could not explain the discrepancy between appellant\u2019s diagnoses and those of others lacked relevance because the absence of proof that appellant\u2019s diagnoses had been fraudulently made rendered the inference sought to be established without evidentiary support. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Riser </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 566, 577 [305 P.2d 1]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Henderson </em>(1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 349, 360 [129 Cal.Rptr. 844]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>De La Plane </em>(1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 223, 240 [151 Cal.Rptr. 843].)  As Justice Jefferson has observed in 1 California Evidence Benchbook (2d ed. 1982) section 21.3, page 502: \u201cEvidence is irrelevant if it has a tendency to prove or disprove a disputed fact of consequence only by reason of drawing speculative or conjectural inferences from such evidence. The concept of a \u2018tendency in reason\u2019 to prove a disputed fact, required by Evid C \u00a7 210, necessarily means that the deduction or inference to be drawn from the proffered evidence to the existence or nonexistence of a disputed fact is a reasonable inference. <em>If the inference of the existence or nonexistence of a disputed fact which is to be drawn from proffered evidence is based on speculation, conjecture, or surmise, the proffered evidence cannot be considered relevant evidence. If proffered evidence can cause the trier of fact only to speculate from such evidence as to the existence or nonexistence of a disputed fact, such evidence is irrelevant and inadmissible, </em>since it does not come within the definition of \u2018relevant evidence\u2019 set forth in Evid C \u00a7 210.\u201d (Italics added.)  Even the prosecution\u2019s own expert established that the statistical discrepancy in diagnosis of \u201canxiety states\u201d and/ or headaches could be attributable to the particular characteristics of appellant\u2019s patient population or to other causes wholly unrelated to fraudulent intent. This statistical comparison evidence therefore only had the effect of permitting the trier of fact to find fraudulent intent by the impermissible means of drawing speculative or conjectural inferences. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Albertson </em>(1944) 23 Cal.2d 550, 576-579 [145 P.2d 7].)</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">In addition to the prosecution\u2019s failure to establish as a preliminary fact that appellant\u2019s 196 other disability diagnoses of anxiety state were fraudulently made, the statistical probability evidence, and the prosecution\u2019s expert opinion based thereon, lacked probative value and should not have been admitted for yet another reason: The statistical comparison of diagnoses was compiled from health practitioners whose practices were not shown to be similar to that of appellant; the comparison was based upon populations of patients not shown to be comparable by way of ethnic background, physical and mental condition, socioeconomic status, work, sex, age or geographical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 48\">*Supp. 48</page-number>area. Such variables must be quantified \u201cexactly\u201d if mathematical probabilities are to have any utility in the courtroom. <em>(.People </em>v. <em>Celia </em>(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 391, 405 [188 Cal.Rptr. 675].) The absence of quantification of crucial variables in the case at bench rendered the evidence useless in terms of proving the issue of appellant\u2019s intent. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 319, 329-331 [66 Cal.Rptr. 497, 438 P.2d 33, 36 A.L.R.3d 1176].) The lack of exact quantification of variables in the case at bench was as scientifically inaccurate as the \u201cestimates\u201d improperly employed in <em>Collins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">As our Supreme Court has cautioned, application of statistical probability theory, particularly in a criminal case, must be \u201ccritically examined\u201d in view of the substantial unfairness to a defendant which may result from ill-conceived techniques with which a trier of fact is not technically equipped to cope. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Collins, supra, </em>at p. 332.)  The critical examination which <em>Collins </em>enjoins leads us to conclude that the failure to quantify all of the crucial variables rendered the statistical probability evidence and the prosecution testimony based on it utterly useless as proof of criminal intent.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Even assuming that the comparative statistical analysis evidence and probability theory testimony offered by the prosecution were relevant under section 210, we would be constrained to hold that the trial court nonetheless abused its discretion under Evidence Code section 352 in determining that the probative value of this evidence outweighed its prejudicial impact. <footnotemark>16</footnotemark>\n                   The law is clear that the admissibility of other-acts evidence must be carefully examined and that merely finding an admissible purpose for the evidence does not automatically authorize its reception. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guerrero </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 719, 724 [129 Cal.Rptr. 166, 548 P.2d 366]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 24-26 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 49\">*Supp. 49</page-number>P.2d 468]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gibson </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 119, 126-131 [128 Cal.Rptr. 302].) Such evidence must be received with \u201cextreme caution\u201d and if its connection with the charged offense is not clearly perceived, the doubt should be resolved in favor of the accused. <em>{People </em>v. <em>Guerrero, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 719.)</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">The admission of the evidence in the case at bench inevitably resulted in prejudice to appellant. Depending essentially on a single witness, whose credibility was impeached in large measure by defense evidence, the case against appellant on the critical issue of intent was wholly circumstantial and depended entirely on the jury\u2019s determination of appellant\u2019s and his witness\u2019 credibility against that of the undercover agent, Mr. Argosino. On this basis, it is likely that the seductively superficial statistical evidence tipped the balance on the credibility issue in the prosecution\u2019s favor despite the absence of any indication of fraudulent intent in certifying the 196 disability claims certified by appellant. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Collins, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at p. 332.)</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">On the basis of the inadmissible evidence the jury must have concluded that appellant was engaged in a large scale scheme of defrauding the state by means of filing false disability claims\u2014a belief fostered by the prosecution\u2019s misuse in closing argument of the statistical data to impugn appellant\u2019s character: Thus, although acknowledging, on the one hand, that he was not arguing that the statistical evidence proved that appellant wrote \u201cphoney anxiety state certifications,\u201d the deputy district attorney emphatically argued, on the other, that appellant was \u201csimply overreaching, that he was simply running an acute anxiety mill, issuing very easy leaves from work, increasing that patient load a little bit more,\u201d and that the evidence \u201cdoes show that the doctor simply was playing fast and loose with disability certifications for acute anxiety states.\u201d The prosecution referred to the Argosino diagnosis of acute anxiety state as \u201cthe doctor\u2019s old favorite diagnosis\u201d and emphasized that there was a \u201cfairly obvious explanation\u201d for the statistical discrepancy, that explanation being that appellant \u201cmust be a little bit known as a doctor who will grant a vacation if you need one\u201d and that \u201ccharitably\u201d appellant had \u201cbeen a soft touch for acute anxiety certifications.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b936-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 50\">*Supp. 50</page-number>Although the trial court did give a modified version of CALJIC No. 2.50,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> we conclude that the prosecution\u2019s argument effectively undermined whatever protection may have been available to appellant under that instruction. The deputy district attorney\u2019s assertions deprived appellant of the right to a jury determination of the question of guilt or innocence upon a proper consideration of the evidence before it and invited the jury to convict appellant upon its conception of him as a person of criminal disposition and of bad character; thus, the prosecution\u2019s misuse of the evidence conflicted with Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision (a), which bars evidence of bad character and criminal disposition to prove conduct on a specified occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">Having reviewed the entire record, we are of the opinion that the inadmissible evidence, the prejudicial impact of which was compounded by the prosecution\u2019s closing argument, deprived appellant of his right to a fair trial and requires a reversal of the judgment of conviction (order granting probation).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">3. <em>Other Contentions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">We have examined the record with regard to appellant\u2019s other contentions and conclude that no error occurred in permitting the jury to have copies of Mr. Argosino\u2019s medical chart during cross-examination of appellant. This procedure permitted the jury to follow the testimony more clearly and permitted the jury to conclude for itself whether appellant had altered the document and, if so, whether this action constituted evidence of a consciousness of guilt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Isby </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d 879, 892 [186 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 51\">*Supp. 51</page-number>405]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Boggs </em>(1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 693, 707 [63 Cal.Rptr. 430].) Moreover, the trial court extensively admonished the jury not to give undue emphasis to the medical chart.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">Concerning People\u2019s exhibit 1, we find no indication that appellant could have been prejudiced by the inclusion on the exhibit of the penalty for a violation of Unemployment Insurance Code section 2101.
