This fund has been assessed for taxation in tbe city of Staunton each year since tbe guardian\u2019s qualification, although she and ber wards several years ago moved to tbe city of Lynchburg, where tbey have ever.since resided. Tbe funds in tbe bands of tbe guardian are invested in tbe city of Lynchburg for tbe most part, none of them being invested in tbe city of Staunton. -In tbe spring of 1898 these funds were placed on the personal property tax books of tbe city of Staunton, and a State tax, as well as a city tax in favor of tbe city of Staunton, was levied thereon, and the State tax, amounting to $36.43, paid to tbe collector of State taxes in Staunton; but plaintiff in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>error refused to pay tlie city taxes claimed by tlie city of Staunton, because tbe funds in her bands bad also1 been assessed, and properly, as she was advised, for city taxation in tbe city of Lynchburg for tbe year 1898, and this tax, amounting to $150, bad been paid by ber to tbe collector of city taxes in tbe city of Lynchburg.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Section 1043 of tbe Code provides that cities shall have the right to make their annual levy, for tbe purposes stated in tbe statute, upon <em>any property therein, </em>and on such other subjects as may at tbe time be assessed with State taxes <em>against persons residing therein.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Under this statute, it is clear that tbe city of Lynchburg bad tbe right to assess a tax for city purposes for tbe year 1898 upon tbe funds in tbe hands of plaintiff in error; and tbe funds having been properly assessed and taxed for city purposes in the city of Lynchburg, and the tax thereon paid, there was no1 right in tbe city of Staunton to levy and collect a like tax upon the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">We are of tbe opinion, therefore, that tbe order of tbe Hustings Court of tbe city of Staunton dismissing plaintiff in error\u2019s application to have corrected tlie assessment of tbe funds in ber bands, belonging to ber wards, for taxation for city purposes in tbe city of Staunton for tbe year 1898, is erroneous, and should be reversed and annulled; and this court will enter such order as tbe Hustings Court of Staunton should have entered, directing that tbe assessment of tbe funds in tbe bands of plaintiff in error placed upon the personal property tax book of tbe city of Staunton, for city taxation for tbe year 1898, be stricken therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
