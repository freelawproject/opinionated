J.</author>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Plaintiff initiated an action in tort against the Catholic Archdiocese of Portland, Mt. Angel Abbey, and Charvet, a former priest at the abbey.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The action was based on plaintiff\u2019s allegations that Charvet masturbated in his presence on one occasion during plaintiffs freshman year of high school at Mt. Angel Seminary and that another priest, Frank, who is now deceased, sexually assaulted him when he was seven or eight years, old. Plaintiff sought to hold Charvet directly liable for his conduct and to hold the archdiocese and the abbey vicariously liable for both priests\u2019 conduct under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Defendants moved for summary judgment, and the trial court granted the motions, concluding that the extended statute of limitations provided in ORS 12.117<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for actions constituting \u201cchild abuse\u201d did not apply to Charvet\u2019s conduct and that neither priest\u2019s conduct was within the scope of his employment so as to provide a basis for vicarious liability on the part of the archdiocese and the abbey. Plaintiff now appeals, contending that issues of fact and law precluded summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. On review of the grant of summary judgment, we state the facts and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from them in favor of the non-moving party \u2014 in this case, plaintiff. ORCP 47 C; <em>Robinson v. Lamb\u2019s Wilsonville Thriftway, </em>332 Or 453, 455, 31 P3d 421 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">The summary judgment record includes the following facts. Plaintiff was raised in a Roman Catholic family in the town of Mt. Angel. The family regularly attended mass at St. Mary\u2019s Church, which was on the same street as, and several properties away from, their home. Mt. Angel Abbey, a Benedictine monastery and seminary, is located in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Mt. Angel. By agreement with the archdiocese, priests from the abbey often staffed St. Mary\u2019s Church.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">One day in the early 1950s, when plaintiff was seven or eight years old, he, two of his siblings, and several friends were roller skating on the sidewalk around St. Mary\u2019s Church when plaintiff fell down and scraped his knees. According to plaintiff, Frank, \u201cdressed like a priest,\u201d was walking nearby. Frank walked over to where plaintiff had fallen, helped plaintiff up, took him by a nearby stairway into the basement of the church, sat him on a table, and asked him to \u201ctake [his] pants down to look at [his] scraped knees.\u201d According to plaintiff, Frank looked at plaintiffs scraped knees, then began fondling plaintiffs penis through his underwear and, ultimately, sodomized him.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Some years later, plaintiff attended Mt. Angel Seminary for his freshman year of high school. Charvet was a freshman advisor and dormitory proctor. Plaintiff testified that, early in the second semester of his freshman year \u2014 that is, in January or February 1958 \u2014 Charvet asked plaintiff to meet him at a specified time in Charvet\u2019s office, which was located at the end of plaintiffs dormitory. When plaintiff arrived at the office, Charvet was sitting behind a desk. The office was large and had a \u201cnormal\u201d level of lighting. While plaintiff was in the office, the door was closed; plaintiff did not know whether it was locked. Charvet, wearing a cassock and scapular, instructed plaintiff to stand in front of the desk and began asking him what he knew about sexuality and reproduction. Among other topics, Charvet asked plaintiff whether he had ever masturbated and began explaining \u201cwhat that was about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Plaintiff testified that, during that discussion, \u201cI could see that there was a lot of motion going on under [Charvet\u2019s] cassock and I assumed what I was seeing was he was masturbating and it became frightening to me and I left \u2014 I just mentally left the room.\u201d Plaintiff did not know whether Charvet\u2019s hand was touching his skin, did not see Charvet\u2019s genitals, and did not see Charvet\u2019s hand on his penis; he concluded that Charvet was masturbating based on the \u201cmotion\u201d that he saw and the fact that \u201c[i]t went on for a long time,\u201d \u201c[m]aybe ten minutes.\u201d Plaintiff also testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>that, although he did not know if Charvet ever \u201cachieved some form of climax,\u201d Charvet \u201cbecame very distracted in what he was doing to himself.\u201d Plaintiff believed that it was \u201cobvious\u201d what Charvet was doing. He testified that Charvet did not \u201cproposition\u201d him to participate in what Charvet was doing, did not touch him, and did not ask him to do the same thing. Plaintiff testified that, although Charvet did not prevent him from leaving the office, his own \u201ctraining\u201d did. Plaintiff testified that he never had any further \u201cincidents\u201d of that kind involving Charvet and that he never told anyone at the school, at Mt. Angel Abbey, or at any church about the incident, because he did not think that doing so \u201cwould do much good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">In February 1999, plaintiff began seeing a mental health counselor, English. Some time after that, he remembered the incidents involving Frank and Charvet.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">In April 2002, plaintiff initiated this action against, as pertinent here, Charvet, the archdiocese, and the abbey. In his operative complaint, plaintiff alleged two claims for relief: a claim for sexual battery based on Frank\u2019s alleged sexual assault and a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress and for breach of fiduciary duty based on the theory that Charvet sexually abused plaintiff by masturbating in his presence. Plaintiff sought economic damages in the amount of $150,000 for costs of counseling and psychological treatment and noneconomic damages in the amount of $4 million. In its answer, the archdiocese denied the relevant factual allegations and asserted, among other affirmative defenses, that plaintiffs claims are barred by the applicable statutes of limitation and are not subject to ORS 12.117, which provides for an extended limitations period for actions based on child abuse. The archdiocese also contended that, to the extent that ORS 12.117 does apply, it is unconstitutional in various respects. Charvet and the abbey also denied the relevant factual allegations and asserted a limitations defense, among other affirmative defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">As noted, defendants moved for summary judgment. As pertinent here, in support of its motion, the archdiocese contended that Frank\u2019s conduct was not within the scope of employment for the purposes of vicarious liability because, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>demonstrated by the summary judgment record, the alleged sexual abuse occurred within minutes of plaintiffs first-ever encounter with Frank and, accordingly, there was no evidence that Frank used or manipulated a position of trust to ingratiate himself with plaintiff or to create an opportunity to sexually abuse him, as occurred in <em>Fearing v. Bucher, </em>328 Or 367, 977 P2d 1163 (1999). In support of its parallel motion, the abbey likewise argued that plaintiffs deposition testimony was insufficient to demonstrate that plaintiff had the requisite prior relationship or contact with Frank or Charvet for purposes of <em>respondeat superior </em>liability. Charvet contended that plaintiffs testimony was insufficient to demonstrate that he ever touched plaintiff or propositioned him to engage in any sexual activity in a manner that would constitute child abuse as defined in ORS 12.117.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">In opposition, relying on <em>Chesterman v. Barmon, </em>305 Or 439, 753 P2d 404 (1988), plaintiff argued that the required causal connection between the priests\u2019 employment and plaintiffs injuries need not be demonstrated by evidence of so-called \u201cgrooming\u201d conduct by the priests. According to plaintiff, there is sufficient alternative evidence relating to Frank\u2019s and Charvet\u2019s priestly functions and duties and the relationship generally between priests and parishioners to demonstrate that the priests\u2019 actions toward plaintiff were an outgrowth of, and were engendered by, conduct that was within the scope of their employment. Plaintiff also contended that the definition of child abuse in ORS 12.117 includes both \u201csexual exploitation\u201d and \u201ccruelty,\u201d that neither of those standards requires physical contact with the child, and that Charvet\u2019s conduct of masturbating in plaintiffs presence therefore was not excluded from that definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The archdiocese replied that Frank\u2019s status as a Catholic priest standing alone was insufficient to show that he was acting within the scope of his employment; that there was no evidence that, around the time of the incident involving Frank, plaintiff was involved in any church-related activities such as serving as an altar boy; and that holding the archdiocese vicariously liable based solely on Frank\u2019s religious status would violate the religion clauses of the state and federal constitutions. Relying on <em>Conger v. Dant &amp; Russell, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number><em>Inc., </em>250 Or 480, 443 P2d 201 (1968), and related cases, the abbey and Charvet replied in part that plaintiffs deposition testimony that he \u201cassumed\u201d that Charvet had been masturbating in his presence was inadmissible speculation and therefore was insufficient to allow a jury to find that Charvet had in fact engaged in that conduct. The abbey and Charvet also contended that, even assuming that Charvet was masturbating during the encounter, that conduct was not \u201cchild abuse\u201d within the definition of ORS 12.117. Finally, they argued that plaintiffs contention that, in effect, all Catholics are \u201cgroomed\u201d by all Catholic priests as a matter of Catholic doctrine amounted to a theory of strict liability that failed as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">After a hearing, the trial court concluded that Charvet\u2019s alleged conduct of masturbating in plaintiffs presence did not constitute \u201cchild abuse\u201d as defined in ORS 12.117 and that, accordingly, plaintiffs claims of direct and vicarious liability based on that conduct were time-barred. The trial court also concluded that neither the alleged conduct of Frank nor that of Charvet was sufficient, under <em>Fearing, </em>to support <em>respondeat superior </em>liability on the part of the priests\u2019 employers. The court therefore granted summary judgment in favor of all defendants on plaintiffs claims involving both Frank and Charvet.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">As noted, on appeal, plaintiff asserts three assignments of error. In his first and second assignments, he contends that the trial court erred in determining that there was insufficient evidence to submit to the jury the question of vicarious liability of the archdiocese and the abbey for the conduct of Frank and Charvet. In his third assignment of error, he argues that the trial court erred in determining that Charvet\u2019s conduct was not subject to the extended statute of limitations in ORS 12.117 and in dismissing the relevant claims as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Because it is dispositive of plaintiffs claims based on Charvet\u2019s conduct, we begin with his third assignment of error, pertaining to the applicability of the extended limitations period provided by ORS 12.117. Plaintiff first contends that a jury could find that Charvet\u2019s action of masturbating in front of a student constituted \u201ccruelty to [a] child\u201d within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>the meaning of ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B) because, according to plaintiff, consistently with the plain meaning of the word \u201ccruel,\u201d the statutory term \u201ccruelty\u201d encompasses acts that cause significant psychic injury to a child and that are performed with a mental state of indifference to such injury. Second, plaintiff argues that a jury could find that Charvet\u2019s conduct constituted \u201csexual exploitation\u201d of plaintiff within the meaning of ORS 12.117(2)(d) because his conduct was sexual in nature and, by engaging in it, he unethically used plaintiff for selfish purposes; plaintiff contends that masturbating in the presence of a child constitutes \u201csexual exploitation\u201d as a matter of common sense. Plaintiff further notes that the legislature provided a nonexclusive list of examples of \u201csexual exploitation\u201d \u2014 child pornography and prostitution \u2014 and that, like the activity of masturbating in front of a child, those activities as defined do not necessarily require sexual contact. Plaintiff also points to the definitions of \u201cchild abuse\u201d in ORS 419B.005 and ORS 163.665, which, he contends, provide contextual support for his proposed interpretation of the phrase in ORS 12.117.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">The abbey and Charvet respond that the trial court ruled correctly for two reasons.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> First, they contend, even assuming that Charvet\u2019s alleged conduct was child abuse within the meaning of ORS 12.117, plaintiff produced no admissible evidence of that conduct. Rather, the only evidence germane to that issue was plaintiffs inadmissible \u201cassumption\u201d or \u201cmere speculation\u201d that Charvet was masturbating in front of him, evidence that defendants assert is insufficiently specific to create an issue of fact to preclude summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Alternatively, the abbey and Charvet contend that, as a matter of statutory construction, and even assuming that there is admissible evidence that Charvet was masturbating in front of plaintiff, that conduct did not constitute \u201cchild abuse\u201d within the meaning of ORS 12.117. According to defendants, the text and context of the statute demonstrate that it applies to conduct involving an adult sexually touching a child, a child sexually touching an adult, or a child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>performing sexual activities that are observed by others, but not to conduct involving an adult touching himself. Here, where Charvet did not physically contact plaintiff and plaintiff himself did not engage in any sexual conduct, the conduct alleged did not constitute either \u201ccruelty to a child\u201d as provided in ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B) or \u201csexual exploitation of a child\u201d as provided in ORS 12.117(2)(d)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Plaintiff replies that, where he testified to seeing movement under Charvet\u2019s cassock that \u201cwent on [for] a long time\u201d while Charvet was talking about masturbation, that evidence was not speculative; rather, a jury reasonably could infer from his testimony that Charvet was masturbating.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">We begin by determining the meaning of the relevant provisions of ORS 12.117 as a legal matter. We do so according to the familiar principles of statutory construction enunciated in <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993), beginning with the text and context of the relevant provision, then considering, if necessary, the provision\u2019s legislative history and relevant maxims of construction. We then consider whether there is evidence in the record from which a jury could reasonably find or infer that Charvet\u2019s conduct met the determined legal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">ORS 12.117 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-7\">\u201c(1) Notwithstanding ORS 12.110, 12.115 or 12.160, an action based on conduct that constitutes child abuse or conduct knowingly allowing, permitting or encouraging child abuse accruing while the person who is entitled to bring the action is under 18 years of age shall be commenced not more than six years after that person attains 18 years of age, or if the injured person has not discovered the injury or the causal connection between the injury and the child abuse, nor in the exercise of reasonable care should have discovered the injury or the causal connection between the injury and the child abuse, not more than three years from the date the injured person discovers or in the exercise of reasonable care should have discovered the injury or the causal connection between the child abuse and the injury, whichever period is longer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>\u201c(2) As used in subsection (1) of this section, \u2018child abuse\u2019 means any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-4\">\u201c(a) <em>Intentional conduct by an adult that results in:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-5\">\u201c(A) Any physical injury to a child; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-6\">\u201c(B) <em>Any mental injury to a child which results in observable and substantial impairment of the child\u2019s mental or psychological ability to function caused by cruelty to the child, with due regard to the culture of the </em>child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-7\">\u201c(b) Rape of a child, which includes but is not limited to rape, sodomy, unlawful sexual penetration and incest, as those acts are defined in ORS chapter 163;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-8\">\u201c(c) Sexual abuse, as defined in ORS chapter 163, when the victim is a child; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-9\">\u201c(d) <em>Sexual exploitation of a child, including but not limited to:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-10\">\u201c(A) <em>Conduct constituting violation of ORS 163.435 and any other conduct which allows, employs, authorizes, permits, induces or encourages a child to engage in the performing for people to observe or the photographing, filming, tape recording or other exhibition which, in whole or in part, depicts sexual conduct or contact; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-11\">\u201c(B) Allowing, permitting, encouraging or hiring a child to engage in prostitution, as defined in ORS chapter 167.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-12\">\u201c(3) Nothing in this section creates a new cause of action or enlarges any existing cause of action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-13\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-14\">We first consider the meaning of ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B). That subsection includes within the category of \u201cchild abuse\u201d that is subject to the extended limitations period of ORS 12.117(1) \u201c[i]ntentional conduct by an adult that results in * * * [a]ny mental injury to a child which results in observable and substantial impairment of the child\u2019s mental or psychological ability to function caused by cruelty to the child.\u201d Specifically, we address the meaning of the disputed phrase \u201ccruelty to the child.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>The noun \u201ccruelty,\u201d although not defined in the statute, is defined in the dictionary, in part, as \u201cthe quality or state of being cruel: disposition to inflict pain or suffering or to enjoy its being inflicted: INHUMANITY.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>546 (unabridged ed 2002). In addition, it indicates \u201ca cruel action: inhuman treatment <em>.\u2019\u2019Id. </em>The adjective \u201ccruel\u201d means, in part, \u201cdisposed to inflict pain esp. in a wanton, insensate, or vindictive manner: pleased by hurting others : SADISTIC : devoid of kindness\u201d or \u201carising from or indicative of an inclination to enjoy another\u2019s pain or misfortune.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>It also means \u201ccausing or conducive to injury, grief, or pain &lt;a [cruel] struggle for existen.ee&gt;\u201d and \u201cSEVERE, DISTRESSING : extremely painful: EXTREME.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">It is apparent that the phrase \u201ccruelty to the child\u201d has several possible meanings. We first consider whether the term \u201ccruelty\u201d as used in ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B) denotes a mental state of the perpetrator of the conduct at issue \u2014 specifically, that the perpetrator has a \u201cdisposition\u201d to enjoy inflicting pain or hurting others \u2014 or whether it describes the nature of the conduct itself \u2014 that the conduct \u201ccausfes]\u201d or is \u201cconducive to\u201d injury, grief, or pain. The quoted definitions of cruelty support both of those interpretations. However, we do not consider the phrase \u201ccruelty to the child\u201d in isolation. <em>See To v. State Farm Mutual Ins., </em>319 Or 93, 99, 873 P2d 1072 (1994) (the court does not consider a phrase in isolation but considers it in the context of the statutory provision as a whole). Considered as a whole, ORS 12.117 \u2014 -which applies to \u201caction[s] based on conduct that constitutes child abuse,\u201d ORS 12.117(1), and which defines \u201cchild abuse\u201d in relevant part, in terms of \u201cconduct,\u201d ORS 12.117(2) \u2014 suggests a general emphasis on the act performed, rather than on the mental state of the perpetrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">A provision of the juvenile code, ORS 419B.504, supports that interpretation. That provision provides for termination of parental rights based on, among other things, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>\u201c[c]onduct toward any child of an abusive, cruel or sexual nature.\u201d ORS 419B.504(2). The fact that the legislature used the adjective \u201ccruel\u201d specifically to modify \u201cconduct\u201d toward children in ORS 419B.504(2) suggests that the legislature intended the word \u201ccruelty\u2019 in ORS 12.117(2) to refer to a type of conduct rather than to the mental state of the perpetrator.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, based on the text and context of ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B), we conclude that the phrase \u201ccruelty to the child\u201d refers to a type of conduct, not to the disposition or mental state of the perpetrator of the conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">We next consider the precise nature of such conduct. To recall, as relevant to conduct, the noun \u201ccruelty\u2019 means \u201ca cruel action : inhuman treatment.\u201d The adjective \u201ccruel\u201d means \u201csevere, distressing : extremely painful : extreme.\u201d The adjective \u201cinhuman\u201d means, in part, \u201clacking the qualities of mercy, pity, kindness, or tenderness : CRUEL, BARBAROUS, SAVAGE.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 1163. Those definitions strongly suggest that, in using the word cruelty, the legislature intended to encompass conduct of a relatively severe or extreme nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Next, assuming that the legislature intended to refer to relatively extreme conduct, we consider whether such conduct can be of any type, such as physical, verbal, or sexual, or whether it encompasses only particular types. The text of ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B) is silent regarding that issue, and the plain meaning of \u201ccruelty,\u201d discussed above, also provides no guidance. The context of ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B) provides some guidance, however. As quoted above, ORS 12.117(2)(a)(A) pertains to intentional conduct that results in physical injury to a child; accordingly, we infer that the legislature did not intend for ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B) to encompass such conduct\u2014 although it might well encompass physical conduct that does not result in physical injury. In addition, ORS 12.117(2)(b), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>(c), and (d) enumerate various forms of sexual contact with or sexual exploitation of a child, regardless of whether that conduct results in any demonstrable mental or physical injury; we therefore infer that ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B) does not encompass the types of sexual conduct specified in ORS 12.117(2)(b), (c), and (d). Nevertheless, even assuming that ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B) does not include types of conduct addressed elsewhere in the statute, it remains unclear what other types of conduct <em>are </em>included.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Finally, the disputed phrase is indefinite in at least one other respect. As noted, the noun \u201ccruelty\u201d means, in part, \u201ca cruel action\u201d or \u201cinhuman treatment.\u201d The noun \u201caction\u201d is defined, in part, as \u201ca voluntary act of will that manifests itself externally.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 21. That is, the word \u201caction\u201d may refer to a single event. However, the word \u201caction\u201d also is defined as \u201cthe process of change or alteration\u201d and \u201cthe process of doing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, it also may mean a series of events. Similarly, the noun \u201ctreatment\u201d means, in part, \u201cconduct or behavior toward another\u201d; \u201cthe action or manner of dealing with something often in a specified way\u201d; and \u201cthe techniques or actions customarily applied in a specified situation as a: a pattern of actions * * * designed to punish or persuade.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2435. Those definitions also encompass both single events and series of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">In summary as to our first-level analysis, we are confident that the phrase \u201ccruelty to the child\u201d refers to conduct of a relatively extreme nature. However, it is not clear from the text or context what types of conduct are included in the phrase, such as whether it encompasses conduct that is physical, verbal, or sexual or whether such conduct can consist of a single act or event or must instead constitute a \u201cprocess\u201d or a \u201cpattern\u201d of behavior \u2014 that is, a series of events. Nor, aside from the other provisions of ORS 12.117 discussed above, have we identified any contextual statutes that clarify the intended meaning of \u201ccruelty to the child\u201d in those respects.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>We therefore turn to the legislative history of ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">ORS 12.117 was enacted by the 1989 legislature in response to concerns that ORS 12.160 (which tolls statutes of limitation for persons under 18 years of age, but only for a maximum of five years, or one year after the person turns 18) was insufficient in cases of minors subjected to \u201cchild abuse and molestation.\u201d As initially introduced, the bill, House Bill (HB) 2668, simply amended ORS 12.160 by extending the tolling period to a maximum of 10 years, three years after the person turned 18 in actions based on assault or battery, or one year after the person turned 18 in all other actions, whichever occurred later. None of the language at issue in this case was present in the original bill. <em>See </em>Staff Measure Summary, HB 2668, Mar 20,1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">At an early hearing on the bill, after some discussion as to the kind of claims the bill applied to, Representative Mannix suggested that it be amended to apply to claims based on \u201csexual, physical, or psychological abuse.\u201d In turn, Representative Minnis noted that, in 1985, the legislature had amended the definition of \u201cchild abuse\u201d in a different statute to include what he referred to as \u201cpsychological abuse\u201d and asked whether there were any appellate cases further defining that form of child abuse. The chair of the judiciary committee asked staff to prepare amendments to respond to those concerns. Minutes, House Committee on Judiciary, Civil Law Subcommittee, Mar 20,1989, 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>In response, committee staff substantially redrafted the bill. Rather than amending ORS 12.160, the redrafted bill added a new section to ORS 12.070 to 12.250. Among other new provisions, the proposed new section, eventually codified as ORS 12.117, defined \u201cchild abuse\u201d to include \u201cintentional conduct by an adult that results in * * * [a]ny mental injury to a child.\u201d Exhibits, HB 2668, House Committee on Judiciary, Civil Law Subcommittee, Mar 24, 1989, Ex I. At a meeting of the relevant subcommittee, legislators discussed what was meant by that type of conduct and injury. Snyder, a witness representing the Oregon Trial Lawyers Association, noted that the term \u201cchild abuse\u201d was defined in the juvenile code. Subcommittee counsel Taylor informed the committee that the then-current child abuse reporting statute, <em>former </em>ORS 418.740 (1987), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 419B.005 (1993), defined \u201cchild abuse\u201d to include a qualified form of \u201cmental injur/\u2019; counsel quoted the relevant language to the committee. Minutes, House Committee on Judiciary, Civil Law Subcommittee, Apr 5,1989, 6-8.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There was no further discussion in the legislature of the \u201cmental injur/\u2019 form of \u201cchild abuse.\u201d The language that the legislature ultimately enacted as the \u201cmental injur/\u2019 component of ORS 12.117 was substantially identical to that found in <em>former </em>ORS 418.740.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Because the disputed language in ORS 12.117 derived almost verbatim from <em>former </em>ORS 418.740, and because the 1989 legislature apparently did not reconsider in any detail the intended meaning of that language, we also consider the legislative history of <em>former </em>ORS 418.740 \u2014 specifically, the 1985 amendments to that statute that introduced the relevant text.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The amendments were requested by what was then the Children\u2019s Services Division (CSD) of what was then the Department of Human Resources. The purpose of the amendments was to bring Oregon\u2019s child abuse reporting statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>into compliance with federal requirements for receipt of federal funding. Staff Measure Analysis, HB 2160-A-E, Senate Judiciary Committee, May 30 and June 4,1985. However, as originally introduced, the relevant bill (HB 2160) did not include any reference to mental injury. Rather, it defined reportable \u201cchild abuse\u201d in terms of intentional physical injury to a child; neglect, \u201cwhich leads to physical harm\u201d; and various types of sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">During the legislative session, CSD requested that the bill also include intentional conduct resulting in mental injury to a child. According to materials submitted by several witnesses, the concept of \u201cmental injury\u201d or \u201cemotional maltreatment\u201d of children was relatively new and was intended to capture \u201cparental acts or omissions\u201d that result in \u201charm or threatened harm to the child.\u201d The submitted materials included excerpts from a Draft Model Child Protection Act, which employed four criteria for identifying emotionally maltreated children. The first criterion pertained to the conduct of the parent or caretaker, as opposed to the resulting symptoms or effects on the child; the relevant conduct was described as a <em>\u201cpattern of behavior </em>that has an EFFECT on the child.\u201d Exhibits, House Committee on Judiciary, HB 2160, Mar 20, 1985, Ex B, C (italics added; capitalization in original). The language originally suggested by the proponents to define \u201cmental injury\u201d did not include any reference to \u201ccruelty,\u201d however. <em>Id. </em>at Ex B; <em>see also </em>Exhibits, Senate Judiciary Committee, HB 2160, June 6,1985, Ex L.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">During the floor debate preceding passage of HB 2160 out of the House, Representative Kopetski explained that the bill expanded the definition of child abuse to include \u201cmental abuse\u201d; in response to a question from Representative. Minnis, Representative Kopetski stated that \u201cmental injury\u201d was intended to encompass \u201csomething beyond a stress level\u201d that created \u201ca dysfunction of mental ability.\u201d The remainder of the floor debate pertaining to HB 2160 focused on other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The bill then went to the Senate. At a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, committee members discussed in detail the intended scope of the \u201cintentional conduct resulting in mental injur/\u2019 form of child abuse, particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>the need for a causal relationship between the actor\u2019s conduct and such injury. To address that concern, two witnesses, Multnomah County Juvenile Court Judge Herrell and Multnomah County Deputy District Attorney Meisenheimer, suggested that mental injury be defined as <em>\u201can act or acts of cruelty to a child </em>which results in an observable and substantial impairment of the child\u2019s mental or psychological ability to function within the child\u2019s normal range of performance and behavior with due regard to the child\u2019s culture.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Meisenheimer noted that \u201ccruelty\u201d was one of the grounds for juvenile court dependency jurisdiction. Committee Chair Senator Frye opined that the latter usage included mental cruelty such as acts of \u201cdepravity\u201d not involving physical cruelty. Several committee members agreed that the quoted definition was intended to include nonphysical conduct on the part of the perpetrator. As examples, Senator Hendriksen mentioned shouting at a child \u201cevery day\u201d or \u201cconstantly\u201d disparaging a child. Minutes, Senate Judiciary Committee, June 6,1985, 23-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Later in the hearing, in order to further emphasize the need for a cause-and-effect relationship between conduct constituting cruelty and the resulting mental injury, the committee moved the language pertaining to \u201ccruelty\u201d to the end of the \u201cmental injury\u201d provision. The committee also omitted the words \u201can act or acts.\u201d Thus, the committee ultimately agreed to qualify \u201cmental injury\u201d as including \u201conly observable and substantial impairment of the child\u2019s mental or psychological ability to function caused by cruelty to the child, with due regard to the culture of the child.\u201d At the conclusion of the hearing, Senator Wyers noted that he was \u201ccomfortable\u201d with the use of the word \u201ccruelty\u201d based on the examples previously given, such as \u201cscreaming repeatedly\u201d at a child \u201cin a very extreme way\u201d and other \u201ctraumatizing\u201d conduct, as opposed to mere \u201cshouting\u201d at children \u201coccasionally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25-26; Tape Recording, Senate Judiciary Committee, HB 2160, June 6,1985, Tape 175, Side B (statement of Sen Jan Wyers). During the Senate floor debate, Senator Wyers reiterated that the category pertaining to intentional conduct resulting in mental injury was intended to capture \u201cabuse that does not actually cause physical, observable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>physical damage to [children], such as repeatedly screaming at a child at very close range.\u201d Tape Recording, Senate Floor Debate, HB 2160, June 12,1985, Tape 185, Side A (statement of Sen Jan Wyers).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">For unrelated reasons, the bill was then referred to a conference committee.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At a meeting of the committee, a witness from CSD expressed concern that the word \u201ccruelty\u201d in the \u201cmental injury\u201d provision was too \u201cnarrow\u201d and would fail to capture other conduct that could cause such injury to a child, such as failure to stimulate, guide, or praise a child. Minutes, Conference Committee on HB 2160, June 17,1985, 6, 8-11; <em>see also </em>Minutes, Conference Committee on HB 2160, June 17,1985, Ex A, B. Senator Frye responded that the purpose of the phrase \u201ccaused by cruelty to the child\u201d.was to emphasize the requirement of a causal relationship between the actor\u2019s conduct and the resulting mental injury, and Senator Hendrikson noted that the word \u201ccruelty\u201d was intended to refer to a narrow range of conduct. Minutes, Conference Committee on HB 2160, June 17,1985, 9-10. The committee therefore retained the language proposed in the Senate Judiciary Committee and passed the bill out of the Senate.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Following consideration in the conference committee, HB 2160 was repassed by the House and Senate. In the House floor debate preceding repassage, Representative Springer explained that, after the bill\u2019s original passage by the House, the Senate had \u201cnarrowed significantly\u201d the definition of what he referred to as \u201cmental abuse\u201d and that the conference committee had retained that language. House Floor Debate, HB 2160, June 19, 1985, Reel 26, Track I. The Senate floor debate preceding repassage did not include any discussion of the \u201cmental injury\u201d provision. Senate Floor Debate, HB 2160, June 20,1985, Tape 230, Side A.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The legislative history of <em>former </em>ORS 418.740 sheds additional light on the meaning of ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B) in several significant respects. First, it demonstrates that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>phrase \u201ccruelty to the child\u201d was intended to refer to a \u201cnarrow\u201d range of conduct.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Second, it confirms that the phrase was intended to refer to relatively severe or extreme conduct toward a child. Finally, the examples given by members of the Senate Judiciary Committee of the type of conduct with which the legislature was concerned \u2014 such as shouting at a child \u201cevery day,\u201d \u201cconstantly\u2019 disparaging a child, and \u201cscreaming repeatedly,\u201d as opposed to \u201coccasionally,\u201d at a child \u2014 discloses that the phrase \u201ccruelty\u2019 was intended to refer, at least most typically, to verbal conduct that, moreover, occurs repeatedly or that forms a \u201cpattern\u201d of abusive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Nevertheless, the legislative history of <em>former </em>ORS 418.470 does not conclusively demonstrate that those types of conduct were the only types that fall within the ambit of the disputed phrase. That is, although the legislative history sheds some additional light on the meaning of the phrase \u201ccruelty to the child\u201d in ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B), it does not, in our view, definitively delineate the entire universe of such conduct. We therefore turn to the third level of statutory interpretation, in which we apply relevant maxims of construction. <em>PGE, </em>317 Or at 612. We recently explained our deployment of two relevant maxims in <em>State v. Lonergan, </em>210 Or App 155, 164, 149 P3d 1215 (2006), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>344 Or 15, 176 P3d 374 (2008):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">\u201c[T]wo interrelated maxims of construction aid in resolving this case: First, we are to construe the language of a statute in a manner consistent with its purpose. <em>Welliver Welding Works v. Farmen, </em>133 Or App 203, 210, 890 P2d 429 (1995). Second, in resolving statutory ambiguities at PGE\u2019s third level, we attempt to discern what the legislature <em>\u2018would have </em>intended had it considered th[e] problem.\u2019 <em>State v. Abdelrasul, </em>111 Or App 276, 279, 826 P2d 58 (1992) (emphasis in original). \u2018In conducting that [second] inquiry, we are guided by what the legislature or the courts have identified as the broader purpose of the statute.\u2019 <em>Godfrey v. Fred Meyer Stores, </em>202 Or App 673, 689, 124 P3d 621 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>(2005), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 672 (2006). Therefore, in applying both of those maxims, the legislative history, even though not dispositive at PGE\u2019s second level, may be highly probative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">(Brackets in original; footnotes omitted.) <em>See also Godfrey, </em>202 Or App at 689 (\u201cIn evaluating competing plausible interpretations of a statute, we are counseled to adopt the construction that is the one closest to what we anticipate the legislature would have intended us to adopt had it confronted the matter.\u201d); <em>Linn-Benton-Lincoln Ed. v. Linn-Benton-Lincoln ESD, </em>163 Or App 558, 570 n 8, 989 P2d 25 (1999) (\u201cIt is appropriate to allude to legislative history at the third level of the <em>PGE </em>analysis. Although the legislative history cited here is not clear enough, standing alone, to allow us to render a decision at the second level, in combination with [the maxim that we construe a statute consistently with its purpose], we find its guidance useful.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">In applying those maxims here, we also note our awareness that, to the extent legislative history provides guidance, in this case, that guidance derives primarily from the history of <em>former </em>ORS 418.740 rather than from the history of ORS 12.117 itself. Nevertheless, we believe that those related statutes \u2014 the former of which pertains to reporting child abuse, and the latter of which establishes an extended limitations periods for bringing actions based on child abuse \u2014 are sufficiently directed at the same legislative purposes and intentions so as to permit us to consider the histories of both at the third level of construction, as we did at the second level. <em>See PGE, </em>317 Or at 611 (where the legislature uses the same term in related statutes, the court infers that the term has the same meaning); <em>Kahn v. Pony Express Courier Corp., </em>173 Or App 127, 141, 20 P3d 837, <em>rev den, </em>332 Or 518 (2001) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The primary purpose of each statute is, of course, the protection of children from abuse. Nevertheless, as hoth the statutes themselves and their histories disclose, neither statute has unlimited scope. Indeed, it is apparent to us that the legislature made a significant effort to enact specific, detailed criteria giving rise to, respectively, the obligation to report child abuse and the entitlement to an extended limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>period. In particular, as pertinent here, it is clear that the legislature intended the word \u201ccruelty\u201d to refer to a narrow range of extreme or severe conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Taking into account both the legislature\u2019s overall purpose in enacting ORS 12.117 and, at the same time, its careful calibration of the reach of that statute \u2014 demonstrated by its detailed description of the various kinds of conduct subject to the extended limitations period \u2014 we conclude that the conduct at issue here does not meet the standard established by ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B). As discussed above, plaintiff testified that, while Charvet was sitting behind his desk in his office, he questioned plaintiff, a freshman in high school, about his knowledge of sexuality and reproduction. During that discussion, plaintiff saw \u201cmotion\u201d under Charvet\u2019s cassock. Plaintiff did not see whether Charvet\u2019s hand was touching his skin, did not see Charvet\u2019s genitals, did not see Charvet\u2019s hand on his genitals, and did not perceive Charvet achieving any form of sexual climax. Plaintiff also testified that Charvet did not \u201cproposition\u201d plaintiff to participate in any way, did not touch plaintiff, did not ask plaintiff to do the same thing, and did not prevent plaintiff from leaving Charvet\u2019s office; to the contrary, plaintiff testified that, during the incident, Charvet \u201cbecame very distracted in what he was doing to himself.\u201d In other words, the conduct alleged here was essentially surreptitious and, although plaintiff was present, it did not directly involve him. Moreover, given that plaintiff alleges that Charvet\u2019s conduct of masturbating in his presence occurred on only one occasion, lasting approximately 10 minutes, the conduct did not occur as part of a \u201cpattern\u201d of abuse \u2014 a circumstance that logically can transform even less-severe conduct into conduct that is injurious to the extent contemplated by ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B). In short, even assuming that intentional conduct resulting in mental injury \u201ccaused by cruelty to the child\u201d as provided in ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B) includes sexual conduct that is not addressed in other portions of the statute \u2014 as we believe best effectuates the purpose of the statute as a whole \u2014 and even assuming as a logical matter that it includes single incidents as well as patterns of behavior, we conclude that, had the legislature considered the specific conduct alleged by plaintiff here, it would not have deemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>the incident to be the kind of extreme or severe conduct constituting \u201ccruelty to the child\u201d for the purpose of ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B). It follows that there was insufficient evidence from which the jury could conclude that Charvet\u2019s conduct was subject to the extended limitations period in that statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">We turn to whether plaintiffs claim based on Charvet\u2019s conduct was subject to an extended limitations period under ORS 12.117(2)(d), providing for such extension for claims based on conduct constituting \u201csexual exploitation of a child.\u201d The statute does not directly define the quoted term; rather, it sets out a nonexclusive list of activities that the term \u201cincludes.\u201d In that circumstance, we construe the statute to refer only to conduct of the same type as the listed activities. <em>See Liberty v. State Dept. of Transportation, </em>342 Or 11, 20, 148 P3d 909 (2006) (when a statute uses a general phrase and a nonexclusive list of items, under the principle of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>the court construes the statute as referring only to other items of the same kind as the listed items). In performing that task, we examine the \u201cbasic characteristics\u201d of the enumerated items. <em>Lewis v. CIGNA Ins. Co., </em>339 Or 342, 350,121 P3d 1128 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">We first examine the basic characteristics of the forms of activity enumerated in ORS 12.117(2)(d)(A). One of those forms is conduct constituting a violation of ORS 163.435, which provides that a person 18 years of age or older commits the crime of contributing to the sexual delinquency of a minor if the person engages in sexual intercourse or deviate sexual intercourse with a person of the opposite sex under 18 years of age or causes a person under 18 years of age to engage in deviate sexual intercourse. A \u201cbasic characteristic\u201d of those activities is sexual intercourse \u2014 that is, actual sexual contact \u2014 between the perpetrator and the victim. <em>See </em>ORS 163.305(6) (defining \u201csexual contact\u201d as \u201cany touching of the sexual or intimate parts of a person or causing such person to touch the sexual or intimate parts of the actor for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of either part/\u2019); ORS 163.305(7) (sexual intercourse \u201chas its ordinary meaning and occurs upon any penetration\u201d). The record in this case contains no evidence of such conduct by Charvet; accordingly, that portion of ORS 12.117(2)(d)(A) is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Next, under ORS 12.117(2)(d)(A), \u201csexual exploitation of a child\u201d also expressly includes \u201cconduct which allows, employs, authorizes, permits, induces or encourages a child to engage in the performing for people to observe or the photographing, filming, tape recording or other exhibition which, in whole or in part, depicts sexual conduct or contact.\u201d By its terms, that provision addresses various types of conduct by an actor that are directed at causing a child to perform sexual conduct or contact or to participate in the \u201cexhibition\u201d of such conduct or contact. <em>See, e.g., Webster\u2019s </em>at 747 (defining the verb \u201cencourage\u201d in part as to stimulate or incite); <em>id. </em>at 1142 (defining the verb \u201cincite\u201d in part as to bring into being or to induce to exist or occur).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">However, in this case, there is no evidence from which a jury could find or infer that Charvet directed any action toward plaintiff. As discussed above, plaintiff testified that, while Charvet was masturbating, he did not \u201cproposition\u201d plaintiff to participate somehow, did not touch plaintiff, did not ask plaintiff to do the same thing, and did not prevent plaintiff from leaving Charvet\u2019s office; to the contrary, plaintiff testified that, during the incident, Charvet \u201cbecame very distracted in what he was doing to himself.\u201d Thus, there is no evidence from which a jury could find or infer that Charvet \u201callow [ed], employ [ed], authorize [d], permit [ted], induce [d] or encourage [d]\u201d plaintiff to do anything, much less that Charvet encouraged plaintiff to perform sexual conduct or contact or to participate in the \u201cexhibition\u201d of such conduct or contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">As noted, plaintiff urges that, construed consistently with the plain and \u201ccommon sense\u201d meanings of the words \u201csexual\u201d and \u201cexploitation,\u201d Charvet\u2019s conduct constituted \u201csexual exploitation\u201d within the meaning of ORS 12.117(2)(d). As we have noted, however, where the legislature has provided that a general term \u201cincludes] but [is] not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>limited to\u201d expressly enumerated items \u2014 here, specific types of conduct \u2014 that is not the applicable textual analysis. Rather, we determine the meaning of the general phrase by examining the characteristics of the enumerated items. As the above discussion demonstrates, none of Charvet\u2019s conduct is of the same type as the activities expressly enumerated in ORS 12.117(2)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">The two categories of contextual statutes on which plaintiff relies do not persuade us that our textual analysis is incorrect. Plaintiff first relies on the definition of \u201cabuse\u201d applicable to the child abuse reporting statutes, ORS 419B.005 to 419B.050. However, ORS 419B.005<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> expressly provides that the terms defined therein have those meanings \u201c[a]s used in\u201d the child abuse reporting statutes; nothing in the text of either ORS 12.117 or ORS 419B.005 makes those definitions applicable in the context of the former statute. In any event, none of the types of conduct described in the child abuse reporting statutes alters our understanding of ORS 12.117 here. We address the various types of conduct of that definition in three parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">First, several of the types of conduct that constitute \u201cabuse\u201d under ORS 419B.005 involve physical contact with a child, such as assault, ORS 419B.005(l)(a)(A), rape, ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>419B.005(l)(a)(C), and sexual abuse, ORS 419B.005 (l)(a)(D); plaintiff does not contend that Charvet committed conduct of that type.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Second, ORS 419B.005(l)(a)(B) refers to mental injury caused by \u201ccruelty to a child.\u201d Even assuming that that subsection is relevant here, we would construe that phrase to have the same meaning as the identical phrase in ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B), discussed above. And, as we have done in the case of ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B), we would conclude that it is inapplicable to Charvet\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Third, plaintiff relies on ORS 419B.005(l)(a)(E)(i), pertaining to \u201c[s]exual exploitation [of a child], including but not limited to\u201d contributing to the sexual delinquency of a minor, as defined in ORS 163.435, and to conduct similar to that identified in the remainder of ORS 12.117(2)(d)(A) (\u201cconduct which allows, employs, authorizes, permits, induces or encourages\u201d a child to engage in, or to participate in an exhibition of, sexual conduct or contact). Again, we have determined that evidence is lacking of those types of conduct by Charvet here. In addition, although ORS 419B.005(l)(a)(E)(i) expressly refers to the description of sexual conduct or contact contained in ORS 163.665, which includes masturbation, ORS 163.665(3)(d), that reference is omitted from ORS 12.117, an omission that we infer to be deliberate. In short, nothing in the child abuse reporting statutes casts doubt on our understanding of the meaning and applicability of ORS 12.117.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">Finally, the second category of statutes on which plaintiff relies as context involves the definition of \u201cchild abuse\u201d in Oregon\u2019s Criminal Code. Plaintiff reasons that ORS 163.665(2) defines \u201cchild abuse\u201d as \u201cconduct that constitutes * * * a crime in which the victim is a child\u201d; that the crime of endangering the welfare of a minor, ORS 163.575, is such a crime; that, under ORS 163.575(l)(a), endangering the welfare of a minor includes inducing, causing, or permitting an unmarried person under 18 years of age to witness an act of \u201csexual conduct\u201d as defined in ORS 167.060; and that, under ORS 167.060(10), \u201csexual conduct\u201d includes masturbation. Again, however, the legislature has made the definition of \u201cchild abuse\u201d in ORS 163.665 specifically applicable only to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>ORS 163.670 to 163.693, which set out crimes relating to the visual recording of sexual conduct of children. Accordingly, even aside from the fact that ORS 12.117 includes its own definition of the term \u201cchild abuse,\u201d the definition of \u201cchild abuse\u201d in ORS 163.665 is of limited value as contextual evidence of the meaning of ORS 12.117.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">In summary, evidence is lacking from which a jury could find that Charvet\u2019s actions met either of the relevant definitions of \u201cchild abuse\u201d in ORS 12.117, as construed above. Plaintiffs claims based on those actions therefore are not subject to the extended statute of limitations provided therein and, accordingly, are time-barred, including both his claims for direct liability against Charvet and his claims against the archdiocese and the abbey under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior. </em>Accordingly, we need not consider whether Charvet\u2019s actions were within the scope of Charvet\u2019s employment for the purpose of <em>respondeat superior </em>liability, as contended in plaintiffs second assignment of error. The trial court did not err, then, in dismissing plaintiffs claims against defendants based on direct and vicarious liability for Charvet\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">We turn to plaintiffs first assignment of error, pertaining to the vicarious liability of Frank\u2019s employers for his conduct. Plaintiff contends that, although the incidents of sexual abuse that were the bases of employers\u2019 vicarious liability in <em>Fearing </em>and <em>Lourim v. Swensen, </em>328 Or 380, 977 P2d 1157 (1999), arose from the employees\u2019 \u201cgrooming\u201d or \u201cseduc tion\u201d of the child victims over time, that particular type of predicate conduct is not required. Rather, according to plaintiff, the proper test is whether there is a \u201ccausal link\u201d between an employee\u2019s authorized duties within the scope of his employment and the employee\u2019s tortious conduct. Plaintiff argues that such a link was present here because Frank had, in effect, absolute authority over him by reason of his priestly status and because the priest\u2019s exercise of that authority gave him the opportunity and the power to perpetrate the abuse. Plaintiff contends that a jury reasonably could find, from evidence of those circumstances, that Frank\u2019s assault was a \u201cdirect outgrowth of and w[as] engendered by conduct that was within the scope of [the priest\u2019s] employment\u201d as required under <em>Fearing. </em>328 Or at 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>In response, the archdiocese argues that, although Frank\u2019s alleged conduct occurred within the space and time limits authorized by his employment, that conduct could not have been motivated in any part by a desire to serve the archdiocese and was not of a kind that he was hired to perform.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Specifically, the archdiocese contends that it is settled that an act of sexual abuse is not generally within the scope of employment and that liability also does not arise merely because the employment relationship gave the employee the opportunity to commit the tortious conduct. Applying those principles, the archdiocese argues that, in this case, where plaintiff acknowledged in his deposition that he had had no contact with Frank before the alleged assault \u2014 indeed, that he did not even remember whether Frank was his parish priest \u2014 Frank\u2019s conduct was not an \u201coutgrowth of or engendered by\u201d conduct within the scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Conversely, the archdiocese contends that no conduct of Frank that was within the scope of his employment \u201cdirectly caused\u201d or was a \u201cnecessary precursor\u201d to the assault; in particular, even assuming that plaintiff subjectively felt compelled to obey Frank by reason of the latter\u2019s position as a priest, there is no evidence that Frank used his position to cultivate a relationship of trust with plaintiff. According to the archdiocese, plaintiffs claim in this case therefore suffers from the same deficiencies as the rejected claims of the plaintiffs in <em>Minnis v. Oregon Mutual Ins. Co., </em>334 Or 191, 48 P3d 137 (2002), and <em>Vinsonhaler v. Quantum Residential Corp., </em>189 Or App 1, 73 P3d 930 (2003). Conversely, plaintiffs claim is distinguishable from the claim in <em>Bray v. American Property Management Corp., </em>164 Or App 134, 988 P2d 933 (1999), <em>rev den, </em>330 Or 331 (2000), in which there was evidence from which the jury could find that the employer\u2019s directive to the employee to prevent the plaintiffs decedent from parking in the employer\u2019s garage was a necessary precursor to, and directly caused, the employee\u2019s tortious action of stabbing and killing the decedent. Finally, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>archdiocese contends that the religion clauses of the state and federal constitutions preclude reliance on Frank\u2019s status as a priest as the sole basis for civil liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">In reply, plaintiff disputes defendants\u2019 characterization of his argument as one imposing strict liability on Catholic priests. Plaintiff argues that the proper inquiry is whether there was an \u201cunbroken chain of causation\u201d between Frank\u2019s act of picking him up after he fell in front of the church and the sexual assault; according to plaintiff, there was. He also contends that defendants do not dispute that all of Frank\u2019s acts leading up to the abuse were within the scope of his duties and do not dispute that they were \u201cnecessary precursors\u201d to Frank\u2019s abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\"> Under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior, </em>an employer is vicariously liable for an employee\u2019s tortious conduct, including intentional torts, when the employee acts within the course and scope of employment. <em>Fearing, </em>328 Or at 372. To establish that the employee acted within the course and scope of employment requires proof of three things: (1) the tortious act must have \u201coccurred substantially within the time and space limits authorized by the employment\u201d; (2) the employee must have been \u201cmotivated, at least partially, by a purpose to serve the employer\u201d; and (3) the employee\u2019s act must be \u201cof a kind which the employee was hired to perform.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 373 (citing <em>Chesterman, </em>305 Or at 442); <em>see also Minnis, </em>334 Or at 201; <em>Vinsonhaler, </em>189 Or App at 5. We examine the case law applying that test in order to illuminate the context of our application of that test to the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">In <em>Chesterman, </em>an employee (who was also the president) of a corporation ingested an hallucinogenic drug to enable himself to continue working on a company project. While under the influence of the drug, he entered the plaintiffs house and sexually assaulted her. 305 Or at 441. The plaintiff brought an action against the corporation, alleging that the employee\u2019s ingestion of the drug was within the scope of his employment and was the cause of her injury. <em>Id. </em>at 443. The trial court granted the corporation\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">The Supreme Court reversed. The court concluded that, as a matter of law, the employee\u2019s acts of entering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>plaintiffs house and sexually assaulting her were outside the scope of his employment. <em>Id. </em>at 443. It also concluded, however, that there was evidence from which a jury could find that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries resulted from the ingestion of the hallucinogenic drug and that ingesting the drug <em>was </em>within the scope of the employee\u2019s employment. <em>Id. </em>Thus, consistently with <em>Chesterman, </em>plaintiff must present evidence from which a jury could find that his injuries were caused by conduct that was within the scope of Frank\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><em>Fearing </em>applies that same inquiry in rather different circumstances. There, the court considered whether the plaintiffs complaint contained allegations sufficient to state a claim against the archdiocese for vicarious liability for a priest\u2019s acts of child abuse. The plaintiff had alleged that, when he was a minor in the early 1970s, the priest had acted as a \u201cyouth pastor, friend, confessor, and priest\u201d for the plaintiff and his family and had gained the family\u2019s \u201ctrust and confidence\u201d; by virtue of that relationship, the priest also had obtained the family\u2019s permission to spend \u201csubstantial periods of time\u201d alone with the plaintiff and had used his position of trust to touch the plaintiff physically. 328 Or at 372. Eventually, the priest committed a series of sexual assaults against the plaintiff. The trial court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim for vicarious liability against the archdiocese, and this court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">In reversing that decision, the Supreme Court again explained that, in the intentional tort context, the relevant question is not whether the intentional tort itself was committed in furtherance of any interest of the employer or involved the kind of activity that the employee was hired to perform. <em>Id. </em>at 373-74, 376. Rather, the question is whether there is evidence of acts that were within the scope of employment that, in turn, resulted in the acts that caused the plaintiffs injury. <em>Id. </em>at 374, 376. The court concluded that the allegations in the plaintiffs complaint were sufficient to allow the jury to infer that the priest\u2019s conduct in cultivating a trust relationship with the plaintiff was motivated, at least in part, by a desire to further the interests of the archdiocese, that that conduct was of a kind that the priest was hired to perform, and that the conduct led to the sexual assaults; that is, that the sexual assaults \u201cwere the culmination of a progressive series of actions that began with and continued to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>involve\u201d the priest\u2019s performance of his ordinary and authorized duties. <em>Id. </em>at 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">The court rejected the argument of the archdiocese that the plaintiffs allegations demonstrated only that the priest\u2019s employment gave him the \u201copportunity\u2019 to commit the alleged assault. The court explained that the jury</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">\u201creasonably could infer that [the priest\u2019s] performance of his pastoral duties with respect to [the] plaintiff and his family were a necessary precursor to the sexual abuse and that the assaults thus were a direct outgrowth of and were engendered by conduct that was within the scope of [the priest\u2019s] employment\u201d;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">accordingly, the performance of those employment-related duties need not itself be the \u201ccause\u201d of the plaintiffs injury. <em>Id. </em>at 377. The court therefore reversed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint. Thus, in contrast to <em>Chesterman </em>\u2014 in which the course of conduct that arguably was within the scope of the employee\u2019s employment was of short duration and took place immediately before the conduct that caused the plaintiffs <em>injury </em>\u2014 Fearing involved employment-related conduct over an extended period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\"><em>Lourim </em>also is instructive. There, the trial court dismissed for failure to state a claim the plaintiffs complaint alleging that the Boy Scouts of America were vicariously liable for a scout leader\u2019s tortious conduct. The plaintiff had alleged that the scout leader had been a duly authorized volunteer leader who had acted as a troop leader or assistant troop leader of the plaintiffs Boy Scout troop; that the plaintiff and his family had become \u201cclose\u201d to the scout leader; that the scout leader had been a frequent guest in their home; that the scout leader had gained their trust and confidence as a \u201csuitable friend, guide, mentor and role model\u201d to the plaintiff (who was then an adolescent); and that, by virtue of that relationship, the family had allowed the scout leader to spend substantial amounts of time alone with the plaintiff and together with other boys in remote places. The scout leader then used his position of trust to gain the opportunity to touch the plaintiff physically; he eventually committed assaults against the plaintiff. 328 Or at 384-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">The court considered whether those allegations were sufficient to show that conduct within the scope of the scout <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>leader\u2019s employment arguably resulted in the tortious acts. <em>Id. </em>at 386. The court concluded that, as in <em>Fearing, </em>a jury could have inferred that the scout leader\u2019s tortious conduct was \u201cmerely the culmination of a progressive series of actions that involved the ordinary and authorized duties of a Boy Scout leader\u201d; that, in cultivating a relationship with the plaintiff and his family, the scout leader was motivated, at least initially, by a desire to fulfill his duties as a troop leader; that the scout leader\u2019s performance of his authorized duties was a necessary precursor to the tortious conduct; and that the assaults were \u201ca direct outgrowth of and were engendered by\u201d conduct within the scope of the scout leader\u2019s employment. <em>Id. </em>at 386-87. In short, the court determined that the complaint was sufficient to state a claim against the Boy Scouts under the doctrine of vicarious liability; it therefore reversed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of that claim. <em>Id. </em>at 388. Thus, <em>Lourim, like Fearing, </em>involved an extended course of employment-related conduct leading up to the conduct that caused the plaintiffs injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Next, in <em>Minnis, </em>the question was whether the insurer of a pizza business had a duty to defend the business against a tort claim brought by a former employee. 334 Or at 193. As pertinent here, the employee\u2019s complaint had alleged that a manager of the business had sexually harassed her in the workplace and had sexually assaulted her at his apartment. The insurer refused to defend. <em>Id. </em>at 197. After settling the employee\u2019s claims, the business owner brought an action against the insurer, to whom the trial court granted summary judgment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The Supreme Court affirmed, concluding that the only injury that was covered by the policy was the employee\u2019s bodily injury caused by conduct that the manager had committed against the employee at his apartment, not conduct in the workplace, which was subject to a policy exclusion. The question thus became whether the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged that that conduct was, in turn, caused by the manager\u2019s workplace conduct \u2014 that is, was conduct within the scope of the manager\u2019s employment. <em>Id. </em>at 201-02. The court concluded that she had not done so; rather, she merely had alleged that both the manager\u2019s workplace conduct and his conduct at his apartment were \u201cepisodes in a series\u201d with no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>cause-and-effect relationship. <em>Id. </em>at 202-03. Accordingly, the business was not subject to <em>respondeat superior </em>liability for the latter conduct of the manager. <em>Id. </em>at 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><em>Bray </em>also is instructive. In that case, the plaintiff and her husband habitually left their delivery van in the driveway of a parking garage managed by the defendant, where it obstructed the garage customers\u2019 use of the garage; plaintiff and her husband also parked their van in the garage at night without permission. 164 Or App at 136. The defendant employed a parking attendant at the garage, whom they neither expressly authorized to use nor prohibited from using force in carrying out his duties. One evening, the plaintiff\u2019s husband attempted to park in the garage. The parking attendant, who, after previous encounters with the plaintiffs husband, had been specifically instructed not to permit the husband to park there, attempted to stop him. A scuffle ensued, and the attendant fatally stabbed the husband. <em>Id. </em>at 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The plaintiff brought an action alleging that the defendant was vicariously liable for the attendant\u2019s conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 137-38. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and this court affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 138. We concluded that, although the stabbing itself was not within the scope of the attendant\u2019s employment, nevertheless, as in <em>Fearing </em>and <em>Lourim, </em>the jury could have found that his conduct was \u201cmerely the culmination of a progressive series of actions that involved [the attendant\u2019s] ordinary and authorized duties\u201d\u2014 that it was \u201cthe product of the escalating antagonism\u201d between the attendant and the plaintiffs husband \u201ccentering on\u201d the husband\u2019s attempted use of the garage and that it was an \u201coutgrowth\u201d of the defendant having told the attendant not to permit that use. <em>Id. </em>at 140-41 (citing and quoting <em>Lourim, </em>328 Or at 386 (internal quotation marks omitted)). Thus, the plaintiff had demonstrated the necessary \u201cdirect causation\u201d between the attendant\u2019s authorized employment duties and the conduct that caused the plaintiffs injury. <em>Id. </em>at 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">We apply the described analysis to the record on summary judgment in this case as it relates to Frank\u2019s alleged conduct. We first note that the alleged sexual assault was not within the scope of Frank\u2019s employment; plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>does not contend otherwise. <em>See Chesterman, </em>305 Or at 443. Rather, we consider whether there is sufficient evidence in the summary judgment record of acts that <em>were </em>within the scope of Frank\u2019s employment that, in turn, resulted in the alleged sexual assault. That is, we consider whether there is evidence of conduct by Frank that was motivated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the archdiocese; that was of a kind that Frank was hired to perform; and that resulted in the acts causing plaintiffs injury. <em>See Fearing, </em>328 Or at 374, 376; <em>see also, e.g., Bray, </em>164 Or App at 138-39 (applying test).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">We conclude that the summary judgment record lacks sufficient evidence of such conduct. First, even if we were to assume that, as in <em>Fearing, </em>cultivation of a trust relationship with plaintiff and his family (who were members of that parish) would have been motivated by a desire to serve the parish and would have been a kind of conduct that Frank was hired to perform, the record is devoid of any evidence that Frank had cultivated that sort of relationship with plaintiff or his family before he assaulted plaintiff. In deposition testimony, plaintiff testified that he had not served as an altar boy with Frank, was not in the choir, and did not remember Frank coming to his family\u2019s house. When asked whether he had any contact with Frank prior to the alleged assault, plaintiff responded, \u201cNone that I remember\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t even remember him being a parish priest there, to tell you the truth.\u201d In short, the record is devoid of evidence that, before the alleged assault, Frank performed pastoral duties in relation to plaintiff or his family that then led to the conduct that caused plaintiffs alleged injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">As an alternative to cultivation of a trust relationship as a basis for imposing vicarious liability, we address Frank\u2019s conduct immediately preceding the alleged assault. <em>See Chesterman, </em>305 Or at 443 (determining an employer\u2019s vicarious liability based on an employee\u2019s actions in the hours preceding his tortious conduct). As previously described, the record shows that, one day when plaintiff was seven or eight years old, he and several other children were roller skating on the sidewalk around St. Mary\u2019s Church; that plaintiff fell down and scraped his knees; and that Frank, who was \u201cdressed like a priest,\u201d walked over to where plaintiff had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>fallen, helped plaintiff up, took him by a nearby stairway into the basement of the church, sat him on a table, and asked him to \u201ctake [his] pants down to look at [his] scraped knees,\u201d at which point he allegedly assaulted plaintiff. We consider whether, in engaging in that conduct immediately preceding the alleged sexual assault, Frank was motivated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the archdiocese and whether his actions were of a kind that he was hired to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">As to the first inquiry, the record lacks any direct evidence from which a jury could find that Frank was so motivated. Frank himself is deceased, and there is no other evidence on the point. Moreover, where Frank\u2019s alleged sexual assault of plaintiff followed immediately on his initial contact with plaintiff, there is no basis for a jury reasonably to infer that Frank was motivated, initially or in part, to serve the archdiocese. <em>Cf. Lourim, </em>328 Or at 386 (the plaintiffs allegations, if proved, would allow a jury to infer that the Boy Scout leader\u2019s conduct in cultivating over time a relationship with the plaintiff was motivated, at least initially, by a desire to fulfill his duties as a troop leader); <em>Fearing, </em>328 Or at 374-75 (the plaintiffs allegations, if proven, would allow a jury to infer that the priest\u2019s conduct in cultivating over time a relationship with the plaintiff was motivated, at least initially, by a desire to fulfill his priestly duties).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">In any event, we need not resolve the issue of Frank\u2019s motive because we conclude that evidence is lacking from which a jury could find that Frank\u2019s actions were of a kind he was hired to perform. Plaintiff contends that the archdiocese and the abbey do not dispute that, in taking the initial actions to help plaintiff with his scraped knees, Frank was \u201cfulfilling the role of a caring pastor.\u201d However, plaintiff points to no evidence in the record affirmatively demonstrating that the described actions, or actions of that general nature, were part of Frank\u2019s particular employment duties in the parish. Rather, plaintiff relies in part on evidence in the record relating generally to church doctrine, under which priests have an exalted status and are expected and required to act as the ultimate authority on right and wrong. That is insufficient. Abstract doctrine regarding the status of priests within the Catholic Church sheds no light on the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>whether the particular actions at issue here were employment duties imposed on Frank, in his capacity as a parish priest of St. Mary\u2019s Church, by the archdiocese.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Plaintiff also relies on evidence relating to the respect and obedience that parishioners are trained to show to priests, including plaintiffs own affidavit attesting that he was taught to \u201crevere and obey Catholic priests\u201d and that, when Frank told him to remove his pants, \u201cI believed from my teaching that I had no choice but to obey. Initially, he appeared to be concerned for my welfare as I was taught to expect from a priest.\u201d That evidence also is insufficient to show that Frank was carrying out authorized employment duties, however. Even assuming that plaintiffs unquestioning obedience of a priest\u2019s directives may have facilitated Frank\u2019s assault on him, evidence of such training, and the resulting obedience required to be shown to a priest by a parishioner, is not evidence of an employment duty of a particular priest.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">In summary, with regard to Frank\u2019s actions toward plaintiff immediately preceding the alleged sexual assault, we conclude that the record lacks legally sufficient evidence to support a jury finding that, in performing those actions, Frank was motivated at least in part by a purpose to serve the archdiocese. Further, and fatally to plaintiffs claim based on Frank\u2019s conduct, the record lacks legally sufficient evidence to support a jury finding that Frank\u2019s actions were of a kind that he was hired to perform. Plaintiff accordingly failed to produce sufficient evidence that Frank\u2019s actions immediately preceding his alleged sexual assault were within the scope of Frank\u2019s employment. We therefore need not consider whether those actions led to the actions that caused plaintiffs injury. The trial court did not err, then, in granting summary judgment to defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b716-8\"> Another defendant was dismissed at an early stage of the proceeding and is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b716-9\"> This and other relevant statutes are set out in the discussion below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b721-6\"> The archdiocese makes no separate response to plaintiffs third assignment of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b723-15\"> The parties do not dispute that, to the extent Charvet engaged in the conduct alleged, he did so intentionally.

The dissent acknowledges, however, that other conduct encompassed within the child endangerment criminal statute \u2014 which included using controlled substances in the presence of a child, causing or permitting a child to participate in gambling, and selling a child tobacco products or drug paraphernalia \u2014 likely would not constitute cruelty, and we do not discern any principle by which we can conclude that masturbation does so. 218 Or App at 704-05 (Edmonds, J., dissenting). In any event, another statute in effect at the time the legislature enacted ORS 12.117 controverts the inference that the dissent draws from ORS 163.575 (1987): Under <em>former </em>ORS 419.476 (1987), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1993, ch 33, \u00a7 373, the juvenile court had jurisdiction of a person under 18 years of age whose circumstances were such as to \u201cendanger the welfare of the person\u201d and a person under 18 years of age whose parents or custodian \u201csubjected the person to cruelty,\u201d among other bases for jurisdiction.

I agree with the majority\u2019s reasoning and conclusions with regard to the conduct of Frank but not with regard to the conduct of Charvet.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">With respect to vicarious liability for the conduct of both priests, <em>Chesterman v. Barmon, </em>305 Or 439, 753 P2d 404 (1988), is the seminal case regarding whether an employer is liable for an employee\u2019s torts when the employee purportedly acts within the scope of employment. As the majority correctly recites, three requirements must be satisfied in order to conclude that an employee\u2019s tort was within the scope of employment: (1) the act occurred substantially within the time and space limits authorized by the employment; (2) the employee was motivated, in part, by a purpose to serve the employer; and (3) the act is of a kind that the employee was hired to perform. 305 Or at 442. Even though a particular act, like a sexual assault, may not be within the actual scope of employment, if acts that were within the scope of employment resulted in conduct that led to the injury to the plaintiff, then vicarious liability exists. <em>Id. </em>at 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Even when plaintiff is given the benefit of all reasonable inferences that flow from the evidentiary record, there is no evidence that Frank was performing a pastoral role defined for him by his employer or by his job description that resulted in the sexual assault on plaintiff. It was merely coincidence that Frank encountered plaintiff while plaintiff was roller skating on a sidewalk adjacent to the church. Plaintiff had fallen down, and Frank, on the pretense of examining plaintiffs scraped knees, asked plaintiff to take his pants down. The sexual assault on plaintiff followed thereafter. There is simply no evidence that Frank\u2019s assistance to plaintiff constituted the performance of his job duties. Rather, by coming to the aid of plaintiff, an injured eight-year-old boy, Frank conducted himself in the same way that any concerned bystander might have. It follows that the majority correctly holds that the archdiocese is not vicariously liable for the conduct of Frank.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">In contrast to the conclusion that follows from the application of the above rules to Frank\u2019s conduct, the circumstances of Charvet\u2019s abuse of plaintiff require a different result when plaintiff is given the benefit of all reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>inferences that flow from the circumstances of the incident. The Charvet incident occurred when plaintiff was a student at Mt. Angel Seminary. Charvet was plaintiffs faculty advisor and dormitory proctor. Charvet asked plaintiff to meet him in Charvet\u2019s office. Obviously, any freshman high school student who is asked by a faculty advisor to meet with him would understand that the advisor was exercising his authority over him by virtue of their faculty-student relationship. Indeed, plaintiff was instructed by Charvet to stand in front of Charvet\u2019s desk. Charvet began the encounter by asking plaintiff what plaintiff knew about the subject of sexuality and reproduction, including the subject of masturbation. A jury could reasonably find that Charvet was inquiring of plaintiff about a subject that was within the scope of Charvet\u2019s authority to counsel him as plaintiffs freshman advisor and dormitory proctor. A jury could also reasonably infer from the evidence that Charvet began to masturbate in plaintiffs presence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although Charvet did not touch plaintiff at that time or encourage him to participate in sexual activity, a jury could reasonably infer from the evidence that Charvet masturbated in plaintiffs presence in order to induce him to participate in future sexual conduct with Charvet. It follows, when plaintiff is given the benefit of all reasonable inferences that arise in his favor from the summary judgment record, that a jury could find defendant Mt. Angel Abbey vicariously liable for Charvet\u2019s conduct. That is so because the abuse occurred while Charvet was purporting to counsel plaintiff, conduct that the abbey authorized Charvet to perform on its behalf as a faculty advisor and dormitory proctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">The remaining question for purposes of summary judgment and the determinative issue, in my view, is whether plaintiffs claim based on Charvet\u2019s abuse is timely in light of ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The core of my disagreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>with the majority lies in the majority\u2019s mistaken belief that when the legislature enacted ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B) in 1989, it did not intend to encompass within the tolling provisions of the statute conduct like Charvet\u2019s abuse of his relationship with plaintiff. In other words, the majority believes that Charvet\u2019s conduct was not within the contemplation of the legislature as intentional conduct by an adult that constituted \u201ccruelty\u2019 to a child. To begin with, I agree with the majority that the proper focus is on the meaning of the words \u201c[a]ny mental injury to a child which results in observable and substantial impairment of the child\u2019s mental or psychological ability to function caused by cruelty to the child, with due regard to the culture of the child.\u201d However, unlike the majority, I believe that the meaning of that phrase can be discerned from the text and the context of the statute itself, and nothing in the majoritys recitation of legislative history undercuts that meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">The above phrase can be dissected into three discrete requirements: (1) a mental injury to the child; (2) that results in an observable and substantial impairment of the child\u2019s mental or psychological ability to function; and (3) that is caused by \u201ccruelty to the child, with due regard to the culture of the child.\u201d The controversy in this case centers on the word \u201ccruelty.\u201d None of the words in the statutory phrase has a meaning specifically defined by statute. In the absence of any intent by the legislature for the words in the phrase to have special meaning, we give words of common usage in a statute their ordinary dictionary meaning. Here, the word \u201ccruelty\u2019 and its derivatives are words of common usage that have ordinary dictionary meanings that connote inhuman treatment or the causing of pain or distress. <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>546 (unabridged ed 2002). Thus, in a general sense, the word and its derivatives can apply to a number of circumstances and therefore, on its face, \u201ccruelty\u2019 would seem to be susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation. However, where words of common usage are used in a way that has a well-defined legal meaning to the legislature, they will be given that particular meaning. <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

Welfare Comm., </em>3 Or App 27, 31, 470 P2d 167 (1970), <em>cert den, </em>402 US 950 (1971). We relied on <em>Chaffin v. Chaffin, </em>239 Or 374, 397 P2d 771 (1964), which addressed the type of conduct by a father toward his child that could give rise to the child\u2019s right of action against the father. In <em>Chaffin, </em>the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>\u201c[A]n act by a parent, whether described as willful or malicious or wanton, which will pierce the veil of parental immunity, is an act which is done with an intention to injure the child or is of such a cruel nature in and of itself as to evidence not a reasonably normal parental mind, but an evil mind, <em>malo animo.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">239 Or at 387. The court then concluded that allegations of a father\u2019s gross negligence were not sufficient to \u201cbe considered as an act of cruelty in and of itself, disclosing a cruel mind or wicked intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We recognized that <em>Chaffin </em>was decided in a different context but nevertheless concluded that it \u201captly describes the type of conduct necessary to constitute \u2018cruelty\u2019 within ORS 416.030(2)([c]),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> thereby insulating a child from liability for contribution for the support of a parent under the Act.\u201d 3 Or App at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The <em>Chaffin </em>construct, which we imported into <em>former </em>ORS 416.030(2)(c) in <em>Kerr, </em>is also consistent with the definition of the term \u201ccruelty\u201d in <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary. See Wal-Mart Stores, </em>Inc., 341 Or at 398 (referring to <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>to determine the well-established legal meaning of the term \u201cservice\u201d). At the time that each of the above-referenced statutes was enacted, that dictionary defined the term \u201ccruelty\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-6\">\u201c[t]he intentional and malicious infliction of physical suffering upon living creatures, particularly human beings; or, <em>as applied to the latter, the wanton, malicious, and unnecessary infliction of pain upon the body, or the feelings and emotions; abusive treatment; inhumanity; outrage.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-7\"><em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>340 (5th ed 1979) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">Thus, at the time that ORS 12.117 was enacted, the term \u201ccruelty,\u201d at least with respect to conduct toward children, was generally understood by the legislature to encompass two categories of acts. First, the term included acts that were specifically intended to inflict harm on a child by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>actor, i.e., any act intended to harm a child was, by definition, cruel to the child. Second, the term included the performance of acts that by their very nature expressed a wanton disregard for the welfare of the child such that they evidenced an \u201cevil mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">That dualistic understanding of the legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201ccruelty\u2019 is supported by the texts of the various statutes designed to prevent \u201cchild abuse\u201d and the policy underlying those statutes. In particular, that understanding is consistent with the provisions of the child abuse reporting statutes, a portion of which was imported by the legislature into ORS 12.117 in 1989. The legislative policy underlying those abuse reporting statutes was expressed in <em>former </em>ORS 418.745 (1987):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\">\u201cThe Legislative Assembly finds that for the purpose of facilitating the use of protective social services to prevent further abuse, safeguard and enhance the welfare of abused children, and preserve family life when consistent with the protection of the child by stabilizing the family and improving parental capacity, it is necessary and in the public interest to require mandatory reports and investigations of abuse of children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Also, <em>former </em>ORS 418.740(1) (1987) provided that \u201c[a]buse\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-7\">\u201c(a) Any physical injury to a child which has been caused by other than accidental means, including any injury which appears to be at variance with the explanation given of the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-8\">\u201c(b) Any mental injury to a child, which shall include only observable and substantial impairment of the child\u2019s mental or psychological ability to function caused by cruelty to the child, with due regard to the culture of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-9\">\u201c(c) Sexual abuse, including but not limited to rape, sodomy, sexual abuse, sexual penetration with a foreign object and incest, as those acts are defined in ORS chapter 163.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-10\">\u201c(d) Sexual exploitation, including but not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-11\">\u201c(A) Contributing to the sexual delinquency of a minor, as defined in ORS chapter 163, and any other conduct which allows, employs, authorizes, permits, induces or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>encourages a child to engage in the performing for people to observe or the photographing, filming, tape recording or other exhibition which, in whole or in part, depicts sexual conduct or contact, as defined in ORS 167.002 or described in ORS 163.665 and 163.670, or sexual abuse involving a child, but not including any conduct which is part of any investigation conducted pursuant to ORS 418.760 and which is not designed to serve educational or other legitimate purposes; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-4\">\u201c(B) Allowing, permitting, encouraging or hiring a child to engage in prostitution, as defined in ORS chapter 167.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-5\">\u201c(e) Negligent treatment or maltreatment of a child, including but not limited to the failure to provide adequate food, clothing, shelter or medical care. However, any child who is under care or treatment solely by spiritual means pursuant to the religious beliefs or practices of the child or the child\u2019s parent or guardian shall not, for this reason alone, be considered a neglected or maltreated child under this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-6\">\u201c(f) Threatened harm to a child, which means subjecting a child to a substantial risk of harm to the child\u2019s health or welfare.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Thus, <em>former </em>ORS 418.740(1) (1987) protected children from physical and mental injury by requiring the reporting of a variety of acts. Some of those acts pertained to intentional physical injury to children, <em>former </em>ORS 418.740(l)(a); some involved mental injury to children, <em>former </em>ORS 418.740(l)(b); some were crimes that presumptively caused physical or mental injury to children, <em>former </em>ORS 418.740(l)(c) and (d); and some involved negligence, maltreatment, and even threatened harm to children, <em>former </em>ORS 418.740(l)(e) and (f). In light of the broad scope of the child abuse reporting statutes \u2014 which included even acts of negligence that put children at risk \u2014 the legislature certainly would have intended to include, within the definition of \u201ccruelty,\u201d acts that were either specifically intended to inflict harm on a child or acts that by their very nature were of such wanton disregard for the welfare of a child that they evidenced an evil intent on the part of the actor. It would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>nonsensical to require mandatory abuse reporting of negligent acts that <em>could </em>harm a child while, at the same time, not requiring the reporting of a mental injury that <em>has actually occurred </em>as the result of conduct intended to inflict that injury or conduct that evidenced a wanton disregard for the child\u2019s welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">In sum, to protect children from mental injuries, the legislature intended the word \u201ccruelty\u201d in <em>former </em>ORS 418.740(l)(b) to have a well-defined legal meaning \u2014 that is, to describe acts that are intended to inflict mental injury on a child as well as acts that, by their very nature, manifest a wanton disregard for the welfare of the child and an evil intent. When the legislature adopted the language of <em>former </em>ORS 418.740(l)(b) in ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B) as a basis for tolling the running of the statute of limitations on claims for civil damages arising out of child abuse, the legislature manifested an intent to similarly extend the time for bringing a claim for mental injuries that were either intentionally inflicted or were inflicted by actions that, by their very nature, qualified under the second category of \u201ccruelty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The question, therefore, is whether Charvet\u2019s masturbation in front of a 14-year-old child, after compelling the child to be in his presence for the ostensible purpose of imparting sex education, is the kind of act that falls within the second category of \u201ccruelty\u201d as contemplated by the legislature through its enactment of ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B). Said another way, is Charvet\u2019s conduct of such a nature that it evidences a wanton disregard for the welfare of a child and an \u201cevil mind\u201d? As a matter of common sense, I would conclude that masturbating in front of a child is conduct that the legislature would have regarded as evidencing a wanton disregard for the welfare of the child and an \u201cevil mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">There was, however, another statute in effect at the time that the legislature enacted ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B) that further informs the issue. ORS 163.575(1) (1987) provided that \u201c[a] person commits the crime of endangering the welfare of a minor if the person knowingly: (a) [finduces, causes or permits an unmarried person under 18 years of age to witness an act of sexual conduct * * * as defined by ORS 167.060[.]\u201d ORS 167.060 (1987) defined \u201csexual conduct\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>include \u201chuman masturbation.\u201d In other words, had Charvet caused plaintiff to witness him masturbating in 1989, when the legislature enacted ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B), that conduct would have constituted the crime of endangering the welfare of a minor.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">Given the interrelated purposes of the various statutes protecting children from abuse, it is apparent that the legislature would have intended \u201ccruelty\u201d to include at least some of those acts that it made crimes under ORS 163.575(1) (1987). Although not all acts that endanger a child necessarily constitute acts of \u201ccruelty,\u201d the common legislative policy underlying the various statutory schemes suggests that the legislature, by making such conduct a crime, would also have intended masturbating in front of a child to constitute \u201ccruelty\u201d for purposes of the child abuse reporting statutes and the statute of limitations in ORS 12.117.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Also, I have no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>doubt that, with respect to masturbation in front of a child, the legislature also would have intended mandatory abuse reporters to report that conduct in the event that a mental injury resulted from it. Because ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B) is similarly intended to protect children from abuse, and because the statute of limitations is tolled under ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B) for the same conduct that would be reported by mandatory abuse reporters in the case of mental injuries, I conclude that Charvet\u2019s conduct constitutes an act of \u201ccruelty\u201d under ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B). It follows that the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment on the basis of ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B) and that plaintiff should have the opportunity to have a jury decide whether the statute tolls his claims against Charvet and Mt. Angel Abbey.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-5\"> Defendants are entitled to summary judgment only if no genuine issue of material fact exists when the record is viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff and when no objectively reasonable juror could return a verdict for him.

Most, if not all, of the acts enumerated are acts that the legislature apparently deemed to be in such wanton disregard of the welfare of children that they evidenced an evil intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b757-6\"> The majority seizes on the fact that some of the acts in ORS 163.575(1) (1987) do not by their nature constitute \u201ccruelty to a child\u201d and then relies on <em>former </em>ORS 419.476(l)(e) (1987), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1993, ch 33, \u00a7 373, which, in its view, \u201ccontroverts the inference that the dissent draws from ORS 163.575U\u201d 218 Or App at 674-75 n 7. <em>Former </em>ORS 419.476(l)(c) (1987) provided that a child was within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court if the child\u2019s \u201cbehavior, condition or circumstances are such as to endanger the welfare of the person or the welfare of others [.] \u201d The majority therefore concludes that, \u201c[pjroperly interpreted, that statute demonstrates that the legislature regarded child endangerment and cruelty to a child as two separate concepts.\u201d 218 Or App at 674-75 n 7. The majority misses the point of the comparison of the provisions of ORS 12.117(2)(a)(B) with the provisions of <em>former </em>ORS 418.740(l)(b) (1987), <em>former </em>ORS 416.030(2)(c) (1987), <em>former </em>ORS 419.523(2)(c) (1987), <em>former </em>ORS 419.476(l)(e) (1987), and ORS 163.575(1) (1987). I do not rely on any of those statutes to directly equate the concepts of cruelty to a child and endangering a child. I recognize that it does not necessarily follow from the fact that conduct endangers a child that it also constitutes \u201ccruel\u201d conduct. But on the other hand, conduct could both be \u201ccruel\u201d and endanger the welfare of the child. Under <em>former </em>ORS 419.476 (1987), a child could have been within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court because the child\u2019s circumstances endangered the child\u2019s welfare or because the child had been subjected to cruelty, or for some other reason, and the child\u2019s circumstances could satisfy more than one of those bases for jurisdiction. Thus, it does not logically follow from the fact that the legislature intended that there be multiple grounds for juvenile court jurisdiction, that it also did not have a well-defined understanding of what conduct constituted \u201ccruelty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>children,\u201d or that Charvet\u2019s conduct, a crime under an existing statute, would not fall within the parameters of the legislature\u2019s contemplation regarding the general understanding of the meaning of that phrase. In sum, the language in <em>former </em>ORS 419.476(l)(c) (1987) does not \u201ccontrovert\u201d any inference arising from all of the statutes existing in 1989 that pertained to cruelty to a child; rather, it is additional support for the understanding advanced above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b758-10\"> I do not understand Mt.
