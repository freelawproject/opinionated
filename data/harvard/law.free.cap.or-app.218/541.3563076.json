J.</author>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">Claimant injured his foot when, during an unpaid lunch break, he assisted a coworker in jostling a vending machine to dislodge a candy bar that had been purchased by another person. Employer denied claimant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim for the foot injury on the ground that the injury arose from a noncompensable social activity and, in any event, did not arise out of or in the scope of employment. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Board (board) set aside the denial and ordered employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation coverage provider, Washington Group International (WGI), to provide coverage for the injury. WGI seeks review of the board\u2019s order. We agree with WGI that the board erred in its analysis of whether the injury arose from a noncompensable social activity, and therefore reverse and remand for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed. Claimant worked in a high security area of the Umatilla Army Depot as a senior maintenance mechanic. Although claimant is not required by employer to stay on the work site during his breaks, because of the distance from the work site to outside eating choices, claimant and his coworkers generally took their lunch breaks as a group in one of the lunch rooms. The lunch rooms contained vending machines that provided candy and soda. The machines were serviced by their vendors, not employer. Claimant had no responsibility to repair them.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Claimant had just completed a 30-minute unpaid lunch break in one of employer\u2019s lunch rooms when a coworker, Nick, asked claimant if he could help dislodge a candy bar from one of the vending machines. Nick had been attempting to help another person \u2014 who may or may not have been an employee \u2014 dislodge the candy bar, but to no avail. Claimant attempted to help by pushing and pulling the machine. When that did not work, claimant attempted to rock the machine back and forth on its legs. When he did that, he heard a sound come from his foot; he thought he had broken a shoelace. His foot, however, \u201cdidn\u2019t work properly.\u201d He went to a hospital, where he was diagnosed as having ruptured an Achilles tendon.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Claimant sought workers\u2019 compensation benefits for the injury, but WGI denied the claim, contending that, because the injury occurred during a social activity, it was excluded from coverage under ORS 656.005(7)(b)(B), which excludes from coverage any \u201cinjury incurred while engaging in * * * any recreational or social activities primarily for the worker\u2019s personal pleasure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Claimant requested a hearing. The administrative law judge (ALJ) determined that the injury was compensable and overturned the denial. The ALJ rejected WGI\u2019s contention that claimant was injured as a result of a recreational or social activity. His analysis, in full, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">\u201cI find that claimant\u2019s activity of shaking the vending machine to assist his coworkers was not a \u2018recreational or social activity primarily for [claimant\u2019s] personal pleasure.\u2019 ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B). At the time of injury, claimant was not engaging in a recreational or social activity of some sort- \u2014 he was not even attempting to procure the candy out of the machine for himself, but rather, helping a coworker who was in turn helping another worker. He was not, for example, sharpening his own personal knives at work like the claimant in <em>Ken Griffin, </em>57 Van Natta 1365 (2005), or arm wrestling another coworker to prepare for arm wrestling competitions as in <em>Geoff Saunders, </em>57 Van Natta 796 (2005). He was not looking to gain personally from his actions; <em>e.g., </em>by obtaining a set of sharpened knives, or sharpening his arm wrestling skills. In other words, there was no personal, recreational or social value to claimant in helping the other workers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">\u201cSuch an activity (shaking the vending machine) simply does not fit within the plain meaning of \u2018recreational or social activity.\u2019 ORS 656.005(7)(b)(B). Therefore, I find that the employer\u2019s affirmative defense under that statute does not apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The ALJ went on to conclude that claimant\u2019s injury arose out of and in the course of his employment. The board adopted the ALJ\u2019s opinion and order, and affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">On review of the board\u2019s order, WGl argues that the board erred both in rejecting its affirmative defense that claimant was injured while engaging in a recreational or social activity and in concluding that claimant\u2019s injury arose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>out of and in the course of employment. Because we conclude that WGI is correct as to its first contention, we need not address its second.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">ORS 656.005(7)(a) provides that a \u201ccompensable injury\u201d is one \u201carising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d The statute then provides an exception to that definition: \u201c \u2018Compensable injury\u2019 does not include * * * [i]njury incurred while engaging in or performing * * * any recreational or social activities primarily for the worker\u2019s personal pleasure.\u201d ORS 656.005(7)(b)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">In <em>Roberts v. SAIF, </em>341 Or 48, 52, 136 P3d 1105 (2006), the Supreme Court explained that the exception for injuries incurred while engaging in or performing any \u201crecreational or social activities primarily for the worker\u2019s personal pleasure\u201d requires a three-step analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">\u201cTextually, ORS 656.005(7)(b)(B) raises three questions. The first is whether the worker was engaged in or performing a \u2018recreational or social activit[y].\u2019 The second is whether the worker incurred the injury \u2018while engaging in or performing, or as the result of engaging in or performing,\u2019 that activity. The final question is whether the worker engaged in or performed the activity \u2018primarily for the worker\u2019s personal pleasure.\u2019 If the answer to all those questions is \u2018yes,\u2019 then the worker cannot recover.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">In that case, the claimant, a car salesman, sustained an injury when he rode a coworker\u2019s motorcycle in the employer\u2019s lot while waiting for customers. The board had concluded that the claimant had been injured while engaging in a recreational activity. Affirming the board\u2019s order, the court explained that, although the claimant was on the job at the time of the injury, the \u201cactivity\u201d in which the claimant was engaged was riding a motorcycle, and that activity was recreational. 341 Or at 52. The court farther reasoned that, in determining whether the claimant was engaged in that activity \u201cprimarily for the worker\u2019s personal pleasure,\u201d the question was whether the worker was \u201cengaged in the activity primarily for the worker\u2019s personal pleasure or for work-related reasons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court turned to the legislative history of ORS 656.005(7)(b)(B) for confirmation of that analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>\u201c[T]he legislature intended that the board should determine both the degree to which a recreational or social activity serves the employer\u2019s work-related interests and the degree to which the worker engaged in the activity for the worker\u2019s personal pleasure. Only if the worker\u2019s personal pleasure was the fundamental or principal reason, in relation to work-related reasons, for engaging in the activity will the resulting injury be noncompensable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><em>Roberts, </em>341 Or at 56. The court recognized that the determination whether the activity was \u201cprimarily for the worker\u2019s personal pleasure\u201d necessitates asking whether there was any work-related reason for the activity. If there was no work-related reason for the activity, necessarily, the activity was personal. The court then concluded that there was substantial evidence in support of the board\u2019s findings that there was no work-related reason for the claimant to be riding a motorcycle at the time of the accident and that the claimant rode the motorcycle for his personal pleasure. <em>Id. </em>Having determined that the board\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence, the court held that the board did not err in concluding that the claimant engaged in the recreational activity primarily for his personal pleasure. <em>Id. </em>at 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">In this case, the first question is whether claimant was engaged in a \u201crecreational or social activity.\u201d That question entails both a legal issue \u2014 pertaining to the meaning of the statutory words \u201crecreational or social activity\u201d \u2014 and a factual one \u2014 pertaining to the nature of claimant\u2019s activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">We addressed the legal issue of the meaning of the statute in Liberty <em>Northwest Ins. Corp. v. Nichols, </em>186 Or App 664, 64 P3d 1152 (2003). In that case, the claimant broke a tooth while chewing on a hard candy during work. The employer rejected the claimant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim for the injury on the ground that it occurred while the claimant was engaged in a recreational or social activity. The board rejected that contention and concluded that the injury arose out of and in the course of employment. We affirmed. We began with the issue whether the claimant was engaged in a \u201crecreational or social activity\u201d within the meaning of ORS 656.005(7)(b)(B). We noted the ordinary meanings of the terms, in particular, that \u201csocial\u201d means \u201c \u2018marked by or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>passed in pleasant companionship with one\u2019s friends or associates * * * taken, enjoyed, or engaged in with friends or for the sake of companionship.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nichols, </em>186 Or App at 668 (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>2161 (unabridged ed 1993)). Turning to the facts of that case, we then observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-4\">\u201c[c]laimant\u2019s injury did not occur \u2018after toil,\u2019 and nothing in the record indicates that it was \u2018marked by pleasant companionship\u2019 or \u2018for the sake of companionship.\u2019 Rather, the injury occurred as a result of an activity claimant engaged in <em>while working. </em>He was not traveling to or from work, on a break, or at lunch.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-5\"><em>Nichols, </em>186 Or App at 668 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">In this case, it is not clear that the board considered at all whether claimant\u2019s injury occurred while engaged in a \u201csocial\u201d as opposed to a \u201crecreational\u201d activity. The board concluded that claimant was not engaged in either activity, but its explanation was based solely on the fact that claimant was \u201cnot looking to gain personally from his actions.\u201d The board did not explain, and we do not understand, why the fact that claimant did not stand to personally gain from the activity necessarily means that it was not a \u201csocial\u201d activity within the meaning of the statute. To the contrary \u2014 and in contrast to the facts in <em>Nichols </em>\u2014 claimant\u2019s injury in this case did occur \u201cafter toil,\u201d arguably for the sake of his companions, and while he was on break and not while working. Additionally, the board did not refer to any work-related reason for the activity. At the least, it is clear that the board did not apply the correct legal standard in determining that claimant was not engaged in a \u201crecreational or social activity\u201d at the time of his injury. Consequently, we must reverse and remand for reconsideration. On remand, the board should determine whether, in the light of our construction of the statute in <em>Nichols, </em>claimant\u2019s activity was \u201crecreational\u201d or \u201csocial.\u201d If the board concludes that the activity was either, then it should proceed with the balance of the three-step analysis that <em>Roberts </em>requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Reversed and remanded for reconsideration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
