J.</author>\n<p id=\"b661-3\">In this criminal case, defendant was convicted of first-degree unlawful sexual penetration and first-degree sexual abuse. He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s admission of several out-of-court statements made by the alleged victim, A. We review for errors of law, <em>State v. Mack, </em>337 Or 586, 590, 101 P3d 349 (2004), and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">Defendant lived with his girlfriend (A\u2019s mother), and their two children, two-year-old M and three-year-old A. At trial, A\u2019s mother testified that defendant was a doting father and that he and A generally got along well. She also testified that, for some months before the incident that gave rise to this case, A had been exhibiting \u201cbad behavior\u201d and had become difficult to deal with.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">On a Friday night in September 2003, A\u2019s mother arrived home between 10:30 and 11:00 p.m.; defendant had been home alone with the children. As A\u2019s mother entered the house, she saw a tube of \u201cgeneric KY jelly\u201d on the clothes dryer. On Monday morning, when A\u2019s mother was getting A dressed, she noticed that her \u201cprivate areas were red and irritated and swollen.\u201d A\u2019s mother said, \u201cIt looks like you\u2019ve got an owie in your privates. Let\u2019s put some cream on it.\u201d A responded, \u201cDaddy gave me an owie in my privates.\u201d When A\u2019s mother asked what she meant, A responded, \u201cDaddy took his finger and he rubbed me right here,\u201d and she pulled back her labia and rubbed her clitoral area. A\u2019s mother questioned A further, and A reported that defendant was naked when he had touched her. Although A\u2019s mother had noticed some vaginal redness or irritation on A several times over the preceding several months, it was not as severe as it was that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The next morning, as they were getting ready to go, A told her mother, \u201cDaddy put a new hole in my body.\u201d That evening, A\u2019s mother asked defendant if he could explain A\u2019s statements; he responded that he did not know what she was talking about. The following morning, A began talking again to her mother about the \u201cowie\u201d and about, as the mother testified, defendant \u201cputting a hole in her body and hurting her with his fingernail. She got more detailed about how that\u2014 what the owie was where his fingernail was poking and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>hurt her when he made the new hole in her body * * A\u2019s mother decided to take A to A\u2019s regular doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">The next day, after talking on the telephone to an on-call doctor at A\u2019s doctor\u2019s office (A\u2019s regular doctor was out of the office) A\u2019s mother believed that \u201csomething ha[d] happened that was more than just a misunderstanding.\u201d A\u2019s mother made an appointment with A\u2019s regular doctor for the following Monday, the first day that the doctor would be back in the office. A continued to bring the incident up to her mother each day. A\u2019s mother continued to question defendant about A\u2019s statements, but his sole explanation was that she must have been referring to a time when they were rolling around on the floor together, playing. When A\u2019s mother told defendant that she was going to take A to the doctor, he became angry and threatened to leave her.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">On the following Monday, A\u2019s mother took A to work with her until her afternoon doctor\u2019s appointment. At the mother\u2019s office, one of the mother\u2019s coworkers asked A if she was going to the doctor because she was sick. A replied, \u201cNo, my daddy gave me a hole in my body,\u201d and lifted her skirt, pointing.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">That afternoon, when A\u2019s doctor examined her, the doctor noted irritation on A\u2019s labia. The doctor asked A if anyone had touched her there and A responded that \u201cher daddy put a hole in\u201d her private area. A also told the doctor that defendant had touched her with his finger. Later, after A\u2019s doctor had finished examining her, the doctor contacted CARES Northwest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The doctor also made a report to the child abuse hotline and filed a report with the Department of Human Services. A copy of the latter report was forwarded to the Forest Grove Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">CARES is a regional child abuse assessment center for the northern region of the state. When a child arrives at CARES, she is met by an interviewer and an examiner. After staff explain to the child and the parent or guardian how the CARES process works, a medical and social history is gathered from the parent or guardian. The child is then examined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>by a physician, outside the parent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s presence. For younger children, no further interview takes place, because of their shortened attention span. Older children undergo a videotaped interview. The child then is escorted back to the waiting room, and the parent or guardian is taken into the interview room where he or she is debriefed. Based on the examination, the CARES physician makes a diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">Forest Grove Police Detective Herb described the function of CARES. When an alleged child abuse victim is under the age of 13 or 14, the policy of the Forest Grove Police Department is to arrange a CARES interview of the child. The CARES interview \u201cserves as a substitute for what previously was a police function; that is, interviewing the victim [.]\u201d CARES is \u201cone component\u201d of the investigatory team. It performs an investigatory function for the police and the police \u201cuse the information obtained during that CARES appointment for [their] job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The day after A was examined by her regular doctor, her mother received a telephone call from Detective Foster of the Forest Grove Police Department asking her to schedule an appointment with CARES. They went to CARES that day. CARES physician Dr. Ritzen examined A. Ritzen noted labial irritation and a normal hymen. A told Ritzen that defendant \u201cput a hole in my butt, too,\u201d pointing to her genital area. When Ritzen asked A if anyone else had touched her \u201cfront private area,\u201d A responded that defendant had. That A\u2019s disclosures were spontaneous indicated to Ritzen that \u201c[i]t\u2019s something that the child is thinking about and is concerned about.\u201d When Ritzen asked A if she could point to where on her body she had been touched, Ritzen testified that A \u201cpulled up both labia majora with one hand to reveal her vaginal opening, gesturing towards the vaginal opening with the other hand and said, \u2018There.\u2019 \u201d Ritzen testified that it is very uncommon for a child to illustrate her statement the way A did; in fact, Ritzen testified that she had never seen a child do that before. A told Ritzen that the touching had occurred only once and that her mom had been home when it happened. A told Ritzen that defendant was naked when the touching happened. A also told Ritzen that defendant had poked her eyes. She stated that defendant hurts her with his fingernails <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>and, when Ritzen asked where on her body that happened, A pointed to her genitals. Ultimately, Ritzen testified that the history and the day\u2019s evaluation \u201cwere highly concerning for sexual abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">During A\u2019s examination, following normal protocol, the audio portion was picked up by a microphone and piped into a separate room, where a Department of Human Services caseworker, Forest Grove Police Detective Herb, and a CARES staff interviewer were listening. A was told that the people were listening. Although the police officer who is monitoring the examination may suggest further questions for the CARES physician to ask the alleged victim, those questions will be asked only if they are medically relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">At some point in the period following A\u2019s initial report to her mother, A told her grandmother that there had been three incidents of abuse. On a number of occasions in the months after September, A told her daycare provider, \u201cDaddy put a hole in my body,\u201d and, \u201cDaddy was naughty for touching my privates and he\u2019s in timeout.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Following A\u2019s examination at CARES, her mother\u2014 at the recommendation of the CARES staff \u2014 arranged for A to see a therapist. A first saw her therapist in November 2003. In the third session, she told the therapist, \u201cDaddy poked a hole in me.\u201d When the therapist asked her where, A replied, \u201cIn my private parts. He hurt my private parts.\u201d A told the therapist that defendant had hurt her more than once. In her fifth weekly session with the therapist, A disclosed that defendant had abused her in his workshop. A sometimes would cover her genital area when disclosing abuse. A never recanted her statements of abuse; she always was \u201cvery certain and very clear.\u201d The therapist noted that A\u2019s behavior was \u201cpretty typical\u201d of children who had been sexually abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Following the CARES evaluation, police arrested defendant. In response to questioning, defendant stated that he might have accidentally touched A inappropriately when they were playing in the living room and he was tickling her. Defendant was charged with first-degree unlawful sexual penetration and first-degree sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Pretrial, the parties litigated the admissibility of A\u2019s out-of-court statements. Following a competency hearing, the trial court determined that A was not competent to testify; that ruling is not challenged on appeal. Following that reding, defendant argued that the statements were inadmissible because, among other reasons, their admission would violate his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him. The trial court ruled that the statements were admissible and, as set forth above, they were admitted at trial. The jury convicted defendant of both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">On appeal, defendant argues that A\u2019s out-of-court statements to CARES physician Ritzen were \u201ctestimonial\u201d as that term was used by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 US 36, 124 S Ct 1354, 158 L Ed 2d 177 (2004), and that their admission (through Ritzen\u2019s tes timony) therefore violated his right under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution to confront witnesses against him. He also argues, with less force, that A\u2019s statements to the other witnesses \u2014 her mother, her grandmother, the therapist, the coworker, and the childcare provider \u2014 also were testimonial and therefore should have been excluded. The state essentially concedes that the trial court erroneously admitted A\u2019s statements to Ritzen, but argues that the error was harmless. For the reasons explained below, we conclude that the trial court erred in allowing Ritzen to testify about A\u2019s out-of-court statements. We further conclude that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">In <em>Mack, </em>after examining the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Crawford, </em>the Oregon Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">\u201cUnder <em>Crawford, </em>the initial, and often dispositive, question is whether an out-of-court statement is \u2018testimonial.\u2019 If it is, the statement cannot be admitted in a criminal case unless (1) the defendant had or has the opportunity to cross-examine the declarant, (2) the statement is not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted, or (3) the statement comes within a small class of exceptions to the <em>Crawford </em>rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">337 Or at 592 (footnotes omitted). None of the three exceptions noted by the <em>Mack </em>court applies in this case. Here, then, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>the dispositive question on the merits is whether A\u2019s statements to Ritzen were \u201ctestimonial.\u201d For the reasons explained in <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. S. P., </em>218 Or App 131, 178 P3d 318 (2008), and <em>State v. Pitt, </em>209 Or App 270, 147 P3d 940 (2006), <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>212 Or App 523, 159 P3d 329 (2007), we conclude that they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">In <em>Pitt, </em>the alleged victim of sexual abuse was interviewed first by a physician at the Lighthouse, a \u201cchild abuse assessment center.\u201d She later made statements to a clinical psychologist. Finally, she took part in a videotaped interview at the Lane County Child Advocacy Center. 209 Or App at 272-73. After the trial court found the alleged victim to be unavailable, the state introduced \u2014 over the defendant\u2019s hearsay objection \u2014 the out-of-court statements she made to the various adults.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">On appeal, the defendant in <em>Pitt </em>argued that the trial court committed plain error under <em>Crawford </em>in admitting the alleged victim\u2019s hearsay statements. We agreed that the trial court had committed plain error and we exercised our discretion to address the defendant\u2019s claim. <em>Id. </em>at 276. Relying on <em>Crawford, Mack, </em>and the consolidated cases reported as <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>54-7 US 813, 126 S Ct 2266, 165 L Ed 2d 244 (2006) <em>(Davis /Hammon), </em>we concluded that the hearsay statements were \u201ctestimonial,\u201d and therefore inadmissible in light of the alleged victim\u2019s unavailability. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">\u201c[W]e readily conclude that the children\u2019s interview [s] * * * at the Lane County Child Advocacy Center were \u2018testimonial\u2019 under <em>Mack </em>and <em>Davis. </em>The circumstances of the interview do not differ in a meaningful way from those in <em>Mack. </em>In this case, as in that one, the interviewer interviewed and elicited statements from a young child \u2018so that police officers could videotape them for use in a criminal proceeding.\u2019 <em>Mack, </em>337 Or at 593. Although, as in <em>Mack, </em>the interviews were not conducted by a police officer, they were conducted for the express purpose of furthering a police investigation, with a police officer recording them and with the interviewer explicitly attempting to solicit information from the children that would be useful for defendant\u2019s prosecution. [The center\u2019s director] testified that the \u2018whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>idea\u2019 of the operation is that parents know that their children are interviewed on tape so that their statements can be used in the course of a prosecution. Under <em>Mack, </em>therefore, [the director] was acting as an \u2018agent\u2019 for the police. 337 Or at 594.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-5\"><em>Pitt, </em>209 Or App at 278-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Similarly, in <em>S. P., </em>the three-year-old. alleged victim made statements during an interview with CARES staff about alleged abuse that later were admitted in a juvenile delinquency proceeding, over the youth\u2019s <em>Crawford </em>objection. On appeal, the youth renewed his <em>Crawford </em>argument, and we agreed with it. After discussing <em>Crawford, Davis I Hammon, Mack, </em>and <em>Pitt </em>in some detail, we concluded that the out-of-court statements made during the CARES interview were testimonial and therefore inadmissible. 218 Or App at 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Our conclusion in <em>S. P. </em>was based on the nature of the CARES program, as substantiated in that record. After describing the CARES program in detail, 218 Or App at 149-52, we summarized the role of the program as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">\u201cThe record in this case pertaining to CARES generally, and this evaluation particularly, compels two conclusions. First, the CARES interview process serves multiple concurrent purposes. To be sure, one of those purposes is to obtain an accurate diagnosis of whether a child has, in fact, been sexually abused \u2014 which, in turn, will promote effective medical and psychological treatment (albeit not by CARES itself). But CARES also functions as an informational clearinghouse for police and child welfare authorities, so that they can deal effectively with perpetrators of child sex abuse. As the juvenile court recognized, the CARES process is designed to \u2018minimize the likelihood of contamination\u2019 of a child\u2019s statements from suggestive questioning techniques or multiple interviews by different questioners\u2014 and, thus, to provide not only treatment providers but also law enforcement authorities with the cleanest, most credible evidence of abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">* <em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-10\">\u201cThe second conclusion that this record compels is that, contrary to the state\u2019s contention, the involvement of law enforcement in the CARES process is hardly \u2018minimal.\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Rather, it is pervasive. It is true \u2014 as the state emphasizes \u2014 that there is no evidence that police officers or prosecutors participated in the development of the CARES protocol and that here [the police officer] had no visible presence during the interview and merely observed passively. But it is also true that not only did [the police officer] observe the entire interview (as did the officer in <em>Pitt), </em>but he also was present during the evaluation team\u2019s consultation and immediately thereafter met with [the alleged victim\u2019s] mother in the CARES facility\u2019s interview room to discuss the course of the prosecution. The close connection between CARES and law enforcement authorities is further corroborated by (1) CARES\u2019 routine practice of providing police agencies with complete copies of its evaluation reports (while providing only abridged \u2018summaries\u2019 to parents) and (2) CARES\u2019 \u2018treatment recommendation\u2019 urging \u2018further investigation by DHS and law enforcement into these allegations of abuse.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">218 Or App at 152-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Our decisions in <em>Pitt </em>and <em>S. P. </em>make it clear that the out-of-court statements in this case were testimonial and that their admission violated defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him. The record in this case, like the record in <em>S. P., </em>demonstrates that A\u2019s statements to Ritzen were testimonial. As in <em>S. P., </em>the statements were made to a CARES evaluator, after a police agency referred A to CARES. The CARES clinic is designed so that the examinations and interviews can be monitored; in this case Detective Herb was in a separate room with headphones that allowed him to listen to A\u2019s examination. The record in this case, like the record in <em>S. </em>P., indicates that CARES works closely with law enforcement agencies in gathering evidence of child sexual abuse. As <em>in Mack, </em>\u201c[t]here can be little doubt that, if the police officers had conducted these interviews with [A], the resulting statements would be testimonial.\u201d 337 Or at 593. In short, as in <em>S. P., </em>A\u2019s statements to the CARES physician were testimonial. Because defendant did not have an opportunity to cross-examine A, it follows that admission of her out-of-court statements was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">As noted, the state recognizes the weakness in its position that the trial did not err in admitting A\u2019s statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>to CARES physician Ritzen. But the state asserts that the error in admitting the out-of-court statements was harmless:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-4\">\u201cBecause the CARES statements were merely cumulative of other properly admitted <em>evidence </em>\u2014 viz., the numerous other out-of-court statements by A that established the very same abuse that A talked about in the CARES interview\u2014 even assuming the CARES statements were erroneously admitted, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Defendant, not surprisingly, disagrees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-6\">\u201cGiven the evidence in this case, it cannot be said that [A]\u2019s statements to the CARES doctor did not contribute to the verdict against defendant. Indeed, it is likely that the jury relied on [A]\u2019s statements to the CARES doctor because of (1) their details, (2) the fact that they were made to a neutral witness with professional training and experience in questioning children about sexual abuse, (3) the fact that they were made in a formal setting and witnessed by multiple persons, including a police officer, and (4) the fact that the CARES doctor relied on them to make her diagnosis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Whether a federal constitutional error is harmless is a question of federal law. <em>State v. Cook, </em>340 Or 530, 544, 135 P3d 260 (2006) (citing <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 US 18, 24, 87 S Ct 824, 17 L Ed 2d 705 (1967)). \u201cSuch a deprivation of a federal constitutional right is harmless only when the reviewing court, in looking at the record as a whole, can say that the error, beyond a reasonable doubt, has not contributed to the determination of guilt. <em>Chapman, </em>386 US at 24; <em>see also State v. Ennis, </em>212 Or App 240, 158 P3d 510 (2007) (applying same standard).\u201d <em>Pitt, </em>212 Or App at 527. In reviewing the whole record to determine whether an error was harmless, the court should consider \u201cthe importance of the [improperly admitted] testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, * * * and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Cook, </em>340 Or at 544 (quoting <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 US 673, 684, 106 S Ct 1431, 89 L Ed 2d 674 (1986) (brackets and ellipsis in <em>Cook)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Applying that standard, we agree with defendant that the error in admitting A\u2019s statements was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Cf. State v. Shelton, </em>218 Or App 652, 658-60,180 P3d 155 (2008) (concluding that the medical assistant\u2019s testimony about a spontaneous and nonspecific statement by the victim \u2014 whether testimonial or not \u2014 was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt because it was admitted only to corroborate the defendant\u2019s confession). Initially, for purposes of our harmless error analysis, we assume without deciding that the trial court correctly admitted A\u2019s out-of-court statements to her mother, her grandmother, her therapist, her childcare provider, and her mother\u2019s coworker. But even with that assumption, for the reasons explained below, we conclude that the state did not meet its burden of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that the trial court\u2019s error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Although the state is correct in a sense that the statements A made to Ritzen and that were admitted through the latter\u2019s testimony were \u201cmerely cumulative\u201d of other out-of-court statements that A made, the inquiry does not end there. To be sure, a number of other witnesses testified about A\u2019s statements that defendant had \u201cput a hole in her.\u201d And, although it is true that, when several witnesses testify to the same effect, the erroneous admission of one witness\u2019s testimony often will be harmless, the role and status of each witness also is relevant to the harmless error determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Here, both Ritzen\u2019s status as a neutral professional \u2014 she testified that she specializes in forensic pediatrics \u2014 and certain details of A\u2019s statements to Ritzen mean that her repetition of A\u2019s statements to the jury likely had a qualitatively different effect on their verdict than did the recounting of A\u2019s statements by other witnesses. Thus, even if A\u2019s statements to Ritzen had been identical to A\u2019s statements to the other witnesses \u2014 which they arguably were not \u2014 Ritzen\u2019s unique training and experience in child abuse assessment would likely have given the statements greater weight in the jury\u2019s eyes. As defendant argues, \u201cGiven the CARES doctor\u2019s recognized expertise, it is likely that the jury relied on the doctor\u2019s testimony to conclude that [A] actually made the statements the doctor said she made and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>doctor did not ask leading questions or otherwise suggest or encourage [A\u2019s] statements.\u201d Moreover, the jurors likely gave Ritzen\u2019s testimony regarding A\u2019s statements greater weight because they knew that Ritzen used the statements to support her diagnosis of sexual abuse. <em>Cf. State v. Keller, </em>315 Or 273, 286, 844 P2d 195 (1993) (Erroneous admission of CARES physician\u2019s comment on alleged victim\u2019s credibility not harmless, as witness was \u201cmedical doctor with extensive professional experience in the area of child sexual abuse, and she testified in an authoritative and detailed manner about that subject.\u201d); <em>State v.
