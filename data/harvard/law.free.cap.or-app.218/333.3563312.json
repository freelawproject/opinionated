J.</author>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Defendant was convicted of attempted delivery of a Schedule II controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a school, ORS 161.405 and <em>former </em>ORS 475.999 (2003), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 475.904 (2005); possession of a Schedule II controlled substance, <em>former </em>ORS 475.992 (2003), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 475.840 (2005); felon in possession of a firearm, ORS 166.270; and unlawful possession of a firearm, ORS 166.250. On appeal, defendant asserts two assignments of error. First, defendant contends that the trial court erred in allowing the testimony of an officer whose identity had not been disclosed on the state\u2019s witness list. We reject that argument without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In a supplemental assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred when it admitted into evidence a laboratory report containing an analysis of a controlled substance without requiring the state to call as a witness the person who prepared the report. <em>See State v. Birchfield, </em>342 Or 624, 631-32, 157 P3d 216 (2007) (the requirement that a criminal defendant subpoena the criminalist who prepared a laboratory report, pursuant to ORS 475.235, violates the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution). Defendant does not argue that he preserved that claim of error as required by ORAP 5.45(1); rather, he requests that we review the error as error apparent on the face of the record. For the reasons stated in <em>State v. Marroquin, </em>215 Or App 330, 335-36,168 P3d 1246 (2007), we agree that admission of the laboratory report violated defendant\u2019s confrontation rights under the state constitution and constitutes error apparent on the face of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The question, then, is whether this is a case in which we should exercise our discretion to correct the error. <em>See Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382 n 6, 823 P2d 956 (1991) (listing factors that bear on the court\u2019s exercise of discretion to correct plain error); <em>see also State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 512-14, 173 P3d 813 (2007) (applying <em>Ailes </em>factors in determining whether this court erred in exercising its discretion to correct plain error). For the reasons discussed below, we exercise our discretion to correct the error as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>conviction for attempted delivery of a controlled substance, but not as to the conviction for possession of a controlled substance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Although defendant concedes that he did not preserve the precise constitutional issue of confrontation that he asserts on appeal, he did raise a closely related objection to the admission of the laboratory report. Defendant argued to the trial court that it should not admit the report because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">\u201cth[e] report is entirely hearsay evidence, regardless of whether or not [the officer who testified] had, in fact, received the report. What the report contains, there are statements that are made out of court that are offered as in-court statements and offered as evidence to the jury. And so I\u2019d offer that this is hearsay evidence and object to the introduction of the lab report.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The court, in response, \u201coverrule [d] the objection per statute. It\u2019s authorized. So it will be admitted.\u201d Thus, although defendant did not direct the trial court to the state or federal constitution in support of his objection, the error in admitting the report was drawn to the court\u2019s attention and a related issue \u2014 the fact that the report contained out-of-court statements that were being used against him \u2014 was presented to the trial court. <em>SeeAiles, </em>312 Or at 382 n 6 (listing, as one factor to consider in deciding whether to exercise the court\u2019s discretion, how the error came to the court\u2019s attention). That factor weighs in favor of the exercise of our discretion to consider the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Moreover, the policies behind the general rule requiring preservation would not be offended by our exercise of discretion in this case. As in <em>Marroquin, </em>\u201cthe law regarding the admissibility of crime laboratory reports has changed significantly since defendant\u2019s trial.\u201d 215 Or App at 337. At the time that defendant objected to the admission of the laboratory report in the trial court, the argument that defendant now asserts on appeal was foreclosed by <em>State v. Hancock, </em>317 Or 5, 854 P2d 926 (1993), which held that the admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>of a laboratory report pursuant to ORS 475.235 did not violate a defendant\u2019s right to confrontation. <em>See also State v. Dibbern, </em>209 Or App 602, 603, 149 P3d 170 (2006), <em>vac\u2019d and rent\u2019d, </em>343 Or 159, 164 P3d 1160 (2007) (\u201cConfrontation Clause concerns are satisfied by the availability of a procedure, under ORS 475.235 * * *.\u201d); <em>State v. Miller, </em>208 Or App 424, 440, 144 P3d 1052, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>210 Or App 176, 149 P3d 1251 (2006) (ORS 475.235 does not violate a defendant\u2019s confrontation rights): Thus, had defendant specifically invoked Article I, section 11, as the basis for his objection to the admission of the laboratory report, the trial court presumably would have reached the same conclusion. That factor, too, weighs in favor of exercising our discretion to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">In addition, with respect to the conviction for attempted delivery of a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a school, we conclude that the gravity of the error and the ends of justice require reversal. Defendant\u2019s theory of the case \u2014 which he argued in his opening statement and closing argument \u2014 was that he possessed methamphetamine for his own use and had no intent to distribute it. The state argued that defendant\u2019s intent to distribute the methamphetamine could be inferred from the amount of methamphetamine found in his possession \u2014 6.9 grams, according to the laboratory report. In fact, in his closing argument, the prosecutor relied on the laboratory report to argue that \u201cquick math tells me that\u2019s about 28 weeks\u2019, approximately, personal use. * * * That\u2019s a lot of personal use. What else was [defendant] doing with that bag?\u201d The quantity of methamphetamine was central to the state\u2019s case on that charge, and defendant should have had the opportunity to cross-examine the criminologist who prepared the report. <em>See Marroquin, </em>215 Or App at 337 (concluding that the gravity of the error was sufficient to warrant correction where \u201c[t]he crime laboratory report was critical to the state\u2019s case against defendant\u201d). Accordingly, we exercise our discretion to correct the trial court\u2019s error as to the conviction for attempted delivery of a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a school.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">We reach a contrary conclusion, however, with respect to the charge of possession of a controlled substance. Defendant\u2019s counsel began his opening statement with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>statement, \u201cThe defendant was in possession of drugs in this case. * * * The methamphetamine, [defendant] does know that at the time, he was into drugs, and he had methamphetamine on his person for his personal use.\u201d In closing argument, defendant\u2019s counsel stated, \u201c[Defendant] was arrested and he had methamphetamine in his pocket, the second count that we\u2019re trying today, the other count, possession of controlled substance. [Defendant] is not disputing that. He\u2019s admitting this * * Thus, even though the trial court erred in admitting the laboratory report, there was never any legitimate debate as to whether the substance at issue in the laboratory report was actually methamphetamine. Accordingly, we decline to exercise our discretion to correct the trial court\u2019s error in admitting the laboratory report with regard to defendant\u2019s conviction for possession of a controlled substance. <em>Cf. State v. Raney, </em>217 Or App 470, 175 P3d 1024 (2008) (trial court did not commit plain error in admitting laboratory report where defendant did not contest that the substance tested was actually methamphetamine).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Conviction for attempted delivery of a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a school reversed and remanded; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-8\"> Defendant concedes that the admission of the laboratory report was not relevant to his convictions concerning the possession of firearms and provides no basis for reversing those convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
