J.</author>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Youth was found to be within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court for committing acts that, if committed by an adult, would constitute first-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.427, and first-degree sodomy, ORS 163.405. On appeal, youth argues that the juvenile court improperly admitted into evidence certain hearsay statements made by the three-year-old complainant, N, in violation of OEC 803(4), OEC 803(18a)(b), and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as interpreted in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 US 36, 124 S Ct 1354, 158 L Ed 2d 177 (2004). As explained below, we conclude that, under <em>Crawford, </em>the juvenile court erred in admitting testimony recounting statements that N made during an interview conducted by staff at the CARES<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Northwest program, in which he described the alleged abuse. On <em>de novo </em>review, we conclude that (1) notwithstanding that error, the properly admitted evidence in the record establishes, beyond a reasonable doubt, that youth engaged in conduct that, if committed by an adult, would constitute first-degree sexual abuse; but (2) that error compels reversal and remand with respect to the sodomy-related allegations of the delinquency petition. We therefore reverse in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">We review the facts <em>de novo </em>and the legal issues as a matter of law. ORS 419A.200(6). On June 10, 2004, the then three-year-old victim, N, was visiting his grandmother\u2019s house, while youth, who was 13, also was visiting the house. N and youth were together watching television in a bedroom while the adults were in another room. That evening, as his parents were putting him to bed, N said that youth had touched his penis and that he did not \u201cwant to bite [youth\u2019s] penis.\u201d When his father asked N to show him where youth had touched N, N put his hand down the front of his diaper, touching his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">N\u2019s father called the Department of Human Services (DHS) for advice and was told not to question N but, instead, to take N to his pediatrician \u201cfor a referral to CARES <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Northwest.\u201d The following day, N\u2019s mother took N first to his regular pediatrician\u2019s office, but N did not make any statements to the pediatrician about being touched. The pediatrician advised N\u2019s mother to schedule an evaluation with CARES.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Mother contacted CARES and recounted to a CARES intake worker what N had reported. The intake worker at CARES also spoke with a DHS representative, McCarthy, who indicated that she would fax a report to CARES and would cross-report the matter to the Multnomah County Child Abuse Team. CARES then convened a team staffing and discussed the case. The resulting intake summary indicated that, because N had not revealed any abuse when examined by his pediatrician and \u201cbecause DHS needs clarification of the allegations,\u201d N \u201ccould be evaluated at CARES NW.\u201d The intake worker then contacted N\u2019s mother and, due to a cancellation, was able to schedule an evaluation for the same day. The intake worker also called DHS to confirm that McCarthy would attend the evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The evaluation at CARES was attended by McCarthy and another DHS worker, as well as Clackamas County Sheriffs Deputy Krummenacker, who was present \u201cas a courtesy to the Portland Police Bureau.\u201d The DHS workers had another meeting scheduled and did not stay for the full evaluation, but Deputy Krummenacker remained throughout, monitoring the initial taking of information through a one-way mirror, and listening by microphone to the subsequent physical examination and interview of N.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">N was examined by Dr. Heiferman, a pediatrician, and interviewed by Findlay, a social worker. Because of N\u2019s age, both the exam and the interview were conducted in an exam room.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Heiferman conducted a \u201chead to toe\u201d physical exam of N and found his physical condition to be normal. She also interviewed N, doing what she referred to as a \u201cbody review,\u201d which involved asking him if anyone had hurt various parts of his body, such as his eye, his throat, his neck, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>his belly. He responded \u201cno\u201d to those questions. When asked if anyone had touched his penis or buttocks, he also answered \u201cno.\u201d When asked if his mom was worried about him, he answered \u201cno\u201d again.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">When N continued to respond with many \u201cno\u201d answers to various questions about his home and friends, in what Heiferman considered to be \u201cpatterned responses,\u201d Findlay took over the questioning, in order to help break the pattern. Findlay told N that N\u2019s mother had told Findlay that she was worried that someone had touched his penis, and asked N if anyone had done that. N responded that youth \u201calready did\u201d and that youth \u201cwas trying to suck it\u201d with \u201chis mouth.\u201d When asked if youth had sucked it, N responded \u201cyes.\u201d N further indicated to Findlay that youth had grabbed N\u2019s crotch.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At that point, N asked for his mother, and the interview ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">After the interview, the CARES evaluation team met to discuss the case. Deputy Krummenacker was a member of the team but did not participate in making treatment recommendations. Heiferman\u2019s diagnosis was \u201chighly concerned for sexual abuse.\u201d After that meeting, N\u2019s mother was provided with an evaluation summary. N\u2019s mother then was joined by Deputy Krummenacker \u201cto discuss the ongoing investigation.\u201d The CARES evaluation team recommended no further contact between N and youth, as well as monitoring N\u2019s behavior, but the team did not recommend therapy at that time, given N\u2019s young age. The evaluation summary further indicated that the team \u201crecommend [ed] further investigation by DHS and law enforcement into these allegations of abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Detectives assigned to the Multnomah County Child Abuse Team, who received the CARES evaluation report, subsequently interviewed youth. Youth, after initially denying any sexual contact with N, ultimately admitted both to intentionally touching N\u2019s penis out of sexual curiosity and to sucking on N\u2019s penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>The present delinquency proceeding ensued. At the outset, the parties stipulated that N was unavailable as a witness. The state indicated that it intended to introduce testimony recounting N\u2019s statements during the CARES interview pursuant to either, or both, OEC 803(4), the \u201cmedical diagnosis or treatment\u201d hearsay exception,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and OEC 803(18a)(b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The state further asserted that testimony recounting N\u2019s statements to his parents describing the alleged abuse was also admissible pursuant to OEC 803(18a)(b). Youth objected on the grounds that (1) the testimony recounting N\u2019s statements either during the CARES interview or to his parents was inadmissible under the Oregon Evidence Code and (2), alternatively, citing <em>Crawford, </em>hearsay recounting of N\u2019s statements during the CARES interview would violate the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">The juvenile court concluded that testimony recounting N\u2019s statements to his parents was admissible under OEC 803(18a)(b). The juvenile court further concluded, with respect to testimony recounting N\u2019s statement during the CARES interview, that, although <em>Crawford </em>precluded testimony recounting that N had identified youth as the perpetrator, testimony recounting the balance of N\u2019s statements during that interview was admissible under <em>Crawford </em>and, as a statutory matter, under either OEC 803(4) or OEC 803(18a)(b). After the presentation of evidence, the juvenile court determined youth to be within the jurisdiction of the court for acts that, if committed by an adult, would constitute first-degree sodomy and first-degree sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">On appeal, youth advances three arguments.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> First, he contends that testimony recounting N\u2019s statements to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>parents describing the alleged abuse was not admissible under OEC 803(18a)(b). Second, he asserts that testimony recounting N\u2019s statements during the CARES interview was not admissible under either OEC 803(4) or OEC 803(18a)(b). Third, youth contends that, even if his statutorily based objections to the admissibility of N\u2019s statements during the CARES interview are unavailing, those statements were \u201ctestimonial hearsay\u201d under <em>Crawford </em>and their admission violated his constitutional confrontation rights. As amplified below, we reject youth\u2019s statutorily based objections but agree that, under <em>Crawford, </em>the juvenile court erred in admitting testimony recounting N\u2019s statements made during the CARES interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Youth\u2019s first argument, pertaining to the admissibility of testimony recounting N\u2019s statements to his parents, is based on OEC 803(18a)(b). That statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">\u201cA statement made by a person concerning an act of abuse * * * is not excluded by [OEC 802] if the declarant either testifies at the proceeding and is subject to cross-examination, or is unavailable as a witness but was chronologically or mentally under 12 years of age when the statement was made * * *. However, if a declarant is unavailable, the statement may be admitted in evidence only if the proponent establishes that the time, content and circumstances of the statement provide indicia of reliability, and in a criminal trial that there is corroborative evidence of the act of abuse and of the alleged perpetrator\u2019s opportunity to participate in the conduct and that the statement possesses indicia of reliability as is constitutionally required to be admitted. * * * For purposes of this paragraph, in addition to those situations described in [OEC 804(1)], the declarant shall be considered \u2018unavailable\u2019 if the declarant has a substantial lack of memory of the subject matter of the statement, is presently incompetent to testify, is unable to communicate about the abuse or sexual conduct because of fear or other similar reason or is sub-' stantially likely, as established by expert testimony, to suffer lasting severe emotional trauma from testifying. <em>Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the court shall examine the declarant in chambers and on the record or outside the presence of the jury and on the record. </em>The examination shall be conducted immediately prior to the commencement of the trial in the presence of the attorney and the legal guardian or other suitable person as designated by the court. If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>declarant is found to be unavailable, the court shall then determine the admissibility of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">(Emphasis added.) Youth argues, principally, that, notwithstanding the parties\u2019 stipulation that N was \u201cunavailable\u201d to testify, the juvenile court erred in accepting that stipulation \u2014 indeed, the court was precluded from doing so \u2014 without making an independent assessment and determination of N\u2019s availability. As support for that proposition, youth invokes <em>State v. Campbell, </em>299 Or 633, 705 P2d 694 (1985).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The state responds first by emphasizing that youth\u2019s present Campbell-based objection was unpreserved \u2014 after all, youth <em>stipulated </em>to N\u2019s unavailability \u2014 and partakes of \u201cinvited error.\u201d The state further argues that any departure from <em>Campbell </em>here cannot be deemed an \u201cerror of law apparent on the face of the record,\u201d ORAP 5.45(1), because, for a variety of reasons, the alleged error here is \u201creasonably in dispute.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990). Specifically, the state points to differences in statutory language, the nature of youth\u2019s constitutional claims, and changes in Sixth Amendment jurisprudence since <em>Campbell </em>was decided. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that, in light of changes in the law since <em>Campbell, </em>the alleged error in this case does not qualify as \u201cplain error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">We begin with <em>Campbell. </em>There, the defendant was convicted of first-degree sodomy of a three-year-old victim. 299 Or at 635. After the parties stipulated that the victim was not competent to testify, her mother was permitted to recount the victim\u2019s statements to her describing the abuse. <em>Id. </em>at 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">On appeal, the Supreme Court considered, in part, whether that testimony was admissible under the then-extant version of OEC 803(18a), which provided that \u201c \u2018[a] complaint of sexual misconduct made by the prosecuting witness after the commission of the alleged offense\u2019 \u201d was not excluded by OEC 802.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Campbell, </em>299 Or at 640. Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>the court addressed whether a child victim needed to testify in order for her out-of-court statements to be admitted under that rule. <em>Id. </em>at 640-53. After reviewing the history of that provision, which codified case law that predated the Oregon Evidence Code, the court concluded that, \u201c[a]lthough one of the reasons for the rule as expressed by this court would logically require the adult victim to testify in order to have her testimony corroborated by her out-of-court complaint, such rationale is not applicable in the case of a child victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 644-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">The Supreme Court proceeded to consider whether admission of the child\u2019s hearsay statements if the child did not testify would violate the confrontation rights guarantee in Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution. It concluded that, although it interpreted Article I, section 11, independently from similar provisions of the United States Constitution, it would adopt as persuasive the reasoning from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 US 56, 100 S Ct 2531, 65 L Ed 2d 597 (1980), concerning the admissibility of children\u2019s hearsay statements. <em>Campbell, </em>299 Or at 648. As pertinent here, the court held that Article I, section 11, required a determination that the declarant was unavailable. <em>Id. </em>The court in <em>Campbell </em>went on to conclude:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">\u201cWe believe that the question of unavailability of a hearsay declarant supposedly due to incompetency should not be left to the advocates in a criminal trial. The prosecution would be relieved from calling the witness and the defense relieved from having the witness appear for trial. If the court is going to admit hearsay statements against a defendant to satisfy the confrontation rights of an accused, the court must ensure the declarant is in fact unavailable. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">\u201c* * * \\ye hold, therefore, that before any out-of-court declaration of any available living witness may be offered against a defendant in a criminal trial, the witness must be produced and declared incompetent by the court to satisfy either Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution, or the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 651-52 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>The Supreme Court consequently reversed and remanded for the trial court to make an independent determination of whether the child victim was incompetent and, hence, unavailable to testify. <em>Id. </em>at 652. The court said nothing about the potential procedural implications of the defendant\u2019s agreement to the stipulation, <em>e.g., </em>waiver, nonpreservation, or \u201cinvited error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">More than 20 years have passed since <em>Campbell. </em>During that time, the Oregon Supreme Court, while acknowledging that subsequent case law from the United States Supreme Court indicates that the Sixth Amendment does not necessarily require the showing of unavailability described in <em>Campbell, </em>has reaffirmed its conclusion that Article I, section 11, does require such a showing. <em>State v. Moore, </em>334 Or 328, 49 P3d 785 (2002). Further, in <em>Crawford, </em>the United States Supreme Court abandoned the Confrontation Clause test from <em>Ohio v. Roberts </em>on which <em>Campbell </em>was predicated. <em>See generally State v. Mack, </em>337 Or 586, 590, 101 P3d 349 (2004) <em>(Crawford </em>\u201cannounced a different Confrontation Clause analysis than [that] announced in <em>Roberts\u201d)</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Several features of <em>Campbell </em>are salient in juxtaposition to this case and youth\u2019s unpreserved claim of error. <em>First, </em>unlike <em>Campbell, </em>where the court\u2019s analysis and holding were based on the Confrontation Clause of Article I, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>section 11, youth\u2019s contention here is purely statutory, <em>viz., </em>that OEC 803(18a)(b) does not, by its terms, permit the admission of hearsay even if the parties have stipulated to the child declarant\u2019s unavailability. <em>Second, </em>language in OEC 803(18a)(b), which was enacted after <em>Campbell,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>at least suggests that the parties\u2019 stipulation is to be given effect. Specifically, OEC 803(18a)(b) provides that, <em>\u201c[ujnless otherwise agreed by the parties, </em>the court shall examine the declarant in chambers and on the record or outside the presence of the jury and on the record.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Third, </em>as noted, <em>Campbell </em>\u2014 which antedated both <em>Brown </em>and <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 823 P2d 956 (1991)\u2014 did not address preservation of error, much less waiver or \u201cinvited <em>error.\u201d Fourth, </em>although <em>Campbell </em>implicitly rests on a premise that constitutional confrontation protections cannot be waived, subsequent decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court appear to contradict that premise, recognizing that criminal defendants routinely waive trial-related constitutional rights for a variety of tactical and strategic reasons. <em>See generally Kitzman, </em>323 Or at 615 (Van Hoomissen, J., concurring). Indeed, the Supreme Court has admonished against \u201cplain error\u201d review in circumstances in which a criminal defendant\u2019s failure to raise a constitutional objection may have been the product of such considerations. <em>See, e.g., State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 523, 173 P3d 822 (2007) (setting out factors pertinent to exercise of discretion to review unpreserved error, including possibility that a defendant may choose for tactical reasons not to assert a constitutional protection); <em>State v. Raney, </em>217 Or App 470, 175 P3d 1024 (2008) (refusing to consider unpreserved constitutional challenge to the admission of the results of a laboratory report where there were competing inferences as to whether the defendant\u2019s failure to object under Article I, section 11, to the admission of that report was the product of a conscious tactical or strategic choice).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">Our point is not, of course, that <em>Campbell </em>is no longer good law. \u201cWe are not in the business of overruling decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Schiffer v. United Grocers, Inc., </em>143 Or App 276, 284, 922 P2d 703 (1996), <em>rev\u2019d </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number><em>on other grounds, </em>329 Or 86, 989 P2d 10 (1999). Rather, the foregoing observations compel two conclusions, either of which is dispositive. First, the juvenile court\u2019s acceptance of the parties\u2019 stipulation as to N\u2019s unavailability does not satisfy the requisites of plain error because Campbell\u2019s proper application in these circumstances is not \u201cobvious\u201d but is, instead, \u201creasonably in dispute.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>310 Or at 355. Further, in all events, the manifest potential that the stipulation was the product of a tactical or strategic choice decisively militates against an exercise of <em>Ailes </em>discretion. Accordingly, we affirm the juvenile court\u2019s admission of the testimony recounting N\u2019s statements to his parents describing the alleged abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">We proceed, then, to youth\u2019s statutorily based challenge to the admission of testimony recounting N\u2019s statements during the CARES interview. As noted, the juvenile court concluded that that testimony was admissible under either OEC 803(4) or OEC 803(18a)(b). Youth\u2019s arguments with respect to the inapplicability of OEC 803(18a)(b) in this context are identical to those that we rejected immediately above and, thus, fail for the same reasons. Accordingly, we need not determine whether the challenged testimony was independently admissible under OEC 803(4).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">We proceed, finally, to youth\u2019s contention that the constitutional principles enunciated in <em>Crawford </em>precluded the admission of testimony recounting N\u2019s statements during the CARES interview. In particular, defendant contends that <em>Crawford, </em>as well as the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s application of <em>Crawford </em>in <em>Mack, </em>compel a conclusion that N\u2019s hearsay statements were \u201ctestimonial\u201d and were not admissible into evidence because defendant did not have an opportunity to cross-examine N.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The state responds that N\u2019s statements were not \u201ctestimonial\u201d as that term has been used in <em>Crawford </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>later cases. In particular, the state asserts that, in determining whether a statement is \u201ctestimonial\u201d for <em>Crawford </em>purposes, \u201cit cannot be the expectation or purpose of the questioner that controls\u201d the analysis; instead, \u201cthe declarant\u2019s purpose or expectation is significant.\u201d The state also argues that, because N\u2019s statements were not elicited by a police officer or other government agent, they are not testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">The parties fully appreciate \u2014 as do we \u2014 that the determination of whether, or in what circumstances, a child complainant\u2019s statements made during a CARES interview will be deemed to be \u201ctestimonial\u201d may have profound implications for the investigation and prosecution of child sex abuse cases in this state. In <em>Mack, </em>the Oregon Supreme Court addressed some aspects of <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>application in this context, as have we in at least two cases in which the Craic/brcZ-based objection was not raised in the trial court. <em>See State v. Foreman, </em>212 Or App 109, 157 P3d 228, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 223 (2007); <em>State v. Pitt (A120428), </em>209 Or App 270, 147 P3d 940 (2006), <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>212 Or App 523, 159 P3d 329 (2007). But the dispute here, in which the question was fully preserved, appears to be more broadly drawn and comprehensively joined than in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">We begin with <em>Crawford. </em>There, the Court abandoned its longstanding formulation, as expressed in <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>that, in most circumstances, the Sixth Amendment did not preclude the admission of hearsay statements by unavailable witnesses if those statements were found to have sufficient \u201cindicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 US at 66. Instead, <em>Crawford </em>announced a rule that the Sixth Amendment prohibits the \u201cadmission of <em>testimonial statements </em>of a witness who did not appear at trial unless [the witness] was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 US at 53-54 (emphasis added). Although the Court did not attempt to define the universe of \u201ctestimonial statements,\u201d it identified a number of types of statements, such as pretrial affidavits that declarants would reasonably expect to be used in a prosecution and statements taken by police officers during interrogations, including statements of a child victim to an investigating police officer. <em>Id. </em>at 51-52, 58 n 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>In subsequent consolidated cases, <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 US 813, 126 S Ct 2266, 165 L Ed 2d 244 (2006) <em>(Davis/</em>Hammon), the Court considered whether certain hearsay statements made by a victim to a 9-1-1 operator <em>(Davis) </em>and certain hearsay statements made by a victim after police responded to a report of domestic disturbance <em>(Hammon) </em>were admissible. The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-4\">\u201cStatements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">547 US at 822 (footnote omitted). That summary indicates that, at least when the statements in question are the result of police interrogation, the Court was looking to the purpose of the interrogator in asking the questions rather' than the purpose of the declarant in making the statements. However, the Court\u2019s further, particularized observations about the circumstances in <em>Davis/Hammon </em>suggest that the inquiry is not so straightforward as simply discerning the intent of the questioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">For example, with respect to the <em>Davis </em>portion of the case, the Court noted that the 9-1-1 caller (McCottry) was reporting events as they actually were happening, rather than describing past events, and she was facing an ongoing emergency: \u201cAlthough one <em>might </em>call 911 to provide a narrative report of a crime absent any imminent danger, McCottry\u2019s call was plainly a call for help against bona fide physical threat.\u201d 547 US at 827 (emphasis in original). That observation proceeds from the declarant/caller\u2019s perspective. However, the immediately following statement reverts to a focus on the questioner: \u201c[T]he nature of what was asked and answered * * * was such that the elicited statements were necessary to be able to <em>resolve </em>the present emergency, rather than simply to learn (as in <em>Crawford) </em>what had happened in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>the past.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, the Court referred to both the declarant\u2019s and the questioner\u2019s circumstances in comparing the circumstances in <em>Davis/Hammon </em>with those in <em>Crawford:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-4\">\u201c[The victim in Crawford] was responding calmly, at the station house, to a series of questions, with the officer-interrogator taping and making notes of her answers; McCottry\u2019s frantic answers were provided over the phone, in an environment that was not tranquil, or even (as far as any reasonable 911 operator could make out) safe.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-5\"><em>Davis/Hammon, </em>547 US at 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Turning to the <em>Hammon </em>portion of the case, the Court concluded that statements made by a victim to officers responding to a domestic disturbance call were testimonial, much as were the statements at issue in <em>Crawford:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">\u201cBoth statements deliberately recounted, in response to police questioning, how potentially criminal past events began and progressed. And both took place some time after the events described were over. Such statements under official interrogation are an obvious substitute for live testimony, because they do precisely <em>what a witness does </em>on direct examination; they are inherently testimonial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-8\"><em>Davis/Hammon, </em>547 US at 830 (footnote omitted; emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">The totality of the Court\u2019s discussion in <em>Davis! Hammon </em>thus indicates that while (1) the purpose of the questioner in eliciting statements is a key focus of the inquiry, particularly in cases involving police interrogations, (2) in some circumstances, the declarant\u2019s reasons for making a statement may also be relevant to determining whether a statement should be treated as testimonial for purposes of Sixth Amendment analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">That conclusion comports with the analysis employed by the Oregon Supreme Court in <em>Mack, </em>which was decided before <em>Davis/Hammon. </em>In <em>Mack, </em>a four-year-old child, Shaydon, had witnessed the defendant\u2019s assault on his brother. After a police officer tried to interview Shaydon but was unable to establish rapport, the police sought the assistance of Snyder, a DHS social worker, in conducting the interview. 337 Or at 588. The police videotaped Snyder\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>interviews of Shaydon, during which he described what the defendant had done to his brother. The trial court ruled that, although the statements would be admissible under OEC 803(18a)(b), they were \u201ctestimonial\u201d and, thus, inadmissible under <em>Crawford. Mack, </em>337 Or at 589. The Oregon Supreme Court agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-4\">\u201cWe need not go beyond the reasoning in <em>Crawford </em>to decide this case. Shaydon\u2019s statements to Snyder fell within the core class of testimonial evidence that <em>Crawford </em>identified. There can be little doubt that, if the police officers had conducted these interviews with Shaydon, the resulting statements would be testimonial. Indeed, <em>Crawford </em>described an officer\u2019s interview of the four-year-old victim in <em>White v. Illinois, </em>502 US 346, 349-51, 112 S Ct 736, 116 L Ed 2d 848 (1992), as eliciting testimonial evidence. 124 S Ct at 1368 n 8. The only difference between this case and <em>White </em>is that a DHS worker, rather than an officer, conducted the interviews. The DHS worker, however, was serving as a proxy for the police. She took over the first interview when the interviewing officer was unable to establish a dialogue with Shaydon. She continued in that role in the second interview and elicited statements from Shaydon so that police officers could videotape them for use in a criminal proceeding. Under <em>Crawford, </em>admitting Shaydon\u2019s statements to Snyder would violate the Confrontation Clause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-5\"><em>Mack, </em>337 Or at 593 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">In so concluding, the Supreme Court emphasized that not only were the interviews taped, but also that Snyder conducted the interview \u201cin an age-appropriate way to elicit information from Shaydon relevant to the police investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594. In response to the state\u2019s suggestion (similar to the argument the state makes here) that the focus must be on the child\u2019s- intent in making the statements, the court acknowledged that there may be situations in which the declarant\u2019s purpose in making a statement might bear on whether it was <em>testimonial </em>\u2014 e.g., \u201cunsolicited statements\u201d or \u201c[e]mergency calls to government officials.\u201d Id. Nevertheless, \u201c[t]he primary focus in <em>Crawford </em>was on the method by which government officials elicited out-of-court statements for use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>in criminal trials, not on the declarant\u2019s intent or purpose in making the statement.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Most recently, in <em>Pitt, </em>we addressed whether statements made by a child victim during a forensic interview conducted at a child advocacy center were testimonial for purposes of the Sixth Amendment. We concluded that they were. Because <em>Pitt </em>is closely analogous to this case in several respects, we describe it in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">In <em>Pitt, </em>a four-year-old child revealed to her mother that the defendant had touched her genital area. The mother called the police, who arranged for the child to be examined by a physician, who diagnosed sexual abuse. The physician made a referral to a psychologist for the child to receive counseling, and the child revealed to the counselor some details of the abuse. 209 Or App at 272-73. Approximately six months later, the child was taken to the Lane County Advocacy Center, where a forensic child interviewer interviewed her about the abuse. The interview was taped. <em>Id. </em>at 273. Ultimately, after the child was found to be unavailable as a witness, the videotape was admitted into evidence against the defendant. Although the defendant did not preserve a <em>Crawford-based </em>objection to the admission of that evidence, he argued on appeal that the trial court had committed \u201cplain error.\u201d We agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">In so holding, we emphasized that the child advocacy center, a private nonprofit organization, was \u201cin partnership with the district attorney\u2019s office and provid [ed] a number of services related to child abuse investigation,\u201d including interviewing, medical examinations, and referrals to mental health treatment. The program also housed a grand jury. <em>Id. </em>at 273. The director of the program, who interviewed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>child, described his role as to \u201c \u2018coordinate interview participation among law enforcement, child protection services and prosecutors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Given those circumstances, relying on <em>Mack, </em>we concluded that the statements the child made in the video were testimonial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">\u201cAlthough, as in <em>Mack, </em>the interviews were not conducted by a police officer, they were conducted for the express purpose of furthering a police investigation, with a police officer recording them and with the interviewer explicitly attempting to solicit information from the children that would be useful for defendant\u2019s prosecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-6\"><em>Pitt, </em>209 Or App at 279. We further emphasized, citing <em>Davis /Hammon, </em>that the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the videotaped interview was to \u201c \u2018establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Davis/Hammon, </em>547 US at 822.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The disposition of the Crawford-based challenge in this case thus turns on whether, for Sixth Amendment purposes, the circumstances of N\u2019s interview at the CARES program were so materially different from those in <em>Mack </em>and <em>Pitt </em>as to warrant a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">The state contends that <em>Mack </em>is so distinguishable because the DHS worker/interviewer in that case was acting directly as \u201ca proxy for\u201d and \u201can agent for\u201d the police, <em>Mack, </em>337 Or at 593, 594, and the record here does not substantiate such a relationship between Heiferman and Findlay, who conducted the interview, and law enforcement or prosecutorial personnel. The state further contends that <em>Pitt </em>is also decisively distinguishable because of a combination of circumstances that are not present here, including that the child advocacy center there operated \u201cin partnership with\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s office, <em>Pitt, </em>209 Or App at 273, and in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>same facility where a grand jury met and that police officers videotaped the interviews there. The state asserts that, in comparison, there was a \u201cminimal degree of police involvement here.\u201d The state further, and fundamentally, contends that, viewed either from the interviewer\u2019s perspective or N\u2019s perspective, the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the interview was \u201cmedical, not investigatory or prosecutorial.\u201d In that regard, the state posits that, regardless of any involvement by police or prosecutorial personnel, a careful medical professional would have asked the same questions of N and, presumably, have elicited the same responses: \u201cExactly the same medical exam and interview would have taken place if the deputy had not been present and exactly the same medical report would have been generated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">We understand the state, in sum, to advance a somewhat nuanced, multifactored analysis in which the determination of whether statements are \u201ctestimonial\u201d for <em>Crawford </em>purposes depends not only on the questioner\u2019s \u201cprimary purpose,\u201d or even on some assessment of both the questioner\u2019s and the declarant\u2019s \u201cprimary purposes,\u201d but also on the quality and degree of police or prosecutorial involvement in any interview or evaluation that produces those statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">We agree with the state that, almost invariably, the determination of whether an unavailable declarant\u2019s statements, which were given in response to questioning, are \u201ctestimonial\u201d will depend on a variety of considerations \u2014 and not solely on an assessment of the questioner\u2019s \u201cprimary purpose.\u201d In particular, where an interview or evaluation process serves multiple purposes, the nature and extent of police or prosecutorial involvement in that process is a very substantial \u2014 indeed, potentially decisive \u2014 consideration. <em>See, e.g., Pitt, </em>209 Or App 270. In this case, as in <em>Pitt, </em>that consideration is decisive. Although, as the state points out, there are some circumstantial differences between the two cases with respect to law enforcement involvement in the evaluation process, those differences are, as we will explain, ultimately immaterial. Consequently, we conclude that N\u2019s statements during the CARES interview were testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">We begin with a description of the CARES program, as substantiated on this record. CARES is a program that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>provides a medical setting for the diagnosis of child abuse. It contains interview rooms where children are interviewed, which are equipped with one-way mirrors so that the interviews may be videotaped or observed by law enforcement and DHS personnel. Adjacent examination rooms contain microphones so that law enforcement and DHS personnel may listen on headphones during the physical examination. After conducting interviews and examinations, CARES makes referrals for treatment to various care providers in light of the results of its evaluations \u2014 that is, CARES does not itself provide treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">CARES operates in conjunction with DHS and law enforcement officials, and receives the majority of its referrals from those sources. As the trial court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">\u201c[A] goal of CARES is to centralize the interview process to minimize the likelihood of contamination to a child\u2019s statements. In other words, CARES is supposed to substitute for the multiple interviews that may result from a child abuse investigation that could include medical, law enforcement and child welfare workers talking with the child at various points in criminal investigations, juvenile dependency, civil custody proceedings and/or criminal prosecutions.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Heiferman testified that CARES interviewers are trained to gather information from children and that their training is beyond what a general pediatrician would be expected to have. She testified that, in the majority of cases, law enforcement and DHS personnel observe CARES interviews. Heiferman explained that police are routinely present during the CARES process because \u201cit\u2019s a safety issue for the child.\u201d She elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">\u201cWhen we make recommendations and in terms of history taking, the information about the offender is important in terms of the contact that the child is going to have with the person and when this is going to be a safe environment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Heiferman further testified that the results of CARES evaluations are routinely provided to law enforcement personnel. In contrast, a child\u2019s parents are not given a copy of the full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>CARES evaluation report but are, instead, provided only with \u201can abbreviated form.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Findlay, the social worker who participated in N\u2019s interview, testified that, although the evaluation process may vary somewhat depending on the age of the child involved and the nature of the suspected abuse, CARES uses a standard protocol regardless of the source of the referral. There is no evidence in this record that law enforcement personnel participated in the development of CARES\u2019 standard protocol. Findlay confirmed that \u201cit\u2019s very common\u201d for law enforcement personnel to monitor CARES evaluations. He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">\u201c[0]ne of the primary goals of CARES is to * * * centralize the evaluation process when there is a concern of abuse so that law enforcement and DHS, other sort of members of the community that are also going to be involved in the sort of evaluation investigative process will be there present to hear firsthand what the child says, so that if they have specific questions from what a child has said, they were there, they heard it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">\u201cThey may not have to, say, reinterview the child themselves. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">\u201c* * * [TJhere is oftentimes where an officer might be listening to an exam in which maybe there\u2019s a detective that\u2019s assigned or they\u2019re deciding whether or not a case has merit to be assigned to a detective at a later date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">With that background, we return to the circumstances of N\u2019s referral and evaluation by CARES. After N disclosed the alleged abuse to his parents, his father called DHS\u2019 Child Protective Services \u201chotline\u201d for advice. He was directed by DHS to \u201cgo to our pediatrician and then get in contact with CARES.\u201d N\u2019s mother took him to his pediatrician the next day, and the pediatrician conducted a physical examination but did not question N about the abuse; instead, consistently with DHS\u2019 instructions, he referred N to CARES.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>The CARES intake summary noted that, before CARES agreed to undertake the evaluation, CARES personnel consulted with DHS, which provided CARES with its initial screening report. CARES subsequently agreed to undertake the evaluation \u201cbecause DHS needs clarification of the allegations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Aa noted, Deputy Krummenacker was present, but not visible, during the interview. Deputy Krummenacker had no input into the questions that were asked. After the interview was concluded, when members of the evaluation team met to render treatment recommendations, Deputy Krummenacker joined them but \u201cdidn\u2019t participate in the treatment recommendations [.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">After the evaluation team had agreed on its treatment recommendations, members of the team then met in the interview room with N\u2019s mother, who had accompanied him to the CARES facility, and provided her with a summary of their findings and an explanation of their treatment recommendations. Immediately thereafter, Deputy Krummenacker met with N\u2019s mother in the CARES facility\u2019s interview room \u201cto discuss the ongoing investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Heiferman and Findlay later generated a comprehensive written report. Among that report\u2019s \u201ctreatment recommendations\u201d was the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">\u201cBased on the information available to us today, we recommend further investigation by DHS and law enforcement into these allegations of abuse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">As noted, under CARES protocols, CARES evaluation reports are \u201croutinely referred to law enforcement.\u201d Here, the lead detective on the case received a copy of the CARES report and reviewed that report before ever speaking with youth. Later, as the detective interviewed youth, he used N\u2019s statements as recounted in the report to contradict youth\u2019s initial denials.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">The record in this case pertaining to CARES generally, and this evaluation particularly, compels two conclusions. First, the CARES interview process serves multiple concurrent purposes. To be sure, one of those purposes is to obtain an accurate diagnosis of whether a child has, in fact, been sexually abused \u2014 which, in turn, will promote effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>medical and psychological treatment (albeit not by CARES itself). But CARES also functions as an informational clearinghouse for police and child welfare authorities, so that they can deal effectively with perpetrators of child sex abuse. As the juvenile court recognized, the CARES process is designed to \u201cminimize the likelihood of contamination\u201d of a child\u2019s statements from suggestive questioning techniques or multiple interviews by different questioners \u2014 and, thus, to provide not only treatment providers but also law enforcement authorities with the cleanest, most credible evidence of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">That purpose is laudable. And that purpose is not problematic, except in cases (like this) where the state seeks to rely at trial on a child\u2019s statements during a CARES interview and the child is not \u201cavailable\u201d \u2014 and, thus, is not subject to cross-examination. <em>That </em>\u2014 viz., conviction based on evidence not susceptible to cross-examination \u2014 is the constitutional vice that <em>Crawford </em>confronts.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The second conclusion that this record compels is that, contrary to the state\u2019s contention, the involvement of law enforcement in the CARES process is hardly \u201cminimal.\u201d Rather, it is pervasive. It is true \u2014 as the state emphasizes\u2014 that there is no evidence that police officers or prosecutors participated in the development of the CARES protocol and that here Deputy Krummenacker had no visible presence during the interview and merely observed passively. But it is also true that not only did Deputy Krummenacker observe the entire interview (as did the officer in <em>Pitt), </em>but he also was present during the evaluation team\u2019s consultation and immediately thereafter met with N\u2019s mother in the CARES facility\u2019s interview room to discuss the course of the prosecution. The close connection between CARES and law enforcement authorities is further corroborated by (1) CARES\u2019 routine practice of providing police agencies with complete copies of its evaluation reports (while providing only abridged \u201csummaries\u201d to parents) and (2) CARES\u2019 \u201ctreatment recommendation\u201d urging \u201cfurther investigation by DHS and law enforcement into these allegations of abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Those circumstances conclusively refute the state\u2019s suggestion that, as a practical matter, CARES is indistinguishable from an individual pediatrician who is subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>mandatory obligations to report suspected child abuse. The individual pediatrician does not, as a matter of routine, invite police officers to listen in on physical examinations or to observe patient interviews from behind one-way mirrors. Nor does he or she invite police officers to sit in on meetings in which treatment recommendations are formulated. Similarly, individual pediatricians generally do not send medical diagnostic reports (much less those that are far more complete than those disclosed to their patients) to law enforcement agencies \u2014 and there is no suggestion on this record that such a practice is common, or even accepted, even in situations in which mandatory reporting obligations are implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">One final and fundamental distinction between the individual pediatrician and CARES remains: The individual pediatrician does not \u2014 or, at least, not as a routine matter\u2014 seek and obtain information with the conscious concurrent purpose of preserving that information to assist possible future prosecutions. Rather, although the operation of mandatory reporting requirements may compel the communication of certain information to child welfare or law enforcement agencies, that is the <em>consequence, </em>not the <em>purpose, </em>of the individual pediatrician\u2019s inquiries.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Ultimately, on this record, CARES\u2019 purpose of developing and preserving an accurate account of alleged abuse for law enforcement authorities is inextricable from its medical diagnostic purpose. The two are concurrent and coequal; both are \u201cprimary\u201d in the sense that neither takes precedence over the other. It may be that individual interviewers/evaluators subjectively elevate the diagnostic purpose but, institutionally, the evaluation process (including routine police observation and systematic sharing of comprehensive reports with law enforcement agencies) is designed to advance both ends concurrently as part of a \u201cholistic\u201d interview process.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, as in <em>Pitt, </em>a \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the interview process was to \u201c \u2018establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>criminal prosecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pitt, </em>209 Or App at 279 (quoting <em>Davis/Hammon, </em>547 US at 822.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Further, and contrary to the state\u2019s assertion, N\u2019s supposed subjective purpose in making his statements during the CARES interview is largely immaterial to the determination of whether those statements are \u201ctestimonial.\u201d Putting aside the difficulties of assessing the mind of a three-year-old (much less one stipulated to be unavailable to testify at the juvenile hearing six months later \u2018Toy reason of competency\u2019),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the circumstances here are not of the sort \u201cin which the declarant\u2019s purpose in making a statement\u201d substantially \u201cbear[s] on whether the statement is testimonial.\u201d <em>Mack, </em>337 Or at 594. For example, N\u2019s statements were not \u201cunsolicited,\u201d <em>id., </em>but were, instead, elicited during the course of a highly structured interview. <em>Accord Davis/Hammon, </em>547 US at 814 (greater \u201clevel of formality\u2019 in the questioning process militates in favor of determination that responses are \u201ctestimonial\u201d). Nor were those statements elicited during the course of questioning designed to address a continuing \u201cemergency,\u201d akin to a 9-1-1 call. <em>Id. Accord Camarena, </em>344 Or at 39-40 (in determining whether, under <em>Davis, </em>unavailable declarant/caller\u2019s responses to 9-1-1 operator were \u201ctestimonial,\u201d court should not focus \u201cexclusively on the nature of the questions\u201d by the emergency operator but, instead, should also evaluate the declarant\u2019s purposes in making her statements).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>In sum, the preservation of evidence for purposes of future criminal investigation and potential prosecution was a concurrent \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the CARES interview process. Further, CARES had significant involvement with child protective services and law enforcement personnel in this case, beginning with DHS\u2019 initial indirect referral of N to CARES, and continuing through CARES\u2019 provision of its complete evaluation report \u2014 including its \u201ctreatment recommendation\u201d that \u201claw enforcement\u201d engage in \u201cfurther investigation * * * into these allegations of abuse\u201d \u2014 to the Multnomah County Sheriffs Office\u2019s child abuse team. Given those circumstances, CARES was, to a substantial extent, \u201cserving as a proxy for the police,\u201d <em>Mack, </em>337 Or at 593, in interviewing N. Consequently, N\u2019s statements during the CARES interview were \u201ctestimonial\u201d \u2014 and, under <em>Crawford, </em>the juvenile court erred in admitting those statements into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"AodV\">We consider, finally, the effect of that error on either or both of the bases for delinquency jurisdiction in this case. If this were a criminal case, because Crawford-based error is constitutional error, we would review to determine whether the erroneous admission of the CARES interview-related testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>see, e.g., State v. Cook, </em>340 Or 530, 544, 135 P3d 260 (2006) \u2014 and, indeed, the state urges us to engage in that sort of harmless error inquiry here. But this is not a criminal case; it is a juvenile delinquency case \u2014 a case in which we engage in <em>de novo </em>review. ORS 419A.200(6)(a). Specifically, we review the record <em>de novo </em>to determine whether the allegations of the delinquency petition have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. ORS 419C.400(2). Given our <em>de novo </em>review function, the appropriate approach is not to employ the usual appellate \u201charmless error\u201d construct but, instead (subject to an exception addressed below), to engage in <em>de novo </em>review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>record <em>excluding the erroneously admitted testimony recounting N\u2019s statements during the CARES interview. See State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Sauer, </em>189 Or App 78, 84, 73 P3d 293 (2003) (\u201cOn <em>de novo </em>review, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling despite erroneously admitted evidence only if we are convinced that the properly admitted evidence establishes the acts in the petition beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Citation omitted.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">We begin with the allegations pertaining to conduct that, if committed by an adult, would constitute first-degree sexual abuse. As noted, youth confessed to the investigating detectives that, out of sexual curiosity, he had intentionally touched N\u2019s penis. That confession was corroborated, <em>see </em>ORS 136.425(1), by N\u2019s statements to his parents that youth had touched his penis and by N\u2019s demonstration of that conduct to his parents. Other testimony established that youth was, indeed, alone with N at the time that the alleged abuse occurred. Youth did not persuasively dispute the state\u2019s proof. On <em>de novo </em>review, we determine that the record establishes, beyond a reasonable doubt, that youth did, in fact, intentionally touch N\u2019s penis and that, in the totality of the circumstances, including the nature of the relationship between youth and N, that intentional touching was \u201cfor the purpose of * * * gratifying the sexual desire of either party.\u201d ORS 163.305(6). Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s finding of jurisdiction based on conduct that, if committed by an adult, would constitute first-degree sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The proof of the allegation of conduct constituting first-degree sodomy is more problematic. As noted, youth confessed to the detectives that he put N\u2019s penis in his mouth. During the CARES interview, N told the interviewers that youth had tried to suck N\u2019s penis with his mouth \u2014 but, with that evidence excluded from our consideration, we must determine whether other evidence in the record sufficiently corroborates youth\u2019s confession in that regard. <em>See </em>ORS 136.425(1) (\u201c[N]or is a confession only sufficient to warrant the conviction of the defendant without some other proof that the crime has been committed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Aside from youth\u2019s confession, the only properly admitted evidence in this record pertaining to possible sodomy is N\u2019s statement to his parents, on the evening of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>encounter with youth, that \u201cI don\u2019t want to bite [youth\u2019s] penis.\u201d That evidence is legally insufficient to corroborate the act of sodomy alleged in the delinquency petition. <em>See generally State v. Simons, </em>214 Or App 675, 682-83, 167 P3d 476 (2007) (\u201cTo satisfy [ORS 136.425(1)], there must be independent proof of the <em>corpus delicti, </em>that is, that (1) the injury or harm specified in the crime occurred, and (2) that this injury or harm was caused by someone\u2019s criminal activity.\u201d). Specifically, N\u2019s statement that he did not want to bite <em>youth\u2019s </em>penis refers to different conduct than that described in youth\u2019s con<em>fession </em>\u2014 viz., that youth sucked on <em>N\u2019s </em>penis. <em>See State v. Fry, </em>180 Or App 237, 244, 42 P3d 369 (2002) (\u201cProof that a different crime has been committed cannot satisfy that [corroboration] requirement, nor can proof of one charged crime satisfy the requirement as to a different charged crime.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The question of the proper disposition as to the sodomy-related allegations remains. If we were to proceed with our <em>de novo </em>review of the record with respect to those allegations in accordance with the methodology described in <em>Sauer, </em>we would be compelled to reverse the trial court\u2019s finding of jurisdiction based on those allegations, because the properly admitted evidence in this record does not establish the alleged acts beyond a reasonable doubt. However, <em>Sauer </em>itself acknowledged \u2014 and applied \u2014 a prudential exception to that approach where the \u201c \u2018record * * * may have been different if the trial court had ruled correctly\u2019 \u201d on the motion to exclude the improperly admitted evidence. <em>Sauer, </em>189 Or App at 85 (quoting <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Castellano, </em>178 Or App 251, 259, 35 P3d 1144 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Here, although it is doubtful that the state could have, and would have, adduced other evidence corroborating youth\u2019s confession as to the sodomy-related conduct, that is by no means certain. <em>See, e.g., Castellano, </em>178 Or App at 259 (\u201cWe do not know what evidence the parties would have presented or not presented in light of a correct ruling on the motion to suppress.\u201d). Consequently, we vacate the juvenile court\u2019s finding of jurisdiction based on the allegation that youth engaged in conduct that, if committed by an adult, would constitute first-degree sodomy and, consistently with the approach in <em>Sauer </em>and <em>Castellano, </em>remand for forther proceedings pertaining to that allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Juvenile court\u2019s finding of jurisdiction on ground that youth had engaged in conduct that, if committed by an adult, would constitute first-degree sodomy vacated and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-7\"> The acronym originally stood for Child Abuse Response and Evaluation Services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\"> Although CARES generally videotapes interviews with older children and has a one-way observation mirror for police and DHS workers to observe such interviews, the interview of N was not videotaped, nor was it conducted in a room with a one-way mirror.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b167-7\"> As noted below, the trial court admitted those statements into evidence but indicated that N\u2019s identification of youth as the perpetrator was not admissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b168-6\"> OEC 803 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">\u201cThe following are not excluded by [OEC 802] even though the declarant is available as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">\u201c(4) Statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment and describing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof insofar as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b168-10\"> The pertinent text of OEC 803(18a)(b) is set out below. 218 Or App at 137-38.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b168-11\"> We have reordered defendant\u2019s arguments to accord with the first things first methodology prescribed in <em>State v.
