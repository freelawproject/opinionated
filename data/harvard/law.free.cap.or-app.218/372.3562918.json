Count 1 of the indictment involved defendant\u2019s actions toward one victim, while the remaining counts concerned defendant\u2019s actions toward a different victim. On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in failing to merge his convictions for second-degree manslaughter (Count 3) and fourth-degree assault (Count 6) with his conviction for first-degree manslaughter (Count 2), all of which concerned the same victim and the same incident. The state concedes that the trial court erred in that regard, and we agree and accept the concession. On remand, the trial court should enter a judgment merging the convictions for Counts 3 and 6 with Count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">In a supplemental brief, defendant attempts to raise additional issues, including inadequate assistance of counsel and prosecutorial misconduct. Defendant\u2019s supplemental brief does not set forth separate assignments of error or otherwise comply with the format and preservation requirements of ORAP 5.45. Accordingly, we refuse to address the issues raised in the supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Remanded for merger and resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
