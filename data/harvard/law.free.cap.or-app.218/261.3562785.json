J.</author>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">The Columbia River Gorge Commission adopted an amendment to the management plan for the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area. The amendment increased the range of permissible uses of historic properties in the Scenic Area to create economic incentives for the rehabilitation and maintenance of those properties. It applies to all properties that are either listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Multnomah County adopted an ordinance intended to implement the plan amendment. The county ordinance, however, applies only to properties that are actually listed on the National Register. The commission rejected the county\u2019s ordinance because it concluded that the ordinance did not adequately protect the cultural resources of the Scenic Area, which include historic properties. Petitioners, a conservation organization and a number of Scenic Area residents, seek judicial review of that decision, arguing that the county\u2019s ordinance better complies with the requirements of federal law. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">We begin by setting forth the relevant provisions of the applicable federal law, the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act, 16 USC \u00a7\u00a7 544-544p. The Act directs the Columbia River Gorge Commission, a regional agency established by the Act, to adopt a management plan for the Scenic Area to implement the standards and purposes of the Act. 16 USC \u00a7 544d(c), (d). The purposes of the Act are two-fold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">\u201c(1) to establish a national scenic area to protect and provide for the enhancement of the scenic, cultural, recreational, and natural resources of the Columbia River Gorge; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">\u201c(2) to protect and support the economy of the Columbia River Gorge area by encouraging growth to occur in existing urban areas and by allowing future economic development in a manner that is consistent with paragraph (1).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">16 USC \u00a7 544a. As part of its charge to implement the Act, the commission is required to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">\u201cdesignate areas in the scenic area outside special management areas used or suitable for commercial development: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>Provided, </em>That such designation shall encourage, but not require, commercial development to take place in urban areas and shall take into account the physical characteristics of the areas in question and their geographic proximity to transportation, commercial, and industrial facilities and other amenities [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-3\">16 USC \u00a7 544d(b)(5). The management plan must also include a provision to \u201crequire that commercial development outside urban areas take place without adversely affecting the scenic, cultural, recreation, or natural resources of the scenic area.\u201d 16 USC \u00a7 544d(d)(7). \u201cAdversely affecting\u201d is defined as \u201ca reasonable likelihood of more than moderate adverse consequences\u201d for the protected Scenic Area resources. 16 USC \u00a7 544(a). Adverse effects are also defined within the context and intensity of a proposed action, the relationship between a proposed action and other similar actions that are individually insignificant but that may have cumulatively significant impacts, and the mitigation measures that will be implemented as part of a proposed action. 16 USC \u00a7 544(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Under the Act, the six Scenic Area counties receive incentives to adopt local ordinances that implement the provisions of the management plan. <em>See </em>16 USC \u00a7 544i(c)(4) (providing as a condition of making economic development grants that the county have in effect consistent land use ordinances). 16 USC \u00a7 544e(b)(l) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">\u201cWithin sixty days of initial receipt of the management plan, each county shall submit to the Commission a letter stating that it proposes to adopt a land use ordinance consistent with the management plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The Act requires the commission to approve the counties\u2019 local ordinances unless the commission determines that they are inconsistent with the management plan or the Act. 16 USC \u00a7 544e(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The Act provides for judicial review of commission decisions and actions. Among other things, it provides that the state courts of the states of Oregon and Washington have jurisdiction to review any final order or action of the commission relating to the implementation of the Act. 16 USC \u00a7 544m(b)(6)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>With that statutory framework in mind, we trun to the facts giving rise to the dispute in this case. The commission adopted a management plan for the Scenic Area in 1991, and, after a three-year \u201cplan review,\u201d adopted a revised management plan in 2004. Several provisions of the management plan are relevant to the issue in this case. The management plan permits a county to adopt ordinances that \u201cvary from the policies and guidelines in the Management Plan as long as the ordinances provide greater protection for the scenic, cultural, natural, and recreation resources of the Scenic Area\u201d than the management plan itself provides. Although one of the protected resources under the Act, the Act does not define the term \u201ccultural resources.\u201d However, in the management plan, the commission defines a \u201ccultural resource\u201d as \u201c[e]vidence of human occupation or activity that is important in the history, architecture, archaeology or culture of a community or region * * * including] * * * [hjistoric buildings and structures * * * that are at least 50 years old.\u201d The management plan also provides that significant cultural resources are those that are, among other things, \u201cincluded in, or eligible for inclusion in, the National Register of Historic Places.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">On December 13, 2005, the commission approved an amendment to the management plan that authorized a wider range of uses of historic properties than were previously allowed. The portion of the plan amendment relating to adaptive uses provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">\u201c1. Properties in all GMA [general management area] land use designations except Open Space and Agriculture-Special with buildings included on the National Register of Historic Places <em>shall be permitted </em>to be open for public viewing, interpretive displays, and an associated gift shop * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">\u201c2. Properties in all GMA land use designations except Open Space and Agriculture-Special with buildings included on the National Register of Historic Places, and which were former restaurants and/or inns <em>shall be permitted </em>to re-establish these former uses * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">\u201c3. Properties in all GMA land use designations except Open Space and Agriculture-Special with buildings included on the National Register of Historic Places <em>shall be permitted </em>to hold commercial events * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>\u201c4. The following additional review uses <em>may be allowed </em>in all GMA land use designations except Open Space and Agriculture-Special on a property with a building <em>either on or eligible for the National Register for Historic Places </em>and that was 50 years old or older as of January 1, 2006 * * *.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-3\">\u00ab:{: \u2021 \u2021 :|i</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-4\">\u201c5. For the purposes of the guidelines in this section, the term \u2018historic buildings\u2019 refers to buildings either on or eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">As required by the Act for a plan amendment to take effect, the Secretary of Agriculture concurred on January 23, 2006. Four days later, the commission transmitted the plan amendment to the six Scenic Area counties, including Multnomah County. On May 4, 2006, after a series of public workshops, a work session, and public hearings, the county adopted an ordinance that mirrors the first three sections of the commission\u2019s plan amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">However, in a departure from the fourth section of the plan amendment, the county\u2019s ordinance provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-8\">\u201cThe following uses may be allowed as established in each zone on a property with a building <em>included on the National Register of Historic Places </em>and that was 50 years old or older as of January 1, 2006 * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">(Emphasis added.) The ordinance also provides \u201creplacement\u201d wording, mirroring section four of the plan amendment, to take effect immediately in the event that the commission rejected its \u201cpreferred\u201d wording.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">On June 28, 2006, the commission rejected the county\u2019s ordinance on the ground that it is inconsistent with the management plan. In its final order, the commission explained that, although a county ordinance may deviate from the provisions in the management plan to provide greater protection of Scenic Area resources, in this case, the county\u2019s ordinance provides less protection. The commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>reasoned that, because the ordinance limits one of its provisions to historic properties listed on the National Register, and excludes historic properties that are merely list-eligible, it is less protective than the newly amended management plan with regard to cultural resources \u2014 in particular, historic properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">In rejecting the countys \u201cpreferred\u201d wording, the commission acknowledged that, ordinarily, an ordinance that further restricts uses would be more protective of protected resources. However, the commission noted, \u201cdevelopment of historically significant buildings with adaptive uses that generate income * * * provides greater protection of the buildings than just limiting the range of land uses.\u201d After rejecting the countys preferred wording, it approved the countys replacement wording as consistent with the management plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">On judicial review of that decision, petitioners contend that the commission erred in rejecting the countys preferred wording relating to uses that \u201cmay be allowed.\u201d They advance two arguments in support of that contention. First, they argue that the commission erroneously construed its own management plan. According to petitioners, the plan amendment plainly provides that Multnomah County has the discretion to decide whether to permit certain uses authorized by the plan; specifically, they argue, it authorizes the county to determine whether to allow commercial uses only on properties that are listed on the National Register. Second, petitioners argue that the commission erred in concluding that Multnomah Countys ordinance was not as protective as the plan amendment itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">We begin with petitioners\u2019 first argument, which involves the question whether the commission erroneously interpreted its own management plan. Petitioners do not appear to contest that the commission generally is entitled to deference in evaluating its interpretation of its own plan. <em>See Auer v. Robbins, </em>519 US 452, 461, 117 S Ct 905, 137 L Ed 2d 79 (1997) (federal agency construction of agency's own rule is entitled to deference); <em>see also Martin v. OSHRC, </em>499 US 144, 150, 111 S Ct 1171, 113 L Ed 2d 117 (1991) (\u201cIt is well established that an agency\u2019s construction of its own regulations is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>entitled to substantial deference.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)); <em>Don\u2019t Waste Oregon Com. v. Energy Facility Siting, </em>320 Or 132, 142, 881 P2d 119 (1994) (under Oregon law, agency construction of its own rule is entitled to deference). Their argument is that no such deference is warranted in this case because the text of the plan amendment is \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d and reasonably capable of only one construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\">Petitioners contend that the plan amendment begins by setting out three categories of uses that \u201cshall be permitted,\u201d followed by a declaration that certain additional uses \u201cmay be allowed.\u201d Among the uses that \u201cmay be allowed,\u201d petitioners note, are the uses that are the subject of the Multnomah County ordinance \u2014 that is, commercial uses of buildings that are listed on the National Register or are eligible for listing. According to petitioners, the fact that section four of the plan amendment is phrased in the permissive\u2014 employing the word \u201cmay\u201d \u2014 is dispositive. It means, they contend, that the plan amendment plainly confers on the county the discretion to determine whether to allow commercial uses of <em>either </em>properties that are listed <em>or </em>those that are eligible for listing, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">The commission takes issue with petitioners\u2019 reading of the plan amendment. According to the commission, the phrase \u201cmay be allowed\u201d is ambiguous, at best, in that it is phrased in the passive voice and does not make clear precisely <em>who </em>may do the allowing \u2014 the commission or the county. In that respect, the commission contends, this case is remarkably similar to <em>Brentmar v. Jackson County, </em>321 Or 481, 487, 496, 900 P2d 1030 (1995), a case in which the Supreme Court interpreted a statute that listed certain land uses that \u201cmay be established\u201d in areas zoned for exclusive farm use not to permit counties to enact local land use ordinances more restrictive than state law allowed. The commission notes that the court concluded in <em>Brentmar </em>that the passive phrasing of the statute rendered it ambiguous, necessitating <em>resort to </em>legislative history and other aids to construction. In this case, the commission argues, because of the ambiguity in the plan amendment, we are required to defer to its construction as long as it is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>We agree with the commission. We begin by observing that petitioners\u2019 argument is predicated on a false premise \u2014 the asserted \u201cdiametrically different meanings of \u2018may\u2019 and \u2018shall.\u2019 \u201d Of course, petitioners are correct that \u201cmay\u201d and \u201cshall\u201d <em>can </em>connote different things. <em>Compare Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1396 (unabridged ed 2002) (defining \u201cmay\u201d as, among other things, \u201chave the ability or competence * * * to have permission to\u201d), <em>with id. </em>at 2085 (defining \u201cshall\u201d as, among other things, \u201cwill have to : must\u201d (capitalization omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">But it has long been recognized that the two terms, particularly as used in statutes, are not so distinct as their abstract definitions might otherwise suggest. The late Professor David Mellinkoff, for example, noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">\u201c[t]he standard grammatical use of <em>may </em>(permitted) and <em>shall </em>(required) is also a legal use, often described as the \u2018presumed\u2019 use. But <em>may </em>and <em>shall </em>in legal writing, especially in statutes, are so frequently treated as synonyms that the grammatical standard cannot be considered the legal standard. Context and interpretation so easily overwhelm either word.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">David Mellinkoff, <em>Mellinkoff\u2019s Dictionary of American Legal Usage </em>402-03 (1992) (emphases in original). Bryan Gamer similarly has observed that the use of the words \u201cmay\u201d and \u201cshall\u201d is \u201ca horrific muddle.\u201d Bryan A. Gamer, A <em>Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage </em>939 (2d ed 1995). As Garner explains, the word \u201cshall\u201d is especially \u201cslippery,\u201d being subject to at least eight different senses and sometimes shifting meaning in mid-sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">\u201cHow can <em>shall </em>be so slippery, one may ask, when every lawyer knows that it denotes a mandatory action? Well, perhaps every lawyer has heard that it\u2019s mandatory, but very few consistently use it in that way. And, as a result, courts in virtually every English-speaking jurisdiction have held \u2014 by necessity \u2014 that <em>shall </em>means <em>may </em>in. some contexts, and vice-versa.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-8\"><em>Id. </em>(emphases in original); <em>see also </em>ORS 174.100(4) (\u201cmay not\u201d and \u201cshall not\u201d are \u201cequivalent expressions of an absolute prohibition\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">The point is that the meanings of the words are not as concrete and immutable as petitioners suggest. Rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>their meanings depend on the manner in which they are employed in context. In this case, as the commission points out, the intended meaning of the phrasing is anything but clear. That is especially so because of the passive phrasing of the operative language of the plan amendment, which states that \u201c[t]he following additional review uses <em>may be allowed\u201d </em>in certain general management area land use designations. (Emphasis added.) Allowed by whom? The county? The commission?</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\">As the commission correctly observes, in that regard, this case is similar to <em>Brentmar. </em>In that case, the statutes\u2014 ORS 215.213(1) and (2) and ORS 215.283(1) and (2) \u2014 provided, in part, that certain land uses \u201cmay be established\u201d in an exclusive farm use zone. A developer argued that the phrasing of the statute granted permission to individual landowners to establish any of the listed uses, while the county argued that the statute permitted local governments to enact criteria that are more restrictive than the uses listed in the statute. <em>Brentmar, </em>321 Or at 487. For our purposes, it does not matter how the court resolved that dispute. What matters is that the court concluded \u2014 readily\u2014that the phrasing was ambiguous. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cThe operative wording of the statutes is ambiguous.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The same is true in this case. Petitioners\u2019 only argument to the contrary is that the commission\u2019s proposed reading of the plan amendment is foreclosed by the \u201cplain\u201d meaning of the words \u201cmay\u201d and \u201cshall.\u201d But, as we have noted, that argument simply is not tenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Given that the plan amendment is ambiguous, and given that petitioners have identified no other way in which the commission\u2019s interpretation of the plan amendment is contrary to its wording or to any other source of law, we must reject petitioners\u2019 argument that the commission\u2019s rejection of the county\u2019s ordinance was contrary to the plan amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">We turn, then, to petitioners\u2019 alternative argument, that the county\u2019s more limited approach to uses of historic properties is more protective of Scenic Area resources than the plan amendment. As we have noted, the Act permits counties to adopt land use ordinances that are \u201cconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>with\u201d the requirements of the commission\u2019s management plan. The commission has interpreted that requirement to mean that a county\u2019s ordinances must be at least as protective of the scenic, cultural, natural, and recreational resources of the Scenic Area. No one appears to take issue with that interpretation. The dispute centers on whether, in this case, the commission was correct in determining that, by restricting the types of historic properties that may engage in commercial uses, the county\u2019s ordinance was less protective of those Scenic Area resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Petitioners, on the one hand, argue that, by restricting commercial uses in the Scenic Area, the county\u2019s ordinance obviously provides greater protection for Scenic Area resources. The commission responds that the county\u2019s ordinance plainly would limit adaptive uses of historic properties and thus threaten the protection of the cultural resources that the Act requires it to protect. According to the commission, petitioners simply assume that protecting scenic and other resources of the Scenic Area is more important than protecting cultural resources such as historic properties, a priority that the Act simply does not establish. The commission insists that it has fairly weighed the different approaches to protecting <em>all </em>the resources that are subject to protection under the Act, and the fact that petitioners or the county would weigh those approaches differently does not mean that the commission violated the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">We again agree with the commission. Petitioners\u2019 argument indeed amounts to little more than a policy disagreement over how the commission evaluated the best ways to protect the resources of the Scenic Area. Petitioners\u2019 own brief characterizes the dispute as a \u201cpolicy difference about how best to create incentives for the protection and enhancement of historic buildings\u201d and that \u201cthe counties are in a better position to evaluate the impacts created by commercial development.\u201d It is not clear to us precisely on what legal basis petitioners would have us resolve that policy dispute and side with the county against the commission in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Petitioners appear to assume that the Act permits us to substitute our judgment for that of the commission in evaluating whether the county\u2019s ordinance better protects Scenic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Area resources. They cite no authority for that assumption, however. To the extent that the commission\u2019s evaluation of the issue is a legal one, involving the interpretation and application of the Act, we conclude that the Act provides no clear answer and that the commission\u2019s interpretation and application of it is reasonable and entitled to deference under <em>Chevron U. S. A. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, </em>467 US 837, 104 S Ct 2778, 81 L Ed 2d 694 (1984). To the extent that the commission\u2019s evaluation of the issue is an exercise of discretion, petitioners have failed to identify how the evaluation represents an abuse of that discretion. And, to the extent that the commission\u2019s evaluation is, at bottom, a finding of fact, petitioners again have failed to explain how the decision lacks the necessary substantial evidence to support it on judicial review. In short, petitioners have not provided a legal basis for their contention that the commission erred in rejecting the county\u2019s ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-11\"> For ease of subsequent reference to those provisions in this opinion, we refer to them as sections one through four of the plan amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
