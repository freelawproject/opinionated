He argues that the board erred in determining that his injury did not arise in the course and scope of his employment. We review for substantial evidence and errors of law. ORS 656.298(7); ORS 183.482(8); <em>Proctor v. SAIF, </em>123 Or App 326, 328, 860 P2d 828 (1993). For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">We recount the material facts consistently with the board\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Claimant worked as a tow truck driver for employer, a towing company located in southeast Portland. Employer had a contract with the Gresham Police Department to tow impounded vehicles, which required that one of the employer\u2019s trucks arrive at the impounded vehicle\u2019s location within 30 minutes of the tow request. At about 3:00 a.m. on December 15, 2004, claimant was dispatched in response to a call to tow an impounded truck from the parking lot of a Fred Meyer store in Gresham.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">As claimant drove east, responding to the call, he exceeded the posted speed limit. Sergeant O\u2019Keefe of the Gresham Police Department saw claimant speeding, turned on his patrol car\u2019s overhead flashing lights, and began pursuing claimant. When claimant realized that the police were following him, he flashed his own overhead lights and, according to claimant, he also pointed out the window in the direction of the parking lot where he was headed \u2014 just a few blocks away \u2014 all, apparently, in an attempt to signal the police that he was responding to a dispatch request. When O\u2019Keefe continued to follow him with lights flashing, claimant pulled over, precisely 30 minutes after employer had received the dispatch request.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Claimant phoned his dispatcher to tell him that he might not make it to the impounded vehicle in time, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>he had been stopped by the police. The dispatcher told claimant to cooperate with the officer, and claimant responded, \u201cI sure will.\u201d Claimant understood that employer required him to \u201ccomply with police officers when they ask for your identification\u201d and that he could lose his job if he did not so comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">O\u2019Keefe approached the tow truck and requested claimant\u2019s identification. Claimant, however, refused, telling O\u2019Keefe that it was his \u201csovereign right\u201d to refuse to present his driver\u2019s license. O\u2019Keefe explained that claimant was legally obligated to present his driver\u2019s license and that he could be arrested for failing to do so. When claimant persisted in his refusal, O\u2019Keefe told claimant that he was under arrest. At that point, claimant locked his door and started to roll up his window.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">O\u2019Keefe then ordered claimant to get out of the tow truck. Claimant refused. When backup officers arrived, claimant continued to refuse to leave his truck. The officers then used a stun gun to subdue claimant and forcibly removed him from the truck, against his resistance. Once claimant was out of the truck, the officers put him on the ground, briefly pinning him on his stomach by putting a knee on the back of his neck, and handcuffed him. Claimant was cited for speeding, failure to present a license, failure to yield, and resisting arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Five days later, claimant went to the doctor, complaining of neck pain and recurring spasms in the area, with discomfort radiating down both arms. After an MRI, claimant\u2019s doctors diagnosed him with a \u201cdisc protrusion on the left at C4-5, in particular, with left C5 nerve root impingement/ radiculitis,\u201d which they believed was likely caused by the altercation with the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Claimant submitted a claim for the cervical condition. Employer denied that claim, asserting, in part, that the injury had not arisen out of or in the course of claimant\u2019s work.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>The board, which affirmed the decision of the administrative law judge, determined that, under the \u201cunitary work-connection test,\u201d see, <em>e.g., Krushwitz v. McDonald\u2019s </em>Restaurants, 323 Or 520, 525-26, 919 P2d 465 (1996), the injury was not a compensable work-related injury. The board first determined that, because claimant was injured after violating his employer\u2019s directive to comply with police requests for identification, claimant\u2019s cervical injury was not incurred \u201cin the course of\u2019 his employment. After invoking <em>Davis v. R &amp; R Truck </em>Brokers, 112 Or App 485, 829 P2d 732 (1992) (which we address below), the board reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\">\u201cPursuant to the employer\u2019s policy, claimant had 30 minutes to respond to the site to pick up the vehicle. He was traveling between the employer\u2019s shop and the recovered stolen vehicle at the time of the incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASl2\">\u201cHowever, the employer\u2019s dispatcher expressly instructed claimant to comply with the directives of the police. Additionally, claimant understood that the company expected him to comply with police officers if asked for his identification. Therefore, consistent with the reasoning expressed in <em>Davis </em>* * *, claimant\u2019s actions, at the time of the alleged injury, were directly contrary to the expectations and express directive of the employer. Accordingly, consistent with the reasoning expressed in <em>Davis </em>* * *, the circumstances of the incident with the police were outside claimant\u2019s ultimate job duties as a tow-truck driver and do not meet the \u2018in the course of prong of the unitary work-connection test.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">(Footnote and internal citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The board further, and alternatively, reasoned that the circumstances here did not satisfy the \u201carising out of\u2019 component of the applicable inquiry, because the injury here arose from a risk \u201cpersonal\u201d to claimant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">\u201c[CJlaimant\u2019s refusal to provide identification to Sgt. O\u2019Keefe, and subsequent failure to comply with the orders of the police officers resulted in an incident which may have caused his injuries. When he was pulled over, claimant was informed by the employer\u2019s dispatch to cooperate and comply with the police officer. However, claimant told Sgt. O\u2019Keefe that it was his \u2018sovereign right\u2019 not to comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>the officer\u2019s repeated request for identification. Subsequently, claimant resisted and struggled [against] the officers\u2019 attempt to remove him from the tow-truck. Therefore, claimant\u2019s risk was based on activities that were not inherent to the job and not while claimant was engaged in his usual employment. Any injury that was sustained occurred as a result of claimant\u2019s personal belief that he did not have to comply with the officers\u2019 orders. <em>Thus, claimant\u2019s risk of injury from not complying with the orders of the police officers arose from a personal confrontation and therefore represented a \u2018personal risk.\u2019 </em>\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">On judicial review, claimant contends that his injury was sufficiently related to his work to be compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law. He asserts, particularly, that his injury occurred \u201cin the course of\u2019 his employment, as he was responding to a towing request, and that the injury \u201carose from\u201d a work-related risk, <em>viz., </em>being stopped while speeding to the site of a tow, and not a personal risk. Claimant contends, alternatively, that he was a \u201ctraveling employee,\u201d and, because he was not on a \u201cdistinct departure from his employment activities while on a personal mission,\u201d he was within the scope of his employment when he sustained the injury. For the reasons that follow, we agree with claimant\u2019s first contention and, hence, do not address the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">1-3. To be compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, an injury must \u201caris[e] out of and in the course of employment * * ORS 656.005(7)(a). In <em>Fred Meyer, Inc. v. Hayes, </em>325 Or 592, 596-97, 943 P2d 197 (1997), the Supreme Court summarized the controlling inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-7\">\u201cThe \u2018arise out of prong of the compensability test requires that a causal link exist between the worker\u2019s injury and his or her employment. The requirement that the injury occur \u2018in the course of the employment concerns the time, place, and circumstances of the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">\u201cThis court views the two prongs as two parts of a single \u2018work-connection\u2019 inquiry, that is, whether the relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>between the injury and the employment is sufficient that the injury should be compensable. * * * Both prongs of the work-connection test must be satisfied to some degree; neither is dispositive. The work-connection test may be satisfied if the factors supporting one prong of the statutory test are minimal while the factors supporting the other prong are many. Both prongs serve as analytic tools for determining whether, in the light of the policy for which that determination is to be made, the causal connection between the injury and the employment is sufficient to warrant compensation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">(Footnotes and internal citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Tracking the board\u2019s analysis, we begin with the \u201cin the course of\u2019 element. Here, as the board acknowledged with respect to the \u201ctime\u201d and \u201cplace\u201d facets of that element, claimant was, in fact, responding to a tow call at the time that he was stopped, leading to the interaction that culminated in his injury. Nevertheless, the board concluded that claimant\u2019s violation of the employer\u2019s directive to cooperate in presenting identification to the police so transgressed the boundaries of claimant\u2019s \u201cultimate job duties\u201d that his subsequent injuries were not incurred \u201cin the course of\u2019 his employment. The board erred in so concluding.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\"><em>Andrews v. Tektronix, Inc., </em>323 Or 154, 915 P2d 972 (1996), describes the controlling principles. In <em>Andrews, </em>the claimant worked for a plumbing company, and his job responsibilities included purchasing and delivering parts and equipment. 323 Or at 157. After the claimant told his supervisor that he had a history of back injuries, the supervisor directed him not to engage in heavy lifting. <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, the claimant was sent to deliver some parts to a restaurant, and an employee of a coffee company asked if the claimant would help carry a heavy espresso machine into the restaurant; the claimant agreed, and he injured his back. <em>Id. </em>at 157-58. The board determined that the injury was not compensable because it resulted from conduct, viz., heavy lifting, which the employer had directed the claimant not to perform \u2014 that is, that the injury-producing activity was outside the \u201c \u201cboundaries of [the] claimant\u2019s ultimate work duties.\u2019 <em>\u201d Id. </em>at 159 (quoting board\u2019s order).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>The Supreme Court reversed and remanded for reconsideration. The court began by rejecting the employer\u2019s proposition that violation of any work rule necessarily evinced such \u201ca rejection by the claimant of the employer\u2019s right of direction and control\u201d as to abrogate \u201cthe claimant\u2019s status as a [subject] worker.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162. In that regard, the court pointed to case law sustaining the compensability of injuries incurred in the course of on-the-job \u201chorseplay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">The Supreme Court then endorsed the principle that the touchstone of \u201cwork-connectedness\u201d is whether the injury-producing activity was within the boundaries of a claimant\u2019s \u201cultimate work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163-64. In so holding, the court \u2014 while disparaging the use of the term \u201cmisconduct\u201d\u2014 endorsed the following distinction, which it had quoted earlier:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">\u201c \u2018When misconduct involves a prohibited overstepping of the boundaries defining the <em>ultimate work </em>to be done by the claimant, the prohibited act is outside the course of employment. But when misconduct involves a violation of regulations or prohibitions relating to the <em>method </em>of accomplishing that ultimate work, the act remains within the course of employment.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 159 (quoting Arthur Larson, 1A <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 31.00, 6-10 (1995) (emphases in Larson)).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Finally, the court emphasized that, even with respect to employer directives that purport to circumscribe \u201cthe boundaries of the claimant\u2019s ultimate work, a worker\u2019s disobedience is not necessarily determinative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165. Rather, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-8\">\u201c[T]he facts that an employer has instructed a worker to avoid certain work, and that the worker\u2019s injury occurred when he or she disregarded that instruction, are only two of many factors that must be considered in the overall calculation of work-connectedness. Among the additional factors are the degree of connection between what the worker is authorized to do and is forbidden to do, the degree of judgment and latitude normally given the worker, workplace customs and practices, the relative risk to the worker when compared to the benefit to the employer, and the like. Moreover, when a worker\u2019s failure to follow a work-defining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>instruction <em>is </em>taken into consideration, the manner in which the instruction was conveyed, and the worker\u2019s consequent perception of the instruction\u2019s purpose and scope, also must be considered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-4\">\u201cTo conclude otherwise would be to approve a scheme whereby employers could insulate themselves from workers\u2019 compensation liability simply by providing the narrowest possible job descriptions to their employees, and instructing them to avoid <em>any </em>work that is not in either scope or manner precisely within the tasks thus assigned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphases in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\"><em>Andrews </em>is highly instructive here. Most significantly, the Supreme Court in <em>Andrews </em>adopted the principle that the violation of an employer rule \u201c \u2018relating to the <em>method </em>of accomplishing [the] ultimate work\u2019 \u201d is <em>not </em>outside the course of employment. 323 Or at 159 (quoting Larson, 1A <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 31.00 at 6-10) (emphasis in original). Here, claimant\u2019s \u201cultimate work\u201d was responding to tow calls and performing tows. We do not understand employer to dispute that, given the nature of its business, including the \u201c30-minute\u201d response obligation, claimant\u2019s work necessarily involved some interaction with law enforcement personnel. <em>How </em>claimant interacted with police officers, including with respect to presenting identification upon demand, related to the \u201cmethod\u201d of performing that \u201cultimate work.\u201d Consequently, claimant\u2019s violation of employer\u2019s directive notwithstanding, his injury was incurred \u201cin the course of\u2019 his employment. <em>Accord Patterson v. SAIF, </em>64 Or App 652, 656, 669 P2d 829 (1983) (where the claimant security guard had \u201cthe assigned task of removing an unruly patient from the employer\u2019s premises\u201d and was injured in releasing the patient after driving him to downtown Portland in violation of the employer\u2019s policy against transporting unwanted persons beyond the limits of the employer\u2019s property, the claimant\u2019s injury was \u201csufficiently work-related to be compensable\u201d because the employer\u2019s rule did not delineate \u201cthe boundaries defining his ultimate job responsibilities\u201d but, instead, \u201cgoverned] the <em>method </em>of accomplishing his ultimate work\u201d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number><em>Davis, </em>which the board invoked, is not to the contrary \u2014 and, indeed, corroborates our conclusion. In that case, the claimant was a truck driver for an employer in Turner, Oregon, near Salem. 112 Or App at 487. The employer instructed the claimant, who was in Washington state, to return the truck immediately to Turner. <em>Id. </em>Notwithstanding those instructions, the claimant picked up some family members in Turner, without stopping at the employer\u2019s yard, and then proceeded south on Interstate 5, having dinner and a drink in Canyonville, and continuing on to just north of Grants Pass, where he was injured in an accident when the truck flipped over. <em>Id. </em>at 487-88. The board determined that the claimant\u2019s injuries were not compensable because he was no longer in the course of his employment when, contrary to the employer\u2019s express directions, he drove to Grants Pass rather than returning the truck to Turner. <em>Id. </em>at 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">We affirmed. After quoting Larson\u2019s distinction between employer directives \u201c \u2018defining the <em>ultimate work </em>to be done by the claimant\u2019 \u201d and those \u201c \u2018relating to [the] <em>method </em>of accomplishing that ultimate work,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 491 (quoting Larson, 1A <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 31.00 at 6-10) (emphases in original), we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-5\">\u201cClaimant\u2019s misconduct in this case was more than a violation of a regulation or prohibition relating to the method of accomplishing his work. He was specifically told to return the truck and to stop working. Instead, he refused to do either and continued on toward Grants Pass, contrary to his job responsibilities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-6\"><em>Id. </em>Thus, in <em>Davis </em>(unlike in this case), the employer\u2019s directives explicitly defined the temporal and spatial limitations of the claimant\u2019s \u201cultimate work\u201d and claimant\u2019s conduct was patently beyond the scope of those boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Employer remonstrates that claimant\u2019s conduct nevertheless exceeded the \u201cultimate boundaries of his employment\u201d because it \u201cactively contravened the interests and purposes of his economic relationship with the employer\u201d and \u201cultimately <em>prevented </em>completion of the purpose of [the] very trip in which he was engaged.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) We disagree. The violation of many, if not most, workplace rules pertaining to the method of performance may subvert a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>worker\u2019s \u201ceconomic relationship\u201d with the employer by delaying or impairing the performance of the ultimate work or by increasing the cost of such performance. Consequently, employer\u2019s proposed analysis would frequently effectively conflate the distinction between violation of directives \u201cdefining the ultimate work\u201d and those \u201crelating to the method of accomplishing that ultimate work,\u201d which the Supreme Court confirmed in <em>Andrews, </em>and which we applied in <em>Davis </em>and <em>Patterson. </em>\u201cIn the course of\u2019 does not bear such gloss.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">We thus conclude that claimant\u2019s injury did occur \u201cin the course of\u2019 his employment. However, as noted, to establish the requisite connection to his employment, claimant must also establish the conjunctive \u201carising out of\u2019 element. <em>See Fred Meyer, Inc. v. Hayes, </em>325 Or at 596 (\u201cBoth prongs of the work-connection test must be satisfied to some degree; neither is dispositive.\u201d); <em>see also Redman Industries, Inc. v. Lang, </em>326 Or 32, 35, 943 P2d 208 (1997) (\u201cUnder [the work-connection] test, both elements must be satisfied to some degree. * * * However, the two elements need not be met to the same degree.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">In <em>Redman Industries, Inc., </em>the Supreme Court summarized the substance of the \u201carising out of\u2019 element:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">\u201c[T]he inquiry into whether an injury \u2018arises out of employment\u2019 tests the causal connection between the injury and the employment. A causal connection requires more than a mere showing that the injury occurred at the workplace and during working hours. A causal connection must be linked to a risk connected with the nature of the work or a risk to which the work environment exposed claimant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">326 Or at 35-36 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\"> In assessing whether a \u201crisk\u201d bears the requisite nexus to employment, the Oregon Supreme Court has consistently invoked and applied the following formulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-9\">\u201c \u2018All risks causing injury to a claimant can be brought within three categories: risks distinctly associated with the employment, risks personal to the claimant, and \u2018neutral\u2019 risks \u2014 i.e., risks having no particular employment or personal character. Harms from the first are universally compensable. Those from the second are universally noncompensable. It is within the third category that most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>controversy in modern compensation law occurs. The view that the injury should be deemed to arise out of employment if the conditions of employment put claimant in a position to be injured by the neutral risk is gaining increased acceptance.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><em>Phil A. Livesley Co. v. Russ, </em>296 Or 25, 29-30, 672 P2d 337 (1983) (quoting Arthur Larson, 1 <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 7.00, 3-11 (1978)); <em>see also Panpat v. Owens-Brockway Glass Container, </em>334 Or 342, 349-50, 49 P3d 773 (2002) (applying that formulation); <em>Redman Industries, Inc., </em>326 Or at 36 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Here, claimant\u2019s injury was not the product of a \u201cneutral\u201d risk \u2014 that is, a risk without a \u201cparticular employment or personal character.\u201d <em>Phil A. Livesley Co., </em>296 Or at 30 (quoting Larson, 1 <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 7.00 at 3-11).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consequently, our disposition turns on whether the operative risk of injury here was \u201cpersonal to the claimant\u201d or, instead, was \u201cdistinctly associated with the employment.\u201d <em>Panpat, </em>334 Or at 350; <em>Redman Industries, Inc., </em>326 Or at 38-40. For the reasons that follow, we determine that claimant\u2019s injury resulted from a risk that was sufficiently related to his work to establish the \u201carising out of\u2019 element. Our conclusion in that regard rests largely on our understanding <em>o\u00ed Redman Industries, Inc., </em>and <em>Panpat.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">In <em>Redman Industries, Inc., </em>the claimant was assaulted and injured by his coworker, who had become angry after the claimant had called the assailant a series of racially charged names. 326 Or at 34-35. The claimant then filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim for the injuries he had sustained. <em>Id. </em>His employer denied his claim, arguing that the claimant\u2019s injury did not arise out of his employment because the claimant had created the risk himself, by inciting his coworker. The board determined that the claimant\u2019s injuries were compensable, but, on judicial review, we disagreed. <em>See Redman Industries, Inc. v. Lang, </em>142 Or App 404, 921 P2d 992 (1996). We determined that the claimant\u2019s injuries did not \u201carise out of\u2019 his employment because the assault was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>not precipitated by a \u201cwork-related dispute\u201d but, instead, \u201carose from [the] claimant\u2019s use of racially derogatory remarks in an attempt to \u2018joke\u2019 with a coworker.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 408-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">The Supreme Court reversed, concluding that the claimant\u2019s injuries did arise from a work-related risk. <em>Redman Industries, Inc., </em>326 Or at 38-42. The court began by observing that \u201c[t]he normal work environment necessitates that employees work together and exposes them to each other, based solely on their employment status.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38. That proximity, in turn, exposes employees to the risk of assault by coworkers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">\u201cJust as the workplace exposes an employee to a myriad of risks that inhere in the physical workplace environment \u2014 such as machines and office equipment that can malfunction \u2014 the workplace also exposes employees to the risk that a coworker may lose control of his or her emotions and assault the employee. Whether the coworker\u2019s loss of control is connected to a work-related comment is not dis-positive. That difference does not, <em>ipso facto, </em>distinguish those cases that can be deemed to arise out of employment from those that cannot. Employee interactions cannot be so easily isolated and compartmentalized. The most direct cause of an assault by a coworker may be a criticism of another employee\u2019s work, lack of hygiene or fashion sense. However, in any such case, the criticism may be but the last of many straws precipitating the assault. Based on the foregoing reasoning, we hold that the risk of an assault by a coworker in the workplace is a risk to which the work environment exposes an employee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">That principle, however, is not unqualified. Rather:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">\u201cWhen the motivation for an assault by a coworker is an event or circumstance pertaining to the assailant and the claimant that originated entirely separate from the workplace, and the only contribution made by the workplace is to provide a venue for the assault, then the rationale does not apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-9\"><em>Id. </em>An example of circumstances falling within that exception would be \u201cwhere two employees had a romantic relationship outside of work and a workplace assault by one on the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>was based on an event unique to that relationship and was not fueled, in part, by any workplace event.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">The Supreme Court then concluded that the claimant\u2019s injury \u201carose out of\u2019 his employment because \u201cthere is no evidence that [the] claimant and his assailant had any relationship outside of work or that the motivation for the assault was fueled by an occurrence involving them outside of work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In that regard, the court emphasized that \u201c[t]he reasonableness or offensiveness of claimant\u2019s racially derogatory comments is irrelevant to this inquiry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41 n 4 (citing <em>Clark v. U.S. Plywood, </em>288 Or 255, 265, 605 P2d 265 (1980) (contention that \u201ccompensability is determined by the reasonableness of the worker\u2019s conduct has no foundation in the workers\u2019 compensation statutes or in Oregon case law\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\"><em>Panpat </em>turned on the exception, recognized in <em>Redman Industries, Inc., </em>to the general principle of compensability of workplace assault-related injuries. In <em>Panpat, </em>the assailant, Blake, and the victim were both employed at the defendant\u2019s manufacturing plant and became romantically involved. 334 Or at 345. After the romantic relationship ended, Blake was distraught and disturbed, and, after the victim informed the defendant employer that Blake had called her derogatory names, Blake was placed on medical leave. <em>Id. </em>However, while on medical leave, Blake returned to the defendant\u2019s plant and shot and killed the victim and then killed himself. <em>Id. </em>at 345-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The victim\u2019s personal representative brought a wrongful death action against the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 346.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant moved for summary judgment, contending, in part, that the tort action was barred by the \u201cexclusive remedy\u201d provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, ORS 656.018(l)(a). <em>Panpat, </em>334 Or at 346. The trial court initially granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on that ground but then allowed a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 346-47. We reversed, concluding that the exclusivity provision of the workers\u2019 compensation statutes controlled and that the newly discovered evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>immaterial to the correct analysis. <em>Panpat v. Owens-Brockway Glass Container, </em>172 Or App 470, 475-80, 21 P3d 97 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">The Supreme Court, in turn, reversed our decision and remanded. The gravamen of the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning was that workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity did not apply because the victim\u2019s death had not arisen out of her employment. <em>Panpat, </em>334 Or at 349-52. In so holding, the court referred to <em>Redman Industries, Inc.\u2019s, </em>example of coworkers engaged in a romantic relationship and then reasoned that the pivotal consideration was \u201cthe <em>motivation </em>for the assault and whether that motivation \u2018originated entirely separate from the workplace.\u2019 \u201d 334 Or at 351 (quoting <em>Redman Industries, Inc., </em>326 Or at 40) (emphasis in <em>Panpat). </em>The Supreme Court concluded that, because Blake\u2019s motivation for killing the victim arose from personal reasons rather than risks \u201c \u2018distinctly associated with the employment,\u2019 \u201d 334 Or at 351-52 <em>(quotingRedman Industries, Inc., </em>326 Or at 37), the victim\u2019s death did not \u201carise out of\u2019 her employment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In sum, both <em>Redman Industries, Inc., </em>and <em>Panpat </em>endorse the general principle that, where the nature of the work necessarily exposes the employee to proximate interaction with third persons in the course of performing the work, the risk of injury-producing physical contact with such persons is sufficiently related to employment to satisfy the \u201carising out of\u2019 element. That is, in general, the risk of injury from such interaction \u201cresults from the nature of the claimant\u2019s work or from the work environment.\u201d <em>Redman Industries, Inc., </em>326 Or at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The sole qualification to that general principle pertains to the <em>assailant\u2019s </em>motivation: If \u201cthe <em>motivation </em>for the assault * * * \u2018originated entirely separate from the workplace,\u2019 \u201d then the risk of injury was \u201cpersonal,\u201d not \u201cwork-related,\u201d and the injury did not \u201carise out of\u2019 the employment. <em>Panpat, </em>334 Or at 351 (quoting <em>Redman Industries, Inc., </em>326 Or at 40) (emphasis in <em>Panpat). </em>The injured claimant\u2019s subjective state of mind, including with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>engaging in conduct that precipitated the \u201cassault\u2019Vinjurious conduct is immaterial to the \u201carising out of\u2019 inquiry. <em>See, e.g., Redman Industries, Inc., </em>326 Or at 41 n 4 (rejecting any consideration of the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the claimant\u2019s use of racially derogatory language as \u201cirrelevant\u201d to the determination of compensability).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">Consistently with those principles, claimant\u2019s injury here was sufficiently \u201clinked to a risk connected with the nature of the work or a risk to which the work environment exposed [the] claimant,\u201d <em>Redman Industries, Inc., </em>326 Or at 36, to satisfy the \u201carising out of\u2019 requirement. Just as the Supreme Court explained in <em>Redman Industries, Inc., </em>that \u201c[t]he normal work environment necessitates that employees work together and exposes them to each other, based solely on their employment status,\u201d 326 Or at 38, here, claimant\u2019s work environment exposed him to numerous and diverse risks and dynamics associated with driving and involving interactions with third persons, such as other drivers and law enforcement personnel. One obvious example \u2014 which we understand that employer here would not dispute \u2014 is the risk of a tow truck driver being involved in an accident with another motorist, while speeding in response to a tow call, and then being assaulted by that motorist because of anger and frustration over the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Similarly, the risk of proximate interaction with law enforcement officers after being stopped for speeding, while responding to a tow call, is manifestly a risk related to claimant\u2019s employment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Further \u2014 albeit (fortunately) only rarely \u2014 such interactions can escalate, sometimes resulting in physical injury. In that regard, the assessment of the injury-producing risk here is qualitatively no different than that pertaining to an assault by an angry motorist \u2014 or, for that matter, an assault by a coworker. Each is extraordinary \u2014 for example, being assaulted by a coworker is hardly the \u201cnorm\u201d in most employment environments \u2014 but each is \u201ca risk to which the work environment exposed [the] claimant.\u201d <em>Redman Industries, Inc., </em>326 Or at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>To be sure, claimant\u2019s refusal to present his identification and his subsequent refusal to leave his truck precipitated the officers\u2019 efforts to forcibly remove him from the truck. Thus, it may well be that, but for claimant\u2019s idiosyncratic personal beliefs, he would never have been injured. But the same was true of the claimant in <em>Redman Industries, Inc. </em>\u2014 and the Supreme Court there explicitly refused to consider the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the claimant\u2019s precipitating conduct. <em>See Redman Industries, Inc., </em>326 Or at 41 n 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Rather, in <em>Redman Industries, Inc. </em>(and, of necessity, in <em>Panpat), </em>the Supreme Court focused exclusively on the motivation of the third party whose conduct injured the employee. Here, as in <em>Redman Industries, Inc. </em>\u2014 and unlike in <em>Panpat </em>\u2014 the motivation for the allegedly injurious conduct did not originate \u201centirely separate from the workplace, [with] the only contribution made by the workplace [being] to provide a venue\u201d for that conduct. <em>Redman Industries, Inc., </em>326 Or at 40. Accordingly, claimant\u2019s injury did \u201carise out of\u2019 his employment. ORS 656.005(7)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">In sum, we conclude that claimant has established to some degree each element of the work-connection test and that, in the circumstances of this case, the combination of those elements demonstrates that \u201cthe causal connection between the injury and the employment is sufficient to warrant compensation.\u201d <em>Fred Meyer, Inc., </em>325 Or at 597. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for the board to consider employer\u2019s unaddressed alternative arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b420-8\"> Claimant contends that the board\u2019s findings were deficient in several respects. We do not address those contentions because they do not affect our ultimate analysis and disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b421-8\"> Employer contended, alternatively, that, in all events, claimant had a preexisting cervical condition that was the major contributing cause of any injury resulting from the incident.
