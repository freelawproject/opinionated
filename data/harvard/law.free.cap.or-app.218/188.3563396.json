J.</author>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Mother appeals the termination of her parental rights to her child, M.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> M is now six years old and has spent more than half of her young life in foster care. She was first placed in foster care at age 19 months after mother expressed thoughts of murdering M and then killing herself. M was returned to mother over a year later, even though the case worker was concerned about mother\u2019s limited ability to cope. Approximately 9 months after M was returned, and despite mother receiving strong support from her church community and DHS, mother relinquished custody of M to DHS, and DHS sought termination of mother\u2019s parental rights. After a trial, the juvenile court ordered that mother\u2019s rights to M be terminated on the ground of unfitness. We review <em>de novo, </em>giving weight to the credibility findings of the juvenile court. ORS 419A.200(6)(b); <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Proctor, </em>167 Or App 18, 27, 2 P3d 405, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>169 Or App 606, 10 P3d 332 (2000). We conclude that there is clear and convincing evidence that mother is unfit and that reintegration of M into her home is improbable within a reasonable time given mother\u2019s and M\u2019s psychological needs. We further conclude that termination of mother\u2019s parental rights is in M\u2019s best interests. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Mother, 24 years old at the time of trial, had a difficult and unstable childhood marked by neglect, physical and sexual abuse, institutionalization, and suicide attempts. When mother was 16, she ran away to escape the abuse and became a ward of the court. After a series of sexually and emotionally abusive placements, mother was institutionalized, where she began cutting herself and attempted suicide multiple times. Psychological testing during her institutionalization revealed a differential diagnosis that included depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, and multiple personality disorder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aiq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Shortly after her eighteenth birthday, mother was released from an institution and moved back in with her mother, who soon kicked her out. Mother then met a man over the Internet who gave her a place to stay in exchange for sex, and she became pregnant with M. During her pregnancy, mother was depressed and homeless. She eventually moved back in with her mother and gave birth to M in October 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">In December 2002, when M was a little over a year old, mother moved to Oregon to live with and care for her great-grandmother. According to mother\u2019s cousin Gwendolyn Cooks, mother\u2019s great-grandmother was <em>\u201ca </em>little set in her ways and used to being alone\u201d and did not want mother to \u201cchild-proof the home by moving things around.\u201d Mother and M soon moved out and stayed in a series of homeless shelters and with Cooks. Cooks testified that mother left her home after one month because Cooks had agreed to house her and M only for that period of time and, in retrospect, she wishes she had supported mother more. The record does not conclusively reveal where mother went after leaving Cooks\u2019s home, but it does reveal that mother and M stayed in several different homeless shelters and with a woman named Carol Steffans, whom she considered her \u201cspiritual mother,\u201d before M was removed during the summer of 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In early 2003, mother sought public assistance and participated in a related self-sufficiency program that included employment assistance, high school classes, and a mental health assessment by Whitney Ziemak. Ziemak saw mother several times over six months. She testified that mother openly disclosed a history of extensive childhood trauma and \u201cwas reaching out for support for herself \u2014 for her emotions and for her parenting abilities.\u201d Mother told Ziemak that her depression was \u201cinterfering in her ability to maintain her [s]elf-[s]ufficiency case plant,] which was approximately 30 hours of job search and classes.\u201d She also expressed \u201cthat it was difficult for her to know how to parent [M] because she had never had that role model when she was growing up.\u201d Mother \u201cwas open to working with a parent support agency\u2019 to learn parenting skills. As part of the self-sufficiency program, Ziemak referred mother for a psychological evaluation. In February 2003, psychologist Pamela Joffe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>evaluated mother and concluded that she was moderately depressed and experiencing anxiety about finding employment and housing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Joffe and Ziemak both recommended that mother seek counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">After being prodded by Ziemak to make an appointment at Options Counseling, mother saw licensed clinical social worker Juveen Buckner for an intake assessment in March 2003. Mother told Buckner that she \u201cwould like to begin dealing with her past,\u201d \u201cto learn how to be a positive parent to her child,\u201d and \u201cto develop a positive support system.\u201d Buckner diagnosed mother with depression and possibly post-traumatic stress disorder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mother then began working with therapist Fransiska Bischof of Options Counseling. Bischof, who treated mother over the course of seven months, diagnosed her with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and, on Axis II, a personality disorder not otherwise specified (NOS) with borderline and dependent features.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Lisa Mills, an employment specialist with the self-sufficiency program, testified that mother\u2019s participation in the program was \u201caverage.\u201d She was concerned, however, about mother\u2019s lack of understanding of M\u2019s developmental needs. In February 2003, mother reported that M, who had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>been suffering from chronic ear infections, \u201cwas really pissing her off\u201d by being \u201cfussy\u201d and not \u201cwanting] to sit still.\u201d Mills explained to mother that M\u2019s ears were probably bothering her, and that M, who was less than 18 months old, lacked the cognitive ability to intentionally misbehave. Mother replied \u201cthat [M] was being a spoiled brat and [ ] knows that she can\u2019t run around when [mother was] using the phone at the shelter.\u201d Daycare provider Karen Dirks was also concerned about mother\u2019s ability to parent M after she noticed that, although M acted like a normal child and was well-groomed, mother \u201cwas more interested in [herself] than her child\u201d and paid little attention to M when dropping her off for the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Mother did, however, exhibit some progress in learning to parent. She told Ziemak that she \u201clearned from other parents while living in [the] shelter that she should not be hitting her child.\u201d Mother reported to Ziemak that \u201c[s]he tries not to hit [M] now but admits she is easily frustrated and angered and doesn\u2019t know how to make the child listen.\u201d Both Mills and Ziemak recommended that mother take parenting classes or seek assistance from parenting relief agencies. Mother contacted two parenting programs, but she did not enroll in classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">In addition to her lack of understanding of M\u2019s developmental needs, Mother also struggled to provide M with proper medical care. Mother brought M to Dr. Dennis Diaz in February 2003 for treatment of M\u2019s recurrent ear infections, and Diaz recommended surgically implanting tubes in M\u2019s ears, which would require post-surgical care every four months. M received the surgery, and, although Diaz testified that he told mother to bring M back every four months, mother failed to follow through with those instructions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Also in February 2003, an unknown source reported to DHS that mother was leaving M alone in the bathtub. The next month, DHS caseworker Chad Tucker visited mother at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>the shelter where they were living to investigate. Tucker noted that M \u201clooked healthy and well cared for\u201d and that the shelter \u201cwas clean and appropriate.\u201d Mother told Tucker that she was involved in services, including the self-sufficiency program, and that she was seeing a counselor at Options Counseling. That same month, an employee at a parenting support agency visited mother and reported to Ziemak that where she was living looked safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">The next month, an unknown source reported to DHS that M might not be. receiving proper medical care for her ears. Tucker called M\u2019s pediatrician, who reported that \u201che thought that [M] was a very healthy young girl and that he was seeing her on a regular basis.\u201d He also reported that her ears looked healthy at that time.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Tucker ultimately concluded that the referral was unfounded and had no further contact with mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In May 2003, M was referred to an early-childhood intervention program. Valerie Close, the co-director of that program, visited mother at the shelter on the last day of her stay.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Close concluded that it would not have been a good time to evaluate M because mother was distraught, and she asked that mother contact her to set up another appointment. Mother never contacted Close to set up an evaluation,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but Close called DHS with concerns about M\u2019s safety after seeing mother treat M \u201croughly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">On June 6, 2003, mother reported to Ziemak that her depression was worsening and inhibiting her ability to look for housing or employment. At that time, mother and M were living in another shelter. Mother told Ziemak that she thought of suicide daily, and that she thought about killing M and then herself because she did not have anyone to care for M. Mother also told Ziemak that \u201cshe does not feel she knows how to love, was never taught, so [she] feels [M] is just a responsibility and does not love her.\u201d Ziemak called DHS and reported that mother was experiencing suicidal ideation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>struggling with parenting, housing, and other stability issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Three days after Ziemak\u2019s report, DHS removed M from mother\u2019s care and filed a petition on M\u2019s behalf alleging that mother subjected M to threat of harm as a result of an emotional or mental condition. DHS agreed to refer mother to the relief nursery, to refer mother for a psychological evaluation, and to provide mother with a bus pass and supervised visitations. Mother agreed to attend Lane Community College, to continue counseling, and to work with her mentors to improve her parenting skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">After M was removed, mother began working with DHS caseworker Laura Castleton, who referred mother for parenting training, assisted mother in moving into an apartment, and referred mother to a family resource worker. She also referred mother for a second psychological evaluation by Joffe.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">In July 2003, Joffe saw mother to assess what services mother might need. Joffe administered psychological testing to determine whether mother was depressed, and mother scored within the minimal range of depression. A month earlier, however, mother had reported to Ziemak that her depression was worsening, and Joffe noted that her score was inconsistent with her current life circumstances, possibly as a result of defensiveness. Nevertheless, Joffe opined that if mother participated in therapy and parenting training, she may be able to successfully parent M.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Although mother told Joffe that she \u201c[didn\u2019t] like counseling, period\u201d and particularly with a non-Christian counselor like Bischof, mother followed through with her agreement to continue counseling by seeing Susan Cummings. Cummings, who did not testify and whose records were not produced at the termination trial, told Castelton that mother had made good progress and was compliant with her appointments.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Castleton referred mother to parenting training with Gretchen Dubie in June 2003. Dubie testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>mother \u201ctended to be very directive of her daughter\u2019s play, often interrupting her,\u201d and \u201cwas very rigid around rules of [M\u2019s] play, * * * [s]ometimes based on her own need.\u201d Mother also \u201chad difficulty managing [M\u2019s] behaviors when [M] was upset * * * or challenging her directives,\u201d and on at least one occasion Dubie saw mother speaking to M \u201cin a harsh tone of voice\u201d and \u201cwhisk[ing] her up very abruptly and forcefully * * * telling her to stop [crying].\u201d When the parenting trainer working with mother on that day suggested that mother not touch M when she is angry, mother \u201cacted incredulous and asked, \u2018So you just want me to let her stand there and cry?\u2019 \u201d Mother also once told an interventionist that she \u201cused to hate, I mean, <em>hate </em>my daughter * * * I would leave her alone in the bathtub and other stuff \u2019cause I didn\u2019t care.\u201d Mother told Dubie she was depressed and expressed \u201ca lot of animosity\u201d toward DHS, making it difficult for her to have a positive attitude. Dubie also noted, however, that mother and M \u201cwere very attached\u201d and had many good interactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Between September 2003 and December 2003, Dubie and others worked with mother to help her play with M, to notice and respond to M\u2019s cues, and to manage her frustrations when dealing with M. Mother asked a lot of questions, was very open, and successfully completed all of her assignments. Over time, Dubie \u201csaw small amounts of progress with [mother]\u201d learning to respond to M\u2019s cues and play uninterrupted, but she \u201chad more concerns regarding her sporadic temperament and presentation each week.\u201d Although Dubie discussed with mother the need to have a formal safety plan in place to deal with her depression, mother \u201cdidn\u2019t see the need\u201d for it \u201cbecause God took away [her] depression.\u201d Mother dismissed the parent trainers\u2019 concerns because \u201cpeople at her church know [what to do about M] and could help\u201d her.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">While in foster care, M exhibited several disturbing behaviors, including violent outbursts involving her foster siblings, smearing her feces, hoarding food, and excessively clinging to her foster mother. Because some of those behaviors appeared to be triggered by M\u2019s visits with mother, M was referred to therapist Jayne Smith for counseling. Smith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>diagnosed M with an adjustment disorder with mixed disturbances of emotions and conduct and reactive attachment disorder. As Smith worked with M and her foster parent, the behaviors improved, but Smith noted that M would often regress after visits with mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">During this period, mother\u2019s visits with M were supervised by Libby Forsberg. Forsberg testified that, for the most part, mother was very aware of M\u2019s needs, picked up on her cues, and appropriately comforted M. Forsberg also noted that mother and M were affectionate with one another. By spring 2004, after nearly one year in foster care, M was staying up to three nights a week with mother and DHS was planning to return M to her care. Mother worked with Smith to effect the transition of M back into her home, and Smith noted that she \u201cappeared open to suggestions [and] somewhat anxious about \u2018doing the right things.\u2019 \u201d After a few sessions with Smith, mother reported that she no longer needed her support, and Smith recommended to Castelton that M\u2019s case be closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">In July 2004, although Castelton still had concerns about mother\u2019s \u201climited ability to cope,\u201d she determined that mother had made sufficient progress to return M to her care. Caseworker Richard Holmes began working with mother and M. At that time, members of mother\u2019s church were helping mother by providing mentoring, transportation, budgeting, babysitting, and emotional support. Holmes helped mother secure clothing and other household items, and he reported to his supervisor that mother was making progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Although Holmes saw progress, members of mother\u2019s support network had different perceptions of her ability to parent M. Jill Purcell, who served as M\u2019s foster parent from June 2004 to July 2004 and who continued to support mother after M\u2019s return, testified that, although she was hopeful that mother could learn to parent M, her hope did not last. Mother had difficulty learning appropriate responses to M\u2019s behavior and exhibited questionable judgment. Purcell noted that mother shut M in her room for long periods of time and threatened to leave her unattended in the apartment; when Purcell confronted mother about it, mother responded that Purcell \u201cc[ould]n\u2019t catch [her]\u201d doing it. Mother would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>sometimes \u201cyell at [M] and she would yank her with her arm.\u201d Although mother \u201ctried really hard not to * * * use her hands\u201d to discipline M, Purcell thought that mother\u2019s behavior scared the child. Purcell also noted that mother\u2019s depression inhibited her parenting, and that M \u201clearned how to stay in her room\u201d because mother would \u201csometimes not want to get out of bed.\u201d Mother also expressed suicidal thoughts to Purcell; mother told her that she \u201cwould take care of her and her daughter\u201d because mother did not want anyone else to raise M.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Mother began to have difficulty at the church she attended with Purcell. According to Deborah Lange, who befriended mother in October 2004, mother told her that, while acting as a youth group leader, mother had engaged in what Lange described as \u201csome very inappropriate conversations with the kids that were young and underage [,] * * * asking them if they ever wanted to try lesbianism, if they ever had dreams or thoughts of wanting to be with a woman.\u201d Mother admitted to Lange that she \u201chad thoughts and dreams\u201d of \u201cbe[ing] with\u201d the children in the youth group, and that she had similar thoughts about M.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">When mother began to have difficulty with Purcell and Purcell\u2019s church, she began to rely heavily on Lange and April Mmari, Lange\u2019s friend from church, whom mother met in J anuary 2005. Lange attempted to help mother but, just as mother had exhausted Purcell, mother \u201cwas just overwhelming right from the beginning.\u201d She inundated Lange with \u201cconstant\u201d telephone calls and e-mails that Lange described as \u201charassing,\u201d and she became \u201cobsessed\u201d with Lange and her husband. Mother called Lange with questions such as \u201chow [mother] could * * * stop hitting [M],\u201d and telling Lange \u201cthat she hated [M] and [M] made her sick,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Lange soon became concerned for M\u2019s welfare, not only because mother had disclosed that she had had either sexual thoughts or sexual dreams about M, but because mother \u201cwas one to admit at the beginning she did not know * * * how to be a mom.\u201d M \u201cwas in trouble for the littlest things and her punishments were so harsh at times,\u201d including starving M all day and locking M in her room for over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>12 hours.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Lange testified that, on one occasion when mother refused to feed M, Lange went inside mother\u2019s home to make food for the child. The next day, mother called Lange to say that she had beaten M to punish the child because Lange had fed her. Lange, president of the church choir to which mother belonged, also observed M \u201cgetting in trouble a lot, getting snatched by the arm, pulled into the bathroom and whipped a lot\u201d at choir practice, which occurred about once a week. Mother\u2019s moods were also unstable and bizarre, including locking herself in a bathroom at Lange\u2019s home for two hours, threatening to kill herself while M sat outside and pleaded with her to come out. Mother also once locked herself in a bathroom stall at church, started foaming at the mouth, and began hitting herself against the wall because \u201csomething was coming inside of her\u201d until Lange and others intervened. Mother told Lange she saw spirits in her home and things flying off the walls and that Satan was communicating through her printer.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">Lange was also concerned about mother\u2019s romantic relationships.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although Lange tried to discourage mother from becoming involved with an ex-convict named Aaron because she \u201cdidn\u2019t want [mother] to fall prey to him,\u201d mother began a sexual relationship. Lange ignored mother\u2019s behavior until mother disclosed that she and Aaron had purchased pornography and \u201cdid all these sexual acts.\u201d Lange then asked mother where M had been, and mother only laughed, which Lange took to mean that mother had exposed M to pornography and sexual conduct. Lange also questioned mother\u2019s judgment about finances. Mother told her that she used M to panhandle; mother also made what Lange believed to be poor financial choices, including buying extravagant gifts with her student loan funds.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Mmari was similarly troubled by mother\u2019s apparent inability to care for M. Mmari also acted as a mentor to mother, helping her \u201cany way [she] could.\u201d At times, Mmari noticed that M would come to church not having eaten and \u201clooking really dirty and not well taken care of in my opinion.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Mother would feed M something from the corner store near the church because, as she told Mmari, she was \u201ctoo busy to get something.\u201d Mother also told Mmari that she locked M in her room for long periods and that M \u201cmakes me sick.\u201d In fact, Mmari once called the police after mother told her that \u201cif [she] didn\u2019t come get [M], [mother] would do something to her \u2014 to her and [M],\u201d which both Mmari and Lange understood as another threat to mother\u2019s and M\u2019s lives. Although the police visited mother\u2019s home, M was not removed from mother\u2019s care at that time.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Other people who observed mother with M during late 2004 and early 2005 saw no problems with her parenting. Searsy Green, who observed mother at mother\u2019s school and who sang in the choir with mother at Lange\u2019s church, testified that mother and M \u201cseemed to be very happy\u201d during this period and that M was well-groomed. Green has \u201cnever seen anything that was negative about [M and mother\u2019s] relationship.\u201d Samantha Heath, who mother also met at Lange\u2019s church, testified that the interaction between mother and M \u201cwas fine\u201d and that M \u201cwas just like every other kid at choir practice.\u201d One of mother\u2019s community-college instructors, Susan Gayle-Reddoor, testified that when mother brought M to class with her, mother was \u201cvery well-prepared * * * to keep her daughter occupied and busy,\u201d and that mother and M \u201cseemed very affectionate\u201d with each other. Laurie Barnes, who babysat M in late 2004 or early 2005, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>noted that M was well-groomed and always brought a snack and toys with her. She saw nothing concerning about M\u2019s interactions with mother or other children. In fact, Barnes testified that M was \u201cvery attached\u201d and mother was \u201cfirm with [M] but also loving and caring about it.\u201d Barbara Sieveking, who provided childcare for M in 2005, also said that M was always clean, well-groomed, and affectionate towards mother, and that mother never mistreated M in Sieveking\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">In April 2005, however, mother went to the DHS office where she spoke with Holmes\u2019s supervisor, Vickie Rose. Mother told Rose that she \u201cwanted to give her daughter up.\u201d Rose was \u201cdumbfounded\u201d because Holmes \u201chad talked about the progress that [mother] had made.\u201d When Rose asked mother to explain, mother refused to discuss her decision and \u201cwas very determined, very forceful in her demeanor, in her voice, in her eye contact that this was absolutely what she wanted to do.\u201d Because Rose was confused, she asked mother to speak to a screener and to provide a written explanation for her decision. Mother wrote that she \u201cd[id] not feel that [she was] capable of raising [M] on [her] own right now\u201d and that she did not wish to discuss the matter further.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">After mother left DHS, Rose sent intake workers to Sieveking\u2019s home to take M into protective custody. She was placed in shelter care with Stephanie James. When M arrived at James\u2019s home, she was \u201c[d]efiant, loud, [and] wilful,\u201d and she would \u201cjust * * * out of the blue even if she was happy * * * let out this bloodcurdling scream.\u201d M was also \u201cafraid to go on the toilet because she had said she frequently got spanked by her mother for pooping in her pants.\u201d Despite M\u2019s behavioral issues, James found her to be \u201cquite charming\u201d and \u201cquite bright.\u201d James attributed M\u2019s behaviorial issues to a lack of guidance and loving discipline because, in James\u2019s care, M\u2019s behavior reformed so drastically that her social worker remarked that he had never seen such a dramatic change in a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Once mother relinquished custody of M, she asked Lange to call DHS and ask to be M\u2019s foster mother. Although Lange was initially resistant to fostering M, she eventually agreed. Two weeks later, M left James\u2019s care and was placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>with. Lange. Lange testified that, when M first arrived, \u201c[s]he was in her room isolated!, and] was having \u2014 and still does [have] \u2014 * * * [vfiolent, scary nightmares.\u201d Lange also reported that M had issues about using the toilet (she would \u201cwip[e] herself till she bled down there\u201d) and that she discussed how to handle the behavior with Purcell, who had noticed it while M was in her care. While bathing, M \u201cwould just scrub * * * so violently]\u201d that she would hurt herself. When Lange tried to teach her not to scrub herself so hard, M would insist that she was not clean.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> M also exhibited enuresis, aggressive conduct, dissociative behaviors, and inappropriate sexual behavior, including frequently talking about sex in a graphic manner, asking to be touched sexually, and sexually touching others. To address these behaviors, Lange requested that M be referred to counseling, and M began seeing therapist LeeAnne Wichmann in January 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Shortly after M was placed in substitute care, Holmes spoke with mother. Mother was unable to explain why she decided to give up M other than to state that she had made a mistake. When asked for a further explanation, mother blamed others for her problems, including Lange, whom she had referred to DHS as a placement resource. Holmes noted that, despite mother\u2019s shortcomings, she \u201cha[d] increased her reliance on and openness to her support system, which includes many friends from her church,\u201d and consistently \u201cexpressed her love for her daughter\u201d to him. During their conversation, however, mother never asked Holmes about M\u2019s well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">In July 2005, the juvenile court held a permanency hearing. The court determined that DHS had made reasonable efforts to reunite M with mother and that it was in M\u2019s best interests to relieve DHS from further responsibility to reunite M with mother. The next month, mother\u2019s attorney requested a referral to the parenting support agency but was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>informed that DHS had been relieved of its obligation to provide services to mother. Holmes also discussed the request with mother, who \u201cindicated that she was not interested in that particular [parenting] class.\u201d Holmes then told mother\u2019s attorney that DHS had been relieved of its obligation to provide additional services to mother and would not provide the referral. A few months later, DHS decided to seek termination of mother\u2019s rights, and the case was eventually transferred to caseworker Jan Phelps.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">In September 2005, mother began \u201cspiritual counseling\u201d with counselor Sharon Gayle. Gayle holds a master\u2019s degree in marriage and family therapy from Northwest Christian College, and she volunteers as a counselor through her church and with an organization called Christians as F amily Advocates. She noted mother\u2019s history of physical and sexual abuse, and she diagnosed her with post-traumatic stress disorder. She also noted that mother exhibited dependent and obsessive-compulsive personality features. During their work together, mother \u201cwas very eager to do what was right,\u201d and Gayle felt that mother was learning how to socialize appropriately and was \u201cgetting * * * founded on her feet\u201d through self-esteem building. Over time, Gayle saw mother maturing and characterized her as \u201cin progress\u201d at the time of the termination trial; however, at that time she had not seen mother for several months because of scheduling difficulties, including that mother was \u201creally busy getting things together for the [termination] hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">In addition to continuing with counseling until a few months before trial, mother was also continuing to visit M in a supervised setting. Forsberg again supervised visits between mother and M for the first few months that M was in foster care. On one occasion, Forsberg noted that M asked mother not to yell at her and explained to Forsberg that mother was \u201cyell[ing] at her like she did when she was at home with her.\u201d Overall, however, Forsberg noted that mother and M played well together during visits and that M was affectionate with mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Jennifer Boyet began supervising mother\u2019s visits with M in early 2006, and continued to do so for several months. Although mother\u2019s attendance was good, Boyet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>found several of mother\u2019s behaviors troubling, including questions that mother would ask M, demands she put on the child, inappropriate clothing that she wore to a visit, and frightening mood swings. For instance, M once wanted to undress a Barbie doll during a visit, and mother snapped at her in a \u201cfrightening tone. * * * [S]he would get to where she was drilling the child or coming down on her, [and] it was frightening to [M].\u201d In fact, M told mother that she was scared, asked to go to the bathroom, and ran away from mother when she returned. According to Boyet, although mother had \u201ca lot of good visits. But when they weren\u2019t good, they really were not good. They were frightening. Especially for a child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">From late 2006 until the time of trial, Kristy Manley supervised visits between mother and M. Manley believed that mother more often lectured M than played with her during visits and was \u201cvery directive,\u201d even though Dubie and others had worked with mother to allow M to play uninterrupted. Manley noted that M was affectionate and seemed happy to see mother. Mother also appropriately reinforced the rules that Manley had set for M, such as cleaning up after visits, and, when M tried to \u201chump\u201d mother\u2019s leg in April 2007, mother stopped the behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Despite the many positive visits, M\u2019s Head Start teacher, Sandra Barnes, noticed that M exhibited anxious behaviors and had difficulty socializing with her peers before and after she visited mother. Based on reports from Barnes and Lange that M\u2019s anxiety increased around visits, M\u2019s reports to her therapist Wichmann that she had \u201cscary feelings\u201d and that monsters came to her house after visits, and Wichmann\u2019s observation that M had anxiously pulled out her hair around visitation time, Wichmann recommended that visits be terminated for a few weeks in April 2007, about six weeks before the termination trial. During that period, Lange and M both reported to Wichmann that M had no nightmares and experienced much less anxiety.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>However, when Wichmann observed visits between M and mother, she noted that their reactions were generally appropriate, with one exception. Mother would touch and tickle M and would not stop until M told her to stop. Mother explained that she deliberately tested M\u2019s boundaries around physical contact because \u201cshe didn\u2019t learn how to use her voice when she was younger and she really wanted to make sure her daughter knew how to say stop or no or to just use her voice.\u201d Wichmann noted that such a strategy was ineffective for teaching children about boundaries</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-4\">\u201cbecause in [M\u2019s] case, if she\u2019s already feeling unsafe to some degree with * * * her mother, and her mother continues to physically touch her in a way that * * * [M] doesn\u2019t want, [M] shouldn\u2019t be the one to set the boundary. Typically parents are the ones who set the boundary and notice and respond to the needs of their children in terms of contact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Wichmann diagnosed M with post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the significant and repeated trauma that-she had experienced in mother\u2019s care, including exposure to mother\u2019s wildly fluctuating moods, having been locked away for extended periods without food or access to a bathroom, homelessness, and harsh discipline. Wichmann also noted that M likely has attachment issues, and provided a rule-out diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder, a condition that can severely impair or destroy a child\u2019s ability to make healthy attachments. M also exhibited \u201csignificant trauma symptoms consistent with a child who has been sexually abused.\u201d M\u2019s problematic behaviors improved through counseling with Wichmann, and she began disclosing more information about the treatment she received at the hands of her mother. For instance, M told Wichmann that, when M was very young, mother used hot sauce on her tongue to discipline M, which \u201churt really bad,\u201d and that M was afraid that that would happen again if she were returned to her mother. When Wichmann asked mother about M\u2019s disclosure, mother admitted to having used this form of discipline, but explained that she discontinued it after being so advised. M also disclosed to Wichmann that mother disciplined her by hitting her with hangers.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Even more disturbing, a few weeks before the termination trial, M disclosed to Wichmann, while Lange was in the room, that mother and her boyfriend Aaron had \u201ctouched [her] private parts.\u201d When Wichmann asked M what she meant, she pointed to her genital area and explained, \u201cI was running around, then they told me to sit down and close my eyes and they touched my private parts.\u201d Although Wichmann tried to gather more information, M indicated that she did not want to talk about it further. M also told Wichmann during the same session that she considered Aaron and mother \u201cunsafe\u201d adults and that her foster parents were \u201csafe\u201d adults. When Wichman discussed M\u2019s sexualized behaviors with mother, she contended to Wichmann that any sexual abuse or exposure to inappropriate material or conduct must have occurred at Lange\u2019s home. Wichmann testified at trial that, after observing M with every member of Lange\u2019s family, she has no reason to believe that M\u2019s alleged sexual abuse occurred while in Lange\u2019s care, and, given M\u2019s fear of mother, she believes that the abuse occurred while M was in mother\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">In March 2006, the state filed a petition to terminate mother\u2019s parental rights, alleging that mother was unfit by reason of conduct or condition seriously detrimental to M, based on (1) exposure of M to domestic violence, (2) lack of effort to obtain and maintain a suitable or stable living situation, (3) failure to present a viable plan, (4) failure to learn or assume parenting and housekeeping skills, (5) mental, emotional, or psychological abuse of M, (6) an emotional illness or mental illness of such nature and duration as to render mother incapable of providing care for extended periods of time, (7) cruel or abusive conduct toward M, (8) physical and emotional neglect, (9) lack of effort to adjust mother\u2019s circumstances, and (10) mother\u2019s voluntary absence. ORS 419B.504. The state also alleged that mother failed \u201cto provide care or pay a reasonable portion of substitute physical care and maintenance while custody was lodged with others.\u201d ORS 419B.506(1). Trial was set for January 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">As the case proceeded to trial, the court ordered mother to submit to a psychological evaluation on the state\u2019s motion. Mother was evaluated by psychologist James Ewell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>in December 2006. Ewell met\u2018with mother once. He conducted a clinical interview, reviewed some collateral information, and administered the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2), the Mill\u00f3n Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-Ill (MCMI-III), and an abbreviated version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition (WAIS-III). Mother\u2019s scores on the WAIS-III were average, indicating no significant intellectual defect. Her scores on the MMPI-2 and the MCMI-III indicated moderate defensiveness when answering the test questions, which Ewell opined may have affected her scores. Ewell concluded that the results could still be clinically useful, however, and noted that the computer-generated interpretation of mother\u2019s MCMI-III scores suggested the presence of a histrionic personality disorder with narcissistic and obsessive-compulsive features.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">During the interview, mother informed Ewell that she had been codependent with members of her church, specifically Lange. Mother claimed that Lange had encouraged her to relinquish custody of M, and that she did so to please Lange. Ewell noted that mother \u201cexpresses a strong motivation and commitment to her child,\u201d that she was attending school and working at least part time, that she had housing, and that she was receiving counseling from two individuals. Ewell also believed that M was doing well in foster care and had no behavioral difficulties.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Based on that information, Ewell found \u201cno evidence * * * of any severe pathology such as a personality disorder, severe mood disturbance or psychotic process.\u201d He diagnosed mother as having attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder on Axis I. Although mother exhibited maladaptive, histrionic, obsessive-compulsive, and narcissistic personality features on Axis II, Ewell concluded that those traits did not rise to the level of a personality disorder. Accordingly, Ewell \u201cfound evidence to suggest * * * guarded optimism regarding [mother\u2019s] ability to parent [M] in the future\u201d because mother appeared to have made progress in counseling over the last 18 months. Ewell opined that continued stabilization might be expected during the next 6 to 12 months and recommended that the termination trial be postponed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>In preparing Ewell to testify at trial, the state noticed that there was \u201csome conflict between evidence that we had concerning this child\u2019s status and the information that [a caseworker] had * * * furnished to Dr. Ewell.\u201d Ewell received additional information from DHS, including a witness interview with Purcell, a witness interview with Lange, Wichmann\u2019s initial assessment of M, and background information from Phelps. After reviewing that information, Ewell wrote a letter recommending that his report be given little weight and that DHS consider having a second psychological evaluation, as well as a psychosexual evaluation, performed by another psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\">After receiving Ewell\u2019s evaluation, mother moved to postpone the termination trial. The court granted the motion, and trial was set over until March 2007. The state moved for an order requiring mother to submit to a second psychological evaluation by psychologist David Truhn. Mother opposed the motion, arguing that the state was requesting the second evaluation solely to create a strategic trial advantage and not in M\u2019s best interests. At a hearing on the motion, the state explained that the caseworker mistakenly gave Ewell incomplete information about M, and, because Ewell\u2019s report was subject to impeachment based on that incomplete information, the court had no current valid psychological evaluation of mother. Mother responded that the state controlled the information given to Ewell and could have given him additional information before the January trial date instead of requesting a second evaluation. She also argued that if the proposed evaluation were to proceed as planned, she would receive the report only a few days before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The trial court acknowledged that mother would require extra time to prepare her defense if the second evaluation were ordered, but it concluded that fundamental fairness required that it obtain complete information with which to decide the case given the seriousness of a termination trial. Accordingly, the trial court ordered mother to undergo the evaluation by Truhn, and the trial was set over until June 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Although DHS had not asked Ewell to evaluate any specific aspect of mother\u2019s psychological functioning, Truhn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>was asked to determine mother\u2019s current mental status, her range of intellectual functioning, and whether she presents a risk of harm to M. Truhn met with mother twice before preparing his report. He administered the MMPI-2, the MCMI-III, and several other psychological tests to mother, conducted a clinical interview, a parenting interview, and a mental status examination, and reviewed collateral information. He also noted that he had met with mother in March 2006 for a comprehensive psychological evaluation to determine whether psychological factors were affecting her academic performance and that there was <em>\u201ca </em>significant discrepancy between her self-report in the current examination and the evaluation conducted a year ago.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Mother\u2019s test scores showed no significant cognitive deficits, but her scores on the MMPI-2 and the MCMI-III suggested that she was defensive and denying or minimizing her problems. Although Truhn acknowledged at trial that defensiveness is a common response of parents undergoing a psychological evaluation, mother\u2019s defensiveness indicated that she did not respond honestly to the child abuse potential inventory. Despite mother\u2019s defensiveness, however, Truhn was able to identify several statistically significant findings from mother\u2019s results. Just as Ewell\u2019s testing had revealed, and similar to Bischof s diagnosis, mother\u2019s MCMI-III scores suggested maladaptive, histrionic, and narcissistic personality features. Psychometric testing indicated that mother is gregarious, desires extensive interpersonal contact, seeks attention from others, and may be manipulative and flamboyant in doing so. Truhn also explained that mother \u201cmay have feelings of entitlement and have a tendency to exploit others,\u201d exhibit mood swings and impulsive behaviors, and experience instability in interpersonal relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">During her clinical interview, mother reported that she was not anxious and has nothing to worry about; that she no longer worries about her past abuse because she has chosen not to think about it; that her self-image had \u201ctotally changed\u201d so that she has not engaged in impulsive sexual activity, binge eating, or cutting in over a year (although she acknowledged continuing to obsessively wash her genitals); that she is not sexually attracted to children; and that her mood is stable and that she does not experience mood swings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Truhn found her self-report to be inconsistent with her test results and his own observations, and, given mother\u2019s tendency to deny and minimize her problems, he opined that mother\u2019s self-report needed to be verified by psychometric test results and collateral information.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Despite trying to portray herself in a positive light, mother made some disturbing statements during her parenting interview. For instance, when queried about her coping strategies, mother indicated that she masturbates any time she feels stressed and was unable to articulate any other method of stress-management. She also told Truhn she might use pornographic movies to educate M about sex when M becomes a teenager. When asked how she would discipline M, mother stated that her only problem with M was \u201cher throwing temper tantrums on the bus,\u201d and that she will take practice rides and get off if M starts to act out. To deal with M\u2019s enuresis, mother stated that she would deny M liquids after five o\u2019clock in the evening. When asked how she would deal with M\u2019s nightmares, she responded, \u201cPray over her while she\u2019s awake. She will need to have a counselor after she comes home just to find out if she\u2019s doing okay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Relying on a combination of his observations, collateral information, and test results, Truhn suggested ruling out chronic post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder with poor insight on Axis I, and he diagnosed a personality disorder NOS with histrionic, narcissistic, and borderline features on Axis II. Truhn opined that the personality traits exhibited by mother during testing and during her previous examination by Truhn \u201cwould seemingly [make it difficult for mother to] placet] her child\u2019s needs above her own on a consistent basis.\u201d Mother also \u201cmay have difficulty maintaining a stable personality style and mood to be able to offer the child a secure [and] safe setting.\u201d Truhn noted that mother \u201chas positive intentions and is motivated to engage in psychotherapeutic activities at times but that consistency is a primary issue for [mother]. She seems to require significant personality development and parenting skills development in an effort to provide her child with a safe, stable environment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Truhn recommended intensive individual and group psychotherapy to address mother\u2019s personality issues and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>post-traumatic stress disorder, structured parenting classes regarding the needs and developmental issues of children, and a psychosexual evaluation based on M\u2019s allegations of sexual abuse and sexualized behavior. Truhn noted that mother \u201chas made significant behavior and personality changes in the past year,\u201d and that, if mother were to consistently follow his recommendations, \u201ca year or more would be a reasonable expectation for her to * * * demonstrate such significant behavioral and personality stability that would be expected for her to be able to provide a safe and stable environment for her child.\u201d Truhn concluded that mother\u2019s prognosis for parenting M was \u201cguarded to poor\u201d as a result of her \u201csignificant interpersonal maturity and the personality issues that are interfering with her ability to maintain a stable lifestyle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">At the termination trial, mother called several witnesses on her behalf, including psychologist David Northway. Northway reviewed Truhn\u2019s and Ewell\u2019s reports, Ewell\u2019s follow-up letter, Joffe\u2019s two reports, Wichmann\u2019s initial assessment of M, and materials from mother\u2019s investigator that included an e-mail from Lange to Holmes, and the state\u2019s witness interview of Lange. Northway explained that defensive responses were common from parents undergoing psychological evaluations, questioned the clinical significance of mother\u2019s slightly elevated scores during both Ewell\u2019s and Truhn\u2019s administration of the MMPI-2 and the MCMI-III, and testified that Truhn had erroneously scored mother\u2019s MCMI-III on the histrionic scale.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> He also explained that he never uses the MCMI-III because the standardization sample included only people with known psychiatric difficulties \u201c[so] you can never know how a normal person would look on the MCMI-III. * * * [Instead, y]ou want to use a test that starts with a baseline of this person\u2019s normal and let\u2019s see what kind of problems they have.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Northway also noted that the MCMI-III has \u201can extremely high error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>rate for Axis II disorders,\u201d and specifically that the test may over-diagnose histrionic and narcissistic personality disorders in people who are outgoing. Northway acknowledged that he is not an expert on the MCMI-III, but he explained that he considers the test poorly designed for the purposes of assessing someone\u2019s ability to parent.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> He also criticized Wichmann\u2019s interviewing of M while Lange was in the room, explaining that children are \u201cincredibly suggestible\u201d at M\u2019s age and loyal to their care providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Northway acknowledged that multiple data sources are necessary to diagnose an individual and that it was conceivably possible but \u201cill-advised\u201d to diagnose an Axis II disorder, especially a personality disorder that is not otherwise specified, based on patient history alone. He explained that he had not seen or met mother prior to his trial testimony and could not diagnose her. Northway also agreed that if Truhn\u2019s diagnosis were accurate, mother would require a year or more of intensive cognitive behavioral therapy to address her psychological issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">At the time of trial, mother was living in low-income housing subsidized by St. Vincent de Paul. The resident service coordinator, Geneva Van Elsberg, testified that she has known mother for approximately one and one-half years and that she sees mother roughly once a week. Van Elsberg has never received a complaint about mother, and she testified that \u201c[o]ver the last year and a half, [mother has] grown a lot personally,\u201d resulting in her having \u201ccalmed down\u201d and reacting more appropriately to situations, including taking \u201ca lot more responsibility for what she was doing in the situation besides focusing on what the other person was doing.\u201d She also testified that she would continue to support mother as long as mother continued to live there and Van Elsberg continued to work as a resident service coordinator.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Cooks similarly testified that mother is \u201cmaking every effort possible,\u201d that mother is \u201ca more mature individual now than she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>was before,\u201d that mother is more connected to her extended family, and that Cooks and other relatives would offer ongoing support to mother if M were returned to her care. Heath, whom mother knew through Lange\u2019s church, also testified that she would continue to support mother if M were returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">Although mother was no longer in school when the trial was held, she had been working full-time at Albertson\u2019s for a week and a half. She explained that she had had other positions while M had been in care, but she testified that she quit each position because it was difficult for her to work and still get to her visits with M on time. Mother also has problems standing for long periods of time because her feet are flat, and each of her prior positions required her to stand. She also explained that her mother has agreed to support her and M for three months if M is returned, after which time she will look for work with a regular schedule. Mother believes she has more job skills now than she did when she relinquished custody of M because she has performed administrative work at Lane County Community College. Vickie Goodness, who worked with mother at the college, testified that she handled the administrative work professionally and reliably, suggesting that she has in fact gained job skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Mother also explained that, if M is returned, mother will continue counseling \u201cif my schedule, you know, works out with theirs.\u201d In addition to counseling with Gayle, mother has a workbook for codependent women that she has found helpful and has attended at least one Co-Dependents Anonymous meeting. Mother also testified that she attended an 11-week parenting class while M has been in foster care, as well as a family and food nutrition class. She explained that she is \u201cdifferent\u201d than she was when she relinquished custody of M because she had \u201clow self-esteem\u201d at that time, but she has \u201cbeen working on who [she is and] trying to feel good about [her] self as far as being a black woman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">She contended that she has a more extensive support system in place than she did when she relinquished custody of M, specifically \u201cother people besides the Langes * * * from the church that I didn\u2019t have then\u201d and \u201cmy cousin that I hang out with, Raulette.\u201d Mother also \u201cknow[s] [her] family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>members a lot more now than I knew then.\u201d She expressed a clear desire to parent M until M is an adult, and she feels she will not again be in the same situation she was in when she relinquished custody of M.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Gayle, who last saw mother more than three months before trial, testified that mother is capable of parenting M because she has <em>\u201ca </em>strong faith\u201d and is a \u201csurvivor\u201d who is \u201cstrong-willed and determined.\u201d She would not want M returned to mother\u2019s care, however, until she is able to discuss M\u2019s allegations of sexual abuse with mother. Although mother has matured while she has been in counseling with Gayle, Gayle described her as <em>\u201ca </em>child in an adult body\u201d because \u201cshe\u2019s confused as to what is and what is not accepted and appropriate response or behavior[, and p]ersonal relationships and skills are a struggle for her.\u201d Mother is \u201cvery remorseful that [M] is under state care,\u201d but she has not taken responsibility for giving up M, which Gayle thinks must have been a \u201cvery scary\u201d experience for the child. Gayle acknowledged that \u201creal\u201d therapeutic progress is not possible unless the patient confronts her own accountability, and that mother has not yet been able to do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Although Lange reported that M was doing well in foster care at the time of trial, Wichmann explained that M has special psychological needs that require that she have permanency \u201cto help her start to address * * * in a deeper way some of these behavior issues, some of the emotional issues, and that she can get on with her life developmentally.\u201d Wichmann testified that, if M were not going to remain with Lange, she needed a stable, permanent placement \u201cvery soon,\u201d or she will suffer more deep psychological and emotional wounds and will experience more significant trauma symptoms. It will also further compromise M\u2019s ability to make healthy attachments. She also believes that M will continue to disclose information about sexual abuse, as it is \u201cfairly typical in [Wichmann\u2019s] professional experience, particularly for younger children\u201d to make delayed disclosures and to \u201cshare details little by little.\u201d Wichmann opined that M \u201ccannot safely be returned to her mother at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The record does not indicate conclusively what DHS\u2019s plan for a permanent placement for M was at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>of trial. It does reveal, however, that DHS was looking into a relative placement with M\u2019s paternal grandmother in Virginia, and that M had had telephone contact with her grandmother. Lange testified that she was willing to be an adoptive resource if M\u2019s grandmother declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">At the close of the evidence, the state withdrew the allegations based on exposure to domestic violence, mother\u2019s voluntary absence, and failure to provide care or pay a reasonable portion of substitute physical care and maintenance. The court found the remaining eight allegations of the petition to have been proved by clear and convincing evidence. It also concluded that termination was in M\u2019s best interests, and it issued a judgment terminating mother\u2019s parental rights to M, from which mother now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\"> Mother first assigns error to the trial court\u2019s order requiring her to participate in a second psychological evaluation. Because the trial court had the discretion to order the psychological evaluation to determine the best interests of M, we review the order for abuse of discretion. <em>See State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Maginnis, </em>28 Or App 935, 937, 561 P2d 1044 (1977) (court authorized to order parent to undergo a psychological evaluation to determine the best interests of the child in a termination proceeding); <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Kopp, </em>180 Or App 566, 579-80, 43 P3d 1197 (2002) <em>(citing Becker v. Pieper, </em>176 Or App 635, 641, 32 P3d 912 (2001)) (abuse of discretion standard of review should be employed when the issue on appeal is whether a trial court\u2019s decision was within the limits of its legal discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Mother contends that the trial court abused its discretion by ordering the evaluation by Truhn because mother had been evaluated by Ewell two months earlier, and that \u201cit is fundamentally unfair to require the parent to submit to one intrusive evaluation after another, for no reason other than to try [to] gain a tactical advantage at trial.\u201d The record does not support mother\u2019s contention that the state requested a second evaluation only to create a tactical advantage at trial; Ewell himself recommended the second evaluation after learning that he prepared his report based on incomplete information about M\u2019s circumstances. We need not determine the state\u2019s motivations for requesting the order, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>however, because the trial court made its motivation clear: to ensure that all relevant, helpful, and accurate information was available to decide a case that will drastically affect the lives of M and her mother. So that mother had an adequate opportunity to prepare her defense, the trial court set over the trial date when it issued the order, and mother was able to call an expert witness who disputed Truhn\u2019s report at trial. Under these circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Mother next assigns error to the trial court\u2019s decision that her parental rights should be terminated. ORS 419B.504 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">\u201cThe rights of the parent or parents may be terminated as provided in ORS 419B.500 if the court finds that the parent or parents are unfit by reason of conduct or condition seriously detrimental to the child or ward and integration of the child or ward into the home of the parent or parents is improbable within a reasonable time due to conduct or conditions not likely to change. In determining such conduct and conditions, the court shall consider but is not limited to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">\u201c(1) Emotional illness, mental illness or mental deficiency of the parent of such nature and duration as to render the parent incapable of providing proper care for the child or ward for extended periods of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">\u201c(2) Conduct toward any child of an abusive, cruel or sexual nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\">\u2021 <em>ifc </em>i\u00a1\u00ed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-9\">\u201c(4) Physical neglect of the child or ward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-10\">\u201c(5) Lack of effort of the parent to adjust the circumstances of the parent, conduct, or conditions to make it possible for the child or ward to safely return home within a reasonable time or failure of the parent to effect a lasting adjustment after reasonable efforts by available social agencies for such extended duration of time that it appears reasonable that no lasting adjustment can be effected.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALK\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>The Supreme Court has observed that both parts of the two-part test set forth in ORS 419B.504 must be met before the court orders termination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-4\">\u201cFirst, the court must address a parent\u2019s fitness: The court must find that the parent is \u2018unfit by reason of conduct or condition seriously detrimental to the child.\u2019 That, in turn, requires a two-part inquiry: The court must find that: (1) the parent has engaged in some conduct or is characterized by some condition; and (2) the conduct or condition is \u2018seriously detrimental\u2019 to the child. Second \u2014 and only if the parent has met the foregoing criteria \u2014 the court also must find that the \u2018integration of the child into the home of the parent * * * is improbable within a reasonable time due to conduct or conditions not likely to change.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\"><em>State ex rel SOSCF v. Stillman, </em>333 Or 135, 145, 36 P3d 490 (2001) (quoting ORS 419B.504); <em>see also State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Smith, </em>338 Or 58, 80-81, 106 P3d 627 (2005) (focus is on detrimental effect of the parent\u2019s conduct or condition on the child, not the seriousness of parent\u2019s conduct or condition in the abstract). Additionally, the court must find that termination of parental rights is in the best interests of the child. <em>Smith, </em>338 Or at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The state must prove unfitness by clear and convincing evidence. Evidence is clear and convincing if it makes the existence of a fact \u201chighly probable\u201d or if it is of \u201cextraordinary persuasiveness.\u201d <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Hinds, </em>191 Or App 78, 84, 81 P3d 99 (2003). Furthermore, the state must prove more than unfitness at some point in the past but rather that the conduct or condition is seriously detrimental <em>at the time of the termination hearing. State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Simmons, </em>342 Or 76, 96, 149 P3d 1124 (2006). If we find clear and convincing evidence that the parent has some combination of conduct and conditions, we consider whether the combination of conduct and conditions is seriously detrimental to that child. <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Rodgers, </em>204 Or App 198, 217-18, 129 P3d 243 (2006) (citing <em>State ex rel SOSCF v. Mellor, </em>181 Or App 468, 476, 47 P3d 19 (2002), <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 217 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">With those principles in mind, we turn to the evidence of mother\u2019s unfitness. We first address whether mother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>suffers from the conditions or has engaged in the conduct that the state identifies as grounds for terminating her parental rights. We then consider whether that combination of conduct and conditions would be seriously detrimental to M if she were returned to mother\u2019s care. Lastly, we evaluate whether termination is in M\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">We begin by examining mother\u2019s conduct and conditions. The state contends that Truhn\u2019s report establishes that mother suffers from a personality disorder, and that, even apart from Truhn\u2019s diagnosis, \u201call of the experts who have evaluated mother agree that she suffers from some sort of mental disorder\u201d that impairs her ability to parent M. In addition, the state points to evidence that mother has engaged in mental, emotional, or psychological abuse of M, cruel or abusive conduct toward M, and has physically and emotionally neglected M. Finally, the state contends that mother failed to obtain or maintain a stable living situation, failed to present a viable plan, and has not attempted to adjust her circumstances or made a lasting adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Mother responds that she suffers from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, but she disputes Truhn\u2019s diagnosis of a personality disorder. She argues that the evidence that her depression and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms had lessened and that she had matured at the time of trial d\u00e9monstrates that her conditions are treatable within a reasonable time so that they do not render her unable to care for M for extended periods. As to the allegations of cruel or abusive conduct, physical or emotional neglect, and physical, emotional, or psychological abuse, mother contends that the record does not contain clear and convincing evidence of such conduct. Although mother agrees that she has struggled to find housing, she points to evidence that, when she did have a place to live, she maintained her home in a minimally adequate fashion, and that she had housing and a job at the time of trial. Mother also plans to seek an office job once she no longer needs to visit M during regular business hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">We agree with mother that the record lacks clear and convincing evidence that she had failed to maintain and obtain a suitable and stable living situation at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>trial. The evidence established that mother has lived in a subsidized apartment for the past one and one-half years. Although there is some evidence that mother\u2019s living space has been cluttered and dirty, the balance of the evidence is that mother kept her home in a minimally adequate manner. Despite evidence that mother\u2019s housing and employment situations are precarious, the state presented no evidence that her living situation was unsuitable at the time of trial. <em>See State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Squiers, </em>203 Or App 774, 796 126 P3d 758 (2006) (state must establish that a parent\u2019s living circumstances were unsuitable at the time of the termination hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">We agree with the state, however, that mother suffers from a combination of conditions and conduct that render her unfit to parent M. First, mother suffers from a mental or emotional illness of such nature and duration as to render her unable to care for M for extended periods of time. Mother agrees that she suffers from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, and there is clear and convincing evidence that mother also suffers from a personality disorder. She has been consistently diagnosed with maladaptive personality traits by each expert to render an Axis II diagnosis from the time of her institutionalization up until the time of trial, including Bischof, Gayle, Ewell, and Truhn. Truhn diagnosed a personality disorder NOS. We credit that diagnosis because Truhn was the sole witness to both administer a personality inventory and to testify that his conclusions were reliable. Although defense expert Northway disputed the clinical significance of mother\u2019s scores on one of those inventories, Truhn stipulated that he would have rendered the same opinion without relying on those scores. Accordingly, we conclude that mother suffers from depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and a personality disorder NOS. That combination has rendered her unable to care for M for extended periods of time because it has prevented her from maintaining a stable personality and mood. Truhn explained that, as a consequence, mother experiences \u201csignificant turmoil [that has] a tendency to draw attention to her,\u201d making it difficult for her to place her child\u2019s needs first. As a result, mother\u2019s conditions prevent her from being able to \u201cprovide the child with reasonable parenting supervision in the near future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Second, the record contains clear and convincing evidence of cruel conduct towards M, physical and emotional neglect of M, and physical, emotional, and psychological abuse of M. When mother first arrived in Oregon in late 2002, she told Ziemak that she had learned not to hit M from other parents staying at the shelter. Despite that lesson, parenting trainers noted in fall 2003 that mother struggled to manage her anger and frustration when challenged by M or other children. Mother\u2019s unsuccessful struggle to manage her anger continued after M was returned to her care in July 2004. Both Purcell and Lange testified, respectively, that mother \u201ctried really hard not to * * * use her hands\u201d to discipline M<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and that mother asked how she could stop hitting M; they also testified that mother failed at those efforts and that her abusive conduct persisted until she relinquished custody. Purcell, who was deeply involved in mother\u2019s life from the time of M\u2019s first return until fall 2004, testified that mother \u201cwould yell at [M] and she would yank her with her arm [and] just * * * scare [M].\u201d Lange, upon whom mother often relied between fall 2004 and when mother relinquished custody of M, testified that mother \u201cwhipped\u201d M \u201ca lot\u201d during that period, that mother denied M food as punishment, and that mother told her she had beaten M after Lange had insisted on feeding the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Both women also testified that mother kept M in her room for extended periods of time without access to food or bathroom facilities. M has confirmed Lange\u2019s and Purcell\u2019s accounts to Wichmann during therapy sessions, as she has disclosed that mother hit her with hangers and that mother locked her in her room and would not \u201clet[ ] me go to the bathroom or * * * eat[ ] food.\u201d The evidence of mother\u2019s cruel and abusive conduct toward M from the time she arrived in Oregon in 2002, when M was a little over a year old, until mother relinquished custody in June 2005 is clear and convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Third, mother has failed to present a viable plan to address her conditions and past conduct and enable M to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>returned to her care. She was not candid about how she might react to future situations, and she is unrealistic about future challenges she will face in parenting M. During her psychological evaluation by Truhn, mother was so defensive when answering the child abuse inventory that her scores were considered invalid. Truhn testified that mother \u201cdid not seem to have much insight regarding coping strategies if issues would arise.\u201d When specifically asked at trial how she would discipline M, mother claimed that her only problem managing M\u2019s behavior had been M throwing temper tantrums on the bus, and that she plans to deal with such tantrums by getting off the bus. That statement directly contradicts the testimony of Wichmann, Ziemak, Dubie, Purcell, and Lange. The strategies that mother articulated to Truhn for dealing with M\u2019s enuresis, sexualized behavior, and nightmares demonstrate mother\u2019s failure to appreciate M\u2019s need for ongoing psychological treatment. Her lack of candor about the past and her unrealistic plans for the future demonstrate that she is unable to appreciate the extent to which her conduct has harmed M. She has failed to develop strategies to manage her feelings and avoid such harmful conduct in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">Mother is similarly unrealistic about her ability to regulate her moods. The sole stress-management technique that she was able to articulate to Truhn was masturbation. Moreover, Truhn explained that mother\u2019s report that her post-traumatic stress disorder and depression symptoms have disappeared is not credible because \u201c[u]sually a chang[e] of significant Axis I or Axis II issues takes extensive psychotherapy [and] medication\u201d \u201cespecially for Axis II issues of any type of personality disorder. * * * It takes usually an extremely long time for personality disorders to change. If at all.\u201d Truhn also explained that post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms generally do not resolve \u201cthrough therapeutic completion on their own.\u201d Given the inconsistency between mother\u2019s self-report and Truhn\u2019s psychometric testing and clinical observations, as well as mother\u2019s unrealistic expectations about parenting M and managing her own mental health, we conclude that mother has failed to present a viable plan to face the challenges of parenting M in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Fourth, the evidence is clear and convincing that mother\u2019s effort to adjust her circumstances, conduct, or conditions is lacking. Mother\u2019s assertions to Truhn and at trial that her post-traumatic stress disorder and depression symptoms have disappeared within the last year are unconvincing. Clinical observations and objective psychometric testing supported Truhn\u2019s assessment that mother was denying and minimizing her problems. Truhn explained that it was unlikely that mother would stop experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder unless \u201cit was being sublimated and then the situation would come up in some other fashion.\u201d Truhn characterized mother\u2019s report that the problems she has experienced in the past have disappeared in the past year as consistent with her denial and minimization, and he opined that it shows a lack of insight and maturity that renders her prognosis for parenting M poor. Truhn also explained that mother\u2019s personality disorder would require extensive psychoeducational and psychotherapeutic treatment, which may take \u201can extremely long time.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Despite having been counseled by a variety of mental health workers since 2003, at the time of trial, mother had not recognized the severity of her mental health issues, the effect her conduct and conditions have had on M, or the continuing need for her to receive mental health treatment. Although mother has received counseling, she has not confronted her accountability and cannot make \u201creal progress\u201d in therapy without doing so, according to her counselor, Gayle. Mother testified that she would continue counseling \u201cif my schedule, you know, works out with [the counselors],\u201d and at the time of trial she had not seen Gayle for several months because she was too busy \u201cworking on the [termination] hearing.\u201d Mother\u2019s explanation of why she would not have the same problems caring for M in the future was that she has gained self-esteem as a black woman and has stopped being \u201ccodependent on other people.\u201d It is clear to us that mother persists in believing that M is in care because of Lange and has failed to confront her own contribution to M\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>circumstances. Mother\u2019s noncommittal statements about counseling and her limited understanding of the causes of her past behavior are evidence that she does not appreciate the importance of continued counseling to her ability to parent M. Although there is evidence that mother has made some gains in the past year, the evidence at trial was clear and convincing that those gains have not been and will not be sufficient to render her a minimally adequate parent within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Having determined that, at the time of trial, mother suffered from mental illness, had engaged in past cruel and abusive conduct toward M, failed to present a viable plan, and lacked effort to adjust her conduct and conditions to enable M to be returned to her care, we turn to whether that combination of conduct and conditions was seriously detrimental to M at the time of the termination hearing. <em>See Rodgers, </em>204 Or App at 218 (citing <em>Mellor, </em>181 Or App at 476) (because child is exposed to all the proven conduct and conditions together, our unfitness determination is similarly based on consideration of that combination and whether it is seriously detrimental to the child). The evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s finding that mother\u2019s combination of conduct and conditions was seriously detrimental to M at the time of trial is \u201cextraordinarily persuasive[ ].\u201d <em>Hinds, </em>191 Or App at 84. M suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder as a consequence of severe trauma during the early years of life, and may suffer from reactive attachment disorder. Those conditions are directly attributable to mother\u2019s conduct, specifically exposing M to unsafe situations, including mother\u2019s wildly fluctuating moods and physical abuse. M is so afraid and anxious about seeing mother that, before visits, she has pulled out her hair leaving bald spots. She experiences nightmares, enuresis, and dissociation around visitation time, and these behaviors abate when the visits stop, as demonstrated when visits were stopped for two weeks in April 2007, approximately six weeks before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Although mother ascribes the reduction in anxious behaviors to other factors and claims that M\u2019s anxious behaviors started only recently, we note that M exhibited the same pattern of anxiety around visits the first time she was in the state\u2019s care. Moreover, M told Wichmann that she is afraid of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>mother hurting her, that she considers mother an \u201cunsafe\u201d adult, that \u201cshe has scary feelings after visits, and that she, thinks this is why the monsters come to her house.\u201d We acknowledge that mother has had several positive visits with M. Wichmann explained, however, that M\u2019s positive feelings are only possible because M feels safe in a supervised visitation setting. Given that M herself has attributed her anxiety to seeing mother and that her anxious behavior abated when visits were terminated, we reject mother\u2019s assertions that M\u2019s troubling behaviors cannot be conclusively attributed to her unfitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">We are mindful that we must assess whether a parent\u2019s conduct or conditions are seriously detrimental to the parent\u2019s child at the time of the termination hearing. <em>See, e.g., Smith, </em>338 Or at 83-86 (parent not unfit in absence of evidence establishing a nexus between a parent\u2019s mental disorders and the capacity to parent at the time of the hearing); <em>Simmons, </em>342 Or at 96-103 (where mother\u2019s drug abuse has been addressed at the time of trial, there was no evidence that her personality disorder was seriously detrimental to the child, and mother and child had positive interactions, trial court erred by terminating mother\u2019s rights); <em>State ex rel Dept. Human Services v. A. M. P., </em>212 Or App 94, 106-07, 157 P3d 283 (2007) (where there is no evidence of the continuing effect of mother\u2019s past behavior on her children, the state failed to prove serious detriment to the children); <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Huston, </em>203 Or App 640, 646-55, 126 P3d 710 (2006) (where mother acknowledged past wrongdoing and resulting harm to child, treatment providers testified that mother had made progress at the time of trial, and state\u2019s experts could not testify as to mother\u2019s mental status at the time of trial, mother not unfit).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Here, the evidence establishes a nexus between mother\u2019s conduct and conditions and her inability to adequately parent M because her mental conditions render her unable to place M\u2019s needs above her own. <em>Cf. State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. J. A. C., </em>216 Or App 268, 278, 172 P3d 295 (2007) (inability to recognize child\u2019s needs resulting from parent\u2019s mental deficiency rendered parent incapable of providing proper care). Despite some gains in self-esteem, mother had not acknowledged or meaningfully addressed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>conduct and conditions that rendered her unfit at the time of the hearing. As Truhn explained, mother\u2019s lack of genuine insight into her conditions and her emotional and interpersonal instability renders her presently unable to parent M. Moreover, she will not be able to make therapeutic progress until she acknowledges her past wrongdoing and confronts her own accountability, which she has not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">We find the evidence extraordinarily persuasive that M continues to suffer from mother\u2019s past conduct. <em>Cf. A. M. P., </em>212 Or App at 106-07. She fears mother and is extremely anxious about seeing her. The evidence is also clear and convincing that mother presents an ongoing risk to M. She has not taken responsibility for her past conduct and is unrealistic about her future ability to parent. Moreover, M has special psychological needs, including the need for ongoing individual and family therapy that incorporates a trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy model, that mother has failed to recognize. Based on M\u2019s and mother\u2019s circumstances at the time of trial, we conclude that mother\u2019s unreformed conduct and unaddressed conditions continue to be seriously detrimental to M.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The sole mental health worker to opine that mother is capable of parenting M was her therapist, Gayle. Gayle\u2019s explanation as to why that is so is unconvincing: she believes mother\u2019s strong faith, strong will, and determination will enable her to parent M. The record establishes, however, that those attributes have not helped her to minimally adequately parent M in the past, and we see no reason to believe that they will enable her to do so going forward. Gayle also explained that she \u201cwanted [mother] to mature. I wanted to help her to be stable. I was hoping that by her coming to me * * * that she would gain some social skills and relationships and be able to be the mother that she would like to be to [M],\u201d but she agreed that mother has not done that, despite some personal growth. Gayle testified that she believes mother has maladaptive dependent and obsessive-compulsive personality traits that do not rise to the level of a personality disorder, yet she does not know whether she is qualified to make an Axis II diagnosis. She administered no psychometric testing, she neither asked for nor reviewed any collateral information from mother\u2019s DHS file, and she did not speak to any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>caseworkers (and testified that she \u201cprobably should have\u201d). Moreover, Gayle knows nothing about M or her specific needs. Accordingly, we give little weight to Gayle\u2019s opinion regarding whether mother\u2019s conduct or conditions would be seriously detrimental to M if M were returned to her care.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"> We next consider whether it is improbable that M might be integrated into mother\u2019s home within a reasonable time due to conduct or conditions not likely to change. Determining a reasonable period for integration must take into account M\u2019s \u201cemotional and developmental needs and ability to form and maintain lasting attachments.\u201d ORS 419A.004(20); <em>see Stillman, </em>333 Or at 146. \u201cThat inquiry is child-specific. It calls for testimony in psychological and developmental terms regarding the particular child\u2019s requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Wichmann testified that M suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and is at risk for reactive attachment disorder.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> She further testified that M must have stability and permanency before she can \u201cstart to address * * * in a deeper way some of these behavior issues, some of the emotional issues, and that she can get on with her life developmentally.\u201d During her initial assessment of M, Wichmann recommended that M receive individual and family therapy that incorporates a trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy model, and she concluded that relief of M\u2019s trauma symptoms will require permanency and \u201congoing therapeutic support as [M] moves through key developmental stages and tasks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Truhn opined that, even if mother had made the changes that she reported to him, given her psychological conditions \u201cit would be necessary for her to demonstrate continued emotional and interpersonal stability as well as environmental stability\u201d and participate in \u201cintensive individual psychotherapy consisting of individual and group therapy to address the personality issues as well as the possible chronic symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.\u201d If mother were to follow those recommendations, \u201ca year or more would be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>reasonable expectation for her to participate and demonstrate such significant behavioral and personality stability that would be expected for her to be able to provide a safe and stable environment for her child.\u201d Although he disputed Truhn\u2019s diagnostic methodology, Northway agreed that someone suffering from the diagnosis that Truhn gave mother would require at least a year of \u201cintensive therapy.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Given mother\u2019s testimony that she will continue counseling if it works with her schedule, her lack of insight into her own need for treatment, Gayle\u2019s testimony that she failed to make counseling appointments during the three months before trial because she was \u201cbusy getting things together for the court hearing,\u201d and Truhn\u2019s observations that, despite her positive intentions, mother struggles with inconsistent participation in the therapeutic process, we conclude that it will be at least a year, and likely longer, before M can be considered for integration into mother\u2019s home. We further conclude that M\u2019s diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder and her attachment issues, as well as her need for permanency to address that diagnosis and those issues, render a year or more an unreasonable amount of time for this particular child to wait.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Finally, we consider whether termination of mother\u2019s parental rights is in M\u2019s best interests. Mother contends that termination is not in M\u2019s best interests because DHS plans to place the child with her paternal grandmother in Virginia, \u201c [d] espite the fact that [M] has never met her and despite the fact that [M\u2019s] father is a convicted sex offender.\u201d However, the record does not reveal where DHS planned to place M, although it does support a finding by clear and convincing evidence that she is adoptable and that Lange will adopt her if she is not placed with her grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Given M\u2019s need for stability and permanency to address the emotional and psychological wounds she has already suffered, her adoptability, and her ongoing fear of mother, we conclude that termination of mother\u2019s parental rights is in M\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-6\"> Father, an untreated, convicted sex offender, also had his parental rights terminated. He is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b224-7\"> Mother later reported that she was diagnosed with multiple personality disorder because she \u201cwould fake having flashbacks or being somebody else.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b226-6\"> Joffe deferred making an Axis II diagnosis because the psychological evaluation was designed only to assess what services mother might need to become self-sufficient. Axis II is used for diagnosing personality disorders and mental retardation and for noting prominent maladaptive personality features that do not meet the threshold for a personality disorder. American Psychiatric Association, <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders </em>28 (4th ed 2002) <em>(DSM-IV). </em>Axis II disorders are more resistant to treatment than Axis I disorders because Axis II disorders generally involve a more enduring and pervasive set of maladaptive behaviors, perceptions, and beliefs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b226-7\"> Buckner also deferred making an Axis II diagnosis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\"> \u201cBecause of the diversity of clinical presentations, it is impossible for the diagnostic nomenclature to cover every possible situation. Por this reason, each diagnostic class has at least one Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) <em>category.\u201dDSM-IV </em>at 4. An NOS diagnosis may be appropriate (1) if the presentation conforms to the general guidelines for a mental disorder in the diagnostic class but the symptomatic picture does not meet the criteria for any of the specific disorders, (2) if the presentation conforms to a symptom pattern that causes clinically significant distress or impairment but has not been included in the <em>DSM-IV </em>classification, (3) if there is uncertainty about etiology <em>(i.e., </em>whether the disorder results from a general medical condition, is substance induced, or is primary), or (4) if there is insufficient opportunity for complete data collection or inconsistent or contradictory information but there is enough information to place the diagnosis within a particular diagnostic class. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\"> By the time M returned to Diaz in 2007, she was living with a foster parent and had developed polyp point growths around the tubes as a consequence of having not received proper follow-up care. Surgery was required to remove the tubes and growths and to repair the resulting hole in M\u2019s eardrum. Although M\u2019s ears are now healthy, Diaz testified that permanent hearing loss was a potential consequence of the lack of care she received after the tubes were implanted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b228-7\"> The tubes had been in M\u2019s ears for only one month; according to Diaz, post-surgical care would not have been necessary for another three months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b228-8\"> The record does not reveal why mother moved from that shelter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b228-9\"> M was evaluated after being removed from mother\u2019s care and her development was found to be within normal limits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b229-9\"> Joffe again deferred making an Axis II diagnosis during this evaluation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b233-5\"> Mother contended in a letter admitted as a trial exhibit that she could not have locked M in her room because her internal apartment doors did not lock. M\u2019s therapist later explained that, whether or not the door actually locked, M\u2019s \u201cperception of events is what shapes her feelings and memories, and that it was her belief that she was locked in her room.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b233-6\"> Purcell was also concerned about mother\u2019s romantic relationships, and she testified that mother told her that mother had \u201cunderage\u201d boyfriends.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b233-7\"> At the time of trial, mother\u2019s MySpace page contained a plea for people to send her money to \u201chelp me get caught up on my rent.\u201d Mother explained that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>plea had \u201cbeen on there for a while,\u201d even though she claimed that she no longer owed that amount in rent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b234-6\"> Forsberg, who had supervised visits before M was returned to mother\u2019s care, testified that she saw M and mother together in the community after M was returned and that M was unkempt and \u201cwould kind of wander behind mom when they were walking down the street or in the store. * * * She was just kind of basically trying to keep up with mom.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b234-7\"> Lange later told Holmes that, after the police left, mother told Lange that \u201cshe has been through this before, don\u2019t you think I know what to say. If I tell them I have a support system then they cannot do nothing to me. * * * [Mother] beat the system and was so proud of herself. She let me know it too.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b236-6\"> Mother later reported to a psychologist that she has a \u201cdirty issue\u201d and admitted to excessively wiping herself, using up to a roll of toilet paper each day. Caseworker Mary Six, who did not testify at trial, wrote in November 2006 that mother \u201cwould wipe [M] so hard, she would bleed so this is what [M has] learned. Foster mom has been working with her on not wiping herself so hard and [M] is concerned she is dirty based on what she was told by her mom.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b238-6\"> While M was living with Lange, M\u2019s paternal grandmother, who was being considered as a potential permanent placement, had been calling M about once a week. Although the record does not reveal why, she stopped calling M for a period of time around the same time the visits with mother were stopped. Wichmann noted that the decreased contact with her paternal grandmother \"could also be helping reduce anxiety.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b245-5\"> On cross-examination, Northway acknowledged that, even without the scoring error, mother\u2019s score on that particular scale was \u201cextremely high.\u201d Additionally, as noted above, Ewell reported similar results during his evaluation of mother.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b245-6\"> Northway acknowledged during cross-examination, however, that the test would have been more appropriate in mother\u2019s case because her history suggests \u201csome clinical problems.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b246-6\"> The parties stipulated at the close of evidence that, if recalled by the state, Truhn would testify that the results of his evaluation would be the same if he disregarded the MCMI-III and its results.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b246-7\"> Van Elsberg plans to work there at least three more years. At the time of trial, mother was behind on her rent, but she had not yet received an eviction notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b250-11\"> The state also alleged that mother failed to present a viable plan for the return of M and that mother failed to obtain and maintain a stable and suitable living situation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b254-6\"> Mother claimed in a letter admitted as a trial exhibit that Purcell instructed her to strike M with a spoon, and that she did not like doing so because it made M cry. Given M\u2019s subsequent disclosures to Wichmann that mother whipped her with hangers and Lange\u2019s testimony that mother asked her \u201chow she could stop hitting [M],\u201d we find that statement in mother\u2019s letter not credible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b256-5\"> We also note that mother told Dubie in 2003 that she did not need a safety plan because she was no longer depressed, yet the record contains clear and convincing evidence of multiple threats of suicide by mother in 2004 and 2005. Her past predictions about her future mental health have not materialized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b260-6\"> Wichmann also testified that she could have also diagnosed M on Axis I with sexual abuse of a child. She noted in her initial assessment (months before M told her that mother and Aaron had \u201ctouched her private parts\u201d) that M\u2019s trauma symptoms were \u201cconsistent with a child who has been sexually abused.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b261-5\"> We note that M\u2019s disclosures of abuse would also have to be further explored before M could be safely returned to mother\u2019s care. Wichmann, Ewell, and Truhn each recommended that mother submit to a psychosexual evaluation, and Gayle indicated that the allegations would have to be discussed with mother before she could opine as to whether M should be returned. Although the record lacks clear and convincing evidence of sexual abuse, the exploration of M\u2019s allegations could significantly increase the amount of time needed before M could be considered for reintegration into mother\u2019s home.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
