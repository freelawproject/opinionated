He afterward came in and was brought up on his' own petition to have judgment pronounced; but the record of the conviction not being made up and brought into court, the bench said they had nothing before them on which to proceed. Bishop, in his Criminal Law, says, if a verdict will sustain a judgment, the judgment must be pronounced instead of a new trial being granted. Chief-Justice Shaw says, in <em>T3x parte </em>Diclc, \u201c There is a manifest difference between the case of the offense upon which the party stands convicted, and upon which sentence is now to be passed.\u201d (14 Pick., 88.) \u201cThe legal meaning of\u2018conviction,\u2019 is that legal proceeding of record which ascertains the guilt of the party, and upon which the sentence or judgment is founded, as a verdict, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>plea of outlawry, or the like. The law implies that there must be a conviction before punishment. (1 Hawk P. C., c. 10, \u00a7 9.) Judgment amounts to conviction, but it does not follow that every one who is convict is adjudged.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>(Shaw, O. J., <em>Richard\u2019s Case, </em>17 Pick., 296.) <em>\u201c </em>Conviction is a condition-precedent to judgment.\u201d (Denn. Or. Oases, 668.) \u201c The judgment consists of two parts, viz, the conviction and the sentence or award of punishment.\u201d (1 Paley, 207.) That conviction is not always followed by judgment, see also 8 Wendell, 204; 4 Ill. Bep., 76. And that it must precede judgment, see 1 Canes, 72; 35 Me. Bep., 594; 16 Ark., 601. Conviction is theeffeetof substantial evidence. (Crabbe\u2019s Syn.) It is simply finding a person guilty by verdict of a jury. (Bisb. Orim. Law.) If the jury find him guilty, he is then said to be <em>convicted. </em>(Blaokstoue, book IY, 362.) If a person is convicted, and never sentenced, the conviction may be pleaded in bar. (5 Wheaton, 31; Serg. Const. Law, 278.) It prevents a second prosecution for the same offense. (1 Me. L. C. C., 429; 7 Conn., 4l4; 14 Ohio, 295; 2 Yerg, Tenn., 24; 28 Pa. St. Bep., 13; 2 Gratt. Va.; 558.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-6\">In any event, it is not competent for the Commissioner to go behind the certificates of <em>\u201c </em>the United States district attorney having charge of the case.\u201d The contract is fixed and determinate upon their production. If not in due form or incomplete they can be rejected, otherwise they are conclusive, and the facts certified to are indisputable; they furnish no evidence or data as to the value of the services rendered, and an equitable allowance, or <em>quantum meruit </em>compensation, of one hundred dollars in each case is a violation of the contract. The rate of reward having been determined and stipulated in advance, becomes an essential element of the contract, iuto which, by giving his time and services, the claimant entered in good faith. By accepting these certificates as evidence of the claimant\u2019s service the Department is estopped from inquiring into its value. That is adjudicated by the very terms of the contract, and the payment of a portion due thereunder is an admission of the whole liability. Even if sentence were necessary, as a component part of the forfeiture and conviction, the certificates all say the defendant was \u201c sentenced to pay all costs in the case; \u201d and as to the forfeitures and sales, they were the results of proceedings <em>in rem, </em>and the very condemnation and sale form, in their nature, the judgment and sentence of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number><em>Mr. John S. Blair </em>(with whom was the <em>Assistant Attorney-General) </em>for the defendant:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-5\">The share of the informer is limited to a moiety by <em>Aet 13th </em>July, 1866, (14 Stat. L., 145,) and the Secretary of the Treasury was not allowed to go beyond it. The <em>Act 2d </em>March, 1867, (14 Stat. L., 473, \u00a7 7.) which authorized the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to pay necessary expenses in detecting violations of the internal-revenue law, expressly limits him to cases where such expenses are not otherwise provided by law. Congress having already provided for the reward to informers, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue was not authorized by this act to exceed the moiety, and his offer of reward creates no contract that is binding on the United States. But, if the act did authorize such offer, the offer must conform to the act, and where the offer contains a word capable of two interpretations, th\u00bbt one must be adopted which corresponds to the language and meaning of the act. The language of the act is \u201csuch sums <em># * * </em>for detecting and bringing to trial and punishment persons guilty of violating,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-7\">The word \u201cconviction,\u201d in its general sense, means the judgment of the court against a defendant in a criminal case. It also means the verdict of the jury, or the plea of guilty; but, inasmuch as the verdict of the jury is liable to be set aside on motion in arrest of judgment, or for a new trial, it cannot be considered sufficient to vest the right to the reward until judgment is pronounced, and all issues thus finally decided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-8\">\u201c It is the judgment, and that only, which is received as the legal, and conclusive evidence of the party\u2019s guilt.\u201d (Greenleaf on Evidence, \u00a7375.) \u201cThe judgment, and that only, can be received as legal evidence of the party\u2019s guilt, for the purpose of rendering him incompetent to testify ; the finding of a jury is insufficient, because it may be reversed or set aside.\u201d (Bou-vier\u2019s Inst., \u00a7 3188.) Whatever may be the peculiar position of the defendant between verdict and judgment in the court where tried, yet in other courts the ouly evidence of conviction is the judgment of the court. Until such judgment the case is pending, and this claimant must wait for the legal determination of those suits before bringing his action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-9\">In the case of <em>Bex </em>v. Luclmp, (2 Strange, 1048,) where, by statute, the informer was entitled to a forfeiture \u201c upon con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>viction,\u201d it was held that the action must be brought upon the judgment <em>quod convictus est. </em>'And the same rule may well be applied here. The sentence of payment of costs is merely interlocutory.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-4\">There are two ways by which this court can be informed that the indictment was good, that the proceedings were regular, and that there will be no new trial: one is by the judgment of that court, and the other is by a revision of its proceedings. The former, we contend, is the legitimate method. But, as is well known, this offer of $300, independent of the value of the matter forfeited, led, in a great many instances, to collusion. The mere imposition <em>of </em>the <em>costs </em>and forfeiture of stills worth less than $300 has a tendency to foster such cases, and the United States may well insist on the punishment of these defendants before payment of the reward.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-5\">That the verdict of the jury will, in some instances, prevent a second,prosecution of the offense seems to be established by the authorities cited in claimant\u2019s brief. But Williams, J., in <em>State v. Benham, </em>(7 Conn., 414,) cited by claimant\u2019s counsel, says there is much doubt whether the legal principle of the necessity of a j udgment has been extended to cases of that kind; but because both prosecutions were in the same court, and no claim is made that judgment cannot be rendered on the.same verdict, \u201cunder such circumstances\u201d he decides that the second information ought not to be supported.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-6\">' The difference in principle between a second prosecution for the s ame offense, and an action for reward while the conviction is incomplete, is sufficient to deprive those decisions of any force in the case in hand. The legal principle of the necessity of a judgment is not extended to the former on account of the tenderness always exhibited toward a culprit, but that is no reason why judgment should not be necessary in an action on a contract for services.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b206-7\">Nott, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A5g\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">The <em>Act 2d March, </em>1867, (14 Stat. L., 471, \u00a7 7,) provides \u201c that the Commissioner of Internal Bevenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, is hereby authorized to pay such sums, not exceeding in the aggregate the amount appropriated therefor, as may, in his judgment, be deemed' necessary for de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>tecting and bringing to trial and punishment persons guilty of violating the internal-revenue laws, or conniving at the same, in cases where such expenses are not otherwise provided by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The discretion conferred by this statute is very broad, inasmuch as the payments authorized are referred absolutely to the united \u201c <em>judgment\u201d </em>of the Commissioner and Secretary, and the only restriction set upon their discretion is that the money shall be paid \u201c for detecting and bringing to trial and punishment persons guilty of violating the internal-revenue laws or conniving at the same, in cases where such expenses are not otherwise provided by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">It is insisted by the counsel for the defendants that this term \u201c expenses\u201d was intended to embrace those cases where, under the provisions of another statute, <em>{Act 13ih July, </em>1866,14 Stat. L., 98,145,) an informer might share in the proceeds of a forfeiture; and hence that the \u201c expenses\u201d in this case were \u201c otherwise provided by law.\u201d But the word \u201c expense,\u201d both in its etymology and ordinary use, indicates expenditure, outlay, the disbursement of money, the payment of a price. To agree to share with a man the proceeds of property which is neither owned nor possessed, and which may never be acquired, would ordinarily be spoken of as an agreement that would \u201c put the Government to no expense.\u201d Here was a class of offenders that, in the judgment of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, could not be reached by the ordinary means of dividing forfeitures with informers. It was necessary, therefore, that the Government should be at the expense of procuring their detection and punishment, or that they should go unpunished. To give moderate rewards for the detection and punishment of such persons seems a reasonable exercise of the discretion vested in the Treasury Department by the statute. Therefore the offer of the reward which forms the basis of the present action was within the authority vested in the Commissioner and Secretary, and a proper exercise of their official discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The offer thus made was of a reward for \u201cinformation\u201d which should lead to the \u201cforfeiture\u201d of an illicit distillery, and to the \u201cconviction\u201d of the person engaged in operating it. And the offer then expressly agrees that the reward shall \u201cbe paid upon the receipt of the certificate of the United States district attorney having charge of the case that the person so claiming such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>reward is the person who furnished such information.\u201d It is conceded by the defendants that certain illicit distilleries were forfeited, and that the claimant produced and delivered to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue the requisite certificates of the proper district attorney; bub it is contended that there was no \u201cconviction\u201d of the guilty parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The certificates of the district attorney state that each of the persons against whom information had been given by the claimant was \u201c convicted,\u201d and the record of the court shows that each was found guilty of the offeuse charged in the indictment by the verdict of a jury, but that judgment on the verdict was not prayed for by the district attorney, and on his motion was suspended \u201con the payment of all costs.\u201d The objection which the defendants\u2019 counsel raises on this word \u201cconviction\u201d is strictly technical. .</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">We are of the opinion that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue did not use the word in any such technical sense. It was his purpose to procure evidence or information which should ler.1 to the legal ascertainment of the guilty parties\u2019 guilt. When that was ascertained, that is to say, when a verdict of guilty was rendered, all would be accomplished by the informer\u2019s information that could be effected by evidence; and the remaining proceedings would be entirely beyond the scope of his undertaking. It never could have been the iutent of the OonryypS-sioner that the informer should furnish a prosecuting officer who would perfect the conviction into a judgment, nor that he should induce a district attorney, over whom he had no control, to move for judgment after a verdict should be rendered. The contract arising from the offer and the services under it was for information which should stand the practical test of accomplishing the purpose for which it was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">But though the proceedings in the district court may not have ripened into that conclusive form which would be indisputable evidence of a defendant\u2019s.guilt in another tribunal, they nevertheless amounted to a conviction so far as to preclude the Government from again puttiug a defendant in jeopardy for the same offense. The district court was the tribunal which had exclusive jurisdiction of the offeuse, and a second trial on the same indictment, or a second indictment for the same cause, must be broughj; in the same court. Assuredly, after the United States had elected to hold the judgment <em>in terrorem </em>over a defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>and had exacted from him the payment of all costs, no court would allow him to be again subjected to the costs and harass-men ts of a second prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">The counsel for the defendants has also argued that the term \u201c conviction\u201d in the offer of reward is to be construed by reference to the statute, as meaning, in its words, \u201ctrial and punishment.\u201d We are of the same opinion, but draw from it a different N'' Nee; which is, that the statute enlarges rather than re-soricts the intent of the word \u201c conviction.\u201d The informer\u2019s information led to an indictment, to a trial, and to a verdict of guilty. It also led to punishment; not to a punishment by fine or imprisonment on the judgment of the court, but to a lesser, modified punishment, inflicted at-the instance of the prosecuting officer, who deemed it best to hold the judgment in suspense over the heads of offenders as security for their future good behavior, and who at the same time exacted from them, under its pressure, the payment of \u201call costs,\u201d which, for anything we know to the contrary, may have included the reward to be paid to this informer. The case, therefore, seems to comply with the conditions of both the offer and the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The judgment of the court is that the claimant recover of the defendants the sum of $1,400.</p>\n<judges id=\"b209-6\">Peck, J., was absent when this case was heard, and took no part in the decision.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
