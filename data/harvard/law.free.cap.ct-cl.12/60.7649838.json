See <em>Ross\u2019s Case, (post.)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-10\">The following are the facts found by the court below :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-11\">I. On the 6th of April, 1865, the claimant lost, by robbery, while in the line of his duty as assistant paymaster in the Army, at Franklin, Tex., a package of Government funds. The package was in Ms official safe at his quarters, and the loss was without fault or neglect on the part of the officer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-12\">II..The claimant, after duly reporting the loss and making-known the facts to his superior officers, credited himself in his next account-current as follows: \u201cAmount lost by robbery of safe at Franklin, Tex., $15,979.87.\u201d This item of credit was not acted upon by the accounting-officers of the Treasury until the final revision of his accounts, on the 6th of November, 1871, when it was disallowed, and charged to him as a balance on hand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-13\">III. The robbery was committed in the day-time by forcibly breaking into the claimant\u2019s quarters, during his temporary absence, and then forcibly breaking into the Government safe, in which the funds were. Two persons were apprehended and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>tried by military commission held at the headquarters of the Department of Hew Mexico, on the 5th June, 1865, (upon the charges and specifications annexed.) On the trial the claimant was a witness, and testified as to the amount of the funds stolen. The commission found the prisoners guilty, (by the finding also annexed,) and the proceedings of the commission were duly approved, and the sentence of the commission carried into effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-5\">The claimant, at the time of the robbery, had no clerk or assistant. It appears, from other testimony, that a package of money was in the safe, but the precise amount thereof was known to no person but the claimant. He was of good character, personally and officially, and had always kept regular and exact accounts of the funds in his official custody, and had made due returns in regard to, and properly accounted for, the S|une. He immediately reported to his superior officers that the funds in that safe were $15,979.87, which was the amount of the loss appearing on his subsequent official reports, and charged against him as deficiency on the final revision and settlement of his accounts by the accounting-officers of the Treasury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-6\">IY. On the 17th of February, 1873, a suit was instituted by the United States, in th\u201ce Circuit Court of the United States for the first circuit, on the official bond of said claimant, which suit is still pending, to recover the sum of $20,000, claimed to be due from him thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-7\">\n<em>Court-martial record referred to in the preceding findings.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-8\">[General Orders.
