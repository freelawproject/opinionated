D. 1873, the petitioner was legally appointed and sworn by the supreme court of the District of Columbia administrator of the personal estate of Peter Lammond, deceased, who at the time of his death was a citizen and resident of the District aforesaid. That the said Peter Lammond was at one time a disbursing-clerk in the Interior Department, and subsequently a clerk of the .first class, at a salary of $1,200 per annum, in the Third Auditor\u2019s Office, unto which latter position he was appointed April 26, 1866, and was paid his salary from and including that date to January 6,1869. In January, 1869, an order was issued stopping his pay, and he was not paid from and including the 7th of January, 1869, to the 20th of April, 1869, when he was removed. His salary for the time the stoppage continued, not including Government tax, was $345.76. The reason for this stoppage of Lammond\u2019s pay was because upon a settlement of his accounts as disbursing-clerk of the Interior Department by the proper officers, it was the opinion of these officers that his accounts showed a balance due by him to the Government. Subsequently suit was entered in the supreme court of the District of Columbia by the United States against Lammond and his sureties upon his bond, to recover the amount of the supposed deficiency. This suit came on for trial on the 14th of April, 1873, and was decided in favor of Lammond and his sureties by a verdict and judgment. This judgment determines finally that there was no deficiency in Mr. Lammond\u2019s accounts, and establishes his right to the amount of salary accrued and withheld on account of his supposed deficiency. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-6\">The defendants in the present?action filed the following plea of set-off:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-7\">\u201cAnd now comes the Attorney-General on behalf of the United States, and for a further plea in this behalf, by leave of the court, says that the said claimant ought not to maintain his aforesaid action against said defendants, because he says that said Peter Lammond, said intestate, before the commencement of this suit, and at the time of his death, to wit, on the 20th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>day of April, 1866, at tbe city of Washington, was indebted to the United States, said defendants, in the sum of $5,000 of lawful money of the United States, for this, that whereas, on or about and before the 3d day of November, 1856, the said Peter Lammond was duly and according to law appointed, by the Secretary of the Interior, a disbursiug-clerk for the Department of the Interior, which appointment was duly accepted by him; and that on or about and after the said 3d day of November he entered upon the discharge of tbe duties of said disbursing-officer, and so remained until on or about the 25th day of April, 1866, the duties of said office being to receive, disburse, and properly account for all such moneys as he should receive from the United States as such disbursing-officer, and to return on demand all such moneys as should not have been properly disbursed; and that said Peter Lammond, as such officer, in his life-time, received of the United States, said defendants, large sums of lawful money of the United States, to wit, the sum of $100,000, but the said Lammond, while such officer, neglected to properly disburse or account for said $5,000 of said moneys so received by him as such officer as aforesaid, and has hitherto neglected and refused so to do, and said Lammond in his lifetime, and said claimant, as such administrator, since his death, have neglected and refused, and still do neglect and refuse, to pay over or account to said defendants for said sum of $5,000, or any part thereof, although heretofore often requested so to do, which said sum, before and at the time of the commencement of this suit, was and still is due and owing from said claimant-administrator as aforesaid to the said defendants by reason of the premises, and this the said defendants are ready to verify. Wherefore said defendants will set off against any amount (if any) that may be found due from defendants to said claimant, as alleged in his said petition, and demand judgment against said claimant-administrator, as aforesaid, for the balance of said $5,000, according to the statute in such case made and provided.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b315-5\"><em>Messrs, Durants Hornor </em>for the claimant:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-6\">Under Revised Statutes, 367, the compensation of regular clerks of the first class is $1,200 annually. Under Revised Statutes, 168, the compensation of temporary clerks is the same as that of regular clerks of like rank.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Therecord from the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia is conclusive on the other question involved, which is that the petitioner's claim is extinguished by a set-off. <em>(Packet Co. </em>v. <em>Sickles, </em>5 Wall., 581; <em>Aurora City v. West, </em>7 Wall., 82; <em>Beloit </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>7 Wall., 619.)</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b316-6\"><em>Mr. John S. Blair </em>(with whom was the <em>Assistant Attorney-General) </em>for the defendants:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-7\">If the former action was determined upon the issue raised by the plea of <em>nil debet, </em>the plaintiff is right; if, however, it was determined on the plea of <em>non est factum, </em>he is not. Failure to prove the execution of the bond by each and all the defendants entitled all to judgment; in other words, if any defendant was entitled to judgment on this plea all were, because a judgment <em>ex contractu </em>cannot be severed, and no presumption can arise that the joint action was defeated on a defense common to all the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-8\">Again, a defense arising from the bond itself, even if common to all the defendants, such as the plea of statute or invalidity of the bond, under the plea of <em>non est factum, </em>would not bar an action brought <em>dehors </em>the bond for Lammond\u2019s original indebtedness. Of the four pleas of defendants, therefore, the plaintiff is confined to the one <em>nil debet </em>to create the estoppel he here seeks to set up.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-9\">In the case of <em>Packet Company </em>v. <em>Sickles, </em>(5 Wall., 580,) Nelson, J., said, (p. 592:) \u201cIf the record of the former trial shows that the verdict could not have been rendered without deciding the particular matter, it will be considered as having settled that matter as to all future actions between the parties.\u201d \u201cIf it be not shown\u201d <em>(i. e., </em>either from therecord or <em>aliunde) </em>\u201cthat the verdict and judgment necessarily involved its consideration and determination, it will not be concluded.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-10\">Inasmuch, therefore, as $3,600 of the amount demanded might have been determined, on the plea of set-off, and the whole demand might have been determined on the pleas of statute of limitations or <em>non est factum, </em>it cannot be said that the verdict necessarily involved the consideration of the plea of <em>nil debet. </em>(See <em>Braden </em>v. <em>The United States, </em>10 O. Ols. R, 412.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-11\">The case of <em>Aurora Gity </em>v. <em>West, </em>(7 Wall., 82,) on page 103, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>re-asserts the doctrine (stated <em>supra) </em>of Packet Company <em>v. </em>Sickles.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-5\">The broad statement, in Aurora City <em>v. </em>West, that \u201c whatever might have been within the scope of the pleadings in the former suit must be held as concluded by the judgment,\u201d should be viewed through the circumstances of that case. There the judgments relied upon as estoppels were judgments on demurrer, and the issues were issues of law. In the light of their then recent decision, in Packet Company v. Sickles, where the estoppel was raised on a judgment upon issues of fact, it cannot be considered that the Supreme Court, in Aurora City <em>v. </em>West, meant to declare the law for any estoppels other than those by judgment upon issues of law. The special plea of defendants, filed February 12, 1877, asserts a counter-estoppel, and the plaintiff\u2019s former plea of set-off, accompanied by the bill of particulars, brought before the jury the very claim for which he now sues; if \u201cwhatever might have been within the scope of the pleadings in the former-suit must be held as concluded by the judgment,\u201d his present claim is barred.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b317-6\">Nott, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ALd\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">In this case it cannot be determined by an inspection of the record whether the judgment and verdict in the Supreme Court of the District in favor of the defendant there, the claimant here, went upon his plea of <em>non est factum, </em>of <em>nil </em>debet, or of set-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">The learned counsel for the claimant has replied to this objection of uncertainty that the Supreme Court of the District had no jurisdiction of the set-off, and hence that it could not have furnished ground for the verdict. But a majority of the judges are of the opinion that the cross-demand against the United States, which the defendant in the other court sought to use against the plaintiffs there, was one which might have been set up against the Government and used strictly as a set-off within the intent and reasoning of the Supreme Court in <em>Tillou\u2019s Case. </em>(7 C. Cls. R., 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">This case is therefore remanded to the general docket, with leave to the parties to show, <em>aliunde </em>the record, the matters which were submitted to and passed upon by the jury in the former suit.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b317-10\">Peck, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A70\">dissented.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Subsequently at Chambers the claimant moved for a rehearing. The following are the motion-papers, and the opinion filed by the judge at Chambers, disposing of this motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\">\u201cIn this case the counsel of petitioner respectfully asks that the court may grant a rehearing and set aside the judgment pronounced herein on the 7th May, 1877, and in support of this ' application the following suggestions are presented:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">\u201c The petitioner claimed $345.76 balance of salary due his decedent as a clerk in theDepartment of the Interior. To this defendants pleaded in offset that petitioner was at the date of his death, 20th April, 1876, indebted to them in the sum of $5,000, to which the petitioner, by way of replication, said that on 27th February, 1869, defendants brought suit in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia against petitioner\u2019s decedent for the, money set up in the defendants\u2019 plea of offset, and on 14th April 1873, judgment went in favor of petitioner\u2019s decedent. To this replication defendants put in a rejoinder denying the fact, and on this issue the parties went to trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">\u201cThe burden of proof was on the petitioner, who showed by a record from the supreme court of the District of Columbia, in a suit in which defendants were plaintiffs and petitioner\u2019s decedent and the sureties on his official bond were defendants, that the same claim, now offered in set-off, had been then set up against them; that they had pleaded: 1st, mow <em>est </em>factum; 2d, no cause of action within five years; 3d, <em>nil </em>debet; 4th, set-off of $ \u2014 \u25a0\u2014\u2014, and that the jury found a verdict \u2018in favor of the defendants,\u2019 whereupon the court gave judgment \u2018 that the plaintiff\u2019 (the United States) \u2018take nothing by its suit, and the defendants\u2019 (petitioner\u2019s decedent and his sureties) \u2018 go without day.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">\u201cThe meaning of the verdict was that all the issues were found in favor of the petitioner\u2019s decedent. What is the meaning of this in law? It clearly means that the United States recover nothing from the defendant in that case, and that the plea of set-off is sustained. But as in a case where no recovery is had by the United States no judgment against them on a plea of set-off can be given, therefore the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia gave no judgment on the plea of set-off against petitioner\u2019s decedent. The case of Tillou, as decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, (6 Wall., 484, and 7 C. Cls. B., 18,) is precisely in point. In that case Tillou was one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>executors of Eckford, who had been surety on the bond of Swart-wout, collector of the port of New York. Tillou set up various pleas, and among them set-off. The verdict was for the defendant, and the, jury found a fixed sum in his favor against the United States, for which Tillou sued in this court, where it was allowed, but the Supreme Court held that such a judgment against the United States was a nullity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-4\">Tillou\u2019s case was decided in the United States Supreme Court at December term, 1867.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">The case of petitioner\u2019s decedent was tried in the Supreme Court District of Columbia, in April, 1873, and with the former' as precedent before it, the United States recovering nothing, there could be no judgment of offset against them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">If this be the correct view of the matter, as we insist it is, it would be a vain thing for us to look for proofs of what the jury decided, when that matter is set at rest by the record we have before us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">We respectfully ask, therefore, that the court will revise the judgment ordering this case back to the general docket, and give judgment in favor of petitioner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">May 14, 1877.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">DUBANT <em>&amp; </em>HOBNOB,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-10\"><em>For </em>Petitioner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-11\">At Chambers, <em>July </em>2,1877.</blockquote>\n<author id=\"AZ4\">Nott, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AOF\">filed the following opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">The claimant moves for a rehearing, and to set aside an order remanding this case to the trial docket for further evidence. The point upon which it is thought the court erred was a point presented at the trial and considered in the disposition .of the case. Where there has been no oversight or misapprehension, in the nature of a mistake of fact, a decision upon a point must be regarded as final by the court unless one of the judges who joined in rendering the judgment complained of should desire a re-argument after examining the grounds upon which it is asked. In that event the motion presented in the first instance at chambers will be sent to the law docket for hearing. If no member of the court desire to have the motion heard, it will be denied at chambers.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">I have accordingly submitted the claimant\u2019s motion to those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>of tbe judges wbo are present, and am authorized to say that none desire a re-argument of the case. The other judges before whom the ease was heard being absent from the city, the motion cannot be submitted to them now. The claimant must elect whether he will proceed during the vacation to take further evidence, or to resubmit this application for a rehearing at the November sittings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
