One item is flour. The claimants\u2019 bid for all the supplies is accepted. The contract specifies the supplies as those io be purchased by the Bureau for the public service, and transported over a certain railroad, under a designated contract ivith that road. Instead of purchasing all of the supplies asid sending them over that road, as contemplated by the advertisement, and supposed by the contractors, the Bureau pus-chases the flour from third persons deliverable at the agencies by the vendors.

the claimant, Piper, before the claimants made proposals under the advertisement mentioned in the next succeeding finding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-28\">III.

Under said advertisement the claimants made proposals for the transportation of goods and supplies purchased by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Indian Department for the public service in the Kiowa, Upper Arkansas, and Wichita agencies, and their proposals were accepted, and the contract between the said Hoag and the claimants was entered into, as set forth in the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-6\">Y. On the day of the date of said contract the said Hoag entered into and signed the agreement set forth in the petition with M. L. Sargent, general freight-agent, for and in behalf of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa F\u00e9 Railroad.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-7\">YI. Between the 1st of July, 1873, and the 1st of July, 1874, the Government purchased and caused to be transported to and delivered at the said three,agencies flour in the following quantities, to wit: At the Kiowa agency, 569,400 pounds; at the Upper Arkansas agency, 276,000 pounds; and at the Wichita agency, 156,150 pounds; no part of which was delivered to the claimants for transportation under the aforesaid -contract with them; but all of it was transported to said agencies by other parties, under contracts between them and the Bureau of Indian Affairs at Washington.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-8\">VII. If the said flour had been delivered to the claimants for transportation, they were prepared to transport it, on the terms set forth in their said contract; and the transportation thereof would have cost them, in the winter season,.from one dollar to one dollar and twenty-five cents per 100 pounds per 100 miles; and in the other seasons eighty cents per 100 pounds per 100 miles.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-9\">VIII. It does not appear that any part of the flour mentioned in finding VI was transported to Wichita over the Atchison, Topeka and Santa F\u00e9 Railroad.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-10\">Upon the foregoing facts the court, upon the grounds set forth in the accompanying opinion, holds that the claimants are not entitled' to recover.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b230-11\"><em>Mr. J. W. Smith </em>for the claimants:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-12\">The exact issue in this case is whether or not the flour in question was included in the contract. It is simply a question of the application of the contract to its proper subject-matter. In offering parol testimony on this point, it is not proposed to contradict, vary, add to, or subtract from tfe contract, or to import new words into it, or to show what the parties secretly intended as opposed to what they have said, but rather to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>what that intention was that they did express, and to satisfy the Court that the flour in question was, in contemplation of the contracting parties, part and parcel of the \u201c goods, subsistence stores, merchandise, and freights \u201d stipulated to be transported, first by the A. T. and S. F. B. B., and then by the plaintiffs. \u201c Whether parcel or not of the estate demised, is always matter of evidence.\u201d <em>(D\u00f3e </em>v. <em>Burt, </em>1 T. B., 704.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-4\">\u201c We think we may lay down this principle as the just result: that in giving effect to a written contract by applying it to its proper subject-matter, extrinsic evidence may be admitted to prove the circumstances under which it was made whenever, without the aid of such evidence, such application could not be made in the particular case.\u201d <em>(Bradley </em>v. <em>W. &amp; A. 8. P. Go., </em>13 Pet., 99.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-5\">Extrinsic evidence has been admitted in many cases to show whether words were used in a past, present, or future sense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-6\">The ambiguities in the Piper-Laflin contract are of the same nature. The word \u201c purchased \u201d\u201eis susceptible of a past or prospective sense. It may mean goods that had been purchased or goods to be purchased, or both. Iu the railroad. contract to which reference is made the goods are spoken of as \u201cpurchased\u201d (past) and \u201crequiring (present) transportation,\u201d indicating that they had been purchased and were then ready for and awaiting needed transportation. And while the word \u201ctransported,\u201d which apparently occupies an equivalent position in the same sentence, seems to have been used in a future sense, on the other hand the stipulation to deliver three-fourths of the goods by December 20 points strongly to a purchased and specific subject-matter \u2014 to a past sense of \u201c purchased\u201d \u2014 for if future, how could it be known how much three-fourths was or when there had been compliance with this stipulation ? (The stipulation that \u201c all of said freight shall be delivered at such intervals and in such quantities and to such points as the said party of the first part may require \u201d was evidently intended to give the Government the selection of the goods to be taken by each train, and of its destination according to the needs of the agencies.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-7\">The advertisements and the parol evidence in this case show the meaning of the contract to be that contended for by the claimant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>It can be sufficiently gathered from the language of the contract and from admissible parol evidence that the true subject-matter of the contract was the goods named in the advertisement of May 20. The words \u201c and transported over said,\u201d &amp;c., may be rejected as surplusage under the rule <em>of falsa demonstrate non nocet, </em>or they may be read (as they were unquestionably intended) \u201cto be transported.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-6\">It is manifest that had this flour been tendered to the plaintiffs to carry, or had it been supplied as the Indian Department led them and Mr. Hoag to believe it would be supplied, they could not have evaded its carriage under the general language of the contract, and what the one party was obliged to carry the other party was obliged to furnish to be carried.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b232-7\">ilir. <em>Horace M.
