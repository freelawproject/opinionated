The order is silent as to the proposition of the owner. He puts the Government in possession. Subsequently the house is used as a militm'y small-pox hospital; the dead are buried there, waste is committed, and finally the house is destroyed by fire. Before the expiration of the first year the Government reduces the rent to </em>$250 <em>a month, but the landlord accepts amd regularly receipts in full therefor. The court below decides that the premises loere let on the terms of the letter, except as modified by the (yrder; that the obligation to keep in repair made the tenant liable for the loss by accidental fire ; that the use of the premises as a burial-ground was an injury for which the tenant is liable; that qmmises leased for a military hospitalmay beused as h military small-pox hospital; that the acceptance of payment and giving receipts in full-bar u suit for the portion of the rent withheld. Judgment for the claimant accordingly. Both parties appeal.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b75-12\">I.

Where the owner oifers by letter to lease property on certain terms, and a military officer orders that they be rented on <em>\u201cthe following terms,\u201d </em>differing in several particulars from those proposed, and the owner puts the Government in possession, it will he held that the order was a new offer <em>in toto, </em>and not a modification of that proposed hy the landlord.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b76-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>III.

It arises, notwithstanding that in the articles of agreement there is an express stipulation to leave the premises in the same state as they were at the commencement of the tenancy. <em>(White </em>v. <em>Nicholson, </em>4 Man. &amp; Gr., 95 j 43 E. O. L. Rep., 58.) But it does not arise when the tenant holds under an express contract which provides for the very <em>matter </em>\u2014 beeping the premises in tenantable repair. <em>(Stan-den </em>v. Christmas, <em>etc., </em>10 Adol. &amp; Ell., U. S., 135; 59 E. O. L. Rep., 135.) <em>Nave v. Berry </em>(22 Ala., 382) was an action of assumpsit upon a lease of a tavern-building, which was by an assignee of the lessees used as a ladies\u2019 seminary, and while so used was destroyed by fire. Lessor contended that such use was not authorized by the lease. The court held that- it .was, the lease simply designating it as the old tavern-building, and containing no stipulation as to its future use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"222\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>The court have found that the United States held the premises from August 23,1861, to September 30,1867, under an agreement in writing reserving a rent of $500 per month, and that this rent was not paid, but only a smaller sum was paid aud receipted for in the terms stated in the finding. The petition averred that under an order of the Secretary of War, aud without the concurrence of the claimant, the monthly payments had been reduced to $250 and afterwards to $200, and the court, finding that these amounts had been receipted for as the monthly rents, ruled that such receipts barred all further claims. It is conceded that such receipts would be evidence tending to show that the original contract had been changed or modified, but the court did not consider them in such light, but, finding in effect that the contract of lease remains unchanged, rule that the receipt of $250 was a satisfaction of a debt of $500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"223\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-6\">Such is not the law. \u201c The payment of a part of a debt is no legal satisfaction of the debt, although the creditor receive the smaller sum in full discharge of the whole demand and give a receipt accordingly.\u201d (Ohitty Oont., 578, and cases cited.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"224\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-7\">There are no facts in this case to bring it within the adverse ruling of this court in the cases of <em>Adams </em>v. <em>The United States </em>and <em>Child </em>v. <em>The United States.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"225\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b88-8\"><em>Mr. Assistant Attorney-General Smith </em>for the United States :</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"226\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-9\">What is the contract made between, these parties 7 In what papers, if any, is it to be found ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"227\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-10\">We say it was completed by the verbal or implied assent of Lovett to the proposition contained in General Mansfield\u2019s letter of August 17, 1861; while the claimant is supported by a majority of the Court of Claims in his effort to bring into the case his own letter of that date to General Mansfield, and to make its contents part of the contract, so far as not palpably and directly repugnant to those found in General Mansfield\u2019s letter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"228\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-11\">We consider Mr. Lovett\u2019s letter of August 17, 1861, \u201c a mere offer, not assented to,\u201d which, (as Story says,) \u201c constitutes no contract; for there must.be not only a proposal but an acceptance thereof.\u201d (Story on Con., \u00a7 490.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"229\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-12\">Mr. Lovett proposed to lease a part of the estate, to wit, 30 acres, with house and lodge. General Mansfield did not consent to take a part on any terms, but would take the whole, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>consisting of 90 acres. Lovett offered it for hospital purposes. General M. proposed to take it for <em>all </em>purposes. The owner desired to lease this part for three years, with right of renewal for like term, at $450 a month. General Mansfield would hire the whole for but one year certain, at $500 a month, with right to retain it three years, if desirable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"230\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-4\">Lovett sets up a contract, containing these special terms, with the United States. Then the burden is upon him to prove it by satisfactory evidence. If, after adducing all he has, the thing is left in doubt, even then he cannot recover; certainly not where the natural implication of the language us\u00e9d by the United States is against him. \u201cThere must be a <em>distinct </em>acceptance of the terms offered\u201d to bind the other party. <em>(Andrews </em>v. Garrett, 6 C. B., (N. S.,) 269; <em>Tuttle </em>v. <em>Love, </em>7 Johns-., 471.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"231\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-5\">.Story states precisely the doctrine which we believe applies here: \u201c \u00a7 503. But if a proposition be made with certain conditions or limitations the acceptance' must correspond to it in terms, <em>or otherwise it will be considered a new proposition, </em>requiring the subsequent .assent of the other party to render it binding.\u201d (1 Story on Con., (5th ed., 1874,) 455 ; <em>\u00a1\u00a1Haymaker </em>v. <em>Irwin, </em>4 Whar., 369; <em>Soneyman </em>v. <em>Marryatt, </em>6 House of Lords Oas., 112.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"232\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-6\">General Mansfield\u2019s letter was no lease at all. It is a misnomer to call it so. It merely proposed to the owner terms upon which the Government would (if those terms were assented to) occupy the estate. A lease is given by the landlord to the tenant as evidence of the latter\u2019s right to enter upon and retain possession of the demised premises, not a letter from one proposing to become a tenant if his wishes are acceded to. A tenant\u2019s letter cannot possibly be construed as a lease; certainly, then, the letter of a person proposing an occupation in the future cannot be. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"233\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-7\">Lovett\u2019s assent to the proposal made its terms those of the holding, but did not make the letter a lease; the letting was verbal. Under the first section of the statute of frauds it was a mere tenancy at will. There was no liability to rebuild in case of fire. (Taylor\u2019s Land. &amp; Ten., 101, \u00a7 146; <em>Leach </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>7 Carr. &amp; P., 327; <em>Horsefall </em>v. <em>Mather, </em>Holt, 7; <em>JBroum'v.

The court rested this liability upon the erroneous assumption that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>property was occupied under an express agreement to repair, agreeably to the contents of Mr. Lovett\u2019s letter of August 17, 1861.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"234\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoZ\">The stipulation for rent at $500 was positive only for one year, to be continued for three more, if desirable.

On the one hand, it is claimed that the proposition of Mr. Lovett was accepted by General Mansfield with modifications, and that all stipulations suggested by him are included in the contract' as finally entered into, unless modified or rejected in terms by th^note of General Mansfield. On the other hand, it is contended by the United States that the note of General Mansfield, instead of being an acceptance of the proposition, was a rejection of it, with an offer of new terms, which, when acceded to by Mr. Lovett, embraced all there was of the contract as made. The latter, we think, is the true construction of the correspondence. We know that when a contract is entered into by correspondence the whole correspondence must be considered in determining what the parties have agreed to, but we also know that both parties must assent to a, proposed agreement before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>either is bound by it. Here General Mansfield has nowhere indicated a willingness to accept any of the terms offered him, bnt, rejecting all, has made a new offer of his own. No reference whatever is made by him to any of the special stipulations suggested by Mr. Lovett. All these are laid aside, and he states the terms upon which the United States will hire the property. The words \u201c as above,\u201d where they occur in his note, are used to designate the- property, not to extend the offer. In short, Mr. Lovett proposed his terms, and General Mansfield his. Mausfield\u2019s were accepted, but Lovett\u2019s were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">This being the case, the contract is one by which Mr. Lovett agreed to let, aud the United States to hire, the premises described for the term of one year, with the privilege of three, at a rent of $500 a month, and without restriction as to the use to which the property might be put. The United States agree to nothing in express terms except to pay rent and hold for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">But in every lease there is, unless excluded by the operation of some express covenant or agreement, an implied obligation on the part of the lessee to so use the property as not unnecessarily to injure, it, or, as it is stated by Mr. Comyn, \u201cto treat the premises demised in such manner that no injury be done to the inheritance, but that the estate may revert to the lessor undeteriorated by the willful or negligent conduct of the lessee.\u201d (Com. Land. &amp; Ten., 188.) This implied obligation is part of the contract itself, as much so as if incorporated into. it by express language. It results from the relation of landlord and tenant between the parties which the contract creates. <em>(Holford </em>v. <em>Dunnett, </em>7 M. &amp; W., 352.) It is not a covenant to repair generally, but to so use the property as to avoid the necessity for repairs as far as possible. <em>(Horsefall </em>v. <em>Mather, </em>7 Holt, 9; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Crump, </em>1 Marsh., 569.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">There are in this contract no stipulations to taire the place of or in any manner restrict this implied obligation on the part of the United States growing out of their relation to the petitioner and his lessees. They had the free^nd unrestricted right to use the property for any and all purposes, but were bound to so conduct themselves in such use as not to cause unnecessary injury. Whatever damages would necessarily result from a use for the same purpose by a good tenant must fall upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>lessor. All that the relation of landlord and tenant implies in this particular is that the tenant while using the property will exercise reasonable care to prevent damage to the inheritance. His obligation repts upon the <em>maxim,sie t\u00edtere tuo, ut alienum non ladas. </em>If he fails in this, he violates his contract and must respond accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">The United States, when they contract with their citizens, are controlled by the same laws that govern the citizen in that behalf. All obligations which would be implied against citizens under the same circumstances will be implied against them. No lease in form was ever executed in this case, but the contract, followed by the delivery of possession'and occupation under it, is equivalent, for the purposes of this action, to a lease duly executed containing all the stipulations agreed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Such being the agreement of the parties, it remains only to consider the questions arising under it as they appear in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">1. As to the rent. The United States hired for a year absolutely, at the agreed rent of five hundred dollars a month, and occupied during the whole of that term. They therefore, by their agreement, were expressly bound to pay rent at that rate for the whole of the year. This they have paid in full to June 30, but after that, until the end of the year, August 23, 1862, their payments have been only at the rate of two hundred and fifty dollars a month. Payment by a debtor of a part of his debt is not a satisfaction of the whole, except it be made and accepted upon some new consideration. It is not found that there was any new consideration in this case. All that appears is that an account was made out for the rent from July 1 to September 30, at the new rate, and that this account was receipted by Mr. Lovett after payment. Upon this finding, therefore, in the absence of anything more showing that the reduction in the rent of the first year was part of the agreement to.continue the lease beyond the year upon the new terms, the petitioner will be entitled to judgment for rent at the rate of two hundred and fifty dollars a month from June 30 to August 23, 1862, that being the balance remaining after deducting payments made.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">After the end of the first year the case is different. The United States were not bound absolutely to keep the premises for a longer term than one year. After that they could make new terms or leave. The acceptance by Mr. Lovett of the. re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>duced rates from that time, without objection, is conclusive evidence of his assent to a modification of the original agreement in this particular, in consideration of the continued occupancy by the United States. Having thus secured the occupancy, he cannot now object to the agreement under which it-was obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">2. As to the use for a small-pox hospital., Mr. Lovett originally offered the property to the Government <em>\u201c </em>for the purpose of a hospital,\u201d and all the receipts for the rent expressly state that the property was beiug so occupied. No objection to such an occupancy was ever made, and, if there was nothing more, the presumption would be that the lessor expected the property was to be used for any and all hospital purposes that the.necessi-tiesof the Government for the time being might require. But the note of General Mansfield is broad enough to cover such an occupancy, for he expressly states that the hiring is to be <em>\u201c </em>for all purposes.\u201d No recovery can be had upon this specification of claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">3. As to the destruction of a part of the buildings by fire. There was, as has been seen, qo express agreement to repair in the lease. The implied obligation is not to repair generally, but to so use the property as to make repairs unnecessary as far as possible. It is in effect a covenant against voluntary waste, and nothing more. It has never been so construed as to make a tenant answerable for accidental damages, or to bind him to rebuild if the buildings are burned down or otherwise destroyed by accident. In this case it has not been found, neither is it claimed in the petition, that these premises were burned through the neglect of the United States. . No judgment can, therefore, be rendered against the United States on this account.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">4. The destruction of the trees and fences and the digging and carrying away of gravel and stone. Whatever injury was done to the property during the occupation, previous to the agreement for the lease, cannot be recovered for in this action. Mr. Lovett\u2019s proposition included an undertaking on the part of the United States to make good this loss, but his proposition was not accepted, and the case stands as if it had never been made. The obligations of the United States under the lease, as to the preservation of the property, relate only to the condition of the premises as it was when the term commenced. All damage done before that is clearly \u201c damages \u25a0 * * by the Army <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>and Navy * * # engaged in the suppression of the rebellion,\u201d and on that account not recoverable in the Court of Claims. (13 Stat. L., 381.) But damages after the lease commenced, and while the United States were actually in possession under it, occupies a different position. That comes within the contract by which the rights of the parties in this action are to be determined. As has been seen, that does not bind the United States to make good any loss which necessarily results from the use of the property, but only such as results from the want of reasonable care in the use. It binds thenti not to commit waste or suffer it to be committed. If they fail in this, they fail in the performance of their contract, and are answerable for that in the Court of Claims, which has jurisdiction of \u201call claims founded upon any contract, express or implied, with the Government of the United States, which may be suggested to it by a petition filed therein.\u201d (Rev. Stat., sec. 1059,\u2022 10 Stat. L., 612, \u00a7 1.) If there had been in this lease an express agreement to repair, certainly it could not have been succ essfully claimed that the Court of Claims would not have had jurisdiction to award damages for a failure to rebuild after the fire, even though the fire was caused by the soldiers while in the hospital for treatment. But the implied obligation as to the manner of the use is as much obligatory upon the United States as it would be if it had been expressed. If there is a failure to comply with the agreement in this particular it is a breach of the contract for which the United States consent to be sued in the Court of Claims. All depends upon the contract. Without that the jurisdiction does not include actions for damages by the Army. With it, damages contracted against may be recovered as for a breach of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">It appears in the finding that during the occupancy under the lease ornamental trees were destroyed, fences and walls torn down, and the materials used for sidewalks and the erection of other buildings, or carried away, and that stone was quarried and gravel dug from a stone-quarry and gravel-pit on the premises and taken away. This was voluntary waste and within the prohibition of the implied agreement in the lease. For this the Court of Claims can award compensation in this action. The amount of this damage has not been found.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">5. The account as stated in the Quartermaster-General\u2019s office. This does not conclude the United States. It was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>mere adjustment of the accounts by oue of the bureaus in one of the Departments of the Government rejected by the accounting-officers of the Treasury, and never paid. Certainly this can have no binding effect upon the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The judgment of the Court of Claims is reversed, and the cause remanded with instructions to render judgment against the United States for the rent of the premises from June 30 to August 23,1862, at the rate of two hundred and fifty dollars per month, and for the damages done \u00abto the property other than the destruction of the house by fire during the occupation of the United States under their lease, except to the extent that the same necessarily results from the use of the premises by the soldiers of the Army of the United States for the purposes of a hospital and camp-ground.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
