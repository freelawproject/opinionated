Whether this be so or not makes no difference, because the payment was not to be made from the contingent fund of the Senate, and the plea of a refusal to pay has never been held to be a sufficient defense in an action for debt.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b439-11\"><em>Mr. Sor ace M.

R., 151, whole case and cases there cited; <em>Arthur Martinis Case, </em>Supreme Court, ante, p. 87.) These claims were not only disputed, but disputable in their character and nature. After what has transpired between the Government and claimants, of course they cannot recover. <em>(\u25a0GomstocWs </em>Case, 9 O. O\u00eds. R., 141, whole case and cases there cited.) \u25a0 The statute of March 3, 1873, did not increase the pay or compensation of these claimants 15 per cent, after March 3, 1873. It may have increased it retrospectively; it did not increase it prospectively. Claimants have already been paid too much by mistake, to wit, from and after March 3,1873, up to the 1st of April, 1873. Under the rulings of this court, this excess could from them be recovered back by the United States. If, however, the statute did increase their pay or compensation prospectively, claimants have been paid it.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b440-6\">Nott, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AH6\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Stripped of the verbiage which does not in any way relate to the case, the <em>Act 3d </em>March, 1873, (17 Stat.

They were paid the 15 per cent, allowed by the act up to the end of the Forty-second Congress, and-they now seek to recover it subsequently.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">It is manifest that the act refers to the employ\u00e9s of the then existing Congress, that it relates to their compensation for the period of that Congress, and that it was not intended to affect the compensation of the employ\u00e9s of future Congresses, nor to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>single out those who chanced to \u201cbe actually employed at the passage of this act\u201d and fix their pay for all time,leaving subsequently-employed persons to be engaged at whatever rate the committee saw fit to impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">The judgment of the court is that the petition be dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b441-5\">Peck and Loring, JJ., did not sit iu this case, and took no part in the decision.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
