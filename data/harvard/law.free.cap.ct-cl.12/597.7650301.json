On the 2Gth of October, 1864, the Secretary of the Treasury signed and delivered to the claimauts the paper of that date annexed to the petition ; and on the same day Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, signed the order of that date accompanying said paper, and also annexed to the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-9\">II. On the 16th of November, 1864, the claimants delivered to George S.

On the 13th of December, 1864, on the United States ship Choctaw, off Bayou Sara, La., John J. Cornwell, lieutenant-commander of the United States Navy, commanding the second and third districts of the Mississippi Eiver, issued the following order, addressed to naval officers between Bayou Sara and New Orleans: \u201cPass the steamer Sciota, Captain Owesney, with a cargo of three hundred and thirty-six (336) bales of cotton, to New Orleans, without molestation. The cotton was taken on board at Bayou Sara by my consent.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-11\">IV. On the arrival of the steamer Sciota at New Orleans, she and her cargo were seized by the United States military police, under thecontrol of Col. ETarai Robinson, then acting as provost-marshal-general of the Department of the Gulf, of which department Gen. S. A. Hurlbut was then in command.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Y. After the seizure of the Sciota and her cargo, G-eueral Hurlbut issued a special order, stating that by direction of the major-general commanding the Military Division west of the Mississippi the cotton brought by the steamer Sciota should be disposed of as follows : A certain number of bales (number not shown) to be given to the claimants; the remainder to be turned over to O. JST. Cutler, the United States purchasing-agent ; and that the claimants should give bonds for their appearance when required. On said Robinson\u2019s receipt of said order he sent for the claimants, and they appeared before him and gave bonds; at which time they did not exhibit to him any papers in relation to the shipment of cotton. It was not the province of said Robinson to have anything to do with the receiving or disposing of the cotton.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-4\">YI. On or about the 21st of December, 1SG4, in the evening, after office-hours, the claimants called on the said Robinson at his dwelling and showed him the papers aforesaid, dated October 26, 1864, signed by the Secretary of the Treasury and the President, which the said Robinson had not before seen or had any knowledge of, and the claimants asked him what he thought of that permit. He told them he thought it was a sweeping onej that it covered all ground. They answered that, notwithstanding that permit, the cotton aboard the Sciota had been seized and detained, and themselves put under bond. He asked how that could be. They answered that the permit was of no account unless signed by the major-general commanding the department. He asked them if they had presented it to the general commanding. They said yes, and it had been refused. He then advised them to go to General Oanby, who commanded the Military Division west of the Mississippi, and show the permit to him. They replied, &lt;!You know that is useless by the very order which put us under bond; it states by order of the general commanding the Military Division west of the Mississippi.\u201d They further said they were satisfied that it could not be done except by money; that money was wanted; and that they were willing to pay most liberally to have it signed; that that would cover and release the cotton. They said they would pay ten thousand dollars to have that presidential permit indorsed and their qotton released. He then told them to leave the permit with him and he would see about it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-5\">The next day the said Robinson took the permit to General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Hurlbut and told him the parties wished to have it signed by him. General Hnrlbut replied, \u201cTes; I have seen this permit before. I have refused to sign it.\u201d Eobinson then said, \u201cGeneral, these men have offered a large amount of money to get this permit indorsed; there\u2019s money in it.\u201d Hurlbut perused the permit carefully, and said, \u201cYou must take that to Mr. Denison and have him certify that the proper bonds have been filed by these parties, Clark and Fulton.\u201d Eobinson took the permit to said Denison and advised him of the wishes of General Hurlbut.

They asked him how he would receive it. He told them he would receive it through Denison, the collector of the port. The next morning Denison handed him an euvelope with $5,000 in it, out of which Eobinson took $2,000 or $3,000 and gave it to General Hurlbut, and laid away the balance in the provost-marshal-general\u2019s office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-14\">After that money was given to Eobinson, the claimant Clark saw him again, and said to him, \u201cNow I have the permit indorsed, see if you can get my cotton released; see if General Hurlbut will give an order releasing or justifying the release of my cotton.\u201d Eobinson then saw Hurlbut and stated the facts to him, and Hurlbut then wrote the following paper:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>\u201cHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OP THE GULF,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-5\"><em>\u201cNew </em>Orleans, <em>Dee. </em>24, 1864.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-6\">\u201c Pursuant to executive order of His Exc\u2019y the President of the United States, J.

The extortion of money from the claimants by the provost-marshal-general at New Orleans, to secure the release of the claimants\u2019 cotton, and the indorsement of the said permit and executive order, was an unlawful act, and the money paid by the claimants for that purpose might have been recovered by the claimants in an action brought by them for that purpose against the said provost-marshal-general. The wrongful and fraudulent acts of the provost-marshal-general, by which the money belonging to the claimants came to the possession of the United States, did not divest the claimants of their property in the said money, nor oi their right to follow it in the possession of the United States, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>and recover it in an action brought by them for that purpose against the United States. Au action for money had and received may be maintained whenever the defendant has received money which is the property of the plaintiff, and which the defendant is obliged, by the ties of natural justice and equity, to refund. <em>{Carey </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>3 Howard, S.

It is well settled that money paid for such a purpose may be recovered back by the party paying it in an action for money had and received. <em>{Atlee </em>v. <em>Backhouse, </em>6 M. <em>&amp; </em>W., 633, 650 ; <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Dwvnall, </em>7 Greenl.

There were no civil tribunals in existence in New Orleans at that time, whose jurisdiction might be invoked to protect the claimants in their rights. The military authority there exercised was exclusive and supreme, and the claimants had no alternative, except to submit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>to the illegal extortions of the provost-marshal-general. They could obtain possession of their cotton in no other way.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b614-4\">The claimants\u2019 right to recover in this action cannot be defeated upon the maxim, \u201c <em>In pari delicto potior est conkitio de-fendentis.\u201d </em>The evidence does not establish such a state of facts as renders this principle applicable. The claimants\u2019 cotton had been seized previous to the payment of the money, and the executive order of the President of the United States, by which their cotton was protected from seizure by the military authorities, was ignored and disregarded. The acts of the provost-marshal-general were illegal and oppressive, and the claimants \u2018were obliged to pay the money extorted by that officer or submit to those acts. It was not a case of <em>par delictum. </em>It was oppression on one side and submission on the other. It can never be predicated as <em>par delictum </em>when one holds the rod and the other bows to it. (Broom's Legal Maxims, 486, 5th Am. ed.; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Cuff, </em>6 M. &amp; S., 160; <em>Alsoger </em>v. <em>Spalding, </em>4 Bing.

It was the persuasive argument, which resulted from the illegal seizure of the claimants\u2019 cotton, which caused them to seek the office of the provost-marshal-general for that relief which they could not obtain elsewhere. It would be a strange perversion of the criminal code if these claimants could have been convicted of bribery for the payment of money to the provost-marshal-general, under the circumstances which this record discloses <em>\u2022, </em>and yet <em>that </em>is the conclusion which this court must reach before it can declare that'the claimants were <em>participes criminis </em>in the illegal acts of that officer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b614-6\"><em>Mr. Horace M.

They were payments made after the goods had been released. The claimants parted with their money intending to give up their fights. The law applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>ble to such, payments (those disclosed by this evidence) declares them to be \u201c voluntary,\u201d and may be found in <em>Mayor of Baltimore </em>v. <em>Lefferman,i </em>Gill, 425, 436, (Maryland Reports;) <em>Fellows </em>v. <em>School </em>District, &amp;c., 39 Maine, 559, 560, (argument of counsel,) 561, 562, 563, (opinion); <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>The City of </em>Boston, 15 Gray, 468; <em>Flston </em>v. <em>The City of </em>Chicago, 40 III., 519; Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 270.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-4\">Iu opposition, therefore, to counsel for claimants\u2019 views; we say: The provost-marshal not having extorted\u201d this money from the claimants, but it having been \u201cvoluntarily paid\u201d by them to him, claimants did divest themselves by such payment of all right or title whatsoever to said money, and they have no right to follow it into the possession of the United States, however it got there. The doctrine of <em>ex ceguo et bono </em>has no application to these facts, and there could be no better illustration of it than the case cited by counsel, <em>(Moses </em>y. <em>Macfarlan, </em>2 Burrows, 1005, <em>1008,1012.)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-5\">A case that has been overruled at least a hundred times as to the decision there made, though containing an elegantly-worded description by Lord Mansfield of the action for money had and received. <em>(Harriot </em>v. <em>Hampton, </em>2 Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, 393, 395.) Even the \u201cdescription,\u201d however \u201celegantly worded,\u201d seems to have gone the way of the \u201cdecision\u201d itself, for \u201c the notion about the action for money had and received being an equitable action, is exploded in modern practice.\u201d (2 Chitty on Contracts, 898,11th American edition; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Atlee, </em>13 J urist, 431, per Pollock, C.

The seizure'of the cotton was in strict conformity to law. The provost-marshal, in seizing the Sciota and her cargo, -was entirely justifiable. <em>(The United States </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>8 Wallace, 185; <em>Maddox </em>v. <em>The United States, </em>15 id, 58.)

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AIVF\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">This is, in effect, an action for money had and received by the defendants for the use of the claimants, and we are at a loss to see upon what legal ground or principle it could be supposed that they could, under any possible view of the case, be entitled to recover, when the court has found as a' fact that the money they paid to Robinson, and which went from him into the War Department, and thence into the Treasury of the United States, was paid by them with the corrupt motive and purpose on their part of procuring official action whereby their cotton should be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Iu argument, it was urged that this was a case of extortion, and not of bribery; but it had no feature of extortion. Robinson demanded no money of them as a consideration for letting their cotton go out of the control of the military authorities back into the possession of the claimants, but the claimants voluntarily offered to pay, and did pay, him money in order to obtain his official aid in procuring the release of the cotton. Under the sixth section of the <em>A ct February </em>2G, 1853, \u201c <em>to prevent frauds upon the Treasury of the United States,\u201d </em>(10 Stat. L., 170,) now incorporated in the Revised Statutes as section 5451, this was bribery, and a high crime and misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">Had the claimants sued Robinson to recover back the money they paid him, they could not have recovered it; for in a case where both parties are <em>in pari delicto </em>the law leaves them where it finds them. If, then, they could not maintain an action against Robinson, they are still less entitled to one against the Government. As between them and Robinson, the money became his the moment they paid it to him ; and when it passed from him to the officers of the United States, and from them into the Treasury, it was not the money of the claimants, but, as against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>them, it was Robinson\u2019s. If any one has a claim against the Government for it, it is he.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The petition of the claimants is dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b617-6\">Poking- and Pecic, JJ., did not sit in this case, and took no part in the decision.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
