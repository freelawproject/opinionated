Estoppei by matter of record does not arise from a judgment by default in an action against an Indian agent for the wrongful occupation of the premises used as an agency, where he did not come in and set up the title either of the United States or of the Indian tribe in whom it really was. The fact that the agent interposed a demurrer at one stage of the case by order of the Secretary of the Interior does not preclude the Government from setting up the Indian title in a suit against it for use and occupation.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b346-15\">IV.

In November, 1836, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, a religious and charitable corporation, established and existing under the laws of the State of Massachusetts, b,y their missionary and agent, the Rev. H. H. Spauld-ing, entered upon and occupied the premises described in the' petition as a permanent missionary station among the Indian tribes in the Territory of Oregon. They subsequently cultivated the land, planted orchards, and erected buildings thereon, which consisted of a.churcb, a school-house, a printing-office, dwelling-houses, mills, and barns. The occupancy was with the assent and the premises were in fact allotted to them by the Nez Perc\u00e9 Indians, who inhabited that portion of the Territory.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-9\">II. The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions continued to occupy and enjoy the said premises as a missionary station until December, 1847, when the Cayuses, a hostile tribe of Indians, advancing upon the station with the intent to destroy the occupants thereof, compelled Mr. Spaulding, the agent of the board, to remove therefrom with his family and servants, and to seek refuge in one of the forts of the Hudson Bay Company. This removal from the mission-station was involuntary, being rendered absolutely necessary by the imminence of great danger, and was made with the intent of returning so soon as he, the agent of the board, might with safety do so. But Mr. Spaulding and the American Board of Commissioners were prevented by Indian hostilities from returning to occupy the said premises until the spring of 1860. During the interval they endeavored at various times to re-occupy the premises and at no time abandoned their intent to maintain a missionary station thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-10\">III. Early in the year 1860, and about the time that Mr. Spaulding returned to occupy the premises before described, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>tbe superintendent of Indian affairs and the Indian agent of the United States entered upon the same and established there an Indian agency, occupying such of the buildings erected by the American Board of Commissioners as then remained standing. The Indian agent also refused to restore possession when the same was shortly thereafter demanded by the agents of the American Board; and in 1862 he refused to allow a surveyor employed by and on behalf of the board to run the lines or otherwise locate the tract occupied by them as aforesaid. The American Board of Commissioners at various times have demanded possession of the same, but the Indian agents in possession by the express authority of and in pursuance of instructions from the Secretary of the Interior, have refused to surrender possession. The premises, except as hereinafter stated in the fifth finding, have been and now are occupied by the defendants as an Indian agency, and are in the actual possession of the agent and of Indians residing at the agency. Buildings also have been erected thereon for the purposes of the agency by the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-5\">IY. On the 26th February, 1868, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, as plaintiffs, brought an action to recover possession of the before-described premises in the dis*-trict court, first judicial district of the Territory of Idaho, in the county of Nez Perc\u00e9, against one James O\u2019Neil as defendant, he then being the Indian agent of the United States in control of the agency and in possession of the premises. The defendant, O\u2019Neil, duly appeared in such action and filed a demurrer to the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. Subsequently such proceedings were had according to the practice of the courts of Idaho that on the 6th October, 1868, W. G. Langford was substituted as plaintiff in the action upon the ground that he had become the sole owner of the premises since the commencement of the action, and on the 6th April, 1869, Bobert Newell was substituted as defendant in the place of James O\u2019Neil, on the ground that O\u2019Neil had delivered the premises in controversy to Newell. On the 6th April, 1869, the demurrer to the complaint was argued by counsel for the respective parties and was overruled by the court, and on the 9th April, 1869, leave was given to the defendant, by stipulation, until the first day of the October term of the court to file his answer. On the 9th October, 1869, the defendant having failed to answer, judgment was entered in favor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>plaintiff, whereby it was adj edged that he should recover possession of the premises. All of which proceedings will more fully and at large appear in the judgment-roll of said action, annexed to and forming part of these findings. At the time that Robert Newell was substituted for James O\u2019Neil as defendant in the action, he, the said Newell, had become and was the Indian agent of the United States at the agency, and was, as such agent, in possession of the premises. During all of the proceedings aforesaid, the action was in fact defended for and on behalf of the United States by and under the authority and direction of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and the Secretary of the Interior.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AKy\">Y. Subsequent to the entry of judgment in the said action described in the fourth finding, a writ of possession issued out of the said court on the 19th December, 1873, directed to the sheriff of Nez Perc\u00e9 County, commanding and requiring him to place the plaintiff in the quiet and peaceable possession of the before-described premises, which writ the Indian agent in possession refused to obey, and the sheriff so returned. On the 14th February, 1874, the Secretary of the Interior authorized and directed the Indian agent to remain in possession of the premises, and to refuse to leave until\" forcibly ejected by the sheriff, but instructed him at the same time not to use force or violence in attempting to remain. On the 12th of November, 1874, a second writ issued out of the said court of Idaho to the sheriff, under which the plaintiff acquired possession of the premises on the following day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-5\">YI. After the claimant had acquired possession, as shown iu the fifth finding, the Indian agent entered into an informal arrangement with him, pursuant to which the employ\u00e9s of the agency became tenants of the claimant, renting of him a portion of the buildings, the premises being used for the purposes of the agency, and the rent being paid by the agent, the claimant retaining possession ofthe remainder of the buildings. Thefacts being reported to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, he, on the 4th January, 1875, under instruc\u2019ions from the Secretary of the Interior, issued an order to the Indian agent \u201c to refuse all demands\u201d of the claimant \u201c for payment of rent of buildings occupied \u201d by the agent or his employ\u00e9s \u201c for agency purposes,\u201d and he at the same time directed the agent, <em>\u201c </em>Should an attempt be made, iu consequence of such refusal, to eject you from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>premises, you will call upon the commanding officer of the nearest military post for protection.\u201d The Secretary of the Interior also, on the 25th February, 1875, applied to the Secretary of War to issue orders to the proper military officer \u201c to dispossess \u201d the claimant from the premises and\u00a3t reinstate \u201d the Indian agent, \u201c and afford him such protection as shall enable him to keep possession of the premises.\u201d The Secretary of War, on the 4th March, 1875, by communication addressed to the Secretary of the Interior, refused to issue such orders on the ground that, in his opinion, it must be \u201cpresumed\u201d that the claimant was then \u201c in possession of the premises referred to by due process of lawr and that the Department had no authority to eject him.\u201d But subsequently, in pursuance of an opinion of the Attorney-General, bearing date the 3d May, 1875, (14 Opins. Atty. Gen., 568,) to the effect that the claimant was \u00a3l an intruder\u201d upon an Indian reservation, and that \u201c the President might take such measures and employ such military force as he might judge necessary to remove him from the land,\u201d the Secretary of War, on the 12th May, 1875, issued orders to the commanding officer of the department of the Columbia, directing him \u201c to protect the Indian agent in possession of the agency in accordance with the opinion of the Attorney-General,\u201d and the commanding officer of the department on the 2d June, 1875, issued his orders directing the officer in command at Fort Lap-wai, Idaho, to \u201c immediately take steps to place the Government, through the Indian agent, in complete possession of the Indian reservation as designated in the decision of the Attorney-General herein, including all buildings and their appurtenances, as situated on said reservation.\u201d Under these orders an officer with a military force detailed for the purpose, on the 11th June, 1875, forcibly ejected the claimant from possession of all the buildings and premises before described, and put the Indian agent in full and complete possession thereof. The action of these officers was fully reported to the Secretary of War, and their reports were by him transmitted to the Secretary of the Interior, and the defendants have ever since retained and still hold possession of the said premises. At the time of this dispossession of the claimant the buildings and premises were required and needed by the Government for the purposes of an Indian agency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-4\">Vil. The deed or conveyance of the premises from the Ameri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>can Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions to the claimant, referred to in the fourth finding, was made and executed while the premises in question were the subject of litigation, as set forth in that finding; and the claimant or grantee was at that time the attorney of record for the plaintiff, the American Board, in that action.

In 1868 tbe American Board of Foreign Missions, finding one James O\u2019Neil in possession of that land, and acting as Indian agent for tbe United States, brought suit against him to recover possession of the property. The suit was brought in the territorial courts under the provisions of the territorial code. By the provisions of that code the technicalities of the action of ejectment are abolished and the suit becomes not one solely to try the right of possession, as in the common-law action of ejectment, but one to try the title to the property, and thus determine who is entitled to the possession. Upon the purchase of tbe premises by Langford he became and was substituted by the court as plaintiff in the action, while the same substitution took place on the part of the defendant whenever a new Indian agent was appointed. The United States, as principal, assumed the defense of this action, gave direction to its agent in respect- to the conduct of the suit, employed and paid the attorneys for making the defense, and, in all respects, conducted itself as the real defendant. Judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff October 9th, 1869. It is to be found in the record. On this judgment a writ of <em>habere facias </em>was issued and the plaintiff put in possession of a part of the premises. On the 11th day of June, 1875, the plaintiff was dispossessed of said premises by the United States by the use of force and arms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-4\">Having thus shown the title to the premises to be in the plaintiff \u2014 the rendition of a judgment in his favor, virtually against the United States, deciding the premises to be that of the plaintiff, and supplementing this with proof of continued use and occupation on the part of the United States, under the authority and by the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, who is at the head of the Department having charge of Indian affairs, and, virtually, the act of the President \u2014 we submit that we have made out our case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b354-5\"><em>IJr. Horace M.

It claims through two statutes: one, an <em>Act to establish the territorial government of Oregon, Angustia, </em>1848, (9 Stat. L., 323, \u00a7 1;) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>the other, an <em>Act to establish the territorial government of Washington, March </em>2, 1853, (10 Stat. L., 172, \u00a7 1.) It is argued that each act was a perfect grant of the fee to the American Board, that each act operated instantly to transfer the estate. The words on which they depend, in the act of 1853, read thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-5\"><em>\u201cProvided further, </em>That the title to the land, not exceeding six hundred and forty acres, now occupied as missionary stations among the Indian tribes in said Territory, together with the improvements thereon, be confirmed and established in the said several religious societies to which said missionary stations respectively belong.\u201d (9 Stat. L., 323, \u00a7 1.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-6\">The words upon which they depend, in the act of 1853, read thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-7\">\u201c <em>Provided further, </em>That the title to the land, not exceeding six hundred and forty acres, now occupied as missionary stations among the Indian tribes in said Territory, or that may have been so occupied as missionary stations prior to the passage of the act establishing the territorial government of Oregon, together with the improvements thereon, be, and is hereby, confirmed and established to the several religious societies to which said missionary stations respectively belong.\u201d (10 Stat. L., 173, \u00a7 1.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-8\">Now, the United States, as a defense, sets up the Indian title. We insist that the Indian title had not been extinguished when these acts were passed; that the United States always regards the Indian title as it ought, and that' these statutes are not to be considered in derogation thereof; that the Indians then occupied all this region of country; that it was an Indian country \u2014 not a white man\u2019s country; all of which is claimed by claimant himself whenever it suits his purpose, and sought to be rejected only where it does not. Claimant answers, \u201cTrue, you ought to respect the Indian title, but very frequently you do not, and in this case you did not; you, the United States, have the superior title even to the Indians. If you do not wish to recognize it, if you choose to ride over it and convey the land to others without regard to the Indian title, you can do so; you have the legal power to do so, and you did do so when you passed these statutes, and by these very acts themselves you extinguished the Indian title.\u201d This was the argument at the bar, and always has been the argument in this case, wherever made. Our reply to it is, we did, in both of these acts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>carefully protect the Indian title; we recognized it in its fullest extent, and declared, in words so clear \u201cthat he that runs'may read,\u201d that nothing in these acts should for a moment impair, or in any manner affect, the-title of the Indians to these lands. In both of these statutes the following proviso was introduced into the first section of each act:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-6\">\u201cProvided, That nothing in this act contained shall be construed to affect the authority of the Government of the United States to make any regulation respecting the Indians of said Territory, their lands, property, or other rights, by treaty, law, or otherwise, which it would have been competent to make if this act had never been passed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-7\">And subsequently treaties were made by which these Indians ceded these lands to the United States, the United States ceding back to them this very land as a reservation \u2014 now claimed as having belonged to the board of missions \u2014 guaranteeing them quiet enjoyment and protection. (12 Stat. L., 957, 958, Articles III and IY; 14 Stat. L., 645, 648, Article III, 649, Article IY;.15 Stat.

He claims that by virtue of a judgment obtained by default in an ejectment suit in the territorial court in Idaho against Bobert Newell, an Indian agent, wherein he, claimant, was plaintiff, that the United States in some way or other is bound, either as party or privy, from' the mere fact of the judgment having been rendered, or from the additional fact that the United States aided the Indian agent in defending the suit. We confess we have not been able to determine exactly upon what he does seek to maintian this novel proposition, for .he passes from one reason to the other in the same breath, and cites his authorities now as bearing on this and now on that, indiscriminately.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-9\">The authorities which he cites decide this, that in cases where you cannot sue the principal you may sue the agent; because the United States is not suable in any manner you may sue its servant. He cannot protect himself by claiming the non-suability of the United States. Thus, if this suit were against Newell here and now, he could not interpose the objection that the suit was in fact against the United States, he being only an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>agent, with no interest or claim in the matter himself, and the United States being in fact the real party and not suable, the action could not be maintained against him, (Newell,) for the court would answer, as in these cases cited by the claimant, You are wrong; this suit is not against the United States; no suit can be brought against her, nor can she in manner be proceeded against or bound; it is against you, an individual; against you, Newell, and we will allow you to be sued, for the very reason that the United States cannot be sued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-6\">This is the reasoning and declaration in every authority cited by claimant. There have been cases where it has been decided that the agent cum avail himself of the non suability of the United States; that because the United States cannot be sued neither can its agent; and it was to overrule those decisions, to destroy that doctrine, that the courts have made the decisions cited by the claimant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-7\">In the celebrated \u201cBatture\u201d <em>Case, </em>a like case to this in more respects than one, Thomas Jefferson said, \u201cThe United States were no party to the suit, nor could they be, having made themselves amenable to no tribunal.

And Edward Livingston, in his elaborate answer to Jefferson in this his own case, frankly conceded the doctrine, saying, \u201c I have admitted that the United States, if they claimed an interest in the land in their own right, or for another not a party to the suit, would not be affected by it,\u201d (the judgment.) \u201cThe law cited by Mr. Jefferson is a first principle in the civil, and, as far. as my knowledge extends, pervades every other code.\u201d (5 American Law Journal, 266; compare Hunt\u2019s Livingston, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, with Bandali\u2019s Jefferson, vol. iii, 266, 267, 268.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-8\">This doctrine is so well settled that it does not often arise in the courts, but it may be found conclusively determined in <em>Beeside </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>(11 How.

L., 172, \u00a7 1,) contained this provision :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">\u201c <em>Provided further, </em>That the title to the land, not exceeding six hundred and forty acres, now occupied as missionary stations among the Indian tribes in said territory, or that , may have been so occupied as missionary stations prior to the passage of the act establishing the territorial government of Oregon, together with the improvements thereon, be, and is hereby, confirmed and established to the several religious societies to which said missionary stations respectively belong.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">And the court has found as a fact that the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions had occupied as a missionary station the land which is the subject of the present controversy prior to the <em>Act establishing the territorial government of Oregon. </em>The point has been made by the defendants that this occupancy had been abandoned when the act of 1853 was passed by Congress; but the court, against the objection, has found that the alleged abandonment was involuntary, being rendered absolutely necessary by the imminence of great danger from a hostile force; that it was made with the intent of returning; and that the missionary in charge did in fact return with the intent of re-occupying at the earliest possible moment. The court entertains no doubt that this enforced temporary absence, accompanied by the <em>animus revertendi </em>and due diligence, did not disturb the legal occupancy of missionaries within the true intent of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">The title thus assured to the American Board was what is known in our public-land law as a \u201cstatutory title.\u201d At least one Attorney-General, and when speaking of this identical statute, has said \u201c that a grant of public land by statute is the highest and strongest form of title known to the law;\u201d and that \u201cit is stronger than a patent, for a patent may be annulled by the judiciary upon a proper case shown of fraud, accident, or mistake, while even Congress cannot repeal a statutory grant.\u201d (Opinion of Attorney-General Bates, May 27, 1864.) The Supreme Court moreover has intimated .in the recent case of the <em>Carondelet Common </em>(11 C. Cls. R., 367) that it is now the settled law that a patent is unnecessary to perfect a statutory grant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>and that the title becomes perfect on the completion of the survey necessary to define it.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">But at the time the claimant\u2019s entry was made, and at the time the act of 1853 was passed, the public surveys had not been made and the Indian title was not extinguished. Analogous cases enable us to say that if the ordinary course of things had extended to this tract, if in time the public surveys had defined it and the Indian title had been extinguished, the statutory grant would have been perfected and the title of the American Board would have become complete. But here an opposite current of events has flowed, for the tract still remains unsur-veyed and the grant undefined; and by subsequent treaties with the Indians this tract in dispute has become a part of a permanent Indian reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The statutory grant was in absolute terms, and it \u201cconfirmed and established\u201d in the claimant\u2019s grantors such title as the Government then had. As in the case of a warranty-deed any subsequent title which the Government might acquire would-inure to the benefit of the grantees. But nevertheless, at that time, as has been said, the Indian title to the property had not been divested, and since then by several treaties between them and the United States this property has been reserved by and ceded to the Indians. <em>(Treaties 11th </em>June, 1855, 12 Stat. L., 957, Art. II; <em>9th June, </em>1863, 14 id., 647, Art. II; <em>13th August, </em>1868, 15 id., 693, Art. I.) It is therefore a case of statute against treaty; of the former being in direct conflict with the latter; and the question is, which is to be taken as paramount law?</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">If this question were a new one we should approach the determination of it with reluctance and perhaps in doubt; but it has already been before the Supreme Court, and has received a unanimous and, we must believe, final determination by that tribunal. In the case of <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Nicholson, </em>(9 How. R., 356,) one party claimed in like manner under a statutory grant, and the other under a subsequent Indian treaty. The language of the Supreme Court is unequivocal, and, as it seems to us, conclusive :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">\u201cNo previous grant of Congress could be paramount, according to the rights of occupancy which this Government has always conceded to the Indian tribes within her jurisdiction. It was so much carved out of the territory ceded, and remained to the Indian occupant, as he had never parted with it. He holds, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>strictly speaking', not under the treaty of cession, but under his original title confirmed by the Government in the act of agreeing to the reservation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Against the determination of this question upon the merits, the claimant has attempted to set up an estoppel by matter of record arising from a judgment recovered by him in the territorial court of Idaho, in an action in the nature of ejectment brought against the Indian agent in possession, which action was in fact defended by the United States. There are cases (cited by the claimant\u2019s counsel) in the reports of the Supreme Court looking, to say the least, favorable to the doctrine that the Government, though it cannot be sued, yet if it voluntarily interpose and indirectly submit its title to the judgment of a court may be estopped. Certainly in many forms it has been held by the Supreme Court that when the Government brings or submits its rights to the Courts for judicial determination they must be measured and maintained by the same standard of judicial principles that would' be applied to an individual. Thus it has been held that where the Government becomes a party on negotiable paper it is bound to use the diligence which the law of negotiable paper requires; and thus, by a parity of reasoning, it may be held that where the Government seeks to obtain the advantage of keeping its agents in possession, and voluntarily comes into a court and defends a suit brought against them, setting up through the nominal defendants its own title, it will be concluded by the judgment of that court as effectually as though it had come in as plaintiff. But be this as it may, we are nevertheless of the opinion that the doctrine of estoppel cannot here be extended to the issue determinable in this action. The former action was simply for the wrongful occupation of the premises by the defendant, and judgment went by default after a demurrer to the jurisdiction had been overruled. The declaration did not show that the premises were a portion of a permanent Indian reservation, nor that the Indian title had never been divested and had been expressly reserved and confirmed by treaty. The nominal defendant did not come in and set up either the title of the United States or the title of the bfez Perc\u00e9 tribe. All that the judgment on demurrer or by default established was that the claimant was entitled to possession on that day. -It did not establish either as fact or law that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Indian title had become extinct, nor were the Indians directly or impliedly before the court to be estopped by its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">In this case the defendants are sued for use and occupation, and they show that they'do not hold in their own right, but under the Indian title, and as trustees or guardians of the Indians by virtue of that peculiar relation which subsists between the Government and the Indian tribes. They could only be held liable for the rent of these premises in virtue of some privity of contract between themselves and the claimant, or in consequence of some obligation assumed for the Indians and ratified by treaty. As to the former, all presumptions in its favor would be negatived by the judgment in ejectment, certainly up to that time; as'to the latter, no such obligation was established by the judgment, and if it had been this court would be without jurisdiction to enforce it. (Rev. Stat., \u00a7 1066.)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">It should also be noted that the claimant\u2019s right of action, whatever it may be worth, can hardly be maintained in its present form. This action has been brought under the decision of this court in <em>Johnson's Case. </em>(4 C. Cls. R., 248.) There the court found that the claimant\u2019s property had been taken for temporary use, and accordingly fixed the compensation in the form of an annual rent. In this case the property, if taken from the claimant, was taken by virtue of the treaties ceding it back to the Nez Perc\u00e9 tribe. It is settled that private property cau be taken for public use by the terms of a treaty. <em>(Meade's </em>Case, 2 C. Cls. R., 224.) That a treaty with an Indian tribe is as supreme law as a treaty with a foreign power is clearly shown, if it could be doubted, by the cases cited by the defendants\u2019 counsel. The taking and present holding of this property, under and by virtue of a treaty of cession, must be deemed a taking in perpetuity or of the fee. That taking would exclude the relation of landlord and tenant within the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Carpenter's Case. </em>(9 C. Cls. R., 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">A number of other points have been raised by the defendants\u2019 counsel, but the court confines its decision to the claimant\u2019s title. That title having failed the action must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">The judgment of the court is that the petition be dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b362-10\">Peck, J., was not present when the case was heard, and took no part in the decision.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
