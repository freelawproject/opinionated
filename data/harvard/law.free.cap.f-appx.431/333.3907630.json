He contends that the four ounces of heroin observed on May 22, 2007, was the same heroin that was included in the five ounces of heroin recovered from Martinez on May 24, 2007, and that the Government did not meet its burden of proving that such a guidelines adjustment based on drug quantity was applicable. Additionally, the Government moves to strike its assertion in its brief that Martinez had a second source of supply in Fort Worth, Texas, and any arguments relying on that assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The district court was entitled to consider such evidence, and aside from his own speculation, Martinez has not offered in rebuttal any evidence demonstrating that the two quantities of heroin were identical. <em>See United States v. Rose, </em>449 F.3d 627, 633 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246-47 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Martinez has not shown that the district court\u2019s drug quantity determination was not plausible in light of the record as a whole, and thus he has not shown that the district court committed clear error in calculating the drug quantity for which he was held accountable at sentencing. <em>See Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d at 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">AFFIRMED; GOVERNMENT\u2019S MOTION TO STRIKE GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b355-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
