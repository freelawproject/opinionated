We have previously affirmed a district court\u2019s denial of a federal prisoner\u2019s transcript request where the appellant had no appeal pending and had not moved to vacate his sentence under \u00a7 2255. <em>See Walker v. United States, </em>424 F.2d 278, 279 (5th Cir.1970)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (holding that \u201conly where a [habeas] petitioner ... has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis and his application is pending before the court is that petitioner is entitled to be furnished copies of court records without costs.\u201d). Moreover, \u201c[b]ased on the plain language and necessary operation of [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f) ], ... a motion for a free transcript pursuant to \u00a7 753(f) is not ripe until a \u00a7 2255 motion has been filed.\u201d <em>United States v. Horvath, </em>157 F.3d 131, 132 (2d Cir.1998); <em>see also United States v. Losi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number><em>ng, </em>601 F.2d 351, 352 (8th Cir.1979) (holding that, under the language of \u00a7 753(f) and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. MacCollom, </em>426 U.S. 317, 96 S.Ct. 2086, 48 L.Ed.2d 666 (1976), \u201cany request for a free transcript prior to the filing of a section 2255 complaint is premature.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">The district court did not err in determining it could not reach the merits of Hernandez\u2019s \u00a7 753(f) request<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because Hernandez had yet to file a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Walker, </em>424 F.2d at 278-79; <em>Horvath, </em>157 F.3d at 132. By determining that it would likewise be premature to consider the merits of Hernandez\u2019s motion to equitably toll the one-year limitation period, the court correctly found that such a request would not be ripe for consideration until Hernandez filed a habeas action. <em>See United States v. Leon, </em>203 F.3d 162, 164 (2d Cir.2000) (holding that a court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to consider a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate for timeliness before it has been actually filed because there is no case or controversy to be heard and any decision would be merely advisory). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-17\">.Although Hernandez\u2019s <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal from the order denying his motion mentioned the then-pending motion for reconsideration, the appeal from the denial of the motion for reconsideration is not properly before us because Hernandez failed to file an amended or second notice of appeal. <em>See Bogle v. Orange Cnty. Bd. Of Comm'rs, </em>162 F.3d 653, 661 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that \u201cRule 3(c) requires that a notice of appeal designate an existent judgment or order, not merely one that is merely expected or that is, or should be, within the appellant\u2019s contemplation when the notice of appeal is filed\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AuL\"><em>. </em>We review questions concerning subject matter jurisdiction, including ripeness, de novo. <em>Elend v. Basham, </em>471 F.3d 1199, 1204 (11th Cir.2006). \"We also review a district court's legal decision on equitable tolling de novo.\u201d <em>Drew v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>297 F.3d 1278, 1283 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b835-28\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this Court adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit before October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"A_HQ\">. It was appropriate for the court to construe Hernandez's motion to compel as a request for a free transcript pursuant to \u00a7 753(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
