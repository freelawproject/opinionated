Hernandez brings two issues on appeal, which we address in turn. After review, we affirm Hernandez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-24\">Hernandez asserts the district court\u2019s imposition of a 77-month term of imprisonment was substantively unreasonable as the Guidelines range resulted from redundant consideration of his criminal history and did not adequately take into account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Within this argument, for the first time on appeal, Hernandez contends his 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) for a previous crime of violence was unreasonable, because it was not based on empirical data and penalizes a defendant twice for the same prior conviction also included in the criminal history calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence, \u201c[r]egardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range,\u201d under a deferential abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We reverse only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">\u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (alteration omitted). A sentence may be substantively unreasonable where a district court \u201cunjustifiably relied on any one \u00a7 3553(a) factor, failed to consider pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selected the sentence arbitrarily, or based the sentence on impermissible factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Sarras, </em>575 F.3d 1191, 1219 (11th Cir.2009). The burden of establishing that a sentence is unreasonable lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">Hernandez\u2019s 77-month sentence, located at the low end of his advisory guideline range, is substantively reasonable. The district court did not abuse its discretion in considering Hernandez\u2019s escalating criminal history in determining a reasonable sentence, and the court also took into account the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including Hernandez\u2019s history and characteristics, the nature of the offense, the fact that Hernandez needed to be held accountable for his conduct, the need to protect the community, and the possibility of Hernandez receiving training while in prison. Particularly, the district court explicitly considered Hernandez\u2019s arguments regarding his youth and assimilation into the culture of the United States in determining Hernandez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">Hernandez failed to raise until this appeal his policy argument that the 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) was unreasonable, and thus he has waived all but plain-error review. <em>See United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 831 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining objections to a sentence raised for the first time on appeal are i\u2019eviewed for plain error). Hernandez cites no binding precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court to support his argument, nor does such precedent exist, and therefore the district court did not plainly err in assigning the 16-level enhancement for Hernandez\u2019s previous crime of violence. <em>See United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003) (stating there can be no plain error where neither the Supreme Coui't nor this Court has directly resolved the issue).</p>\n<p id=\"AbS\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"ALt\">Although acknowledging this Court\u2019s precedent is contrary to his argument, Hernandez also contends the district court erred by assigning two criminal history points for a juvenile conviction for obstruction, because the court improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(k)(l) to determine that his probation revocation sentence of two years\u2019 imprisonment prevented that offense from being exempt from application of criminal history points under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">We have held the district court should apply \u00a7 4A1.2(k)(l) when determining whether an offense should be excluded pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1)(A). <em>United States v. Coast, </em>602 F.3d 1222, 1223-24 (11th Cir.2010). Thus, the district court did not err in applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(k)(l) to determine Hernandez should receive two criminal history points for his June 2004 adjudication, based upon his two-year sentence of imprisonment for a probation revocation. Hernandez concedes <em>Coast </em>forecloses his argument and supports that a district court should aggregate a defendant\u2019s original sentence and probation revocation sentence to determine whether a conviction is exempt from the application of criminal history points pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l) and 4A1.2(k).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
