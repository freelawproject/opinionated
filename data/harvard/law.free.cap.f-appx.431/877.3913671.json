Mullenhoff, .United States Attorney\u2019s Office, Miami, FL, for PlaintiffAppellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b899-19\">Jesus Arritola, Eden, TX, pro se.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b899-21\">Before EDMONDSON, HULL and MARTIN, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b899-22\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b899-23\">Jesus Arritola, a federal prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction of his motion for a sentence modification.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-24\">Arritola filed a post-conviction motion asking the district court to depart downward on his sentence (imposed for a drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>crime) based on the harsh pre-trial conditions he faced in Colombia before -being extradited to the United States and based on collateral immigration consequences. On appeal, Arritola repeats these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">Arritola has shown no basis for the district court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over his motion. The authority he cited in support of his motion \u2014 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(f)\u2014 simply directs that the Sentencing Commission devote \u201cparticular attention\u201d to \u201creducing unwarranted sentencing disparities\u201d in promulgating its guidelines; it does not provide a remedy to reduce a sentence based on the circumstances of pretrial detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">Because Arritola was unentitled to relief under section 994(f), we must decide whether his motion is \u201ccognizable under a different remedial statutory framework.\u201d <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>915 F.2d 622, 624-25 (11th Cir.1990) (explaining that federal courts must \u201clook behind the label of a motion filed by a <em>pro se </em>inmate\u201d). But even considering other mechanisms for sentence modifications, Arritola has failed to demonstrate a basis for the district court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Arritola cited no amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines that would allow for a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He already has filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his sentence that the district court denied on the merits, and he has received no permission to file a second motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h); <em>Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2003) (explaining that a district court lacks jurisdiction to consider a criminal defendant\u2019s motion as a \u201csecond or successive\u201d section 2255 motion without certification). Arritola has not timely alleged \u201carithmetical, technical, or other clear error\u201d in his sentence that would have allowed the district court to correct his sentence under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a). And the government has filed no motion based on substantial assistance that would entitle him to relief under Rule 35(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">Because Arritola cannot show a basis for the district court\u2019s jurisdiction over his motion to reduce his sentence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b899-15\"> Whether a district court has \u201cjurisdiction over a particular case is a question of law subject to plenary review.\u201d <em>United States v. Maduno, </em>40 F.3d 1212, 1215 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
