Bustillo\u2019s motion to reopen was filed nine years after she failed to appear for her hearing and was ordered removed in absentia.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-22\">Bustillo first contends the BIA erred by failing to exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reopen those proceedings. Because that authority is discretionary, our court lacks jurisdiction to review this claim. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a); <em>Lopez-Dubon v. Holder, </em>609 F.3d 642, 647 (5th Cir.2010), cer<em>t. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2150, 179 L.Ed.2d 934 (2011); <em>Enriquez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 246, 249-50 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-25\">Bustillo also maintains the BIA abused its discretion by declining to reopen her removal proceedings, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c), to permit her to pursue an asylum application based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>changed conditions in Honduras. Our court has jurisdiction to review this claim. <em>Nolos v. Holder, </em>611 F.3d 279, 281 (5th Cir.2010) (citing <em>Kucana v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 827, 838-40, 175 L.Ed.2d 694 (2010)). The BIA\u2019s denial is reviewed under a \u201chighly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard\u201d. <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). Under that standard, the decision is upheld \u201cso long as it is not capricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 304 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Bustillo was required to file her motion to reopen no later than 180 days after the date of the removal order. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(H) (time limitation for motion to reopen in absentia removal order). That time limitation does not apply, however, where the motion is \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality ..., if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing\u201d. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Moreover, the motion to reopen \u201cmust be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation\u201d. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">In its order regarding not reopening removal proceedings, the BIA noted, <em>inter alia, </em>that Bustillo failed: to produce evidence of changed country conditions; and to submit an asylum application with supporting documentation establishing her eligibility for relief. Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Finally, Bustillo contends the BIA violated her due-process rights by basing its dismissal on her failure to submit an asylum application. She maintains she had no time to submit the application because her impending deportation required immediate action. The BIA, however, did not violate her due-process rights because \u201cthere is no liberty interest at stake in a motion to reopen due to the discretionary nature of the relief sought\u201d. <em>Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, </em>560 F.3d 354, 361 n. 2 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b288-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
