He was also convicted on 39 counts of assisting in filing false income tax returns and aiding and abetting in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(2) and \u00a7 2. He was sentenced to consecutive 36-month terms of imprisonment on the first six counts of the indictment and to concurrent 36-month terms on all of the other counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-21\">Having already filed a direct appeal and a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion in this case, Marshall moved the district court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for a modification of his sentence, arguing that only his conviction under \u00a7 7212(a) was valid and that his sentence should be adjusted accordingly. The district court denied Marshall\u2019s motion and denied him leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. Marshall has now filed a motion in this court seeking leave to proceed IFP on appeal. To proceed IFP, Marshall must demonstrate financial eligibility and a nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 24(a); <em>Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-22\">On appeal, Marshall intends to argue that the district court should have granted relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 709 to the Sentencing Guidelines. Amendment 709 is not listed as an amendment covered by the policy statement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(c). Therefore, under the plain language of \u00a7 3582(c), a district court is not authorized to reduce a sentence based on Amendment 709 because that would be inconsistent with Sentencing Commission Policy. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)). Marshall also intends to argue that his motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>should not have been denied without an evidentiary hearing. However, he does not advert to any factual disputes that would warrant such a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Because Marshall has not shown that his appeal presents any legally nonfrivolous issues, <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983), his motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is denied. Marshall\u2019s appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b336-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
