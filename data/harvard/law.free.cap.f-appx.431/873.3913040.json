Ahamed argues that the BIA erred in finding that he had not shown past persecution based on his political opinion. He also contends that he established a well-founded fear of future persecution. For the reasons stated below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">The Department of Homeland Security issued a Notice to Appear to Ahamed, charging that he was a native and citizen of Bangladesh who entered the United States without being admitted or paroled by an immigration officer. Ahamed admitted the allegations in the notice to appear and conceded removability. He filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">Ahamed\u2019s application was based on the following facts. In 1974, Ahamed joined the Islamic Student Association, a group affiliated with the Jamat Islam political party. Ahamed served as treasurer of the Student Association and collected donations to Jamat Islam from wealthy people in the area. The party promised to use the donations to build houses and provide aid for the needy. After a time, however, the party stopped following through on its promises. When the donors realized this, they became angry, and they threatened Ahamed and other party members who had collected money from them. Ahamed tried to return some of the donations, but he was unable to repay all of the money by himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">Ahamed became disillusioned with Jamat Islam on account of the party\u2019s failure to abide by its promises, so he decided to resign from the party. When the party leaders learned that he was resigning, they were angry because he knew everything about the party\u2019s internal affairs. They wanted to either kill Ahamed or force him to remain in the party. In 1984, Ahamed was kidnapped by a group of terrorists who took him to a building at Dakar University. His kidnappers chained him up and did not give him any food. They threatened to kill Ahamed if he did not \u201cgive [them] the money back.\u201d The kidnappers blindfolded Ahamed and hit him with fists, bats, and hockey sticks. They also applied heavy weight to Ahamed\u2019s chest until he had blood in his mouth. When the kidnappers saw that Ahamed was getting sick, they feared that he would die, so they released him. Ahamed received medical treatment from the village physician. Ahamed reported the kidnapping to the police, but they would not take his case \u201c[b]ecause at that time, some other party was in power.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">In addition to the kidnapping incident, Ahamed was attacked on the street two or three times between 1984 and 1994 and was beaten with sticks. After each of these attacks, Ahamed received medical treatment from the village doctor. Ahamed testified that he knew one of the attackers, but he did not otherwise describe their identities or motivations.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-12\">Ahamed left Bangladesh and came to the United States in 1994. He was not able to bring his wife and children with him at the time. One year after Ahamed left Bangladesh, party members and the people from whom he had collected money went to the house where his wife and children were staying and \u201ctook every<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>thing.\u201d In addition, Ahamed\u2019s mother received threats from \u201cinfluential people\u201d and party members who demanded that their money be returned. In 1995, Ahamed\u2019s wife and children came to the United States. Ahamed testified that he could not return to Bangladesh because there was no security in that country and because the individuals from whom he had collected money were still searching for him. Those individuals had ties to terrorism and could \u201ckill for anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">The IJ denied Ahamed\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. First, the IJ determined that Ahamed\u2019s testimony was not credible. The IJ also concluded that Ahamed had failed to show past persecution. The IJ reasoned that the incident where Ahamed was detained for two days was not so severe as to constitute persecution. The IJ further explained that Ahamed had not linked the mistreatment that he experienced to one of the protected grounds for asylum. The IJ observed that the incidents described by Ahamed were more akin to criminal acts or personal vendettas than to political persecution. Accordingly, the IJ denied Ahamed\u2019s application for asylum. Given Ahamed\u2019s inability to meet the standard for asylum, the IJ determined that he could not meet the higher standard for withholding of removal. Finally, the IJ denied Ahamed\u2019s claim for CAT relief because Ahamed had not established a clear probability that he would be tortured by, or with the acquiescence of, the Bangladeshi government.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Ahamed appealed to the BIA, but the BIA dismissed his appeal. The BIA concluded that it was unnecessary to address the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding because, even assuming that Ahamed\u2019s testimony was credible, he had not shown past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Regarding past persecution, the BIA determined that Ahamed had failed to show a nexus between the mistreatment that he suffered and one of the protected grounds for asylum. The BIA pointed out that the party\u2019s donors targeted Ahamed not because of his political beliefs, but because they wanted their money returned. In addition, the BIA noted that there was no evidence that the Jamat Islam party wished to harm Ahamed because of his political opinion. The BIA further concluded that the incident where Ahamed was kidnapped for two days, and the street attacks that he suffered, were not so extreme as to constitute persecution. The BIA observed that these were \u201crelatively isolated incidents, occurring over a 10 year period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">The BIA also determined that Ahamed had not established a well-founded fear of future persecution. The BIA reasoned that Ahamed\u2019s ties to Jamat Islam were not so significant or well-known that he would be targeted by party members or by angry donors after the passage of more than 25 years. Given that Ahamed had not met the standard for asylum, the BIA concluded that he likewise was unable to meet the higher standard for withholding of removal. Finally, the BIA upheld the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">In an immigration case, we review the BIA\u2019s decision, and any portions of the IJ\u2019s opinion adopted by the BIA. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA issued its own decision, so we review that decision. Because the BIA did not adopt the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, we need not consider Ahamed\u2019s argument that the credibility finding is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">We review the BIA\u2019s factual findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc). \u201c[W]e view the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1027. We may reverse the BIA\u2019s factual findings only when the record compels a reversal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">An applicant for asylum must demonstrate that he is a refugee. INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). An applicant qualifies as a refugee if he suffered past persecution, or has a well-founded fear of future persecution, in his country of origin. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b); <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1351 (11th Cir.2009). To establish past persecution, the applicant must show that he was persecuted in the past on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1); <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">We need not decide the question of whether or not Ahamed has established past persecution because the record provides ample evidence supporting the BIA\u2019s finding the Ahamed simply failed to show a nexus between the mistreatment he says he experienced and a protected ground under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">While soliciting political contributions from donors, Ahamed made promises to them about how the money would be put to use. When these promises did not materialize, the donors demanded their money back. And when Ahamed could not come up with all of their money, they kidnapped and restrained him for two days, beating him and threatening to kill him if he did not give them their money back. The violence done to Ahamed was not a result of his political opinion (or any other statutorily protected ground); it resulted from angry donors violently reacting to his failure to give them back their money after the promises he made were broken. Consequently, Ahamed is not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">In the absence of past persecution, an applicant may establish a well-founded fear of persecution by showing that there is a reasonable possibility that he will be persecuted if he is returned to his country of origin. 8 C.F.R. 208.13(b)(2); <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1352. The applicant must show that his fear of persecution is \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. An applicant can satisfy the objective prong by showing that he \u201chas a good reason to fear future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must establish that her life or freedom would be threatened in her country of origin on account of a statutorily protected ground. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). This Ahamed has failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">Ahamed\u2019s failure to meet the standard for asylum means that he cannot satisfy the higher standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232-33 (11th Cir.2005). Finally, Ahamed does not challenge the BIA\u2019s denial of his claim for CAT relief in his initial brief. Therefore, he has abandoned any argument with respect to that issue. <em>See id. </em>at 1228 n. 2 (noting that issues not raised in a party\u2019s initial brief are deemed abandoned). Accordingly, after review of the administrative record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
