Mize argues that the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) denial of benefits was not supported by substantial evidence. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s judgment reviewing a decision of the Commission of Social Security. <em>Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1260 (11th Cir.2007). In such cases, we review the agency\u2019s decision to determine if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir.2005). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a scintilla,\u201d but less than a preponderance: it \u201cis such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158-59 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe may not decide the facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the [Commissioner].\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240 n. 8 (11th Cir.2004) (alteration in original) (quotation marks omitted). We must, however, conduct an \u201cexacting examination of the [Commissioner\u2019s] conclusions of law.\u201d <em>Martin v. Sullivan, </em>894 F.2d 1520, 1529 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-17\">Mize first argues that the ALJ erred by discrediting her opinion and the opinions of her son\u2019s teachers and treating physicians in concluding that her son did not suffer from a disability. \u201cAbsent good cause, an ALJ is to give the medical opinions of treating physicians substantial or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>considerable weight.\u201d <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1179 (11th Cir.2011) (quotation marks omitted). \u201c[T]he ALJ must state with particularity the weight given to different medical opinions and the reasons therefor.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The ALJ properly gave considerable weight to the opinions of D.I.M.\u2019s treating physicians when determining whether D.I.M. was disabled. According to the ALJ, he accorded the treating physicians\u2019 opinions \u201ccontrolling\u201d weight. The ALJ noted that D.I.M.\u2019s pediatrician reported that D.I.M.\u2019s asthma was controlled relatively well with medication, he had no restriction on his physical activities, and that he had a good prognosis. The ALJ acknowledged that D.I.M.\u2019s other treating physician, Dr. Grad, reported that D.I.M. was \u201cdoing great\u201d on his medications. Moreover, the ALJ observed that recent medical records indicated that D.I.M\u2019s asthma and sleep apnea were \u201cwell controlled.\u201d We therefore conclude that the ALJ properly accorded substantial or considerable weight to the opinions of D.I.M.\u2019s treating physicians. <em>See Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1179.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The ALJ also considered the opinions of Mize and D.I.M.\u2019s school teachers in concluding that D.I.M.\u2019s impairments did not constitute a disability. The reports from D.I.M.\u2019s teachers revealed that he had \u201csome slight problems at school secondary to his impairments, but none that have significantly curtailed him in regular classroom placement.\u201d Similarly, while Mize testified that she had taken D.I.M. to the emergency room on several occasions, the treatment D.I.M. received and the number of hospital visits did not rise to the severity level required by the regulations. <em>See </em>Listing 103.03(B) (providing that the child must suffer asthma attacks requiring physician intervention at least once every two months or at least six times a year). We therefore conclude that Mize\u2019s argument that the ALJ ignored her opinion and those of D.I.M.\u2019s teachers lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">Mize next argues that the ALJ erred in finding that D.I.M.\u2019s impairments did not constitute a disability. An ALJ must conduct a three-part sequential analysis to determine whether a child is entitled to disability benefits. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924(a). The ALJ first must determine whether the child is engaged in substantial gainful activity. <em>See id. </em>If the child is engaged in such activity, then he is neither disabled nor eligible for benefits. If the child is not engaged in substantial gainful activity, the ALJ next determines whether the child has an impairment or combination of impairments that is severe. <em>Id. </em>If the child does not suffer from a severe impairment or combination of impairments, the child is ineligible for benefits. But if the child has a severe impairment, the ALJ finally determines whether the child\u2019s impairment meets, or is medically or functionally equal to, an impairment included in the listing of impairments. <em>Id. </em>If the child\u2019s impairment is a \u201cslight abnormality or combination of slight abnormalities that causes no more than minimal functional limitations\u201d the child is ineligible for benefits. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Mize\u2019s minor child did not suffer from an impairment or combination of impairments that met, medically equaled, or functionally equaled any of the listed impairments. To qualify for SSI benefits for asthma, the child must experience asthma attacks, \u201cin spite of prescribed treatment and requiring physician intervention, occurring at least once every 2 months or at least six times a year\u201d over a consecutive twelve-month period. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>Listing 103.03(B). During the relevant twelve-month period, D.I.M. had only four non-routine visits to a doctor as a result of his asthma. Substantial evidence also supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that D.I.M.\u2019s impairments did not functionally equal any of the listings. One of D.I.M.\u2019s treating physicians indicated that D.I.M.\u2019s asthma <em>may </em>restrict his physical activities, but he noted that such restrictions would only occur when D.I.M. experienced an exacerbation of his usual symptoms. In light of D.I.M.\u2019s medical record and the opinions of his treating physicians, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s denial of D.I.M.\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Mize finally argues that the ALJ erred by failing to fully develop the record by seeking further medical review. \u201cThe administrative law judge has a duty to develop the record where appropriate but is not required to order a consultative examination as long as the record contains sufficient evidence for the administrative law judge to make an informed decision.\u201d <em>Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1269. Here, the record before the ALJ was sufficient such that the ALJ had no duty to develop it further. The administrative record included opinions from D.I.M.\u2019s treating physicians as well as D.I.M\u2019s medical records. It also included anecdotal evidence from D.I.M.\u2019s teachers. We conclude that the ALJ did not err in finding that the record was sufficient to make an informed decision about D.I.M.\u2019s impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">For all these reasons, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court affirming the ALJ\u2019s denial of SSI benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
