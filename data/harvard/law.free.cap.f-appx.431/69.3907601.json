For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm the district court\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">In June 2010, Holmes (a federal prisoner) commenced a civil rights action under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), alleging that his rights were violated during his 2009 criminal trial and subsequent appeal by: (1) his attorneys (defendants Frederick, Sarner, Reffaele, and Dreyer), who purposely did not provide him with effective representation; and (2) federal prosecutors (defendants McKeon and Bologna), who selectively prosecuted him and introduced perjured testimony at his trial. Holmes further claims that the Clerk of this Court lacked authority to deny his motion to remove his appellate counsel, and that the Third Circuit judges who heard his appeal erred by allowing the Clerk of Court to rule on his motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Upon granting Holmes permission to proceed in forma pauperis, the district court dismissed his complaint as legally frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). The district court thereafter denied Holmes\u2019s motion to amend or supplement his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Holmes now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">Because this appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the orders of the district court dismissing the complaint as frivolous and denying the motion to amend. 3d Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of the sua sponte dismissal of a complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) is plenary. <em>Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">Holmes\u2019s civil complaint concerns his allegedly unfair criminal trial and appeal therefrom, which he asserts violated his civil lights. For example, he asserts that his attorneys at the trial and appellate stages \u201cmaliciously and deliberately\u201d \u201cfilled in the gaps\u201d of the prosecution\u2019s case \u201cto support the illegal conviction,\u201d apparently by allowing the prosecutor \u201cto testify to evidence that was never presented to the jury ... to ensure an illegal conviction.\u201d However, a prisoner\u2019s civil rights suit for damages is barred unless he can demonstrate that his conviction or sentence has been invalidated. <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Heck\u2019s </em>favorable termination rule applies \u201cno matter the target of the prisoner\u2019s suit <em>... if </em>success in that action would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of confinement or its duration.\u201d <em>Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 81-82, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005). The district court determined that <em>Heck </em>prohibited Holmes\u2019s civil rights claims. We agree that, in the circumstances presented, Holmes\u2019s claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>regarding prosecutorial misconduct, malicious prosecution, and ineffective assistance of counsel imply the validity of his conviction and thus are not cognizable under <em>Heck.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The district court also appropriately dismissed the claims against the Clerk of Court and the judges of this Court after determining that they are immune from suit. <em>See Azubuko v. Royal, </em>448 F.3d 302, 303 (3d Cir.2006) (\u201cA judicial officer in the performance of his duty has absolute immunity from suit and will not be liable for his judicial acts.\u201d); <em>Lockhart v. Hoenstine, </em>411 F.2d 455, 460 (3d Cir.1969) (\u201c[A]ny public official acting pursuant to court directive is [ ] immune from suit.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the district court\u2019s orders.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b92-9\">. We affirmed Holmes's conviction on July 23, 2010, and denied his motion for rehearing on April 11,2011. (C.A. No. 09-3 811.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b92-13\">. Although <em>Heck </em>involved a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action by a state prisoner, its reasoning has been applied to bar claims under <em>Bivens. See, e.g., Williams </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>74 F.3d 1339, 1341 (D.C.Cir.1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b93-15\">. Because the district court dismissed Holmes's complaint as legally frivolous, it appropriately denied his motion to amend the complaint, as amendment would be futile. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 112-13 (3d Cir.2002) (explaining that \"dismissals of frivolous claims do not require leave to amend due to the long tradition of denying -leave to amend under Rule 15(a) when amendment is inequitable or futile\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
