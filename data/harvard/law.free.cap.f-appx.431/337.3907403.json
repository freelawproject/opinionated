He argues that the district court improperly applied an armed career criminal sentencing enhancement because one of his prior Texas burglary convictions did not constitute the generic offense of burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">The parties agree that the applicable Texas indictment conjunctively charged elements of both generic and nongeneric burglary offenses under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) and (a)(3). The fact of Chapman\u2019s guilty plea to the charges in the indictment is alone insufficient, under Texas law, to demonstrate that his prior offense constituted the generic offense of burglary. <em>See United States v. Morales-Martinez, </em>496 F.3d 356, 358-61 (5th Cir.2007). The district court, however, did not rely solely on Chapman\u2019s guilty plea to the charges in the indictment; instead, the court properly considered Chapman\u2019s written judicial confession. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Arellano, </em>522 F.3d 477, 481 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">In his confession, Chapman stipulated that he committed each allegation in the indictment, including the elements of both the generic and nongeneric burglary offenses. This language cleared up any ambiguity regarding Chapman\u2019s guilty plea to the conjunctive charges in the indictment; was sufficient to establish Chapman\u2019s conviction for a generic burglary offense; and was thus sufficient to support the district court\u2019s application of the armed career criminal sentencing enhancements. <em>See id. </em>at 480-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b359-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
