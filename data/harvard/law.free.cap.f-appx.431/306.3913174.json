Young (\u201cYoung\u201d) and Atlas Credit Corn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>pany, Inc. (\u201cAtlas\u201d) (collectively \u201cAppellants\u201d) bring this appeal following the district court\u2019s grant of Plaintiff-Appellee Nicole Ortiz\u2019s (\u201cOrtiz\u201d) motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"ALqI\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">On June 17, 2010, Ortiz filed suit in the 206th Judicial District Court of Hidalgo County, Texas. Her suit against Atlas alleged violations under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Against Young, Ortiz asserted claims against Young, Atlas\u2019s owner, for assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Ortiz served both with citation on July 23, 2010. On August 16, 2010, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(b), Atlas filed its application for removal to the Southern District of Texas. Atlas\u2019s application made no mention of Young. On September 14, 2010, Ortiz filed a motion to remand arguing that removal was defective because not all defendants had consented to removal within thirty days. On September 20, 2010, Young consented to removal. On November 3, 2010, the district court granted Ortiz\u2019s motion for remand. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination of the propriety of removal. <em>Webb v. Investacorp, Inc., </em>89 F.3d 252, 255 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(a) requires that all defendants join in a petition for removal. <em>Tri-Cities Newspapers, Inc. v. Tri-Cities Printing Pressmen &amp; Assistants\u2019 Local 349, </em>427 F.2d 325, 326-27 (5th Cir.1970). This requires that all served defendants join in the removal petition prior to the expiration of the removal period. <em>Gillis v. Louisiana, </em>294 F.3d 755, 759 (5th Cir.2002). Section 1446(b) explains that the \u201cnotice of removal of a civil action or proceeding shall be filed within thirty days\u201d after service of the citation. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b). In <em>Doe v. Kerwood, </em>969 F.2d 165 (5th Cir.1992), we held that when a civil action has multiple defendants, as is the case here, then all defendants must act collectively to remove that case. <em>Id. </em>at 167. This requirement has been named the \u201cunanimity of consent rule.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-15\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-16\">Here, Atlas timely filed an application to remove the matter. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b). Young did not. Thus, removal was defective and remand appropriate. <em>Kerwood, </em>969 F.2d at 169. Young appeals to the district court\u2019s equitable powers to excuse his tardy application for removal. This court has held that sometimes exceptional or unique circumstances might permit removal after the expiration of the thirty day period prescribed by \u00a7 1446(b). <em>Brown v. Demco, </em>792 F.2d 478, 482 (5th Cir.1986); <em>Getty Oil Co. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>841 F.2d 1254, 1263 (5th Cir.1988); <em>Gillis, </em>294 F.3d at 759. Yet, as Ortiz correctly indicates, those instances where this court has exercised its equitable powers to permit a party to consent to removal outside of the statutorily prescribed time frame often concern plaintiff conduct, and not untimely consent to removal by a defendant. For example, in <em>Brown, </em>we stated that \u201c[exceptional circumstances might permit removal\u201d when confronting bad faith efforts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>to prevent removal. 792 F.2d at 482. Meanwhile, <em>Kerwood </em>permits removal outside of the window in order to prevent injustice. <em>Kerwood, </em>794 F.3d at 759. Here, no such conduct by Ortiz in her service of citation compels the court to exercise its equitable powers. Moreover, no injustice will be obviated by the court condoning tardy consent to removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">As an aside, we note that in neither his opening brief nor in his reply brief does Young address which exceptional circumstances should compel the district court to permit him to consent to removal outside of the thirty day period outlined in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446. Instead, Young merely quibbles with the district court\u2019s declining to permit him to do so. Thus, because Young failed to consent to removal as prescribed in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b), the district court\u2019s remand of this matter was not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
