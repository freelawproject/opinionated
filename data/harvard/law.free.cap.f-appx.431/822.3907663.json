On appeal, Shah argues that the record compels reversal because the Shiv Sena political party in India threatened him, attacked him on two occasions (including once with a pipe), broke his mother\u2019s arm, and harassed him and his family in several cities over a three-year period. Shah argues that the cumulative effect of these events amounted to persecution in retaliation for Shah\u2019s expressing his political objections to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>Shiv Sena members visiting his family\u2019s home. Shah also argues that the BIA erred by concluding that he failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final judgment, unless the BIA has expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). In this case, the BIA wrote its own opinion, so we review only the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">We review the BIA\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). We must \u201caffirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotations omitted). Under this test, we view \u201cthe record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>Accordingly, \u201c[t]o conclude the BIA\u2019s decision should be reversed, we must find that the record not only supports the conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>479 F.3d at 765 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. The Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if the alien is a \u201crefugee,\u201d as defined by INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). Section 1101(a)(42)(A) of Title 8 of the United States Code defines a refugee as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-9\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality, or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving her status as a statutory \u201crefugee\u201d and thereby establishing eligibility for asylum. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. \u201cTo establish asylum eligibility based on political opinion, the alien carries the burden to prove, with credible evidence, either that (1) he suffered past persecution on account of his political opinion, or (2) he has \u2018a well-founded fear\u2019 that his political opinion will cause him to be persecuted.\u201d <em>Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 890 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-12\">\u201cTo establish asylum based on past persecution, the applicant must prove (1) that she was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006). To establish a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future perse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>cution, \u201can applicant must demonstrate that his or her fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. An asylum applicant can establish a well-founded fear of future persecution by presenting \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be singled out for persecution on account of\u2019 the statutorily listed factor. <em>Id. </em>at 1287 (quotation omitted). Alternatively, an applicant can establish a well-founded fear of persecution by establishing that there is a pattern or practice of persecution of persons similarly situated on account of the statutorily listed factor. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">However, not all \u201cexceptional treatment\u201d constitutes persecution. <em>Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1290 (11th Cir.2006). Persecution is \u201can extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and ... mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cIn determining whether an alien has suffered past persecution, the IJ must consider the cumulative effects of the incidents.\u201d <em>Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 861 (11th Cir.2007). To illustrate, we have held that menacing phone calls and threats to an alien, coupled with a bombing at the restaurant where she worked, did not compel a finding of persecution. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005). Similarly, we rejected a claim of persecution where an alien, in addition to receiving threats, was detained at a police station for 36 hours, was kicked and beaten with a belt, and suffered multiple scratches and bruises. <em>Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1171, 1174 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1353 (11th Cir.2009) (concluding that no persecution existed where the petitioner was arrested for participating in a student demonstration, interrogated and beaten for five hours, detained for four days, and monitored by authorities after his release); <em>Zheng, </em>451 F.3d at 1289-91 (concluding that an alien did not suffer persecution where authorities detained him for five days, forced him to watch reeducation materials, made him stand in the sun for two hours, and after his release, monitored him and occasionally searched his residence).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">On the other hand, we upheld a persecution claim where an alien received numerous death threats, was dragged out of her car by her hair and beaten, had her groundskeeper tortured and killed by attackers looking for her, and was kidnapped and beaten before being rescued by government forces. <em>De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1008-09 (11th Cir.2008). Similarly, we agreed that an alien suffered persecution where he received numerous death threats over an 18-month period and was twice physically attacked, including having his nose broken with the butt of a rifle. <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1257-58 (11th Cir.2007); <em>see also Niftaliev v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1211, 1217 (11th Cir.2007) (accepting a persecution claim where the petitioner suffered \u201cnumerous beatings, arrests, searches, and interrogations\u201d and spent 15 days in detention where he was \u201cdeprived of food, beaten, and threatened at gunpoint\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that incidents between Shah and the Shiv Sena supporters did not amount to persecution. Although Shah was attacked twice, the attacks were of short duration and caused only minimal injury, the attackers ran away after each encounter, and Shah was able to continue his job and school work despite the encounters. Although \u201cscary,\u201d the beatings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>vague threats, and harassment \u2014 considered either individually or collectively\u2014 were not so \u201cextreme\u201d that they amounted to persecution. <em>See Zheng, </em>451 F.3d at 1290. Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Shah\u2019s fear of persecution was objectively unreasonable because he could safely relocate within India. As the BIA noted, Shah has never voted in an Indian election and conceded that he was not a high-profile political activist. Shah\u2019s parents have remained in India without incident since September 2007, and Shah conceded that the Congress party that he supports won the 2004 election and remains in power. Because substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s findings that Shah established neither past persecution nor a well-founded fear of future persecution, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b846-7\">. As an initial matter, we note that Shah\u2019s appellate brief does not address his claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief. If a petitioner fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). Because Shah failed to address withholding removal and CAT relief in his brief, Shah abandoned these claims. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, although the BIA ruled <em>sua sponte </em>on withholding of removal and CAT relief, the issue is unexhausted because Shah failed to present these issues to the BIA. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1249-51 (11th Cir.2006). Accordingly, we decline to address the claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
