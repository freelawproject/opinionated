As Diaz-Corrales does not challenge the procedural correctness of his sentence, we will proceed to an examination of its substantive reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008). Because he objected to the reasonableness of his sentence, we will apply the abuse of discretion standard. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-23\">Although the district court at times used the term \u201cdeparture\u201d at the sentencing hearing, the court\u2019s comments, viewed as a whole, and its written Statement of Reasons, clearly reflect that it was imposing a sentence which represented a variance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) rather than an upward departure. Where the district court has imposed a sentence that varies from the guidelines range, reasonableness review requires this court to evaluate whether the sentence \u201cunreasonably fails to reflect the statutory sentencing factors\u201d set forth at \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006). A sentence outside the Guidelines is unreasonable if it \u201c(1) does not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or (3) represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>The district court determined that a variance was justified by Diaz-Corrales\u2019s uncounted criminal convictions and his continued illegal activities. The court also specifically cited several of the \u00a7 3558(a) factors which it considered relevant. The district court thus made an \u201cindividualized assessment based on the facts presented\u201d and concluded that the advisory guidelines range gave insufficient weight to some of the sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 809 (5th Cir.2008). Because the court cited fact-specific reasons for imposing a non-guideline sentence and its reasons adequately reflected consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the sentence was reasonable and will not be disturbed. <em>See Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 349-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b303-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
