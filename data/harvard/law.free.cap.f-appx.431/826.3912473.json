Following our remand in <em>United States v. Canty, </em>570 F.3d 1251 (11th Cir.2009) <em>(Canty I), </em>the district court recalculated Canty\u2019s sentence absent an armed career criminal (\u201cACCA\u201d) enhancement. As part of the revised calculations, the district court applied a base offense level of 24 for Canty\u2019s firearm offense, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), after finding that his prior convictions for opposing an officer with violence and escape while in transport were crimes of violence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">On appeal, Canty argues the district court\u2019s determination that both prior convictions were crimes of violence was erroneous. With respect to his conviction for opposing an officer with violence, Canty asserts that the district court could not conclude that it was a crime of violence as defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l) because Florida\u2019s resisting-with-violence statute did not actually require violent force, and did not qualify under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) because the statute did not require that an offender purposely use force. Canty also argues that escape while in transport did not qualify under \u00a7 4B1.2(a), asserting that it was not similar in kind to the purposeful, violent, and aggressive offenses enumerated in \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) because it may be committed passively and any risk it bore was not inherent in the act itself but rather in the possibility of interruption.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">We affirm Canty\u2019s sentence based on two recent decisions of this Court that have held both of his potential predicate crimes were crimes of violence. In <em>United States v. Nix, </em>628 F.3d 1341 (11th Cir.2010), this Court held that a conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01 was a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). We have previously held that cases decided under that statute\u2019s residual clause apply to residual clause cases under the career offender provision, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008). Similarly, in <em>United States v. Proch, </em>637 F.3d 1262 (11th Cir.2011), we held that a conviction for escape from while being transported to or from jail under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 944.40 constituted a crime of violence. Therefore, we affirm the Canty\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b849-7\">. Canty conceded that a third conviction, for cocaine possession, was a serious drug offense, and therefore the district court needed to find that only one additional conviction qualified as a crime of violence for scoring under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b849-21\">. Canty's request for oral argument is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
