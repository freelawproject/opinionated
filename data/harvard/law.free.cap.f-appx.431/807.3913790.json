Rosell argues that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court failed to avoid an unwarranted sentencing disparity when sentencing him to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment and his codefendant, Yosnell Montejo-Garcia, to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment. He also argues that we should remand his case so that the district court may consider the possibility of a conflict of interest resulting from the potential payment of his counsel\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees by a codefendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">We review the reasonableness of Rosell\u2019s sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of review. <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445. The party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing that the sentence was unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). The district court is required to impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d that are listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The district court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we conduct a two-step review. <em>Gall, 552 </em>U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. First, we must ensure that the sentence was procedurally reasonable, meaning that the district court properly calculated the guidelines range, treated the Sentencing Guidelines as advisory, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, did not select a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, and adequately explained the chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>Once we determine that a sentence is procedurally reasonable, we must examine whether the sentence was substantively reasonable under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A district court may impose a higher sentence on one defendant if he is not \u201csimilarly situated\u201d to his codefendants. <em>See United States v. McNair, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>605 F.3d 1152, 1232 (11th Cir.2010) (affirming a district court\u2019s sentence when a \u201cnumber of factors\u201d distinguished the defendant from his codefendants). A defendant who cooperates with the government is not similarly situated with one who has not cooperated, and thus there is no unwarranted sentence disparity between such codefendants when they receive sentences of different lengths. <em>See United States v. Docampo, </em>573 F.3d 1091, 1101 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Rosell has not shown that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence. He was not similarly situated to MontejoGarcia, his co-defendant, and his sentence was otherwise reasonable. Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Rosell\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">A claim is not ripe for our consideration when the district court \u201cdid not entertain the claim nor develop the factual record.\u201d <em>See United States v. Patterson, </em>595 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation omitted) (holding that a defendant\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was not ripe on direct appeal). The preferred means for deciding a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is through a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">Rosell\u2019s conflict-of-interest claim is not ripe for our consideration because the district court did not develop the factual record nor consider his claim. Therefore, we decline to consider the claim on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AOmv\">.
