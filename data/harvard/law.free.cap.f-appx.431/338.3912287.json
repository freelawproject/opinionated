Because Thompson failed to establish a prima facie case of Title VII retaliation, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-15\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b361-16\">Thompson began employment with Somervell County in May 1995 and became an Assistant County Auditor the next year. In August 2005 she alleged that Darrell Morrison (\u201cMorrison\u201d), the County Auditor, had sexually harassed her. Although Thompson filed a written report with Ken Thrasher (\u201cThrasher\u201d), the County\u2019s Personnel Director, she ultimately decided not to pursue her complaint after Morrison apologized to her and signed a statement to that effect. Although she alleges that she continued to feel uncomfortable working with Morrison, Thompson remained at the County Auditor\u2019s office for three more years without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-17\">In 2008, Thompson transferred to the Somervell County Expo Center. Thompson does not deny that she struggled with her responsibilities in this new position. She had difficulties keeping the bank account balanced and failed to keep a deposit ledger as she had been instructed. Her supervisor at the Expo Center, Mike Dooley (\u201cDooley\u201d), discussed these problems with her, but he did not discipline her. However, due to her difficulties at the Expo Center, Thompson began looking for other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>positions. On May 4, 2009, Thompson asked Thrasher for her personnel file, including the written report of her sexual harassment complaint. Thompson told Thrasher that she \u201cwas going to do whatever it took to make this right.\u201d Thompson testified that she wanted the paperwork \u201cto explain why [she] had to take [the Expo Center] job. [She] simply wanted to find a job in the County for which [she] was better suited.\u201d She received the personnel file on May 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">On May 18, 2009, Dooley reprimanded Thompson for her poor work quality for the first time. The next day, he sent her a Work Deficiencies Memorandum (\u201cMemorandum\u201d), detailing her errors in drafting contracts and balancing the bank account. The letter stated that \u201c[t]here are several deficiencies in [Thompson\u2019s] work that must be corrected\u201d and that Thompson could not \u201chold [the] position if the errors are not corrected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">After receiving the Memorandum, Thompson continued to submit contracts with substantive errors. In one contract, Thompson failed to verify the dates for shows and rehearsals as directed. As a result, all twenty dates in the contract were wrong. Dooley directed Thompson to have co-worker Abe Comacho help her, but when Dooley discussed the matter with Comacho, Comacho indicated that Thompson had not sought his assistance. On June 1, 2009, Dooley told Thompson that she would have to resign by the end of the next day or she would be terminated. Thompson did not resign, and Dooley fired her as indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Thompson claims that her relationship with Dooley became less warm and more professional after she requested her paperwork. She also claims that during this time, when discussing an incident in which a patron of an Expo Center event was injured, Dooley opined that an employee would be more likely than an outsider to sue the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">Thompson brought suit against Somervell County alleging that she was fired in retaliation for requesting the documentation of her sexual harassment report from 2005. After discovery, the County filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Thompson had not engaged in a protected activity and that there was no evidence of a causal link between her request and her termination. The district court granted the County\u2019s motion, and Thompson timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the district court. <em>Brumfield v. Hollins, </em>551 F.3d 322, 326 (5th Cir.2008). Summary judgment is appropriate where the evidence demonstrates that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">Thompson\u2019s suit alleges that Somervell County retaliated against her for engaging in activity protected by Title VII. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). Specifically, Thompson alleges that the County fired her because she asked for the paperwork detailing Morrison\u2019s sexual harassment toward her. Where a plaintiff alleges unlawful retaliation in violation of Title VII, the court employs the burden-shifting analysis the <em>McDonnell </em>Douglas<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> burden-shifting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>framework. <em>See Long v. Eastfield College, </em>88 F.3d 300, 304 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Under the first step of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework, the plaintiff must make a prima facie case of discrimination. <em>See Turner v. Baylor Richardson Med. Ctr., </em>476 F.3d 337, 348 (5th Cir.2007). To make a prima facie case of retaliation, Thompson \u201cmust demonstrate that: (1) she engaged in protected activity; (2) an adverse employment action occurred; and (3) a causal link exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court determined that Thompson had failed to make a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII because she failed to establish that she had engaged in protected activity or that there was a causal connection between her termination and her claimed protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">A. Protected Activity</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">\u201cAn employee has engaged in protected activity when she has (1) \u2018opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice\u2019 by Title VII or (2) \u2018made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing\u2019 under Title VII.\u201d <em>Douglas v. DynMcDermott Petroleum Operations Co., </em>144 F.3d 364, 372 (5th Cir.1998) (internal citations omitted). As noted by the Supreme Court, \u201coppose\u201d is undefined by Title VII and therefore \u201ccarries its ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Metro. Gov\u2019t of Nashville &amp; Davidson Cnty., Tenn., </em>555 U.S. 271, 129 S.Ct. 846, 850, 172 L.Ed.2d 650 (2009). Though the Court rejected a definition of \u201coppose\u201d that requires the opposition to be \u201cactive [and] consistent,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 851, it is clear that opposition nonetheless must be purposive. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[W]e would call it \u2018opposition\u2019 if an employee <em>took a stand against </em>an employer\u2019s discriminatory practices not by \u2018instigating\u2019 action, but by standing pat, say, by refusing to follow a supervisor\u2019s order to fire a junior worker for discriminatory reasons.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>id. </em>at 853 (Alito, J., concurring) (\u201cThe primary definitions of the term \u2018oppose\u2019 ... require conduct that is ... purposive.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">In this case, Thompson emphasizes that, when requesting the documentation of her sexual harassment report from four years earlier, she told Thrasher that she \u201cwas going to do whatever it took to make this right,\u201d arguing that this constituted an \u201copposition\u201d statement. <em>See id. </em>at 851 (\u201cWhen an employee communicates to her employer a belief that the employer has engaged in ... a form of employment discrimination, that communication virtually always constitutes the employee\u2019s opposition to the activity.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (alteration in original)). We conclude that the district court did not err in finding this statement insufficient to qualify as \u201copposition\u201d given that Thompson\u2019s admitted reason for requesting the documentation was because she \u201csimply wanted to find a job in the County for which [she] was better suited.\u201d This stated reason is also consistent with the timing of the request, having been made nearly four years after the incident at issue and more than three years after she signed a \u201cno action\u201d letter. Because Thompson admits that her sole intent in requesting the documentation of her sexual harassment complaint was to find another position within the County, no reasonable jury could find that the request was made with intent \u201cto contend against[,] confront[,] resist [or] withstand\u201d any long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>ago discriminatory practices by the County or its officials. <em>See id. </em>at 850 (quoting Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 1710 (2d ed.1958)); <em>cf. Payne v. McLemore\u2019s Wholesale &amp; Retail Stores, </em>654 F.2d 1130, 1136-37 (5th Cir.1981) (affirming district court\u2019s finding of opposition where there was \u201csubstantial evidence ... that the purpose of the boycott and picketing was to opposed defendant\u2019s discrimination against blacks in certain employment opportunities\u201d). Therefore, Thompson\u2019s request did not constitute opposition to an unlawful practice under Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">B. Causal Link</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Thompson also failed to establish the third prong of a prima facie retaliation case, a causal link between the alleged protected activity and the adverse employment action. To establish the causal link between her request for the sexual harassment documentation and her termination, Thompson relies exclusively on the fact that she received the Memorandum within one week of requesting the report and was terminated within one month of requesting the report. However, even at the prima facie stage, temporal proximity can only establish a causal link when it is connected to the decision maker\u2019s knowledge of the protected activity. <em>See Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, </em>532 U.S. 268, 273, 121 S.Ct. 1508, 149 L.Ed.2d 509 (2001) (per curiam) (\u201cThe cases that accept mere temporal proximity between <em>an employer\u2019s knowledge of </em>protected activity and an adverse employment action as sufficient evidence of causality to establish a prima facie case uniformly hold that the temporal proximity must be very close.\u201d (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); <em>Cothran v. Potter, </em>398 Fed.Appx. 71, 73-74 (5th Cir.2010) (unpublished) (\u201cThe combination of temporal proximity and knowledge of a protected activity may be sufficient to satisfy a plaintiffs prima facie burden for a retaliation claim\u201d); <em>Ramirez v. Gonzales, </em>225 Fed.Appx. 203, 210 (5th Cir.2007) (unpublished) (\u201cFifth Circuit precedent requires evidence of knowledge of the protected activity on the part of the decision maker and temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.\u201d); <em>see also Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., </em>231 F.3d 791, 799 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201c[Tjemporal proximity alone is insufficient to create a genuine issue of fact as to causal connection where there is unrebutted evidence that the decision maker did not have knowledge that the employee engaged in protected conduct.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">In this case, Dooley testified that he was unaware that Thompson had requested documentation of her sexual harassment report at the time that he fired her, and his testimony is uncontroverted on this matter. Indeed, Thompson admits that she has no evidence that Dooley knew that she had requested her documentation other than to rely on the inference of temporal proximity. Therefore, even if we were to assume that Thompson\u2019s request for documentation of her prior sexual harassment report constituted a protected activity, Thompson has failed to establish even a prima facie causal link between her request and her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">For the above reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\">. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). Under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework, an employee must first establish a prima facie case of retaliation. <em>Hockman </em>v. <em>Westward Commc'ns., LLC, </em>407 F.3d 317, 330 (5th Cir.2004). If successful, then the employer must demonstrate a legitimate, nonretaliatoiy reason for the adverse employment action. <em>Id. </em>If the employer meets this burden, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>the burden then shifts to the employee to show that the employer\u2019s stated rationale is pretextual and that engaging in the protected activity was the but-for cause of the adverse employment action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
