Chandler argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-21\">Chandler\u2019s sentence is procedurally and substantively reasonable. In 2005, Chandler pleaded guilty to conspiring to manufacture more than 100 marijuana plants, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(b)(1)(B), and while he was on supervised release, Chandler and his brother cultivated 58 marijuana plants. The district court considered Chandler\u2019s guideline range of 12 to 18 months of imprisonment, but found that \u201c[a] thirty-six month ... sentence\u201d was necessary to address \u201cthe nature of [Chandler\u2019s] new criminal conduct,\u201d his commission of a \u201csecond felony drug offense,\u201d the \u201cserious[ness] of [his] crime,\u201d his lack of \u201crespect for the law,\u201d and to \u201censure deterrence[,] and ... protect the public from future criminal conduct\u201d by Chandler, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3583(e), 3553(a). \u201c[A]t revocation the [district] court should sanction primarily the defendant\u2019s breach of trust,\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, ch. 7, pt. A, introductory cmt. 3(b), and the district court reasonably determined that Chandler\u2019s decision to return to the drug trade while under supervised release war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>ranted an upward variance to the maximum statutory sentence, <em>see United States v. Brown, </em>224 F.3d 1237, 1242-43 (11th Cir.2000). The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Chandler\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
