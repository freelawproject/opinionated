On appeal, DeLeon-Argueta argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of his personal history and background.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-26\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1188-89 (11th Cir.2010), <em>petition for cert. filed,, </em>(U.S. Nov. 24, 2010) (No. 10-727). The appellant has the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>given case, there is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose. <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1189. Therefore, we will only remand a sentence when the district court commits \u201ca clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1190 (quotation omitted). A sentence within the guidelines range will ordinarily be deemed a reasonable one. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The district court acknowledged DeLeon-Argueta\u2019s experiences in the Guatemalan army, but chose to give that factor less weight due to the passage of approximately 15 years. Instead, the court stated that the crimes of conviction were serious in light of the fact that DeLeon-Argueta continued to reenter the United States illegally, and, once he reentered, he committed crimes involving assault, drug possession, and resisting arrest, to name a few. Given these circumstances, the district court reasonably put more weight on the sentencing factors of adequate deterrence and the protection of the public, and a sentence of time served would not have accomplished those sentencing objectives. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The resulting 15-month sentence is within the guidelines range, and well below the statutory maximum penalty of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788; <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (concluding that the sentence was reasonable in part because it was well below the statutory maximum). Although DeLeon-Argueta argues that a six-month sentence of time-served would have been reasonable, there is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose, and DeLeon-Argueta has not shown that the court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to arrive at a 15-month guidelines sentence was unreasonable. <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1189; <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b810-15\">.
