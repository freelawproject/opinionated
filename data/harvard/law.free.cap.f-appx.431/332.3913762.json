The district court varied upward from the advisory-Sentencing Guidelines range of 21 to 27 months and sentenced him to 48 months\u2019 imprisonment. Cruz contends his sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-17\">Although, <em>post-Booker, </em>the Guidelines are advisory only, and a sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its findings of fact, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-22\">Accordingly, our court first examines whether the district court committed any significant procedural error. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. We next \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-23\">Cruz maintains the district court procedurally erred by selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts. Although information contained in the presentence investigation report (PSR) showed Cruz worked, albeit illegally, as a street vendor and market salesperson, the district court did not clearly err in finding Cruz had not made any \u201creal contribution\u201d to our economy or society. The comment was premised on the district court\u2019s observing that Cruz consistently engaged in criminal conduct while in the United States. The PSR supports the court\u2019s noting that, except in one instance, each time Cruz was detained for immigration purposes, it was because he was in custody for another charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-24\">Cruz also maintains the district court proeedurally erred by failing to adequately explain the extent of its upward variance. The court was aware of Cruz\u2019 age and difficult employment situation in Mexico; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>however, because of his extensive criminal history (12 criminal convictions and three arrests) and insistence on returning to this country despite having already served an 82-month sentence for illegal re-entry, the court ruled that a non-Guidelines sentence was necessary to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, deter future criminal conduct, protect the public from further crimes, and provide just punishment for the offense. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 706-08 (5th Cir.2006). Unlike in <em>United States v. Kirkpatrick, </em>589 F.3d 414, 415-16 (7th Cir.2009), cited by Cruz, the court\u2019s reasons were not conclusional and did not indicate that the sentence was arbitrarily chosen. The court expressly fashioned a sentence that would be sufficient, in the light of Cruz\u2019 extensive criminal history in this country.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Regarding Cruz\u2019 contention that the sentence was substantively unreasonable, he maintains: a shorter sentence would have been sufficient to deter him because he was nearly 60 years old at sentencing; the court gave insufficient weight to the Guidelines and undue weight to his criminal history; and his having no family in the United States was an improper factor that the court considered. There is no indication that the court: failed to \u201caccount for a factor that should have received significant weight\u201d; gave \u201csignificant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor\u201d; or made \u201ca clear error of judgment in balancing the [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] sentencing factors\u201d. <em>See Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 708 (citation omitted). Accordingly, Cruz has shown no more than a disagreement with the district court\u2019s balancing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Moreover, the sentence imposed \u201cwas reasonable under the totality of th[ose] ... factors\u201d. <em>United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
