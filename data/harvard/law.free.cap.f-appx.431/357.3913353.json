Our review of the record shows that David\u2019s plea was voluntary and that he was advised of the statutory maximum sentence he could receive. Therefore, he has not shown plain error in connection with this claim. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 58-59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002); <em>see also Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 74, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977); <em>Hobbs v. Blackburn, </em>752 F.2d 1079, 1081-82 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">David also argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. As a general rule, this court will not consider an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim that was not raised in district court. <em>United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 313-14 (5th Cir.1987). Moreover, the Supreme Court has emphasized that a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion is the preferred method for raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). As the record for this case is not sufficiently developed to qualify for an exception to that general rule, we decline to consider David\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim in this appeal without prejudice to his ability to raise this claim in a \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-13\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b380-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
