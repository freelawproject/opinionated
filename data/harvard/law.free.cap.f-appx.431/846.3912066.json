Hames argues that the district court erred in dismissing his motion to amend for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction when it concluded that his motion was a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion that he did not have authorization to file.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">We review questions regarding subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. United States v. Oliver, </em>148 F.3d 1274, 1275 (11th Cir.1998). We review a district court\u2019s application of Rule 15(c) for abuse of discretion. <em>Davenport v. United States, </em>217 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Rule 15(c) allows, in specific circumstances, \u201can amendment to a pleading [to] relate[ ] back to the date of the original pleading.\u201d Rule 15 can be used in cases where a defendant files a timely \u00a7 2255 motion and then later files an amendment or additional motion that relates back to the original \u00a7 2255, but would otherwise be untimely. <em>Davenport, </em>217 F.3d at 1344. An amendment \u201crelates back\u201d to the date of the original pleading if it, \u201casserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out ... in the original pleading.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(c)(1)(B). Importantly, a motion under \u00a7 2255 can only be amended under Rule 15 before judgment is issued; Rule 15 has no post-judgment application. <em>Jacobs v. Tempur-Pedic Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>626 F.3d 1327, 1344-45 (11th Cir.2010). Finally, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h) requires that any prisoner who wishes to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate must first file a request with this court for an order authorizing the district court to consider the motion. Without such authorization, the district court does not have jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">Hames filed his \u201cmotion relating back to original \u00a7 2255 motion\u201d over ten years after final judgment was entered in his original \u00a7 2255 case. Further, Hames did not have authorization from this court to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255. Therefore, the district court did not err in dismissing the motion to amend for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b869-7\">. Hames also argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a Certificate of Appealibility (COA). Hames lacks a COA to appear before this court, but a COA is not required when a prisoner seeks review of the dismissal of an \"amended\u201d \u00a7 2255 motion for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>See Hubbard v. Campbell, </em>379 F.3d 1245, 1246-47 (11th Cir.2004) (concluding COA not required for consideration of district court's order because \"the district court's decision dismissing the [ajmended [pjetition is not a- final order\u201d under 28 U.S.C. 2253(c), but rather \"a final order dismissing the [ajmended [pjetition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, this court has jurisdiction to consider the merits of the district court's order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
