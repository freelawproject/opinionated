He asserts he is entitled to relief because this Court\u2019s precedent regarding discretionary Rule 35(b) motions does not limit unconstitutional motives to race and religion, and his invocation of his Sixth Amendment rights in support of his motion to compel met the threshold standard for court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">Federal prosecutors are given vast discretion whether to file a substantial assistance motion, and a prosecutor\u2019s decision is subject to review only where the defendant can make a threshold \u201csubstantial showing\u201d before the district court that the decision not to file the motion was motivated by an unconstitutional concern, <em>e.g., </em>the defendant\u2019s race or religion. <em>United States v. McNeese, </em>547 F.3d 1307, 1308 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cWe have held that arguments that the government had motivations beyond the defendant\u2019s provision of substantial assistance do not satisfy the Supreme Court\u2019s unconstitutional-motive standard for review.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1502-03 n. 5 (11th Cir.1993) (generally a district court need not consider claim the government acted in \u201cbad faith\u201d in refusing to file substantial assistance motion). We have not defined the parameters of constitutional motives subject to this inquiry, but have expressed a view that review is limited to matters involving \u201crace, religion or other arbitrary classification.\u201d <em>Forney, </em>9 F.3d at 1501 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-12\">The district court did not err in finding Quinones failed to make a substantial showing the Government refused to file a Rule 35(b) motion based upon an unconstitutional motive. In support of his motion to compel, Quinones offered nothing beyond a blanket \u2014 and counter-intuitive\u2014 claim the Government was retaliating against him because he opted to waive his right to be represented by counsel when testifying for the Government in the case against Juan Carlos Cruz. It simply does not follow that the Government would somehow negatively view Quinones\u2019s decision not to have counsel in furtherance of his testimony in the Cruz case, as Quinones\u2019s actions in this regard likely helped the Government. We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Quinones was simply manufacturing a constitutional \u201chook\u201d to avoid the application of this Court\u2019s precedent regarding review of substantial assistance disputes. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Quinones\u2019s motion to compel under Rule 35(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
