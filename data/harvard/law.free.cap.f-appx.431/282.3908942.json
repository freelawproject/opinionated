He was sentenced as a career offender to a total of 262 months in prison. He challenges his career-offender status, the district court\u2019s finding that he obstructed justice, and the denial of credit for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-22\">First, McDonald contends that he was wrongly sentenced as a career offender because his prior Texas conviction for evading arrest in a motor vehicle was not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). In <em>United States v. Harrimon, </em>568 F.3d 531, 534-37 (5th Cir.2009), we held that the Texas crime of evading arrest in a motor vehicle is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The relevant residual definitions of \u201cviolent felony\u201d under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) are interchangeable. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>635 F.3d 774, 776 (5th Cir.2011). <em>Hammon </em>thus forecloses McDonald\u2019s contention that the prior crime was not a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>In his second contention, McDonald argues that his offense level should not have been increased for obstruction of justice. This contention is not relevant to McDonald\u2019s offense level, which was determined by his career-offender status. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4Bl.l(b). However, the finding of obstruction is relevant to the denial of credit for acceptance of responsibility, so we address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">McDonald wrote several letters to his fellow conspirator, Inequa Rushing, asking her to state falsely under oath that McDonald knew nothing about the bank robbery until she came out of the bank with the money. This conduct falls squarely within the ambit of obstruction of justice. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n.4). The district court did not commit any error, clear or other, by finding obstruction of justice. <em>See United States v. Pofahl, </em>990 F.2d 1456, 1481-82 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">McDonald finally contends that he should have been awarded credit for acceptance of responsibility despite his obstruction. Absent extraordinary circumstances, obstruction of justice shows that a defendant has not accepted responsibility, and the denial of credit for acceptance of responsibility will be affirmed unless it is \u201cwithout foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 211 (5th Cir.2008). The record soundly refutes McDonald\u2019s assertion that he abandoned his efforts to obstruct justice. He thus shows no extraordinary circumstances warranting credit for acceptance of responsibility, and there was a firm foundation for the denial of that credit. <em>See id. </em>The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b304-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
