This court granted a certificate of appealability on the issue whether the district court erred by dismissing Patino\u2019s claims that prospective jurors James Estes and John Grimland were biased and should have been excused for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-23\">A federal court must give deference to a state habeas court\u2019s determination of the merits of the prisoner\u2019s claims, unless the state decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(1) &amp; (2). We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and issues of law de novo. <em>Propes v. Quarterman, </em>573 F.3d 225, 227 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3272, 176 L.Ed.2d 1188 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-26\">Even if Estes and Grimland were biased, Patino\u2019s constitutional rights were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>not violated because he used peremptory-challenges to strike both of them from jury service. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Salazar, </em>528 U.S. 304, 307, 311, 120 S.Ct. 774, 145 L.Ed.2d 792 (2000); <em>United States v. Sanchez-Hernandez, </em>507 F.3d 826, 830 (5th Cir.2007). His arguments that his case falls within the exceptions to <em>Martinez-Salazar </em>are entirely conclusory. <em>See Ross v. Estelle, </em>694 F.2d 1008, 1012 (5th Cir.1983). He fails to show that he is entitled to habeas relief. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2254(d)(1) <em>&amp; </em>(2); <em>Harrington v.
