Lechuga-Guerrero argues that his sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He contends that the guidelines sentencing range was too severe because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 resulted in the double counting of his prior conviction for a crime of violence and further that a sentence under that guidelines provision should not be afforded a presumption of reasonableness. He also argues that the guidelines sentencing range did not accurately reflect the seriousness of his offense and failed to account for his history and characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">As Lechuga-Guerrero concedes, his argument that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009). We have also rejected the argument that using a conviction to increase the offense level and to calculate criminal history is impermissible double counting. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">The district court considered LechugaGuerrero\u2019s request for a downward variance, and it ultimately determined that a sentence at the bottom of the applicable guidelines range was appropriate based on the circumstances of the case and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The assertions regarding the seriousness of his offense and his personal history and characteristics are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. See <em>United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b318-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
