Powell (\u201cPowell\u201d) appeals from the district court\u2019s order of summary judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellee United States of America (\u201cGovernment\u201d). Powell sued the Government for negligence under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346. We AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">Powell visited the Veterans Administration Medical Center (\u201cVA\u201d) in Jackson, Mississippi, on March 21, 2006. An altercation arose after Powell refused to remove items from his pockets at the seeurity checkpoint. A security guard struck Powell\u2019s arm and knocked away Powell\u2019s finger, which was pointed at the guard. The squabble ended moments later without further incident. Powell sued the Government for negligence for its employee\u2019s actions and alleged damages based on mental anguish and pain, medical expenses, and physical pain and suffering. The district court found a complete absence of evidence to support a finding of damages and granted summary judgment in favor of the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-16\">We review a summary judgment order de novo, applying the same standard as the district court. <em>United States v. Lawrence, </em>276 F.3d 193, 195 (5th Cir.2001). \u201cSummary judgment is proper when no issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Questions of fact are reviewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and questions of law are reviewed de novo.\u201d <em>Deas v. River West, L.P., </em>152 F.3d 471, 475 (5th Cir.1998). Here, Mississippi tort law applies to Powell\u2019s claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-17\">The Government argued that Powell cannot satisfy his burden of proof regarding damages for his claim of negligence. To overcome the Government\u2019s summary judgment motion, Powell had to show a genuine issue of fact as to the element of damages. <em>See Carpenter v. Nobile, </em>620 So.2d 961, 964 (Miss.1993); <em>Sellars ex rel. Dill v. Walgreen Co., </em>971 So.2d 1278, 1279 (Miss.Ct.App.2008). Nothing in the record supports Powell\u2019s allegations of injury. In response to the Government\u2019s Motion, Powell did not set out any specific facts to show a genuine issue of fact existed regarding his alleged injury. In fact, Powell has failed to supply any evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>shows he suffered an injury from the brief squabble. Accordingly, the district court did not err by granting summary, judgment in favor of the Government because no genuine issue existed over whether Powell could satisfy his burden of proof regarding damages. <em>See Carpenter, </em>620 So.2d at 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s summary judgment order in favor of the Government.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b290-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
