The district court ruled that Creech had no right to reinstatement because Tift Regional decided to eliminate Creech\u2019s position before she requested leave under the Act. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">To prove that an employer interfered with a right of reinstatement, \u201can employee must demonstrate that [s]he was denied a benefit to which [s]he was entitled under the [Family Medical Leave Act].\u201d <em>Martin v. Brevard Cnty. Pub. Sch., </em>543 F.3d 1261, 1266-67 (11th Cir.2008) (citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2615(a)(1)). An employee who returns to work after taking leave covered by the Act is entitled to be returned to her former position or its equivalent. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2614(a)(1); <em>Strickland v. Water Works and Sewer Bd. of City of Birmingham, </em>239 F.3d 1199, 1208 (11th Cir.2001). This right of reinstatement \u201cis not absolute; rather, \u2018an employer can deny reinstatement if it can demonstrate that it would have discharged the employee had she not been on FMLA leave.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schaaf v. </em>Smith<em>kline Beecham Corp., </em>602 F.3d 1236, 1241 (11th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Martin, </em>543 F.3d at 1267).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Tift Regional did not interfere with Creech\u2019s right to reinstatement by eliminating her position as coordinator of the surgical care improvement program. Tift Regional proved without dispute, through the testimony of its director of human resources, Ellen Eaton, and the testimony of Creech\u2019s supervisor, Tonia Garrett, that the hospital decided in the fall of 2006 to eliminate Creech\u2019s position and transfer her responsibilities to the quality management department. About three months later, in February 2007, Creech requested medical leave to undergo hip replacement surgery. When Creech returned in April 2007, her position had been eliminated. The decision by Tift Regional to eliminate Creech\u2019s position was unrelated to her request for medical leave, <em>see Schaaf, </em>602 F.3d at 1241; <em>Strickland, </em>239 F.3d at 1208, and, upon her return, Creech was not entitled to a \u201cposition of employment other than any\u201d she \u201cwould have been entitled had [she] not taken the leave,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2614(a)(3)(B). Because Tift Regional had eliminated Creech\u2019s position, she was not entitled to reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">The summary judgment in favor of Tift Regional is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
