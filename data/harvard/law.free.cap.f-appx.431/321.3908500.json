In that regard, Williams contests the three-level enhancement, pursuant to Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 3Bl.l(b), for his role as a manager or supervisor in a criminal conspiracy. He maintains there is no evidence showing that he exercised any supervisory authority or that he did anything other than act as a broker for two drug suppliers and buy and sell drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Extensive evidence was presented at the sentencing hearing. A district court\u2019s determination that a defendant was a manager or supervisor under Guideline \u00a7 3B 1.1(b) is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Rose, </em>449 F.3d 627, 633 (5th Cir.2006). A finding of fact is not clearly erroneous if it is plausible in the light of the entire record. <em>Id. </em>For the reasons that follow, the district court did not clearly err in imposing the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The record reflects that Williams independently set his own price and arranged the details of the drug transactions. As evidenced in recorded telephone conversations, which were played for the district court, Williams recruited, and attempted to recruit, individuals into the operation. The organization\u2019s scale was significant \u2014 it was responsible for drug distribution in four States. Additionally, there was evidence that Williams managed issues of quality control. He also contacted a co-conspirator when a customer was arrested; he managed that situation and repeatedly sought to ensure that neither he nor his supplier would be found with drugs if the arrested customer lead law enforcement authorities to them. Further, Williams received a share of the fruits of the enterprise. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Lopez-Urbina, </em>434 F.3d 750, 766-67 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
