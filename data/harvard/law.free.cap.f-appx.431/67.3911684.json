For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Maphorisa filed a complaint, later supplemented by what he called a \u201cTraverse Motion,\u201d alleging that he had been unlawfully detained in the CFCF on five separate occasions between March 2009 and March 2010 after he had posted bail or been paroled. Maphorisa sought money damages for \u201cemotional torture and stress\u201d suffered during each day of allegedly illegal detention. At a pretrial conference, the District Court ordered the warden of the CFCF to provide details describing the circumstances of Maphorisa\u2019s detention. In response, the warden filed a report, along with custody and criminal docket records. The warden explained that during each of the disputed periods of incarceration, Maphorisa had been detained primarily at the York County Prison in the custody of federal immigration authorities. Those authorities, however, would \u201ceffectively loan [Maphorisa] out to Philadelphia County for his local matters that were still pending.\u201d Thus, according to the warden, \u201cin each instance [where Maphorisa] resolved a matter in the Philadelphia courts, he was released back to York County for his federal detain-er for the immigration issues.\u201d Maphorisa submitted a response to the warden\u2019s report, but did not deny any of the material facts.. Instead, Maphorisa maintained that his detention at the CFCF was unlawful under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 287.7(d), a federal regulation pertaining to immigration detainers.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">The District Court dismissed the complaint as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). According to the District Court, because Maphorisa was already in the primary custody of immigration authorities, the regulations pertaining to detainers were inapplicable to him. Maphorisa appealed. We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review is plenary. <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">\u201cA detainer serves to advise another law enforcement agency that the Department [of Homeland Security] seeks custody of an alien presently in the custody of that agency, for the purpose of arresting and removing the alien.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 287.7(a). As noted, Maphorisa\u2019s claim relied exclusively on \u00a7 287.7(d), which provides that \u201c[u]pon a determination by the Department to issue a detainer for an alien not otherwise detained by a criminal justice agency, such agency shall maintain custody of the alien for a period not to exceed 48 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays in order to permit assumption of custody by the Department.\u201d Maphorisa complained that, after he posted bail or was granted parole, the warden unlawfully detained him at the CFCF for over 48 hours. We disagree. As the warden\u2019s report and state criminal records demonstrate, Maphorisa was not subject to a detainer issued by the Department of Homeland Security during his incarceration at the CFCF. Rather, Maphorisa had been transferred from immigration custody to the CFCF pursuant to what were essentially state writs of habeas corpus ad prosequendum. Thus, the regulations pertaining to detainers issued by federal im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>migration authorities are inapplicable. <em>Cf. United States v. Mauro, </em>436 U.S. 340, 358, 98 S.Ct. 1834, 56 L.Ed.2d 329 (1978) (distinguishing between a detainer and a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum); <em>Rios v. Wiley, </em>201 F.3d 257, 274 (3d Cir.2000) (\u201c[A] prisoner detained pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum remains in the primary custody of the first jurisdiction unless and until the first sovereign relinquishes jurisdiction over the prisoner.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Because the appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Maphorisa\u2019s complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
