App. 195 [281 Pac. 533].) A stipulation was entered by the parties that if the motion to dismiss the appeal should be denied, the appeal involved herein should be submitted upon the briefs filed in the main appeal, No. 3653.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-14\">As the questions involving all the merits presented herein have been determined in said appeal No. 3653, all questions now before the court are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>It is therefore ordered that the motion to dismiss the appeal be denied, and in so far as the appeal involved herein affects the judgment, the judgment is affirmed. And by reason of what is stated in the opinion filed in the appeal No. 3653, the costs incurred upon this appeal are taxed against the community property belonging to the respective parties.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
