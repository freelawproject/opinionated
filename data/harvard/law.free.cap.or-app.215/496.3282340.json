Appellant also contends that the trial court erred in finding that, because of a mental disorder, he is dangerous to himself and others, and presently unable to provide for his basic needs. ORS 426.005(l)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">On appeal, the state concedes that the trial court abused its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s request for a continuance. On <em>de novo </em>review, we agree and accept that concession. In this case, counsel requested that the court grant a continuance because appellant was suffering from dehydration and possible renal failure and would be better able to participate in the hearing after his immediate physical crisis was addressed. The trial court denied that request because of concerns about defendant\u2019s resistance to treatment of his deteriorating physical condition. ORS 426.095(2)(c) permits a continuance of up to five judicial days for \u201cgood cause\u201d in order to allow preparation for a hearing. That statute further allows the court to \u201cmake orders for the care and custody of the person during a postponement * * <em>Id. </em>We agree with the parties that appellant showed good cause for a continuance, and that, given the trial court\u2019s ability under ORS 426.095(2)(c) to \u201cmake orders for [appellant\u2019s] care\u201d in the interim, the court abused its discretion in denying the requested continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
