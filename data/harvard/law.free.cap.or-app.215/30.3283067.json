J.</author>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">SAIF Corporation seeks judicial review of an order of the Department of Consumer and Business Services (DCBS) ruling that employer successfully reestablished its coverage under a SAIF workers\u2019 compensation policy as of May 17, 2004. SAIF acknowledges that it had accepted overdue documents and premiums by May 17, but maintains that its coverage of employer was not reinstated until July 16, 2004, because employer did not apply for reinstatement until that date.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Employer B &amp; W Car Wash, owned by respondents Kent and Terry Bowers, was covered by a SAIF workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy from February 2, 2000 through April 15, 2004. On at least eight occasions during that period, employer did not pay its premium on time or submit required payroll reports. When that happened, SAIF (as was its practice) sent an \u201cadvance termination notice\u201d warning employer that \u201c[c] overage under your policy, and the associated guaranty contract\u201d would be \u201cterminated\u201d effective on a stated date, but also stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">\u201cIf SAIF receives the completed payroll report before the termination date, your insurance policy will remain in effect and there will be no lapse in your coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">\n<em>\u201cPlease be aware that repeated late payments and termination notices may cause increased rates or jeopardize your coverage\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">(Emphasis in original.) On at least six occasions, employer supplied the overdue documentation or premiums before the stated termination date, and SAIF sent employer a \u201cwithdrawal of termination\u201d letter stating, \u201cWe have withdrawn the termination of your workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy with SAIF Corporation. Your coverage remains in effect with no lapse in coverage.\u201d On two occasions, however, SAIF received overdue documents or premiums after the stated termination date but sent \u201cwithdrawal of termination\u201d letters nonetheless.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>In the present case, SAIF sent employer an advance termination notice on March 12, 2004, because employer had not filed a required payroll report. The notice informed employer that its workers\u2019 compensation coverage would be terminated at midnight, April 15, 2004; the notice also contained the customary statement that receipt by SAIF of the report before that date would keep employer\u2019s coverage in effect without a lapse. SAIF also sent employer a bill for $17, due on April 25, 2004, but with the warning, \u2018You have received a termination notice for past due premium or payroll report. The due date on this invoice does not extend coverage beyond the termination date of that notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Shortly thereafter, and before the April 15 date of threatened termination, Kent Bowers \u2014 according to his uncontradicted testimony before the administrative law judge (ALJ) who heard and decided the case \u2014 telephoned SAIF, and an employee assured him that his \u201cworkman\u2019s comp insurance would be okay as long as I got [the payroll report] to them.\u201d Bowers sent the completed payroll report and a check for $17 to SAIF on April 13,2004. Two days later, SAIF terminated employer\u2019s policy for \u201ccollection reasons.\u201d The ALJ made no finding regarding whether SAIF had received the report and check before terminating the policy; he found only that SAIF received them by May 17, 2004, the day that SAIF negotiated employer\u2019s check and credited its account.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">After one of employer\u2019s employees was injured on July 12, Bowers \u2014 again, according to his uncontradicted testimony \u2014 received a notice from \u201cthe State of Oregon\u201d informing him that he was a noncomplying employer. He telephoned SAIF on July 16 to inquire about the status of his coverage and was told, after a SAIF employee looked in employer\u2019s file and discovered that SAIF had cashed the $17 check and received his payroll records, \u2018You\u2019re reinstated immediately.\u201d SAIF sent employer a letter that same day, stating that its insurance \u201cwith SAIF Corporation was reinstated on the date indicated above [July 16, 2004]. Our records indicate that no coverage was in effect from April 16, 2004, through July 15, 2004.\u201d SAIF subsequently issued employer an insurance policy, using the same policy number that existed before the April 15, 2004, termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>On July 6, 2004, DCBS sent employer a final order assessing a $1,000 fine because employer neither had workers\u2019 compensation insurance nor was a self-insured employer between April 16 and July 16, 2004. Employer requested a hearing, contending that its status as a noncomplying employer ended before July 16 and that, even if it did not, employer nonetheless had coverage from SAIF from the time SAIF accepted employer\u2019s premium and payroll documents. The ALJ concluded that, between April 16 and July 16, no guaranty contract between SAIF and DCBS was on file with the director of DCBS as required by ORS 656.017(1), and that, for that reason, employer was out of compliance during that entire period.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See King v. Dept. of Ins. and Finance, </em>126 Or App 1, 5, 867 P2d 511, <em>rev den, </em>319 Or 149 (1994) (employer was noncomplying because it did not cause a guaranty contract to be filed with predecessor to DCBS). Employer does not seek judicial review of that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">However, the ALJ also concluded that, even though employer was noncomplying for the entire period, employer nonetheless had \u201ccoverage\u201d as of May 17, 2004. The ALJ relied on ORS 656.419(3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">\u201cWorkers\u2019 compensation is effective when the application of the subject employer for coverage together with any required fees or premium are received and accepted by an authorized representative of an insurer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The ALJ reasoned, \u201cSAIF acknowledged that it had both the premium payment and payroll report by May 17, 2004. SAIF \u2018accepted\u2019 those items when it negotiated the employer\u2019s check and credited its account.\u201d The ALJ further noted the uncontradicted testimony of SAIF\u2019s collections manager that SAIF can reinstate a lapsed policy based on its receipt of overdue premiums and documents, and that SAIF did so after employer\u2019s July 16 telephone call and some internal deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">On judicial review, SAIF assigns error to the ALJ\u2019s interpretation of ORS 656.419(3). According to SAIF, the statute establishes that coverage occurs only after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>insurer receives and accepts (1) an \u201capplication * * * for coverage\u201d and (2) \u201cany required fees or premiums.\u201d In the present case, SAIF argues, one of those essential prerequisites\u2014 acceptance of an application for coverage \u2014 did not occur. The unambiguous text of the statute, SAIF maintains, indicates that the \u201capplication\u201d and the fees or premiums are different items; if the fees or documents could by themselves constitute an application, then the phrase \u201capplication * * * together with any required fees or premium\u201d makes no sense. Regarding its employee\u2019s testimony that coverage can (and did, on July 16) occur without a formal application, SAIF appears to offer two explanations: first, SAIF argues that, regardless of the employee\u2019s testimony, SAIF does not have the authority to vary from the terms of ORS 656.419, which requires strict compliance; and second, somewhat inconsistently, SAIF argues that its employee testified only that SAIF has the <em>discretion </em>to establish coverage without a formal application and chose to do so on July 16 only after internal deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">We conclude that SAIF\u2019s reading of ORS 656.419(3) is unjustifiably crabbed. No statute or rule specifies what an employer must do to \u201capply\u201d for coverage or defines the term \u201capplication.\u201d In ordinary usage, an \u201capplication\u201d is \u201cthe act of applying,\u201d that is, an \u201cAPPEAL, REQUEST, PETITION,\u201d as in an application \u201cto an underwriter for insurance.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>105 (unabridged ed 2002). Nothing indicates that a specific writing is required, and, indeed, SAIF\u2019s act of conferring coverage on employer as of July 16, 2004, having received only a premium and payroll records, confirms that it shares that understanding. Nor does the phrase \u201capplication * * * together with any required fees or premium\u201d indicate, as SAIF contends, that the insurer cannot ever receive and accept an application and premium in the form of a single document. In the context of this case, that is what SAIF did. It is undisputed that, by the time SAIF accepted employer\u2019s premium, employer knew that its coverage was in jeopardy and SAIF knew that employer knew. When it received employer\u2019s premium and payroll records, SAIF must have regarded them as an application for coverage, and negotiating the check properly must be interpreted as accepting that application.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b56-9\"> The issue arose because one of employer\u2019s employees was injured at work on July 12, 2004, and SAIF denied coverage. The employee received compensation from another source and did not appeal the denial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b58-8\"> The ALJ\u2019s order is deemed to be the final order of the director of DCBS. ORS 656.740(5)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
