The court directed verdicts in defendants\u2019<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> favor on all claims. Plaintiff appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in excluding her scientific evidence of medical causation. <em>See State v. O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or 285, 899 P2d 663 (1995); <em>State v. Brown, </em>297 Or 404, 687 P2d 751 (1984). In addition, with respect to her informed consent and negligent spoliation claims, plaintiff asserts that the trial court erred in directing verdicts in defendants\u2019 favor on those claims and in excluding evidence pertaining to the spoliation claim. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\"> We review the exclusion of scientific evidence under <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key </em>for errors of law. <em>Jennings v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>331 Or 285, 301, 14 P3d 596 (2000). In reviewing the directed verdicts, \u201cwe view the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff and extend to [her] the benefit of every reasonable inference that could be drawn from the evidence.\u201d <em>Harris v.

Herbison, </em>57 Or App 496, 500, 645 P2d 563, <em>rev den, </em>293 Or 394 (1982). A directed verdict is appropriate only if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Lindstrand v. Transamerica Title Ins. Co., </em>127 Or App 693, 695, 874 P2d 82 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The following facts are uncontroverted unless otherwise noted. In March 2003, after plaintiff was involved in an auto accident, suffering a possible head injury, her doctor ordered an MRI. Plaintiff went to Tillamook County General Hospital and was escorted to an MRI trailer just outside. The MRI technologist, employed by Alliance, informed plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>that he would be injecting her with a contrast chemical, gadolinium, used to enhance the MRI image.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Alliance\u2019s MRI technologists are trained to advise patients that, if the injection of a contrast chemical causes pain or any other discomfort, they should immediately inform the technologist. If a patient makes such a complaint, the technologists are trained to check for extravasation. \u201cExtravasation\u201d occurs when a substance exits the vein and enters the surrounding tissue. <em>See Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary </em>635 (27th ed 2000) (defining \u201cextrav\u00e1sate\u201d as, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[t]o exude from or pass out of a vessel into the tissues\u201d). The general standard of care applicable to MRI technologists requires that they explain the procedure to the patient and ask the patient to inform them if they feel pain. However, neither plaintiffs technologist nor her treating physician explained the injection procedure, asked.her to report pain, or explained to her any risks associated with the injection.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">After attempting the injection on each of plaintiffs arms unsuccessfully, the technologist attempted to make the injection on the back of plaintiffs left hand. Immediately after the needle went into her hand, plaintiff complained that her hand felt \u201clike a glove filling up.\u201d She explained to the technologist that \u201cif he was to take the tip of my fingers off he would see the stuff running on the floor. That\u2019s how full it felt.\u201d The technologist acknowledged plaintiffs complaint but told her it would be okay and finished the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Plaintiff manages a restaurant. She normally performs various functions in the business, including food preparation, which involves going to the restaurant\u2019s walk-in refrigerator. The day after the MRI, however, when she went to the walk-in refrigerator she had a difficult time handling the cold food and complained that her left hand hurt. Her coworker described her hand as appearing purple, orange, and swollen. After a couple of hours, plaintiff went to the emergency room. She has experienced pain ever since, which has impaired her ability to work. Plaintiffs hand has remained discolored near where she received the gadolinium injection.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>The MRI technologist created an incident report the day after the MRI. The original report has not been located; however, plaintiff obtained a copy of that report that is incomplete. The bottom of the form states that the information continues on the next page, but the next page is missing. A blank copy of the form shows that the second page requests information about the technologist making the report and allows for additional comments. Neither the incident report nor any other records disclose the amount of contrast used in plaintiffs injection or whether her informed consent was obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Plaintiff filed this action against defendants. In her operative complaint, she alleged that defendants had negligently injured her and negligently failed to obtain her informed consent before injecting her with gadolinium. In addition, plaintiff alleged \u201cnegligent spoliation\u201d of evidence with regard to three classes of documents: documents indicating the specific chemicals and amounts ordered and used in the injection; the complete incident report filed after she complained of pain at the injection site; and documents recording the details of the MRI procedure, including a patient worksheet, screening form, and consent form for the procedure. Plaintiff alleged that defendants lost or destroyed each of those documents and that, due to their absence, \u201cplaintiff has suffered an impairment of her ability to prevail in this lawsuit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">As amplified below, at trial, the court excluded portions of the testimony of plaintiffs two expert witnesses, Dr. Weldon Williamson and Karen Marburger. Williamson, a medical doctor specializing in hand disorders, would have testified concerning medical causation. Marburger, an MRI technologist, would have testified that defendants should have made and kept various records and that, had plaintiff been able to obtain those records, they might have been beneficial in proving plaintiffs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">With respect to Williamson\u2019s testimony, the court held an OEC 104 hearing to determine whether Williamson\u2019s opinion regarding causation \u2014 specifically that gadolinium extravasation caused plaintiffs Raynaud\u2019s syndrome \u2014 was \u201cscientifically valid\u201d under the standards prescribed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number><em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key. </em>The court ultimately concluded that that testimony did not satisfy the requisites of foundational admissibility. The court excluded portions of Marburger\u2019s testimony as \u201cspeculative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Defendants moved for a directed verdict on plaintiffs medical negligence claim based on plaintiffs failure to produce evidence of causation. Plaintiff, while maintaining that the exclusion of Williamson\u2019s testimony was error, agreed that without that testimony, she had not produced evidence of causation. Defendants also moved for directed verdicts on plaintiffs informed consent and negligent spoliation claims. The court directed a verdict in defendants\u2019 favor on all three claims and entered judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Plaintiff appeals. She assigns error to the exclusion of Williamson\u2019s testimony regarding causation, to the exclusion of Marburger\u2019s testimony regarding her spoliation claim, and to the allowance of the directed verdicts on the informed consent and spoliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">In her first assignment of error, plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in excluding Williamson\u2019s testimony. As a preliminary matter, defendants argue that that assignment of error is not reviewable because plaintiff did not also assign error to the subsequent allowance of the directed verdict against the medical negligence claim. For purposes of our review in this context, that is a distinction without a difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Plaintiff, of course, vigorously disputed, and objected to, the court\u2019s exclusion of Williamson\u2019s testimony regarding the causation and permanency of her injury. Plaintiff candidly acknowledged that that evidence was essential to her medical negligence <em>claim </em>\u2014 i.e., without it, defendants would be entitled to a directed verdict on that claim. On appeal, plaintiff properly assigns error only to the evidentiary ruling. The failure to also assign error to the allowance of the directed verdict was not somehow preclusive; the latter was entirely derivative of the former. Indeed, given the court\u2019s predicate evidentiary ruling, the allowance of the directed verdict was not erroneous, because there was no evidence of medical causation before the jury. <em>See, e.g., Shockey v. City of Portland, </em>313 Or 414, 422-23, 423 n 6, 837 P2d 505 (1992) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>(\u201cIn determining whether the trial court erred in entering a directed verdict for [the] defendants, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party * * * and extend to that party the benefit of every reasonable inference that may be drawn from the evidence\u201d; \u201cevidence\u201d for purposes of that review is the evidence \u201cnot excluded\u201d by the trial court).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We proceed, then, to the merits of that assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">Williamson first examined plaintiff on September 15, 2003, approximately six months after the MRI. He is a vascular surgeon who is on the academic faculty at Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU). His research and teaching focus on vascular surgery and artery problems. He was a member of a team at OHSU that received funding from the National Institutes of Health to study the effects of various chemicals on blood vessels. That team has produced \u201c[t]he largest volume of research literally in the world * * * for arteries [and] problems in the fingers.\u201d Williamson himself has published approximately 30 articles and book chapters, several of which address vascular problems in the hands. At least one of his published works deals specifically with methods of diagnosing the \u201ccauses of vascular compromise in the hand and fingers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Williamson has done specific research on a condition known as \u201cRaynaud\u2019s syndrome,\u201d a \u201cvasospastic disorder.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Williamson explained a vasospasm as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>\u201cIf you can visualize an artery as just a regular tube, it\u2019s made up of muscle cells and other tissues, and an artery that is in a condition of vasospasm has clamped down, sometimes to the point where there\u2019s no blood flow going through it, at all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">With Raynaud\u2019s syndrome, the arteries experience a vasospasm, <em>i.e., </em>they \u201cclamp[] down abnormally in response to cold exposure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">When Williamson first met plaintiff, he performed a physical examination and took a case history, both of which were specific to his specialty and to her complaints. Plaintiff told Williamson that she had never had similar symptoms in the past, but that, instead, her symptoms began \u201cimmediately around the time that she received an MRI scan [when] an IV was placed in the back of her hand * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She described the sensation she felt when the gadolinium was injected into her hand. She also stated that her symptoms were limited to her left hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">As Williamson learned more about plaintiffs condition, he ordered blood tests and performed more detailed and specific diagnostic tests. He then attempted to rule out the various potential causes of plaintiffs symptoms. After collecting that information, Williamson diagnosed plaintiff with Raynaud\u2019s syndrome in the left hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Before allowing Williamson to state his ultimate opinion as to the <em>cause </em>of that condition, the trial court held an OEC 104 hearing outside the presence of the jury. During that hearing, Williamson testified to his opinion that (1) extravasation occurred during the injection of gadolinium; (2) that extravasation \u201cis connected to [the] vasospastic disorder in the digital arteries of [plaintiffs] left hand,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>that gadolinium extravasation caused plaintiffs onset of Raynaud\u2019s syndrome; and (3) plaintiffs condition is permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Williamson explained that his conclusion derived from a number of different factors. <em>First, </em>he considered the temporal relationship between plaintiffs symptoms and the injection of gadolinium. That is, plaintiffs symptoms began shortly after the injection, and Williamson considered that fact highly relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><em>Second, </em>Williamson considered the fact that plaintiffs symptoms arose in only her left hand. In Williamson\u2019s view, that fact was \u201cvery important\u201d because other known causes of Raynaud\u2019s syndrome would have affected both hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\"><em>Third, </em>Williamson reviewed \u201cevidence in peer review [ed] journals [indicating] that gadolinium and other related contrasts can be toxic to tissues when * * * presented to the tissues.\u201d Specifically, a study performed on mice showed that toxicity can occur when the substance is \u201coutside the blood vessel[,]\u201d as is the case with extravasation. Extravasation will result in the gadolinium \u201cremain [ing] in the body longer than usual * * * in that localized area\u201d and that \u201cthe duration of exposure of gadolinium to the tissues is proportional to the degree of toxicity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\"><em>Finally, </em>Williamson performed a differential diagnosis. Differential diagnosis, or \u201cdifferential etiology,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> involves a process of elimination. After examining plaintiff and conducting numerous tests, Williamson was unable \u201cto point to any other cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">After \u201cfactor [ing] in all of the research that\u2019s known about gadolinium and all that [he] know[s] using [his] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>scientific medical methodology for the diagnosis of the cause of digital artery disease,\u201d Williamson concluded that \u201cgadolinium was a substantial contributing factor in causing\u201d plaintiffs symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">As part of the offer of proof, Williamson also rendered the opinion that plaintiffs symptoms were permanent. He reached that conclusion by considering plaintiffs continued complaints of symptoms and a continuing \u201cdusky or slight discoloration of the fingers\u201d seen during subsequent visits. Williamson acknowledged that his opinion was based, to some extent, on plaintiffs subjective complaints, but maintained that his observations of visible discoloration were \u201csubtle objective findings\u201d that supported his opinion as to permanency.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">During the OEC 104 hearing, Williamson was subjected to extensive cross-examination. On cross-examination, Williamson admitted that there is no medical literature reporting a causal link between gadolinium extravasation and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In fact, Williamson admitted that no study had ever been done, either by him or anyone else, analyzing gadolinium extravasation and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. However, he explained that the two events occurring is so rare that it would be nearly impossible to conduct such a study.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Defense counsel also questioned Williamson about a study he had relied on in forming his opinion about the cause of plaintiffs injury and, particularly, the potential toxicity of extravasated gadolinium. In that study, researchers injected gadolinium into the hind legs of mice. The researchers found that such injections, at certain volumes, caused necrosis. \u201cNecrosis\u201d is the \u201c[p]athologic death of one or more cells, or of a portion of tissue or organ, resulting from irreversible dam<em>age[.]\u201d Stedman\u2019s </em>at 1185.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">On cross-examination, Williamson admitted that necrosis is a different condition than Raynaud\u2019s syndrome\u2014 and he did not posit any causal connection between necrosis and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. Further, Williamson acknowledged that, because of the weight difference between mice and humans, it is \u201cdifficult to have a complete extrapolation of the mice results to human beings.\u201d However, he qualified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>that admission by explaining that the study \u201cis most valuable, in that [it] show[s] some toxicity or level of toxicity of gadolinium that appears to be proportional to the time of exposure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">The court also questioned Williamson. Specifically, the court asked whether gadolinium extravasation was common, and, if so, why there are not more cases involving symptoms connected to it. Williamson explained that, although extravasation generally is not uncommon, extravasation in the back of the hand is. He theorized that, because the structure of the hand is smaller, injuries arising from extravasation in the hand would be more likely than injuries arising from extravasation in other parts of the body, for instance the upper arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Williamson acknowledged that the medical community does not fully understand the cause of Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. More specifically, on cross-examination, Williamson admitted that he could not explain the mechanism by which the gadolinium extravasation caused the syndrome to manifest in plaintiffs arteries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So [plaintiff] is the first patient that you\u2019ve treated in your practice that has, in your mind, had an extravasation that has caused Raynaud\u2019s syndrome?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">\u201c[WILLIAMSON]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: <em>You don\u2019t have an explanation regarding the mechanism of how an injection into a vein somehow caused a disease of the arteries, correct </em>?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-9\">\u201c[WILLIAMSON]: <em>Correct.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-10\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And, in fact, the cause of Raynaud\u2019s syndrome really has yet to be established by the medical community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-11\">\u201c[WILLIAMSON]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-12\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: It is still the subject of study.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-13\">\u201c[WILLIAMSON]: That\u2019s correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-14\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>At the end of the OEC 104 hearing, defendants objected to the admission of Williamson\u2019s testimony regarding causation and permanency. Specifically, with respect to causation, defendants contended that, because Williamson\u2019s causation theory \u2014 that gadolinium exposure (from extravasation or otherwise) causes Raynaud\u2019s syndrome \u2014 was not supported by any previous study and because Williamson himself could not explain the mechanism of causation, his opinion regarding causation should be excluded. With respect to permanency, defendants contended that, because Williamson\u2019s opinion on permanency was based, in part, on plaintiffs own complaints, that opinion should be excluded as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">The trial court agreed and excluded the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">\u201cUnder <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key </em>* * * when scientific evidence is offered!,] the party offering the evidence has the responsibility to establish that the evidence has a basis in science; in other words, does it possess a reliability in science or the reliability of science. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">\u201cNow, in this case, we\u2019re focusing on the methods used and applied by Dr. Williamson. I have no question about Dr. Williamson\u2019s credentials or his qualifications. I would find that he would be an expert in his field * * *. But I conclude [ ] * * * that the foundation was virtually nonexistent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">\u201c* * * [I]n <em>Jennings v. Baxter Healthcare[,] </em>there were just a number of factors in evidence about the way the expert had proceeded with his patient that persuaded the Supreme Court that that was sufficient to go to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">\u201cSo we\u2019re not focusing on the conclusions of Dr. Williamson, we\u2019re focusing on his methodology and the principles that he applied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\"><em>a* </em>\u2021 * * ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-10\">\u201c* * * [A]s I understood Dr. Williamson\u2019s testimony, it was essentially [that] he had treated the patient. This was his theory of what caused her complaints and this was his * * * explanation about why he thought the alleged damage was permanent. To me, that satisfied almost none * * * of the <em>Brown/OKey </em>factors, so I found that the testimony did not possess the necessary indicia of scientific validity, notwithstanding Dr. Williamson\u2019s impressive credentials.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the trial court correctly determined that Williamson\u2019s testimony regarding medical causation was not admissible under OEC 702. That rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-4\">\u201cIf scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">In <em>Brown, </em>the Supreme Court explained a court\u2019s role in determining whether scientific expert testimony is admissible. The court functions as a \u201cgatekeeper,\u201d determining what scientific evidence will be presented at trial. 297 Or at 438. The court does so, generally, in an OEC 104 hearing, by applying OEC 702 in conjunction with the rules governing relevance, including OEC 401<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and OEC 403.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 408; <em>see also O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or at 301 n 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">When deciding whether to admit scientific evidence, the relevant inquiry is whether the evidence is derived from \u201cscientifically valid\u201d principles. <em>O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or at 301 n 19 (\u201c [Scientific validity [is] the linchpin of admissibility [.]\u201d).

Thus, the inquiry addresses not only the abstract soundness of the methodology or reasoning employed, but also whether that reasoning or methodology was \u201cproperly * * * applied to the facts in issue.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">We proceed to the application of those principles to Williamson\u2019s putative testimony. Williamson\u2019s diagnosis involved two parts, only the second of which is at issue on appeal. First, Williamson diagnosed plaintiff with what he termed \u201cRaynaud\u2019s syndrome\u201d \u2014 and the trial court admitted his testimony as to that diagnosis. Second, Williamson determined that the cause of that condition was the extravasation of gadolinium into plaintiffs hand. The parties\u2019 dispute pertains solely to the scientific validity of that opinion concerning causation \u2014 specifically, Williamson\u2019s application of differential diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Differential diagnosis is a generally accepted method of medical inquiry. <em>See Jennings, </em>331 Or at 308. However, like other scientific methods, its \u201cuse\u201d must be proper. In the federal courts, \u201c[a] whole sub-body of [FRE 702] law has developed with respect to the reliability, and admissibility, of differential diagnosis.\u201d <em>Clausen v. M/V New Carissa, </em>339 F3d 1049, 1057 (9th Cir 2003). Those cases describe the process of differential diagnosis as one of \u201cruling in\u201d all potential causes of a particular injury and then systematically \u201cruling out\u201d all but one. <em>Id. </em>at 1058. If a scientific expert improperly \u201crules in\u201d a potential cause \u2014 that is, considers a potential cause that is not scientifically capable of causing the alleged injury \u2014 the expert\u2019s conclusion that that agent caused the injury is unreliable and not scientifically valid. <em>Id.; see also McClain v. Metabolife Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>401 F3d 1233, 1252 (11th Cir 2005) (\u201c[Differential diagnosis] may offer an important component of a valid methodology. This approach, however, will not usually overcome the fundamental failure of laying a scientific groundwork for the general toxicity of the drug and that it can cause the harm a plaintiff suffered.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">In determining the cause of plaintiffs condition, Williamson used differential diagnosis. In initially identifying the universe of potential causes, Williamson included a variety of causes recognized in the medical literature. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>addition, Williamson included gadolinium extravasation as a possible cause. Williamson then \u201cruled out\u201d all of the other potential causes he had initially identified; he was unable to \u201cpoint to any other cause.\u201d Consequently, he concluded that gadolinium extravasation was the medically probable cause of plaintiffs Raynaud\u2019s syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">In deciding to \u201crule in\u201d gadolinium extravasation, Williamson, as noted, relied on three considerations: (1) the temporal proximity of the injury and the extravasation; (2) the spacial proximity of the injury to the extravasation site; and (3) published medical literature concluding that gadolinium exposure is toxic, can cause necrosis, and becomes increasingly toxic as exposure time endures. Defendants contend that Williamson\u2019s inclusion of gadolinium extravasation in the universe of potential causes, and his ultimate identification of gadolinium extravasation as the medically probable cause of plaintiffs Raynaud\u2019s syndrome, did not comport with <em>Brown\u2019s </em>requirements \u2014 and, in fact, transcended <em>Jennings, </em>which defendants style as representing \u201cthe outer limits\u201d of the admissibility of \u201cscientific evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">In <em>Jennings, </em>a product liability case, the plaintiff alleged that she had experienced neurological disorders as a result of exposure to silicone leaking from a ruptured breast implant. 331 Or at 288. The plaintiff sought to introduce the testimony of an expert witness, Dr. Grimm, that her neurological symptoms were probably caused by silicone exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Testimony in the OEC 104 hearing established that, although no published study had ever linked silicone to the particular types of neurological problems that the plaintiff was experiencing, Grimm had personally conducted a study of approximately 50 women patients with breast implants who had experienced the same \u201cunique pattern\u201d of symptoms. <em>Id. </em>at 289-90. Based on his study, Grimm concluded that, although he did not \u201cunderstand * * * the mechanism [of causation] yet,\u201d it was medically probable that silicone, from the ruptured implants, had caused the patients\u2019 neurological symptoms. <em>Id. </em>at 291. With respect to the plaintiffs condition, Grimm employed differential diagnosis and, given the results of his patient study, \u201cruled in\u201d silicone exposure as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>a potential cause. Grimm then \u201cruled out\u201d other potential causes and concluded that the plaintiffs condition was probably caused by silicone. <em>Id. </em>at 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Following the OEC 104 hearing, the trial court excluded Grimm\u2019s testimony concerning causation. <em>See </em>331 Or at 294-98. The jury ultimately returned a verdict for the defendants. On appeal, we reversed, concluding that the trial court had erred in excluding Grimm\u2019s testimony on causation. <em>Jennings v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>152 Or App 421, 954 P2d 829 (1998). The Supreme Court agreed and affirmed our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The Supreme Court noted that Grimm had \u201celiminated other potential causes of [the] plaintiffs conditions through differential diagnosis, which is a generally accepted form of scientific inquiry.\u201d <em>Jennings, </em>331 Or at 308. With respect to Grimm\u2019s reliance on his experience with other patients, the Supreme Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">\u201cAny scientist can check Grimm\u2019s testing methods and the clinical history of each of his patients. Moreover, Grimm\u2019s results also can be tested (another neurologist could test women with silicone breast implants to see if they had the same neurological conditions identified by Grimm). * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">\u00ab\u2021 # % \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">\u201c* * * Grimm\u2019s hypothesis is based on his own experiences and observations, as well as on scientific methodology. It was tested by his evaluation of about 50 patients, most of whom exhibited \u2018unique\u2019 symptoms and conditions similar to those of plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 307-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">In sum, the Supreme Court analyzed Grimm\u2019s previous study and concluded that, because it validly linked silicone to a unique neurological disorder, he had a scientifically valid basis for linking plaintiffs symptoms with silicone. Essentially, Grimm properly \u201cruled in\u201d silicone as a potential cause of the plaintiffs injury.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>The Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Jennings </em>very substantially informs our consideration and disposition here. In assessing the admissibility of Williamson\u2019s testimony regarding causation, we note, at the outset, three salient features of his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><em>First, </em>Williamson did not purport to identify any scientifically demonstrable mechanism of causation \u2014 and, indeed, expressly acknowledged that he was unable to do so. In particular, Williamson did not identify any causal relationship between necrosis and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\"><em>Second, </em>Williamson acknowledged that plaintiffs case was singular \u2014 that is, literally unique in his experience. To Williamson\u2019s knowledge, there had never been any reported incidents of a person experiencing Raynaud\u2019s syndrome following extravasation of a contrast chemical. Nor could Williamson identify any arguably analogous case.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">That circumstance \u2014 that singularity \u2014 distinguishes this case from <em>Jennings. </em>There, the expert, Grimm, could not explain why or how silicone exposure could have caused the plaintiffs symptoms \u2014 -just as Williamson here could not explain why or how gadolinium extravasation could have caused plaintiffs Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. <em>See Jennings, </em>331 Or at 291 (quoting Grimm\u2019s testimony: \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is the mechanism yet. That, I\u2019m working on. I cannot say that I have got to that point in my work, that I understand the mechanism.\u201d). However, unlike in this case, in <em>Jennings, </em>Grimm was able to refer to roughly four dozen other cases of the \u201cunique pattern\u201d of women who had been exposed to silicone migration from ruptured breast implants experiencing neurological disorders. Such corroboration is completely absent in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number><em>Third, </em>as noted, the dispute here is not over the abstract validity of differential diagnosis as a scientifically valid methodology. Rather, defendants challenge Williamson\u2019s application of that methodology \u2014 and, particularly, Williamson\u2019s \u201cruling in\u201d of gadolinium extravasation as a possible cause of plaintiffs Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. The practical significance of that \u201cruling in\u201d was, of course, that once Williamson, by way of differential diagnosis, eliminated every other potential cause, gadolinium extravasation was, by default, the \u201clast cause standing\u201d \u2014 rendering it the \u201cmedically probable\u201d cause of plaintiffs condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">A simple hypothetical approximates defendants\u2019 challenge in its most basic form: A, who is experiencing migraine headaches, visits Dr. X, an expert on headaches. In attempting to diagnose the cause of A\u2019s headaches, X lists every known cause of migraines and also \u201crules in\u201d \u201cevil spirits.\u201d X then, by way of differential diagnosis, eliminates all the other causes and renders the opinion, \u201cIt must be the evil spirits.\u201d Notwithstanding X\u2019s expertise and ostensible use of differential diagnosis, that opinion would not meet the requirements of foundational admissibility. <em>See, e.g., Rosen v. Ciba-Geigy Corp., </em>78 F3d 316, 318 (7th Cir 1996) (in performing its \u201cgatekeeper\u201d function, the court must determine \u201cwhether the evidence is genuinely scientific, as distinct from being unscientific speculation offered by a genuine scientist\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Of course, Williamson\u2019s opinion in this case is not so crude. Nor is defendants\u2019 challenge so simple. A series of escalating hypothetical brings the inquiry into sharper relief:</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Case #1: B experiences numbness in her left hand immediately after applying lotion to her foot. Dr. Y renders the opinion, based solely on the temporal relationship, that the lotion must have caused the numbness. Y cannot explain why or how the lotion caused the numbness, and there are no reported cases of lotion causing numbness in hands or elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Case #2: The same facts as Case #1, except that B applied the lotion to her left hand immediately before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>onset of numbness in that hand. Ns opinion is based solely on the combination of temporal and spatial proximity.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Case #3: The same facts as Case #2, except that there is one reported study that, when applied to mice in large quantities, the lotion caused skin cancer. Ns opinion is based on the combination of temporal and spatial proximity and on the study involving the mice. Again, N cannot explain why or how the lotion could cause numbness and, specifically, N cannot explain why skin cancer, or the mechanisms of causation of skin cancer, are related to numbness in the hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The first case is, obviously, the easiest. Ns opinion is based on quintessential <em>\u201cpost hoc ergo propter hoc </em>(after this, therefore because of this)\u201d reasoning and, as such, would not be admissible as scientifically valid under OEC 104. As the Supreme Court explained in Jennings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">\u201c \u2018[S]ome children who live near power lines develop leukemia; but does exposure to electrical and magnetic fields cause this disease? The anecdotal evidence is not compelling because leukemia also occurs among children who have minimal exposure to such fields. It is necessary to compare disease rates among those who are exposed and those who are not. If exposure causes the disease, the rate should be higher among the exposed, lower among the unexposed.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">331 Or at 306 (quoting David H. Kaye and David A. Freedman, <em>Reference Guide on Statistics, </em>91, in <em>Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence </em>(Federal Judicial Ctr, ed 1994) (original footnote omitted; brackets in <em>Jennings))', see also Moore v. Ashland Chem. Inc., </em>151 F3d 269, 278 (5th Cir 1998) (\u201cIn the absence of an established scientific connection between exposure and illness, or [other] compelling circumstances * * * the temporal connection between exposure to chemicals and an onset of symptoms, standing alone, is entitled to little weight in determining causation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">The second case, although seemingly \u2014 and perhaps actually \u2014 more compelling, is similar to the first. Both involve after-the-fact attribution of causation based on unique factual circumstances that may, or may not, be coincidental. Again, in each case, there are no reported cases of anyone else ever experiencing numbness in the hand or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>elsewhere after applying the lotion to the hand or any other part of the body. It may very well be that a prudent person (or physician) might, \u201cto be on the safe side,\u201d stop using the lotion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But foundational scientific validity, as prescribed in <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key, </em>requires more.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">The third case approximates this case. It partakes not only of temporal and spatial proximity but also of proof that, sometimes, exposure to the substance involved can cause adverse effects. The difficulty, however, is that the adverse effect in nonhuman subjects is not only different from that experienced by the plaintiff, but also that the expert cannot identify any reason how or why that adverse effect could be related to causation of the plaintiffs condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Here, again, Williamson, although pointing to necrosis reported in the mouse study as evidence of the toxicity of gadolinium, could not explain why such toxicity should be causally related to the onset of Raynaud\u2019s syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\"> The question is not easy. Nevertheless we conclude that, even with full appreciation of Williamson\u2019s expertise, <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key </em>require more. Either the expert must be able to identify a scientifically demonstrable mechanism of causation or there must be some independent, verifiable corroboration of otherwise inexplicable causation, as in <em>Jennings. </em>Where, however, a plaintiffs circumstances are unique and the expert cannot proffer a mechanism of causation, general temporal and spatial proximity to the onset of symptoms, even when coupled with reports of other adverse effects, is insufficient.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The cases that plaintiff invokes are not to the contrary. For example, plaintiff points to <em>John\u2019s Heating Serv. v. Lamb, </em>46 P3d 1024 (Alaska 2002), where the court upheld the admission of an expert\u2019s testimony that the plaintiffs symptoms had been caused by exposure to carbon monoxide. There, the expert used differential diagnosis \u201cbolstered\u201d by a temporal relationship between exposure and the onset of symptoms. <em>Id. </em>at 1036. However, that case is distinguishable in that, although the court noted that temporal relationship, it also noted a variety of other considerations supporting the expert\u2019s opinion, including, significantly, published literature showing that the plaintiffs symptoms \u201ccorresponded] almost uniquely to carbon monoxide poisoning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In contrast, here there is no published literature substantiating that plaintiffs symptoms correspond \u2014 much less \u201calmost uniquely\u2019 \u2014 to gadolinium exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><em>Westberry v. Gislaved Gummi AB, </em>178 F3d 257 (4th Cir 1999), is similar. There, the court upheld the admission of scientific evidence based on the testifying expert\u2019s reliance on a strong temporal relationship and differential diagnosis. However, there, as in <em>John\u2019s Heating Serv., </em>there was no dispute that exposure to the toxin at issue was capable of causing the plaintiffs injury. <em>Id. </em>at 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">We appreciate plaintiffs assertion that \u201csomeone has to be the first\u201d and that she should not be unfairly disadvantaged merely because she was \u201cthe first.\u201d <em>Accord O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or at 293 n 9 (\u201c \u2018The chief difficulty with novelty as a limitation is * * * that it too strongly suggests a focus upon the subject matter of the testimony as opposed to the real matter of concern, the particular general propositions relied upon by the witness.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting John William Strong, <em>Language and Logic in Expert Testimony: Limiting Expert Testimony by Restrictions of Function, Reliability, and Form, </em>71 Or L Rev <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>349, 367 (1992)). But the legal deficiency in plaintiffs proof is not that she was \u201cthe first.\u201d Rather, plaintiffs proof of causation is legally deficient because (1) she is \u201cthe only\u201d\u2014 again, there are no (other) reported cases of Raynaud\u2019s syndrome allegedly related to extravasation of a contrast chemical \u2014 as that alleged phenomenon has not been replicated; and (2) Williamson, notwithstanding his manifest expertise, was unable to explain why or how plaintiffs condition could result from such exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">We thus conclude that the trial court properly excluded Williamson\u2019s testimony pertaining to causation of plaintiffs Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. By extension, the trial court correctly granted defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict against plaintiffs medical negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">We proceed to plaintiffs second assignment of error, which challenges the trial court\u2019s allowance of a directed verdict against plaintiffs informed consent claim. Plaintiff contends that \u201clawful consent for an invasive and potentially dangerous procedure, such as injection of a contrast chemical, cannot be obtained until the patient has been informed of the nature of the procedure, alternatives, if any, and the risks involved.\u201d As support for that proposition, plaintiff invokes ORS 677.097.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>The difficulty for plaintiff, however, is that mere failure to comply with ORS 677.097 is not, in and of itself, actionable. Even assuming, without deciding, that one or more of the defendants failed to comply with that statute, plaintiff must also prove that that failure \u201ccaused\u201d the alleged injury. <em>Arena v. Gingrich, </em>305 Or 1, 4, 748 P2d 547 (1988) (\u201cThe injury must have resulted from the wrongful conduct. The failure properly to obtain the patient\u2019s consent \u2018causes\u2019 the alleged harm if after a proper explanation the patient would not have consented to the procedure (unless, of course, the harm would have occurred without the procedure).\u201d). Here, plaintiff did not do so. Because she could not prove that the extravasation of gadolinium caused her Raynaud\u2019s syndrome, she cannot prove that she was injured as a result of the procedure \u2014 and, thus, that she was injured as the result of any failure to convey information relating to MRI procedures, and the injection of the contrast chemical particularly.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Plaintiffs third and fourth assignments of error challenge the allowance of the directed verdict against her claim for \u201cnegligent spoliation of evidence\u201d and the trial court\u2019s exclusion of certain portions of Marburger\u2019s testimony pertaining to that claim. Marburger, an MRI technologist, testified that the standard of care for MRI technologists requires the technologist to record what contrast is injected, the amount, the location of the injection, and any problems encountered or complaints made by the patient. After reviewing the documents that were a part of the case, Marburger testified that that information was not on record.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Marburger also noted the incomplete incident report on file. When plaintiffs counsel asked Marburger \u201cwhat sort of damaging information might have been on the second page\u201d of the report, defendants objected on grounds that that testimony would assume facts not in evidence and would be speculative. The court sustained that objection, which is the subject of the fourth assignment of error. In an offer of proof, plaintiff\u2019s counsel explained that Marburger would have testified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">\u201cif those documents had been produced and they contained information indicating that the standard of care was not followed, that there was a complaint by the patient at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>of the injection consistent with an extravasation, that that would have been helpful to her in forming her opinions on the standard of care, and that the absence of those entries and those records for her to review has impaired her ability to form opinions on the nature and extent of negligence of the defendant, and that is what she would have testified.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">The parties vehemently dispute whether, or to what extent, a claim for \u201cnegligent spoliation\u201d of evidence is cognizable under Oregon law. <em>Compare Boden v. Ford Motor Co., </em>86 Or App 465, 739 P2d 1067 (1987) (reversing ORCP 21 A(8) dismissal of claim for economic damages, for diminished value of product liability claim, resulting from third party\u2019s negligent destruction/\u201cspoliation\u201d of allegedly defective part; concluding that such a claim was cognizable under the foreseeability principles of <em>Fazzolari v. Portland School Dist. No. 1J, </em>303 Or 1, 734 P2d 1326 (1987)) <em>with Simpkins v. Connor, </em>210 Or App 224, 150 P3d 417 (2006) (disavowing Boden\u2019s foreseeability-based analysis as a basis for recovery of purely economic damages but reversing ORCP 21 A(8) dismissal of the plaintiffs claim that, because of the defendant\u2019s negligence in failing to timely produce certain medical records, violating a statutory duty prescribed under <em>former </em>ORS 192.525(2), the plaintiff was deprived of the ability to pursue a medical malpractice or wrongful death claim against the defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">We need not, and do not, address the precise contours of a cognizable claim for \u201cnegligent spoliation\u201d under Oregon law. That is so because plaintiff here failed to make a <em>prima facie </em>showing that defendants\u2019 alleged failure to maintain or produce the allegedly \u201cmissing\u201d records materially impaired her prosecution of her medical negligence and informed consent claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Plaintiffs \u201cnegligent spoliation\u201d claim is akin to a legal malpractice claim in that \u201cdamages arise from the loss\u201d \u2014 or diminution of value \u201cof an underlying claim.\u201d <em>Simpkins, </em>210 Or App at 230. As explained above, plaintiffs primary medical negligence and informed consent claims ultimately failed for lack of proof of scientific/medical causation. Plaintiff argues that, if the allegedly absent records had been created or maintained and produced, Williamson might have been provided with the \u201cmissing link\u201d that would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>enabled him to identify and persuasively explain the causal relationship between gadolinium extravasation and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. Specifically, plaintiff points to the fact that no records reflect <em>the amount of gadolinium </em>used during the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Plaintiffs claim in that regard fails because Williamson never testified that the amount of gadolinium injected was, or would have been, material to his opinion regarding causation. To the contrary, when cross-examined specifically about the amount used in humans (as compared to the amounts injected in mice), Williamson responded that the amounts of gadolinium discussed in the literature were not material to his opinion. Rather, his theory of causation depended on the duration of time that tissue is exposed to that substance. <em>See </em>215 Or App at 177. In sum, nothing in Williamson\u2019s testimony or in plaintiffs case-in-chief established any need to know of the amount of gadolinium injected into plaintiffs hand. Accordingly, on this record, there is no evidence that plaintiffs prosecution of her primary claims was materially impaired by the absence of such information \u2014 whether because of affirmative \u201cspoliation\u201d or by any negligent failure to create, maintain, or produce records pertaining to the MRI procedure.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Finally, we reject plaintiffs assignment of error pertaining to exclusion of certain portions of Marburger\u2019s putative testimony. As noted, the excluded testimony pertained to the absence of information in the medical records that may have been material to breach of the standard of care in injecting the gadolinium and informed consent. <em>See </em>215 Or App at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>190-91. Given plaintiff\u2019s failure of proof as to medical causation, any \u201cnegligent spoliation\u201d of documents as to those matters did not, ultimately, materially impair plaintiffs prosecution of her medical negligence and informed consent claims. Consequently, the exclusion of Marburger\u2019s putative testimony was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-7\"> The defendants in this case are Adventist Health System/West, Northwest Medical Foundation of Tillamook, dba Tillamook County General Hospital, Alliance Imaging, Inc., Alliance Imaging Management, Inc., and Alliance Imaging Centers, Inc.

I respectfully disagree with that conclusion. Although the question is close, I believe that the evidence was admissible and that the trial court erred in excluding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Plaintiffs expert, Dr. Williamson, diagnosed plaintiff as suffering from Raynaud\u2019s syndrome in her left hand. Raynaud\u2019s syndrome is a condition in which arteries in the hand become unduly constricted when the hand is exposed to cold. There is no dispute that plaintiff established an adequate foundation for Williamson to testify that plaintiff suffers from that condition. The dispute concerns the adequacy of the foundation for Williamson to give his opinion about the cause of the condition in plaintiffs left hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Williamson testified that, in his opinion, an extravasation of gadolinium that occurred in plaintiffs left hand during an MRI that she received from defendants was a substantial causal factor in her development of Raynaud\u2019s syndrome in her left hand. He identified a number of factors that led him to that conclusion. They were, <em>first, </em>the temporal relationship between the extravasation of gadolinium and the development of Raynaud\u2019s syndrome in plaintiffs left hand; <em>second, </em>that plaintiff had Raynaud\u2019s syndrome in only her left hand when most conditions associated with the development of the syndrome cause people to have the syndrome in both hands; <em>third, </em>that gadolinium was shown in a study involving mice to be toxic to tissue, that is, to kill tissue, when exposed to tissue outside of blood vessels; and, <em>fourth, </em>that tests and studies involving plaintiff had led him to rule out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>all known conditions associated with the development of Raynaud\u2019s syndrome in people.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">It is important to note, as well, that Williamson is a well-regarded member of a medical research team at Oregon Health and Science University that may be the most experienced and knowledgeable team in the world about Raynaud\u2019s syndrome and other vasospastic disorders. As a member of that team, he applied scientific knowledge and techniques to reach a scientific conclusion about the causal contribution of the extravasation of gadolinium in plaintiffs left hand to the development of Raynaud\u2019s syndrome in that hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Nevertheless, the majority concludes that the trial court properly excluded Williamson\u2019s testimony about the scientific conclusion that he had reached about the cause of plaintiffs condition because his testimony failed to meet the standard established in <em>State v. Brown, </em>297 Or 404, 687 P2d 751 (1984), and <em>State v. O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or 285, 899 P2d 663 (1995), for the admission of scientific evidence. That standard requires a court to determine whether proffered scientific evidence is based on \"scientifically valid\u201d principles, that is, whether the evidence is legitimately scientific, and to exclude evidence that lacks such a basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">In reaching its conclusion, the majority principally relies on distinctions that it sees between the excluded evidence in this case and the scientific evidence that the Oregon Supreme Court held to be admissible in <em>Jennings v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>331 Or 285, 14 P3d 596 (2000). With respect, the distinctions that the majority sees are not scientifically significant distinctions. Moreover, the majority\u2019s focus loses sight of the core feature of science, which is falsifiability. Both the excluded evidence in this case and the evidence that the court held admissible in <em>Jennings </em>involve scientific conclusions that can be shown to be false using recognized scientific techniques. The evidence in both cases is equally scientific.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The core distinction \u2014 in fact, the only distinction\u2014 that the majority sees between the evidence in this case and the evidence in <em>Jennings </em>is the basis on which the two experts placed a disputed causal factor into their differential diagnoses of the plaintiffs\u2019 conditions. The condition in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number><em>Jennings </em>was said to be a unique combination of neurological problems involving the inner ear and a loss of sensation in fingers and toes. The plaintiffs expert in <em>Jennings, </em>Dr. Grimm, put silicone breast implants into his differential diagnosis as a potential cause of that condition. He did so based on the fact that he had found the same condition in 43 women whom he had examined in his practice who had had silicone breast implants. In other words, he included silicone breast implants in his differential diagnosis as a cause of plaintiffs condition on the basis of 43 cases. Here, in contrast, Williamson put gadolinium extravasation into his differential diagnosis as a cause of Raynaud\u2019s syndrome in plaintiffs left hand on the basis of one case, plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">In the majority\u2019s view, approximately 50 cases in which Grimm found a \u201cunique pattern\u201d of neurological conditions in women with silicone breast implants made it scientifically appropriate for Grimm to include silicone breast implants in his differential diagnosis as a cause of the condition. Because Williamson had only a single case of a person with Raynaud\u2019s syndrome that arose in a hand soon after the person had experienced an episode of gadolinium extravasation in the hand, the majority reasons that it was not scientifically appropriate for Williamson to include gadolinium extravasation in his differential diagnosis as a cause of the condition. While the difference in number, 43 cases versus one, seems intuitively significant, it is not scientifically significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">As the court recognized in <em>Jennings, </em>case reports can play an important role in establishing a cause of a condition, but they must be used with caution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">\u201cAn opinion [on causation] drawn from only case reports can be troublesome, because it involves <em>post hoc, ergo propter hoc </em>(after this, therefore because of this) reasoning:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">\u201c \u2018[S]ome children who live near power lines develop leukemia; but does exposure to electrical and magnetic fields cause this disease? The anecdotal evidence is not compelling because leukemia also occurs among children who have minimal exposure to such fields. It is necessary to compare disease rates among those who are exposed and those who are not. If exposure causes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>disease, [then] the rate should be higher among the exposed, lower among the unexposed.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">331 Or at 306 (citation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">\u201c \u2018However, <em>case reports are often all that is available on a particular subject </em>because they usually do not require substantial, if any, funding to accomplish, and human exposure may be rare and difficult to study. Causal attribution based on case studies must be regarded with caution. However, such studies may be carefully considered in light of other information available, including toxicological data.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-6\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted; emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The <em>Jennings </em>court ultimately concluded that Grimm\u2019s reliance on case reports to put silicone breast implants into his differential diagnosis as a cause of the plaintiffs condition was acceptable because the hypothesis that he derived from the reports could be shown to be false:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">\u201cAny scientist can check Grimm\u2019s testing methods and the clinical history of each of his patients [to determine whether they had the neurological conditions that Grimm identified and had had silicone breast implants]. Moreover, Grimm\u2019s results also can be tested (another neurologist could test women with silicone breast implants to see if they had the same neurological conditions identified by Grimm). Grimm\u2019s hypothesis is capable of being falsified; that is, evidence may be introduced to disprove his hypothesis. <em>See O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or at 303 (science is based on testing hypotheses to see if they can be falsified).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">The same scientific principles apply to Williamson\u2019s reliance on a case report to put gadolinium extravasation into his differential diagnosis as a cause of plaintiffs condition. Scientists can check Williamson\u2019s testing methods and plaintiffs clinical history to determine whether plaintiff suffers from Raynaud\u2019s syndrome in only her left hand and whether the condition arose soon after the gadolinium extravasation episode. In fact, on cross-examination during the OEC 104 hearing in this case, one of the defendants sought to establish that plaintiff suffered restricted blood flow in arteries in both of her hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Williamson\u2019s hypothesis also can be falsified by evidence about the physiological processes by which arteries in the hand constrict or go into vasospasm. According to the record, there currently are various hypotheses about why arteries constrict in the manner that causes Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. One hypothesis is \u201cthat there is some type of malfunction within the vessel or the vessel wall\u201d of the arteries that causes them to constrict. Another is that interference with the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves in the hand can cause or contribute to the constriction seen in Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. If evidence is developed that establishes that the first hypothesis is correct and the second is not, then that evidence presumably would undermine if not render false the hypothesis that led Williamson to put gadolinium extravasation into his differential diagnosis, because it relied on a study involving the death of tissue <em>outside </em>the walls of blood vessels from gadolinium that had been placed outside the vessels. In fact, one of the defendants sought on cross-examination to get Williamson to agree that nerve impairment was no longer considered to be a cause of the type of vasospasm seen in Raynaud\u2019s syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Although it may be less likely that epidemiological evidence could be developed to disprove the hypothesis in this case than it could to disprove the one in <em>Jennings, </em>that should not make a difference to the admissibility of the evidence. Grimm\u2019s hypothesis was new and untested, which means that there were no extant epidemiological studies or evidence on the causal relationship between silicone breast implants and the neurological conditions that Grimm had identified. Epidemiological evidence could, in theory, be developed to disprove the hypotheses in both cases, which means that the hypotheses meet the \u201cfalsifiability\u2019 standard that scientific evidence must meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">As I noted at the outset, and as the majority recognizes, the admissibility question in this case is close. I believe, however, that we must err in favor of admitting scientific evidence that meets the criterion that the relevant scientific community would consider to be valid evidence. I am confident that the disputed scientific evidence in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>meets that standard and that the trial court erred in excluding it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Because of my conclusion about the admissibility of Williamson\u2019s opinion about the causal contribution of the gadolinium extravasation episode to the development of Raynaud\u2019s syndrome in plaintiffs left hand, I also disagree with the majoritys decision to affirm the grant of a directed verdict on plaintiffs informed consent claim. I believe that it should be reversed as well. I agree, however, with the majoritys disposition of the remaining assignments of error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-5\"> The majority contends that I fail to recognize that <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key </em>require more than abstract falsifiability in order to satisfy the foundation for admission of scientific evidence. 215 Or App at 189 n 12. The majority misunderstands my position. A court properly can reject a scientific hypothesis that has been established to be false, <em>e.g., </em>that the sun and planets revolve around the earth. However, a court should not reject a hypothesis of a preeminent medical expert that is based on recognized scientific techniques, that is not inconsistent with current scientific knowledge, and that can be falsified. Williamson\u2019s opinion about the cause of Kaynaud\u2019s syndrome in plaintiff\u2019s left hand is such a hypothesis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
