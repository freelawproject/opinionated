ORS 138.060(l)(c). The trial court concluded that defendant was stopped without reasonable suspicion when an officer approached the parked vehicle in which defendant was sitting and asked him if he had been drinking. The trial court also concluded that defendant was arrested without probable cause when the officer left defendant with another officer while he interviewed a witness. We disagree and, consequently, reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">We recite the facts as presented at the hearing on the motion to suppress. An unidentified caller contacted the police to report a possible drunk driver at a 7-Eleven store. Officer James Nett responded to the 7-Eleven, where he saw the vehicle the caller had described parked in front of the store. Defendant was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat with the engine running and the window down. Nett approached and asked defendant if he was okay. Defendant was eating a chili cheese hot dog, and Nett could smell the odor of an alcoholic beverage on defendant\u2019s breath over the smell of the chili cheese hot dog. Nett also noticed that defendant\u2019s eyes were watery and bloodshot and that defendant seemed unaware that he had spilled melted cheese on himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Nett then asked defendant \u201cif he had been drinking.\u201d Nett testified that defendant responded that he had had two beers; defendant testified that he denied having had anything to drink.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When Nett asked how he had gotten to the 7-Eleven, defendant claimed that his cousin had driven him and then left the area. Nett testified that defendant asked if he could get out of the vehicle and wait for his cousin; defendant testified that Nett asked him to get out of the vehicle and to leave his keys inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">After defendant was out of the vehicle, Nett\u2019s fellow officer, Clary, stayed with defendant while Nett went inside to speak to the store clerk. The clerk told Nett that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>watched defendant get out of the driver\u2019s side door and enter the 7-Eleven, where he stumbled as he walked around. The clerk also told Nett that he could smell the odor of alcohol on defendant\u2019s breath when he paid for the chili cheese dogs and that he would not have sold defendant any alcohol had he tried to purchase it. While Nett was inside gathering this information, defendant stood \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d on the pavement near the car with Clary and asked whether the cowboy boots defendant was wearing might affect his ability to \u201cwalk a straight line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">Based on his own observations and the clerk\u2019s statements, when Nett left the 7-Eleven, he asked defendant to perform a field sobriety test. Defendant initially expressed confusion at having to perform the test. When Nett explained that there had been a complaint about his driving, defendant refused to perform the test. Nett then read him the field sobriety test warning explaining that the test was purely physical, and defendant agreed to be tested. Following the administration of the tests, Nett cited defendant for driving under the influence of intoxicants in violation of ORS 813.010 (2005), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2007, ch 879, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to Nett\u2019s interactions with defendant. After a hearing on the motion, the trial court concluded that Nett had stopped defendant in violation of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution when he approached the vehicle in which defendant was sitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The state sought reconsideration, which the trial court granted. After hearing further evidence and reviewing additional authority, the trial court acknowledged that Nett\u2019s merely approaching defendant\u2019s vehicle did not constitute a stop, but concluded that Nett lacked reasonable suspicion when he asked defendant whether he had been drinking and that asking that question effected a stop. Although the trial court did not resolve the exact circumstances of defendant\u2019s exit from the vehicle,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it concluded that Nett arrested defendant when he left defendant with Clary outside the store. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>According to the trial court, at that point, Nett \u201creally had no evidence whatsoever to establish * * * objective probable cause for the arrest.\u201d On appeal, the state argues that the trial court erred by concluding that Nett stopped defendant when he asked him whether he had been drinking and further by concluding that defendant had been arrested when he was left with Cleary.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"> Under Oregon law, there are three general levels of encounters between police and citizens: a police-citizen encounter without any restraint of liberty (\u201cmere conversation\u201d); an encounter in which the officer temporarily restrains a person\u2019s liberty (a \u201cstop\u201d); and an encounter in which the officer either places a person under actual or constructive restraint or takes a person into custody for the purpose of charging that person with an offense (an \u201carrest\u201d). <em>State v. Holmes, </em>311 Or 400, 407, 813 P2d 28 (1991); <em>see also </em>ORS 133.005(1) (defining \u201carrest\u201d); ORS 131.605(6) (defining \u201cstop\u201d). Although an officer needs no justification for engaging in mere conversation with a citizen, he must have a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity for a stop and probable cause to believe that the person committed a crime for an arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">We first consider whether Nett asking defendant whether he had had anything to drink was constitutionally permissible. The trial court concluded that, by asking that question, Nett stopped defendant. We need not decide whether the question constituted mere conversation or a stop, because, in all events, we conclude that a stop would have been justified at that point by reasonable suspicion. First, Nett\u2019s observation of defendant\u2019s bloodshot, watery eyes, defendant\u2019s inattentive and messy eating, and the odor of alcohol on defendant\u2019s breath were objective facts that permitted Nett to reasonably suspect that defendant was under the influence of intoxicants. <em>See, e.g., State v. Berg, </em>140 Or App 388, 391, 914 P2d 1110 (1996) (bloodshot eyes and odor of alcohol on a driver\u2019s breath created reasonable suspicion); <em>State v. Liebrecht, </em>120 Or App 617, 618, 853 P2d 1322, <em>rev den, </em>317 Or 584 (1993) (odor of alcohol emanating from the vehicle and a driver\u2019s admission that he had been drinking created reasonable suspicion); <em>State v. Kolendar, </em>100 Or App 319, 322-23, 323 n 1, 786 P2d 199, <em>rev den, </em>309 Or 698 (1990) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>(\u201cThe odor of alcohol on a person\u2019s breath is an objective, observable fact that permits an officer reasonably to suspect intoxication.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Second, Nett had reason to suspect that defendant had been driving. When Nett arrived at the 7-Eleven, he found defendant sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a vehicle with the engine running. Those are \u201cspecific and articulable facts [that] give rise to the inference\u201d that defendant had been driving. <em>State v. Valdez, </em>277 Or 621, 626, 561 P2d 1006 (1977) (quotation marks and citation omitted). We conclude that, when Nett asked defendant whether he had been drinking, Nett reasonably suspected that defendant had been engaged in the criminal activity of driving under the influence of intoxicants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That reasonable suspicion would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>have permitted Nett to stop defendant without violating Article I, section 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"> We next consider whether defendant was \u201carrested\u201d when Nett left him with Clary while Nett entered the 7-Eleven to talk to the clerk. The trial court so concluded based on Nett\u2019s testimony that defendant was not free to go at that time, and on defendant\u2019s testimony that he believed that he was not free to go (even though he testified that he had no intention of going anywhere because he was waiting for his cousin to return). Although the record supports those findings, \u201c[t]he fact that an individual who is subject to a stop is not free to go does not transform a stop into an arrest.\u201d <em>State v. Bush, </em>203 Or App 605, 609, 126 P3d 705 (2006) (citing ORS 131.605(6)\u2019s definition of a stop as a \u201ctemporary restraint of a person\u2019s liberty\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Moreover, Nett\u2019s conduct in leaving defendant with another officer to further investigate whether a crime has occurred is fully consistent with a routine and lawful stop. There is no evidence in the record that defendant was detained for an unreasonable amount of time, that the officers used unreasonable force, or that the officers\u2019 conduct or attitudes were in any way oppressive or coercive. <em>Id. </em>Nett did not use any restraints or confine defendant in the back of his patrol car; he simply left defendant to stand \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d on the pavement near the car with Clary. <em>Id. </em>Defendant was comfortable enough with Clary to ask him whether the cowboy boots defendant was wearing would affect the field sobriety test. In sum, defendant was subject only to a \u201ctemporary restraint on [his] liberty\u201d supported by Nett\u2019s reasonable suspicion that defendant had been driving while under the influence of intoxicants. ORS 131.605(6). He was not subject to \u201cactual or constructive restraint\u201d or \u201c[taken] into custody for the purpose of charging [him] with an offense.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ORS 133.005(1). The trial court erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Defendant also contends that Nett\u2019s conduct ran afoul of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution because he stopped defendant without reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct. We reject defendant\u2019s federal constitutional arguments for the same reasons we reject his Oregon constitutional arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-8\"> At the hearing on his motion to suppress, defendant admitted under cross-examination that he had consumed a \u201ccouple\u201d of \u201c[p]ounder[ ]\u201d beers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b315-7\"> The trial court declined to make this finding because \u201cthe stop had already occurred at that point.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b317-4\"> Defendant argues that the record is not clear as to whether Nett smelled the odor of alcohol before he asked defendant about drinking and that, because the trial court concluded that Nett lacked reasonable suspicion, we must presume that Nett smelled alcohol only after he asked the question. However, before we will presume a fact not specifically found by the trial court there must be evidence in the record to support it. Here, there is not. During his direct examination, Nett described the sequence of events leading up to his asking defendant that question.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">\u201cA. The window was all the way down. And [defendant] appeared to be eating the remains of some sort of 7-Eleven cheese hot dog * * *. There was melted cheese on [defendant\u2019s] right chest and shoulder area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">\u201cI asked [defendant] if he was okay. I noticed that the vehicle was running, and he was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat. I noticed that his eyes were watery and bloodshot. And I could smell the odor of an alcoholic beverage on [his] breath over the smell of the hot dog that he had just finished eating.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">\u201cQ. Okay. And what did he respond when you asked him that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">\u201cA. Oh, I asked him if he had been drinking. He stated that he had two beers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfI\">Defendant similarly testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">\u201cQ. [When you were about halfway done with the second hot dog,] what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-10\">\u201cA. I noticed [Nett] was at the window and said how are you doing tonight. I said fine and went back to eating, taking another bite of my hot dog. He said had you had anything to drink. I told him no.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">The only reasonable inference based on that evidence is that Nett detected the odor of alcohol on defendant\u2019s breath during his initial exchange with defendant, <em>before </em>he asked defendant if he had been drinking. We find no evidence in the record to support the inference that Nett detected the odor of alcohol only <em>after </em>asking the question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b317-12\"><em> </em>The trial court declined to \u201crely at all on the informant\u2019s information [of a possible drunk driver] because the state is unable to produce any of the evidence that is required for us to be considering the informant\u2019s call as a basis for the reasonable suspicion necessary for the officer to conduct stop.\u201d The state does not challenge that ruling on appeal, and we therefore do not consider the informant\u2019s information when analyzing whether Nett had reasonable suspicion. Nevertheless, we note that, under certain circumstances, an anonymous tip can support and even create <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>reasonable suspicion. <em>See, e.g., State v. Cook, </em>163 Or App 24, 31, 986 P2d 1228 (1999), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>332 Or 601, 34 P3d 156 (2001) (an anonymous tip, when coupled with defendant\u2019s conduct at and proximity to the scene, created reasonable suspicion); <em>State v. Kosta, </em>75 Or App 713, 718, 708 P2d 365 (1985), <em>aff'd, </em>304 Or 549, 748 P2d 72 (1987) (anonymous telephone calls contained sufficient information to provide the police with reasonable suspicion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b318-10\"> Because we conclude that Nett had reasonable suspicion \u2014 all that was required to stop defendant \u2014 we do not address whether Nett also had probable cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
