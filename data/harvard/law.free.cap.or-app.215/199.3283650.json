J.</author>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">Defendant appeals his convictions for multiple felony sex offenses. He assigns error to (1) the denial of his motion for mistrial, (2) the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury that it could convict as to each of the charges only upon a unanimous verdict, and (3) the imposition of consecutive sentences based on judicial findings. We reject the first assignment of error without discussion and the third assignment of error based on the reasoning of <em>State v. Tanner, </em>210 Or App 70, 150 P3d 31 (2006). For the reasons that follow, we also reject defendant\u2019s asserted entitlement to a jury unanimity instruction. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution provides, in part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">\u201cin the circuit court ten members of the jury may render a verdict of guilty or not guilty, save and except a verdict of guilty of first degree murder, which shall be found only by unanimous verdict, and not otherwise [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Notwithstanding that provision, defendant requested that the jury be instructed as follows: \u201cThis being a criminal case, each and every juror must agree on your verdict.\u201d Defendant argued, generally, that that instruction comported with\u2014 and, indeed, was compelled by \u2014 the following observation in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 301, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">\u201cThis rule reflects two longstanding tenets of common-law criminal jurisprudence: that the \u2018truth of every accusation\u2019 against a defendant \u2018should afterwards be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of his equals and neighbours,\u2019 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 343 (1769) * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">The trial court rejected the proposed instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-11\">\u2018Yes, I can\u2019t give that. That wouldn\u2019t comply with Oregon law so I\u2019m not going to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-12\">\u2021 \u2021 \u2021 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: I don\u2019t think <em>Blakely </em>actually speaks to <em>this </em>\u2014 Blakely wasn\u2019t really a decision that was addressing that special issue. It was addressing, of course, whether or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>not a jury should weigh in on factors that related to enhancements of sentencing. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-4\">* Ht * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: * * * [That statement] is in a sense a form of dicta. In other words, the issue of whether 12 are required in every case was not squarely before the court. And this was a sentence with which I\u2019m familiar because, of course, I\u2019m familiar with <em>Blakely </em>* * * but [it\u2019s] in the context [of] an entirely different issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">\u201cI don\u2019t read this as a decision by the United States Supreme Court that every state must have * * * unanimous verdicts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">On appeal, defendant reiterates his \u201cjury unanimity\u2019 contention. Necessarily implicit in defendant\u2019s argument is the premise that the Court\u2019s observation in <em>Blakely </em>had the effect of overruling <em>Apodaca v. Oregon, </em>406 US 404, 92 S Ct 1628, 32 L Ed 2d 184 (1972). In <em>Apodaca, </em>the Court held that the permissibility of less-than-unanimous jury verdicts under Article I, section 11, did not violate the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Apodaca, </em>406 US at 407-14.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Nothing in <em>Blakely </em>purports to overrule Apodaca; indeed, <em>Blakely </em>does not include any reference to <em>Apodaca. </em>Rather, as the trial court correctly observed, jury unanimity \u2014 or the lack thereof \u2014 was immaterial to the analysis in <em>Blakely, </em>and its antecedent, <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 US 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000), which both addressed the constitutionally prescribed role of the jury, as opposed to the court, in determining facts material to the imposition of criminal sentences. <em>Cf. State v. Caples, </em>938 So 2d 147, 157 (La App 1 Cir 2006) (rejecting similar challenge to Louisiana\u2019s constitutional and statutory provisions permitting less-than-unanimous criminal verdicts). The trial court properly refused to give the proposed instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-10\"> Very recently, in <em>State v. Miller, </em>214 Or App 494, 166 P3d 591 (2007), we rejected an unpreserved challenge identical to defendant\u2019s, concluding that, given <em>Apodaca, </em>the failure to give a \u201cunanimous verdict\u201d instruction was, at the very least, not error apparent on the face of the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
