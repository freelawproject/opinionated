Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The underlying circumstances in this payment dispute are arcane, and a detailed recitation of those circumstances would not benefit the bench, bar, or public. It suffices to say that, before the ALJ, petitioner contended that respondent was required to pay petitioner for the medications dispensed by Fred Meyer because petitioner was a \u201c[mjedical [p]rovider\u201d within the meaning of OAR 436-010-0005(29) or an \u201cagent\u201d of such a provider. The ALJ rejected those contentions. On judicial review, petitioner does not dispute that determination; rather, petitioner contends that, even if it was not a \u201cmedical provider\u201d or an \u201cagent\u201d of Fred Meyer, it was an \u201cassignee\u201d of Fred Meyer\u2019s right to payment and, as such, was entitled to be paid by respondent. Petitioner acknowledges that, to prevail on judicial review, it must prevail on that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Respondent counters, and we agree, that that contention was not raised and preserved for the ALJ\u2019s consideration. Arguing that one is entitled to payment as an \u201cagent\u201d is qualitatively different from arguing an entitlement to payment as an \u201cassignee.\u201d Nor did petitioner\u2019s contentions as to the former reasonably alert the ALJ that petitioner was, alternatively, asserting the latter. In sum, petitioner failed to preserve a contention that is essential to its success on judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-8\"> Although there are several party respondents in this matter, \u201crespondent\u201d in the balance of this opinion refers solely to Liberty Northwest.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
