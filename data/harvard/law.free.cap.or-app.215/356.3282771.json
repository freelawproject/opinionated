After the board issued its order, we decided <em>Karjalainen v. Curtis Johnston &amp; Pennywise, Inc., </em>208 Or App 674, 685, 146 P3d 336 (2006), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 473 (2007), which held that the meaning of the term \u201carthritis or an arthritic condition\u201d involved an issue of statutory construction rather than \u201cone based on what [the board] regard[s] as the most persuasive evidence as to current medical understanding of the term.\u201d Because the board\u2019s order was erroneous in light of <em>Karjalainen, </em>we reverse and remand to the board for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Respondents cross-assign as error the board\u2019s ruling that claimant had an \u201cotherwise compensable injury\u201d based on its finding that claimant\u2019s act of bending forward at work was a \u201cmaterial contributing cause\u201d of disc herniations. Respondents rely on our decision in <em>Mize v. Comcast Corp-AT &amp; T Broadband, </em>208 Or App 563, 145 P3d 315 (2006), also decided after the board issued its order. The board did not have the benefit of our decision in <em>Mize </em>when it determined that claimant had an \u201cotherwise compensable injury\u201d and, on remand, may reconsider its order in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Reversed and remanded for reconsideration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
