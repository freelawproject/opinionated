J.</author>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">In this prosecution for driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII), ORS 813.010, the state appeals from a pretrial order suppressing the results of a breath test. ORS 138.060(l)(c). The trial court concluded that ORS 813.100(2) prohibits an officer from giving a breath test after a driver has initially \u201crefused\u201d to take the test, even if the driver, in response to the officer\u2019s renewed request, subsequently reconsiders and agrees to take the test. We conclude that the trial court erred in so construing and applying ORS 813.100(2). Consequently, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The following facts, as found by the trial court, are supported by evidence in the record. <em>See State v. Stroup, </em>147 Or App 118, 120, 935 P2d 438 (1997) (describing standard of review). On February 4, 2006, Tillamook Police Officer Steven Small arrested defendant on suspicion of DUII. At the police station, Small read defendant the statutorily prescribed implied consent rights and consequences, ORS 813.130, checked defendant\u2019s mouth, and observed defendant for at least 15 minutes. At the end of that period \u2014 but before Small had ensured that the Intoxilyzer power switch was on or pushed the machine\u2019s \u201cstart\u201d button \u2014 Small asked defendant if he would be willing to submit to a breath test. Defendant responded, \u201cI don\u2019t want to take a test and go fuck yourself.\u201d After defendant made that comment, Small wrote \u201crefused\u201d in the \u201cComments\u201d section of the Oregon State Police \u201cOperator\u2019s Checklist for Breath Testing Equipment Intoxilyzer 5000.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Small continued to proceed with the items on the DUII \u201cchecklist\u201d \u2014 he confirmed that the Intoxilyzer\u2019s power switch was on and that the instrument was out of the \u201cnot ready\u2019 mode, pushed the \u201cstart test\u201d button, and inserted the DUII test record card. When the Intoxilyzer machine was ready to accept a breath sample, displaying the \u201cPlease blow\u201d instruction, Small again asked defendant if he was willing to submit to a breath test, telling him, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to take one, it\u2019s going to be considered a refusal.\u201d Defendant responded that he would take the test. After a \u201crestart,\u201d necessitated by radio interference with the machine\u2019s diagnostic function, the test revealed defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content to be .25 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Defendant moved to suppress the results of the breath test, arguing that the administration of the test violated ORS 813.100(2). ORS 813.100 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\">\u201c(1) Any person who operates a motor vehicle upon premises open to the public or the highways of this state shall be deemed to have given consent, subject to the implied consent law, to a chemical test of the person\u2019s breath * * * for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content of the person\u2019s blood if the person is arrested for driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants in violation of ORS 813.010 * * *. A test shall be administered upon the request of a police officer having reasonable grounds to believe the person arrested to have been driving while under the influence of intoxicants in violation of ORS 813.010 * * *. Before the test is administered the person requested to take the test shall be informed of consequences and rights as described under ORS 813.130.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">\u201c(2) No chemical test of the person\u2019s breath * * * shall be given, under subsection (1) of this section, to a person under arrest for driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants in violation of ORS 813.010 * * * if the person refuses the request of a police officer to submit to the chemical test after the person has been informed of consequences and rights as described under ORS 813.130.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Defendant argued that ORS 813.100(2) \u201cexpressly prohibits an officer from giving an arrested person a second opportunity to take a breath test once he/she has refused to take a test after being advised of the rights and consequences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>of such a refusal.\u201d Thus, in defendant\u2019s view, \u201c[I]n simple terms you only get one chance and, if you refuse, you refuse.\u201d The state responded that defendant\u2019s initial statement was not an effective \u201crefusal,\u201d and that, in all events, nothing in ORS 813.100(2) explicitly prohibits \u201can officer [from] asking one more time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">The trial court agreed with defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\">\u201cThe Court concludes that ORS 813.100(3) [sic] applies to this situation. The defendant was arrested, he was read his rights and consequences, he refused and the Officer understood the statement to be a refusal. Ex. 103.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s clear statement, viewed in the context of ORS 813.100(3) [sic], was a decisive event which ended the transaction between the officer and the arrestee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">\u201cThe Court concludes that the second request for an intoxilyzer violated ORS 813.100(3) [sic].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Consequently, the court suppressed the breath test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">On appeal, the state argues that there was no violation of ORS 813.100(2) for either of two reasons. First, and contrary to the trial court\u2019s determination, defendant\u2019s initial response was not \u2014 or, at least, need not have been treated as \u2014 an effective \u201creftisal.\u201d Second, in all events, Small remained free \u2014 at the very least until the Intoxilyzer machine was ready to accept a sample \u2014 to noncoercively revisit defendant\u2019s willingness to take the test and, if that occurred, defendant could reconsider and take the test. The state contends that, to construe and apply ORS 813.100(2) so as to preclude such noncoerced reconsideration would contradict the fundamental overarching purposes of the statutory \u201cinformed consent\u201d scheme.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">Defendant responds that the content (and vehemence) of his initial response to Small, coupled with Small\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>\u201crefused\u201d notation, was ample basis for the trial court\u2019s determination that Small \u201cunderstood the response to be a refusal.\u201d Further, defendant contends that, for purposes of ORS 813.100(2), once a defendant unequivocally refuses to take the test, that refusal is immutable and irrevocable, precluding any reopening of the matter. Bluntly: \u201cOnce a refusal, always a refusal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">As amplified below, we agree with the state\u2019s second, independently sufficient argument. Accordingly, we do not address the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The success of the state\u2019s second argument turns on the proper construction of ORS 813.100(2) \u2014 particularly, the phrase \u201cif the person refuses the request * * * to submit to the chemical test after the person has been informed of consequences and rights as described under ORS 813.130.\u201d We begin by assessing that text in context. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Defendant posits, and the trial court agreed, that \u201crefusal\u201d for purposes of ORS 813.100(2) is, essentially, a historical determination: If, at any time after having been informed of statutory rights and consequences, the driver refused to take the test, that refusal was automatically, immediately, and absolutely preclusive. Whatever occurred thereafter is legally immaterial. Conversely, the state contends that \u201crefusal\u201d must be determined by reference to the circumstances existing as of the time the test is given \u2014 that is, is there an <em>extant </em>refusal? If not \u2014 if, notwithstanding an earlier refusal, the suspect is, in fact, willing to take the test when it is administered \u2014 there is no violation of ORS 813.100(2). In that regard, the state emphasizes that nothing in ORS 813.100(2) or any other statute precludes an officer from inviting a suspect to reconsider a refusal, or a suspect from acting on such an invitation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>In the abstract, either party\u2019s construction is linguistically plausible. However, broader statutory context \u2014 the legislatively intended functions of the informed consent scheme generally, and ORS 813.100(2) particularly, as described by the Oregon Supreme Court \u2014 conclusively militates in favor of the state\u2019s construction. The informed consent statutory scheme is designed to enforce a driver\u2019s legal obligation to submit to a breath test based on his or her prior consent. \u201cThe law is designed to overcome the possibility of physical resistance, despite legal consent, without resort to physical compulsion.\u201d <em>State v. Newton, </em>291 Or 788, 793, 636 P2d 393 (1981). Thus, the requirement in ORS 813.100(1) that the driver be informed of the statutorily prescribed rights and consequences of refusal is calculated \u201cto nonforcibly enforce the driver\u2019s previous implied consent.\u201d Id. That is, that requirement is intended to provide \u201cadditional incentive, short of physical compulsion\u201d to induce the driver to submit to the breath test. <em>State v. Spencer, </em>305 Or 59, 71, 750 P2d 147 (1988). <em>Cf. State v. Weishar, </em>78 Or App 468, 477, 717 P2d 231, <em>rev den, </em>301 Or 338 (1986) (\u201cSince its inception, Oregon\u2019s implied consent statute has contained various sanctions designed to coerce submission to a breath test.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">Still, although the statutory scheme is designed to strongly encourage drivers to submit to a breath test, the driver ultimately retains the <em>\u201cphysical power </em>to refuse.\u201d <em>Newton, </em>291 Or at 792 (\u201c \u2018[Rjefusal\u2019 describes a physical reality. By implying consent, the statute removes the <em>right </em>of a licensed driver to lawfully refuse, but it cannot remove his or her <em>physical power </em>to refuse.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)). ORS 813.100(2) is intended to preclude physical compulsion and to forestall the risks, including the potential for violence, and practical difficulties of forcible administration of a breath test to an unwilling driver:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>\u201c \u2018The obvious reason for acquiescence in the refusal of such a test by a person who as a matter of law is \u2018deemed to have given bis consent\u2019 is to avoid the violence which would often attend forcible tests upon recalcitrant inebriates. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-4\">\u00ab &lt;\u2021 * * $ *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\">\u201c \u2018* * * It is firmly established that a drunken driver has no <em>right </em>to resist or refuse such a test [citations]. It is simply because such a person has the <em>physical power </em>to make the test impractical, and dangerous to himself and those charged with administering it, that it is excused upon an indication of his unwillingness.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-6\"><em>Newton, </em>291 Or at 792-93 (quoting with approval <em>Bush v. Bright, </em>264 Cal App 2d 788, 790, 792, 71 Cal Rptr 123, 124-25 (1968) (emphasis in Bush) (brackets in original)). <em>See also Spencer, </em>305 Or at 71 (\u201cA driver * * * can <em>physically </em>refuse to submit, and the implied consent law, recognizing that practical reality, forbids the use of physical force to compel submission.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The state\u2019s construction of ORS 813.100(2) promotes the broader purposes of ORS 813.100 in its entirety and comports with the specific purpose of subsection (2) itself. Permitting officers to invite, and encourage, drivers to reconsider refusals enhances the likelihood that drivers will, ultimately, agree to submit to a breath test. Further, when a driver is, in fact, willing to take the test, notwithstanding an earlier refusal, the vices of forcible compulsion, including the risks and dangers associated with the use of physical force, are not implicated. Conversely, defendant\u2019s construction would limit drivers\u2019 opportunity to submit to breath tests, even when they are ultimately willing to do so, without advancing the protective purposes of ORS 813.100(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">We conclude that, given the statutory context, as elucidated in <em>Newton </em>and <em>Spencer, </em>only the state\u2019s construction of ORS 813.100(2) plausibly comports with the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>See Lane County v. LCDC, </em>325 Or 569, 578, 942 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>P2d 278 (1997) (\u201c[W]e do not look at one subsection of a statute in a vacuum; rather, we construe each part together with the other parts in an attempt to produce a harmonious whole.\u201d). That is, ORS 813.100(2) does not preclude the giving of a breath test in circumstances in which a driver who initially refuses to take a breath test is later invited to reconsider and agrees to take the test. Consequently, the trial court erred in allowing the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b95-6\"> Although Small testified that he did not regard defendant\u2019s response to be a refusal, defendant contended that that notation demonstrated that Small did, in fact, deem defendant\u2019s response to be an effective refusal. The trial court adopted defendant\u2019s view, stating that Small \u201cunderstood the statement to be a refusal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AEl\">On appeal, the state disputes the trial court\u2019s determination in that regard. Specifically, the state emphasizes that, after making the \u201crefused\u201d notation, Small continued with the DUII \u201cchecklist steps\u201d and waited until the Intoxilyzer machine had completed its \u201cdiagnostic preparation\u201d before confirming whether defendant was willing to take the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Given our analysis below, we need not address that contention. As we explain, even if Small deemed defendant\u2019s statement to be a firm \u201crefusal,\u201d defendant, upon Small\u2019s reinitiation and revisiting of the matter, was free to reconsider his prior refusal and agree to take the test. <em>See </em>215 Or App at 71-75.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-11\"> The state also contends that, given the operation of ORS 136.432, suppression is not a proper remedy for violations of ORS 813.100(2). <em>Cf. State v. Thompson-Seed, </em>162 Or App 483, 489, 986 P2d 732 (1999) (addressing application of ORS 136.432); <em>accord State v. Creson, </em>33 Or App 369, 372, 576 P2d 814 (1978) (concluding that, as a matter of negative implication, the statutory antecedent to the current ORS 813.320(1) precluded the admission in DUII trials of \u201c[e]vidence obtained in violation of implied consent procedures\u201d). Given our analysis and disposition, we need not resolve that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b98-7\"> The state acknowledges that, in <em>Bergstrom v. MVD, </em>104 Or App 141, 799 P2d 673 (1990), which involved an administrative suspension of the respondent\u2019s driving privileges because he refused to submit to a breath test, we held that, where the driver refused to take the test and then unilaterally sought to rescind that refusal, the officer was not obligated to administer the test. That circumstance differs materially from this case where, even assuming defendant\u2019s initial statement was a refusal, Small reinitiated conversation on the matter and invited defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>reconsideration. Nothing in <em>Bergstrom, </em>precludes the administering officer from doing so. <em>Cf. State v. McHenry, </em>205 Or App 310, 312-14, 134 P3d 1016 (2006) (holding that the DUII defendant was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to consult with counsel where (1) the defendant initially said \u201cno\u201d when asked whether he would submit to a breath test, (2) a short time later, the officer \u201creopened negotiations with defendant by asking him a second time whether he would submit to the breath test,\u201d and (3) when the defendant replied, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not blowing until I talk to my attorney,\u201d the officer entered the defendant\u2019s response as a refusal to take the test).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b100-9\"> We note, parenthetically, that, if defendant were correct, then a driver who initially refused to take a breath test but who, upon being invited to reconsider, took the test, would be subject to an automatic administrative suspension of driving privileges, OES 813.100(3), because of the \u201crefusal\u201d \u2014 notwithstanding that he or she ultimately actually took the test, and regardless of the result of that test.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
