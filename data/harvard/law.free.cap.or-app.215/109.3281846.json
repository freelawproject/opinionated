He asserts that (1) the trial court erred in finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that, because of a mental disorder, he was a danger to himself and others and was unable to provide for his basic needs, ORS 426.005(l)(d), and (2) even if the evidence is sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that appellant is mentally ill, the court erred when it determined that he was unwilling, unable, or unlikely to participate in treatment on a voluntary basis, ORS 426.130(l)(b)(A). On <em>de novo </em>review, we determine that the trial court erred in the latter regard. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">A detailed recounting of the circumstances pertaining to appellant\u2019s alleged dangerousness to himself and to others, and his alleged inability to provide for his basic needs, would be of no benefit to the bench, the bar, or the public. Rather, given the basis of our disposition, it suffices to say that, even assuming that, at the time of the commitment hearing, appellant was a \u201cmentally ill person\u201d as defined in ORS 426.005(l)(d), the preponderant evidence in this record shows that appellant was \u201cwilling and able to participate in treatment on a voluntary basis\u201d and that he would \u201cprobably do so.\u201d ORS 426.130(l)(b)(A). That is, regardless of which party properly bears the burden of persuasion with respect to the inquiry prescribed by ORS 426.130(l)(b)(A), on <em>de novo </em>review, a preponderance of the evidence supports appellant\u2019s position. <em>See, e.g., State v. D. F., </em>211 Or App 181, 190, 154 P3d 141 (2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>In that regard, we view four circumstances, in combination, as being especially significant. First, appellant himself initiated the telephone call to the mental health crisis line, which precipitated the commitment proceedings, because he was concerned about \u201curges\u201d to improperly take his medication. Second, appellant candidly acknowledged and agreed with the diagnosis of his mental disorder and, in response to the court\u2019s questions, quite cogently described the \u201cbest treatment\u201d for that disorder as being \u201cmedication and a mix of therapy.\u201d Indeed, appellant was extraordinarily lucid and thoughtful in his responses during the commitment hearing. Third, appellant had been fully cooperative with the course of medication during his hospitalization, and he was able to precisely and accurately describe changes in his medications and their effects on him. Finally, appellant credibly stated his determination and commitment to continue his course of outpatient treatment with his therapist, whom he described as \u201cthe best therapist I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-6\"> <em>Compare State v.
