They argue that the state failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that they were unfit to parent at the time of the termination proceeding. Mother also contends that DHS did not make reasonable efforts to reunify the family. We review <em>de novo, </em>ORS 419A.200, and conclude that the state presented clear and convincing evidence that mother is unfit to parent by reason of her mental defect. We also conclude that clear and convincing evidence demonstrates that father is unable to protect S from the dangers she faces in mother\u2019s care and that, despite the state\u2019s reasonable efforts, he has failed to make a lasting adjustment to that condition. Although parents presented a plan on the day of the termination trial that mother and S will be supervised by relatives, that plan will not ensure that S is never left alone with mother. Thus, integration of the child into parents\u2019 home is unlikely within a reasonable amount of time. We also conclude that termination is in S\u2019s best interests. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">We take the facts from the evidence presented at the termination hearing. In August 2004, a few weeks before the birth of S, the Department of Human Services (DHS) received a report from an unnamed source that mother was pregnant and that both she and father lacked the cognitive abilities to care for a newborn infant. When caseworker Susan Brugato arrived at parents\u2019 home to investigate the report, she had difficulty finding the front door because the yard was so cluttered with debris. She eventually found a path to the door near a small dog pen containing \u201clots of feces, and urine, and no dog food or water.\u201d The dog inside the pen was \u201cvery thin and skinny,\u201d and its food and water bowls were covered with cobwebs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When she entered the home, Brugato was \u201cimmediately able to tell [that the home] was not within community standards for the health and safety of a child\u201d because it was so dirty and cluttered that Brugato <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>could not see any windows or furniture, let alone walk through the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Brugato identified herself and told mother about the report. During their conversation, it became clear that mother was \u201cvery low functioning\u201d and that Brugato would need to speak with father. Brugato left mother her card and asked her to have father call when he arrived home from work. When father called later that day, Brugato explained that the home was not safe for an infant and expressed concern about mother\u2019s ability to parent. Although father acknowledged the dismal condition of the home and told Brugato that they were planning to move, he \u201cwas not concerned\u201d about the potential effect of mother\u2019s cognitive limitations on her ability to care for an infant and \u201cdidn\u2019t see an issue with having [mother] alone with a brand new baby.\u201d Brugato informed father that DHS would hold a team decision meeting to discuss whether mother could care for an infant, and she encouraged him to invite family members to that meeting. Father told Brugato that he would invite his mother and his grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The first team decision meeting was held the next day. None of father\u2019s or mother\u2019s family members attended. At that meeting, Brugato again explained to father why she was concerned about mother\u2019s ability to care for the couple\u2019s child, and father again insisted that he \u201cdid not see any issues with [mother] being alone with [S] all day long.\u201d Brugato asked mother and father to formulate a safety plan to ensure that someone would be available to assist mother on a full-time basis. Father agreed to call his grandmother to ask whether parents could live with her for an undetermined time as part of their agreement that they would find stable and adequate housing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Father also told Brugato that his father and a parenting coach, Lorae Viars, would supervise mother. When Brugato contacted father\u2019s father and Viars, they both told her that they were unable to assist mother full time.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">A second team decision meeting was held soon after the first because no one from parents\u2019 families had attended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>the first meeting. Although Viars and father\u2019s father both attended that second meeting, father\u2019s mother and grandmother again did not. Despite their earlier acknowledgment of the need to find suitable housing in advance of their child\u2019s birth, parents had failed to formulate a safe childcare plan, and father continued to deny that mother needed assistance to care for the child. Brugato informed father that, unless mother and the baby moved to a maternity home where mother could learn the skills necessary to care for a newborn infant, DHS would place S in foster care to ensure her safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">When S was bom in August 2004, DHS filed a dependency petition. The petition alleged that mother\u2019s developmental disabilities impair her ability to safely parent the child, that father\u2019s ability to safely parent the child was unknown but that he had mental health issues that affected his ability to parent, that the home was unsafe for a child, and that parents had failed to develop a plan to ensure the child\u2019s safety after her birth. The juvenile court granted DHS temporary custody of S, and father entered into a service agreement that included a substance abuse evaluation and a psychological evaluation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Psychologist Dr. David Sweet evaluated mother and diagnosed her with mild mental retardation, estimating that her cognitive capabilities are those of less than a 10- or 12-year-old child. Sweet also diagnosed mother with a dependent personality disorder. As a result of those conditions, she is \u201cextremely dependent on other people\u201d and \u201ccan\u2019t manage things adequately on her [own] on a daily basis. She needs people to be there [to] take care of her.\u201d Sweet recommended that mother and father enroll in one-on-one parenting training and noted that, \u201c[a]t some point, if she is able to acquire adequate skills, she may become an adequate parent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">After mother left the hospital with S, they moved into the Safe Haven Maternity Home. Over the next month, several social service providers worked with mother in an attempt to help her learn how to care for S. Despite the efforts of the staff, mother was unable to learn to care for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>child. For instance, Safe Haven house mother Barbara Hastings attempted to teach mother how to bathe S, yet mother was unable to keep S safe during bath time. Hastings had to frequently remind mother not to let go of S in the bath, and she once had to physically intervene so the child \u201cwouldn\u2019t slide into the water.\u201d Family resource worker Karen Gould similarly was unable to teach mother how to nurture, bathe, and feed S, and community health nurse Wendy Zyzniewski unsuccessfully attempted to train mother to recognize and respond to S\u2019s cues. Because mother was unable to learn the skills necessary to safely care for an infant, Hastings, Zyzniewski, and Gould agreed that mother needs constant supervision to avoid placing S\u2019s life and health in danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Mother\u2019s cognitive deficiencies also affected her ability to bond with S. According to Brugato, mother never made eye contact with the baby and referred to her daughter as \u201c \u2018it,\u2019 almost as if the baby wasn\u2019t a human being.\u201d Zyzniewski testified by deposition that mother was unable to adequately bond with S and \u201cwould hand the baby off to anybody who would take her and want to go do whatever she wanted to do.\u201d Gould was similarly concerned with mother\u2019s interactions with S because \u201c[t]here was no conversation, just a flat affect, * * * lack of nurturing.\u201d Moreover, mother\u2019s inability to bond and to understand how to communicate with S caused her to become easily frustrated. Her typical response to S crying was to scream at the infant to \u201cshut up,\u201d despite Hastings\u2019s repeated explanations as to why that response was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Approximately one month after mother and S arrived at Safe Haven, mother\u2019s roommate heard mother screaming at S and found mother holding the baby as if she had been shaking her. When Hastings asked mother about her roommate\u2019s allegations, mother admitted to shaking S. Hastings explained why babies must not be shaken and that she was required to report the incident to DHS. When Brugato investigated Hastings\u2019s report, mother told her that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t shake the baby a lot.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although mother initially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>denied shaking S to DHS intake worker Sandra Webster, mother later shook a teddy bear to show Webster what she had done to S, and said that she did not like to shake the baby.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Based on the shaking incident, DHS removed S from mother\u2019s care. Father vehemently disagreed with the decision to remove S from mother\u2019s care and continued to make excuses for mother. While Brugato would expect any parent to be angry at the decision to remove their child, she was afraid that father\u2019s significant minimization of mother\u2019s cognitive condition and its effect on her ability to care for S would place S in mortal danger if she were returned to parents\u2019 care.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Dr. James Ewell, who evaluated father shortly before S was removed, agreed that father\u2019s apparently intractable belief that mother could safely and adequately parent S placed the child in danger. In addition to his inability to recognize mother\u2019s limitations, Ewell opined that father\u2019s own psychological conditions rendered him incapable of offering the level of consistent parenting or providing the structure required to raise a child. Ewell diagnosed father with alcohol dependence in partial remission based on father\u2019s admission that he is addicted to alcohol and does not abstain from drinking. Ewell explained that father\u2019s alcohol consumption could interfere with his judgment, his ability to maintain employment, and his ability to maintain appropriate relationships, creating an environment that could impede a child\u2019s development. Father was also diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), further exacerbating his difficulty maintaining employment and appropriate long-term housing and interfering with his judgment as a parent and ability to provide for S.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Although father\u2019s alcoholism and ADHD are both treatable conditions, he also suffers from a personality disorder that is resistant to treatment as a result of avoidant, paranoid, and passive-aggressive features. His personality disorder results in, among other things, a tendency to resist cooperating or following through with authority figures by using passive-aggressive obstructionism, and unusually negative feelings, particularly toward people in positions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>authority. These features of father\u2019s personality disorder create an environment that is unpredictable and unstable and that would undermine a child\u2019s development and ability to interact appropriately with others. As a result of his conditions, father \u201chas particular difficulty managing stressful situations, or interpersonal conflict.\u201d He also \u201chas some difficulty managing his own life and following through with responsibilities.\u201d Ewell did not believe that father was capable of minimally adequately parenting S unless he was able to show progress in parenting classes, individual mental health therapy to address his \u201cmoderately severe mental disorder,\u201d and couples counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Father never pursued individual or couples counseling, but he did undergo a mental health assessment at Douglas County Mental Health. Rose Marie Gibbs, who evaluated father and who had not seen the results of Ewell\u2019s evaluation, also diagnosed him with a personality disorder and noted that he exercised poor judgment and lacked insight. She referred father for parenting and anger management classes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Gibbs told father that he could return for individual treatment if he wished, but he never followed through on that offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Father also participated in a drug and alcohol assessment at ADAPT. He disclosed previous methamphetamine use to ADAPT evaluator Terry Hicks, but he did not acknowledge continuing use of or urges to use the drug. Hicks recommended that father participate in a minimum drug and alcohol education program. Father was referred to that program four times, but he never followed through on those referrals.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Over the course of the next year and a half, DHS offered father and mother extensive services beyond the initial evaluations and referrals. For instance, DHS entered into a second service agreement with parents in which parents agreed to work with a mentor to find suitable housing, to demonstrate the ability to maintain clean and safe housing over time, and to attend parenting classes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Gould was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>assigned to help parents locate suitable housing and make their home safe for a child. Although Gould found suitable housing in parents\u2019 price range, father failed to follow through with the rental applications. Douglas County Developmental Disabilities nurse Jessica Rutter, who also attempted to help parents find housing, similarly reported that parents\u2019 failure to follow through with paperwork prevented them from finding a new home.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">Parents similarly made no progress toward maintaining the condition of their home.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Gould testified that the home lacked running water or bathroom facilities, was being heated using three burners of a gas stove, and was so cluttered that it was unsafe. She talked to parents about cleaning the home, and on her second visit they had done so. Despite that initial effort, parents were unable to maintain the house. When Gould made an unannounced visit to the home in January 2005, the home was again in deplorable condition, and subsequent visits showed no improvement. On one occasion after the unannounced visit, Gould discovered dirty clothes and empty containers everywhere, \u201cguns propped in the corner,\u201d \u201ca sauce pan containing vomit\u201d in the bathroom, and sewage in the shower from an overflowing septic tank. The home was so filthy and cluttered that Gould considered it unsafe.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">A third team decision meeting was held in February 2005. Although mother and father were present with their attorneys, again none of mother\u2019s or father\u2019s family members attended. Despite their failure to follow through with any rental applications, mother and father told DHS that they were looking for new housing and were on the Section 8 waiting list. Father agreed to a second evaluation at ADAPT and to random urinalyses. Those services were requested because he had disclosed more extensive past methamphetamine use to Gibbs than he had to Hicks<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and he had not followed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>through on his prior referral to a minimum education class at ADAPT.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Although father did not keep his appointment for a second evaluation at ADAPT, he did participate in random urinalyses. Three of father\u2019s urinalyses were negative for drug use, but father missed one appointment and tested positive for methamphetamine use in June 2005. Father initially denied that he had used methamphetamine, but he later admitted that he had, explaining that he \u201cwent around [with] somebody that I usually never do, and I tried to stay away from [him] to begin with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">DHS also referred father to anger management classes at Valley View Counseling based on Ewell\u2019s and Gibbs\u2019s reports and allegations that father had abused mother prior to their marriage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Father attended almost three months of classes and, although it appeared that he internalized some of the information presented during the course, he had difficulty following through with his homework and concentrating in class. After three absences, he was expelled from the anger management program.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Father largely failed to follow through with the second service agreement, but he and mother did receive one-on-one parenting training from Ron Wilmot during their visits with S. According to Wilmot, mother showed \u201cno improvement of understanding of parenting concepts.\u201d At the end of the training, Wilmot also concluded that mother was not and would never be capable of safely parenting S without constant supervision. When Sweet was informed of the outcome of the one-on-one parenting training that he had recommended, he revised his opinion to conclude that mother could not independently and adequately care for S because she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>could not acquire or retain the information necessary to make progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Although father worked hard, understood the concepts of the training, and was generally appropriate during his interactions with S,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Wilmot was concerned about father\u2019s ability to provide for safe and suitable housing, his tendency to leave S in mother\u2019s care during visits, and his controlling demeanor with mother. When Wilmot visited the camp trailer in May 2005, the septic tank was still overflowing and the floor and surface areas were still littered with clutter and debris. Despite the unsanitary and unsafe condition of the home and mother\u2019s demonstrated inability to parent S, father continued to assert to Wilmot that mother could safely care for her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Father and mother also visited with S while she was in foster care. Although father actively participated in visits and genuinely seemed to care about S, visiting supervisor Margaret Leonard saw almost no improvement in his parenting skills during the approximately two years that she supervised visits, from fall 2004 through spring 2006. Like the other social service providers working with parents, Leonard noted their inability to follow through with her suggestions.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">In February 2006, DHS filed petitions to terminate mother\u2019s and father\u2019s parental rights. After those petitions were filed, father discontinued visits with S for several weeks. Although he resumed visiting S, the visits stopped altogether when parents moved to Modesto, California, at the end of April.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Shortly before parents moved to Modesto, father\u2019s 76-year-old grandmother, Omalie West, called caseworker Jessica Hunter to discuss whether she might be a placement resource for S.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> West acknowledged to Hunter that she could have come forward sooner, but she proposed that S could be placed in parents\u2019 care in her home, and she alternatively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>requested to be certified as a foster parent. Hunter discussed the requests with two supervisors. After deciding that West would not be considered as a placement resource, Hunter wrote West a letter explaining that DHS does not place children with parents after a termination petition has been filed and that her request to be certified as a foster parent had come too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Indeed, the dependency court had relieved DHS of its efforts to reunify the family several months before West expressed interest in being a placement resource. By the time West contacted Hunter, S had been in foster care for over a year and a half. During that period, DHS had conducted a diligent relative search for a potential adoptive placement, relying on parents to identify relatives to consider. Parents submitted a list of relatives, including father\u2019s sister Stacey Beck and his mother Gail Middleton, but father never mentioned West as a potential placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Based on parents\u2019 suggestion that DHS consider certain relatives as potential placements, the agency conducted what Shattenkerk described as an \u201cexhaustive relative search,\u201d which included contacting both Middleton and Beck. In fact, DHS approved Beck, who lived in Modesto, after a home study required by the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children. In September 2005, Hunter contacted Beck, who told her that she was still interested in serving as a placement resource for S. Hunter asked Beck why she had not been in communication with DHS, and Beck explained that she believed S\u2019s foster family would adopt her, \u201cso she didn\u2019t feel that she needed to maintain contact.\u201d Hunter explained that DHS \u201chad every intention\u201d of considering her as a placement for S. Hunter then called the Modesto child welfare agency and spoke with the supervisor for the certification and adoption units of that agency. She asked the supervisor how Beck could become immediately certified as a potential placement. Hunter then spoke to the caseworker responsible for certifying Beck, who informed her that Beck would be asked to participate in certain classes to become certified. When Hunter informed Beck of the requirement that she attend those classes in December 2005, Beck withdrew her application.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Father\u2019s uncle, Bob West, who also contacted Hunter after parents moved to Modesto in support of Omalie West\u2019s request to be a placement resource, explained that the family did not get involved earlier because \u201cwe thought it was taken care of [through Beck]\u201d and that the family only became involved once they discovered that Beck would not be a placement resource for S. Omalie West similarly explained that she did not become involved earlier because she thought everybody was taking care of it.\u201d Neither Bob West nor Omalie West contacted DHS until nearly five months after Beck withdrew her application.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">At the end of May 2006, father called DHS to request another visit. Hunter discussed the request with her supervisor and others, and eventually the agency determined that visits were not in S\u2019s best interests, in part because S had started experiencing anxiety around the visits. Parents did not contest the decision to deny visitation and never requested another visit with S.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">At the time of the termination trial in November 2006, parents had been living in Modesto with Omalie West in her two-bedroom home for approximately six months.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Consistent with Ewell\u2019s prediction that a person suffering from father\u2019s personality disorder would have difficulty obtaining and maintaining employment, during his six-month stay in Modesto, father worked for a temporary agency for a single day and did odd jobs for family members in exchange for room and board. He testified that he is planning to enroll in training to become a certified mechanic.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">At the trial, father claimed to be planning to enroll in a residential drug treatment program. He admitted that he had used methamphetamine in June 2005 and had lied when he had claimed that the urinalysis was incorrect. Although father does not think he has a current drug problem, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>believes that treatment could help prevent him from relapsing again. He also acknowledged that he never followed through on the referral to an ADAPT minimum education course, that he never completed anger management counseling, that he had failed to find housing despite Rutter\u2019s and Gould\u2019s help, and that he had failed to access any services in California.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">For the first time, father also acknowledged during the trial that mother is unable to care for S unsupervised. He testified that mother</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">\u201cgets upset at times, and she just goes ahead to do things and doesn\u2019t settle down to think it through, and that\u2019s what made me realize she has to be supervised at all times. * * * [She gets n]ervous. If she don\u2019t get to go places with me or something at times, she just feels like she\u2019s being left behind\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">and \u201cstomps around mad.\u201d Although father claimed that he had realized nine months earlier that mother was unable to care for S, he admitted that he had never before explained his position or his plan to have relatives supervise mother. When he explained how he arrived at this realization, he said only that family members \u201cpointed out\u201d things to him, such as \u201csometimes she\u2019ll be doing something and she\u2019ll get frustrated * * * and then she\u2019ll get upset and just have a different attitude about things.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Father\u2019s plan to ensure that mother would always be supervised when caring for S was to stay with his grandmother, Omalie West, who would coordinate with Bob West, Beck, or \u201cdifferent cousins [who] live there that are in and out all the time\u201d to supervise mother when he is not available. Omalie West testified that \u201c[t]here\u2019s so many [relatives that] there would be somebody,\u201d including her sister and her four adult grandchildren who \u201cwill be there to do anything they can\u201d and are available on short notice. West also said that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>has church friends who have agreed to help. West indefinitely committed to coordinate the supervision of mother and S by relatives, but she acknowledged that she may not always be able to supervise. However, she assured the court that \u201csomebody will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">S\u2019s foster mother, who is a registered nurse who has experience working with medically fragile children, also testified at the termination trial. She explained that S, who was two years old at the time of trial, is a high-needs child who requires \u201cvery close supervision\u201d because she is so active. S\u2019s foster mother, who has fostered 10 children and raised four biological children, also testified that parenting S takes \u201cvery strong parenting skills, lots of patience and consistency.\u201d S also requires frequent high-caloric meals, continued developmental screenings, and consistent treatment for a skin condition. Although S had reached the expected developmental milestones at the time of the termination trial, she has facial features consistent with fetal alcohol syndrome.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The foster mother stated that those facial features indicate this child is much more likely than a child who does not have such features to experience developmental problems in the future. S\u2019s foster mother testified that S is well bonded to her foster family and that S had begun experiencing anxiety around visits with parents before parents moved. S has not mentioned either of her parents since the visits ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">As to mother, the trial court found by clear and convincing evidence that mother\u2019s cognitive deficiencies render her unfit to parent, and that her condition is seriously detrimental to S, as evidenced by the life-threatening shaking incident that led to S\u2019s removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">As to father, the trial court identified father\u2019s lack of effort or failure to obtain and maintain a suitable or stable living situation, his failure to present a viable plan for the return of S to parents\u2019 custody, and his mental illness as conduct or conditions that render father unfit to parent. It also found that father\u2019s lack of sound judgment regarding safe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>caregivers for S, coupled with his failure to effect a lasting adjustment after reasonable efforts by social service agencies, was a serious detriment to her welfare. Although father testified at the time of trial that he believed mother incapable of independently parenting S, the court was not convinced by his eleventh-hour change of heart and concluded that S would be placed in danger of harm if returned to his care because father \u201cha[s not] internalized the safety concerns [unanimously] expressed by others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The trial court also found that father\u2019s plan to have mother supervised by his relatives would not ensure S\u2019s safety. Based on Ewell\u2019s opinion that father\u2019s mental health issues impede his ability to manage stressful situations, the trial court found that it is likely that parents will leave the home in the event of a conflict with father\u2019s grandmother. Even if mother is constantly supervised, the court concluded that it is doubtful that parents\u2019 plan would ensure S\u2019s safety, because, when trained residential staff supervised mother at Safe Haven, an \u201cincident occurred that led to the removal of S[ ] because of the potential for a life-ending injury.\u201d Because S, who has high needs, has not bonded with parents, and there is an available adoptive resource, the trial court concluded that termination was in S\u2019s best interests. Both parents appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">We begin by examining the applicable legal standards and then apply those standards to each parent\u2019s case. ORS 419B.504 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">\u201cThe rights of the parent or parents may be terminated as provided in ORS 419B.500 if the court finds that the parent or parents are unfit by reason of conduct or condition seriously detrimental to the child or ward and integration of the child or ward into the home of the parent or parents is improbable within a reasonable time due to conduct or conditions not likely to change. In determining such conduct and conditions, the court shall consider but is not limited to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">\u201c(1) Emotional illness, mental illness or mental deficiency of the parent of such nature and duration as to render the parent incapable of providing proper care for the child or ward for extended periods of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>\u00ab\u00edH ^ iK # \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-4\">\u201c(3) Addictive or habitual use of intoxicating liquors or controlled substances to the extent that parental ability has been substantially impaired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">\u00abHi \u2021 ^ ^ \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">\u201c(5) Lack of effort of the parent to adjust the circumstances of the parent, conduct, or conditions to make it possible for the child or ward to safely return home within a reasonable time or failure of the parent to effect a lasting adjustment after reasonable efforts by available social agencies for such extended duration of time that it appears reasonable that no lasting adjustment can be effected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">The statute requires a two-step analysis. We first examine whether a parent has engaged in conduct or suffers from a condition that is seriously detrimental to the child. If so, we determine whether it is improbable that the child will be integrated into the parent\u2019s home within a reasonable time. <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Smith, </em>338 Or 58, 80-81, 106 P3d 627 (2005); <em>State ex rel SOSCF v. Stillman, </em>333 Or 135, 145-46, 36 P3d 490 (2001). Termination requires that the state prove unfitness by clear and convincing evidence; that is, evidence that makes it highly probable that the parent is unfit at the time of the termination trial. <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Simmons, </em>342 Or 76, 95-96, 149 P3d 1124 (2006); <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Rardin, </em>340 Or 436, 448, 134 P3d 940 (2006); <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Hinds, </em>191 Or App 78, 84, 81 P3d 99 (2003). It also requires clear and convincing evidence that \u201cthe state [made] reasonable efforts to assist parents in making the adjustments to enable them to become minimally adequate parents.\u201d <em>State ex rel SOSCF v. Frazier, </em>152 Or App 568, 582, 955 P2d 272, <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 305 (1998) (citation omitted). Whether the state\u2019s efforts were reasonable depends on the particular circumstances. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">With those principles in mind, we turn to the evidence regarding parents\u2019 unfitness. We recognize that the state must prove that each parent is unfit by clear and convincing evidence, but we treat mother\u2019s and father\u2019s appeals together because the issues are inextricably intertwined in this case. We first examine whether each parent has engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>in conduct or suffers from a condition that supports terminating their parental rights. In so doing, we consider whether the fact that parents are living with Omalie West means that their conduct or conditions would not be seriously detrimental to the child because West has offered to ensure supervision of mother when she is caring for S. We conclude that parents\u2019 plan for family supervision of mother does not ensure constant supervision, resulting in S facing a significant risk of harm from parents\u2019 conduct if she is returned to their care. For the same reason, we also conclude that it is unlikely that S could be integrated into parents\u2019 home within a reasonable amount of time. Lastly, we find that termination is in S\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">We begin by examining mother\u2019s conduct or condition. Every social service provider who considered whether S could be left in mother\u2019s care \u2014 including house mother Barbara Hastings, family resource worker Karen Gould, community health nurse Wendy Zyzniewski, psychologist David Sweet, and parenting trainer Ronald Wilmot \u2014 testified that she cannot minimally adequately parent S without constant supervision. Mother\u2019s cognitive limitations render her unable to learn how to care for or appropriately respond to S. The shaking and near-drowning incidents at Safe Haven demonstrate that she needs constant supervision to avoid risking the child\u2019s life or health. In short, mother should never be left alone with S. We find that mother is incapable of providing adequate care for S and that her conduct and condition are seriously detrimental to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">We turn to father\u2019s conduct and conditions, specifically his alcohol and drug issues, his mental health issues, his failure to obtain and maintain a suitable housing situation in which S is protected from mother, and his lack of effort to adjust his conduct or conditions. Although father\u2019s conduct or conditions might not support termination when considered in isolation, they are directly and seriously detrimental to S when considered in the context of his relationship with mother. Father\u2019s lack of effort to obtain and maintain a stable and suitable living situation \u2014 namely, one in which S will be protected from the dangers she would face in mother\u2019s care\u2014 renders him unfit to parent S. Father historically has failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>to recognize the importance of ensuring that mother is constantly supervised when S is in her care and has demonstrated an unwillingness \u2014 and inability \u2014 to protect S from mother. We are not convinced by his eleventh-hour testimony that he now understands mother\u2019s limitations and the real need for constant supervision. Although father claimed to have formulated a family-supervision plan to have his relatives supervise mother nine months before the termination trial and three months before parents moved to Modesto, the trial was the first time he explained it to DHS or to the court. The trial was also the first time father purported to acknowledge mother\u2019s inability to parent S. Until his trial testimony, father had maintained the steadfast belief that mother was an adequate parent in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary (including the near-drowning and shaking incidents at Safe Haven).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Father\u2019s ostensible realization that mother needs supervision failed to convince the trial court that he \u201chas internalized the safety concerns expressed by others.\u201d We give \u201cconsiderable weight\u201d to the trial court\u2019s findings on credibility due to its ability to observe the witnesses and their demeanor, <em>State ex rel. Juv. Dept. v. Geist, </em>310 Or 176, 194, 796 P2d 1193 (1990), but even if we did not defer to those findings, father\u2019s testimony falls short. He testified that he now knows that mother requires supervision because of \u201cthings pointed out\u201d to him by family members, specifically that mother \u201cgets upset at times, and she just goes ahead to do things and doesn\u2019t settle down to think it through,\u201d that mother gets \u201cnervous,\u201d and that she \u201cstomps around mad.\u201d Those statements do not demonstrate a complete or accurate understanding of mother\u2019s limitations or of the dangers those limitations would pose to S if the child were left unsupervised in mother\u2019s care. Without such an understanding, father\u2019s plan is nothing more than a last-ditch effort to mollify the authorities that he has passive-aggressively resisted, consistent with Ewell\u2019s description of his personality disorder, throughout this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Also consistent with his personality disorder and his ADHD diagnosis, father has a history of not following through on his plans. From the outset of this case, father <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>acknowledged the need to find safe housing for S, and yet failed to follow through by submitting rental applications obtained by Gould. Rutter also noted that father\u2019s failure to follow through with paperwork prevented parents from locating a suitable home. Father also failed to maintain parents\u2019 house in a sanitary condition, despite having been told \u2014 and agreeing \u2014 that the home was unsafe. Father was referred to alcohol and drug education four times but never followed through on those referrals. Although father attended and appeared to benefit from anger management classes, instructor Lynda Mason testified that he had difficulty following through with homework, and he was eventually expelled for missing more classes than the program allows. In sum, father\u2019s repeated failure to uphold his promises to social service providers suggests that he will also fail to follow through on his promise to ensure that mother is constantly supervised. We conclude that father\u2019s failure to completely and accurately recognize mother\u2019s limitations renders him unable to protect S from harm by mother, and, consequently, that his condition is seriously detrimental to S.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">We next consider whether it is improbable that S will be integrated into parents\u2019 home within a reasonable time. Although father claims that he is \u201cin process,\u201d and that the trial court therefore erred by concluding that he has failed to effect a lasting adjustment after reasonable efforts by available social service agencies, the evidence does not show that father is \u201cin process\u201d or \u201cseeking to change [his] behavior.\u201d <em>Cf. State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Huston, </em>203 Or App 640, 658, 126 P3d 710 (2006) (\u201cIndeed, mother is like thousands of parents in Oregon who are \u2018in process\u2019 \u2014 parents who may initially fail to reckon with the potential consequences of their behavior on their children but are seeking to change their behavior to become better parents.\u201d). Just as he failed to successfully complete many of the services offered to him in Oregon, he has failed to avail himself of any services since parents moved to Modesto. There is no evidence that father possesses \u201cthe required motivation to change [or has] demonstrated [his] ability to change.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Father\u2019s inability to follow through, coupled with his failure to acknowledge or protect against the dangers S would face in mother\u2019s care, establish a \u201c[l]ack of effort * * * to adjust the circumstances of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>the parent, conduct, or conditions to make it possible for [S] to safely return home.\u201d ORS 419B.504(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">Father argues that he has made a lasting adjustment in that he obtained a stable living situation in Omalie West\u2019s home more than six months before trial.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Similarly, mother argues that living with Omalie West, with West serving as S\u2019s permanent guardian, would prevent her mental deficiencies from being \u201cseriously detrimental to S.\u201d The record in this case reveals several reasons that father\u2019s plan would not work. Even if parents\u2019 living situation with West is stable,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> it is not suitable because there is clear and convincing evidence that the family will not be able to ensure that mother is constantly supervised when caring for S.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">First, parents\u2019 plan to have relatives supervise mother lacks sufficient detail about <em>who </em>will be supervising mother and <em>when </em>in order to ensure that S will not be left alone with mother. When West contacted Hunter in April 2006, she did not offer to constantly supervise mother; rather, she offered that parents could live in her home or that she could be certified as a foster parent. At trial, West testified that there are so many relatives in Modesto that there would always be someone available to supervise. She did not, however, commit to constantly monitoring mother or offer any detail about how others\u2019 supervision would be coordinated other than to say that her family is \u201ctogether a lot and we do a lot together\u201d and that her house is a \u201cbusy house\u201d with grandchildren and \u201cgreat grand kids that are in and out.\u201d The lack of detail in the proposed supervision plan demonstrates that West does not have a true understanding of the level of monitoring needed to ensure S\u2019s safety. The proposed plan is simply insufficient to assure that S will never be left alone with mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Second, the plan proposed by parents would require frequent and accurate communication among family members. Although there are many relatives in the Modesto area, the record reveals that those relatives have already encountered difficulty communicating about S. Although Beck withdrew her application to serve as S\u2019s foster parent in December 2005, Omalie West did not learn of the withdrawal until almost five months later in April 2006. West explained that she did not step forward in the case sooner because she \u201cthought everybody was taking care of it * * * [and that] the younger generation were doing it.\u201d The \u201cyounger generation\u201d \u2014 which father, Omalie West, and Bob West all testified will be relied upon to supervise mother \u2014 has historically failed to communicate with West about the care of S, and the record reveals no reason that the family will be able to communicate more effectively in the future. As well-intentioned as Omalie West may be, the family\u2019s lack of communication, particularly concerning the family\u2019s role in caring for S, calls into question her ability to ensure that mother will be constantly supervised. Father\u2019s failure to develop realistic strategies to protect S from the dangers she would face in mother\u2019s care is further evidence of his \u201clack of effort * * * to adjust the circumstances of the parent, conduct, or conditions to make it possible for [S] to safely return home.\u201d ORS 419B.504(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Father correctly contends that failure to present a viable plan cannot provide the basis for a finding of unfitness. <em>See Rardin, </em>340 Or at 444-45. Failure to present a viable plan can, however, establish that it is improbable that the child will be integrated into the home within a reasonable period of time due to conduct or conditions not likely to change. ORS 419B.504; <em>Rardin, </em>340 Or at 445 (explaining that the termination court must first focus on a parent\u2019s unfitness rather than a \u201clack of a viable plan\u201d because that relates to the second step of the <em>Stillman </em>analysis). Based on the likelihood that mother and S will be left unsupervised if S is returned to parents, and that this high-risk situation is unlikely to improve, we conclude that integration of S into father\u2019s home is improbable within a reasonable period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">We next consider whether DHS made reasonable efforts to assist parents. Mother argues that DHS did not make reasonable efforts to address her condition because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>agency provided mother only with \u201cnormal services which are provided for parents\u201d that \u201cwere never going to solve the problem of mother\u2019s disability\u201d and were therefore \u201creally no services at all.\u201d We disagree. The agency provided services designed to best meet mother\u2019s needs. The fact that the services were not ultimately successful does not undermine the reasonableness of offering them. When Sweet first evaluated mother, he suggested she be provided with one-on-one training to learn the specific techniques and skills necessary to care for a young child. It was not until Shattenkerk informed him that mother had unsuccessfully participated in one-on-one parenting training at Safe Haven and again with Wilmot that Sweet concluded that further training would be futile. As he explained at trial, \u201c[i]t works with some people [, but] it apparently didn\u2019t work well with her.\u201d We conclude that DHS\u2019s efforts in assisting mother to become a minimally adequate parent were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">There is clear and convincing evidence that mother\u2019s mental deficiencies are \u201cof such a nature and duration as to render [her] incapable of providing proper care for [S] for extended periods of time,\u201d and that mother\u2019s condition would be seriously detrimental to S because the plan for Omalie West to coordinate people to supervise mother at all times is likely to fail. ORS 419B.506. For the same reason, father\u2019s inability to protect S from mother or effect a lasting adjustment to that condition would be seriously detrimental to S if she were returned to parents\u2019 care. Although the state made reasonable efforts to assist mother, and despite Omalie West\u2019s offer to supervise, we conclude that integration of S into parents\u2019 home is improbable within a reasonable amount of time because the plan presented by parents at trial will not ensure that mother is constantly supervised in S\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Lastly, we find that termination of parents\u2019 rights is in the child\u2019s best interests. S has not bonded with parents and had begun experiencing anxiety around visits with parents about three months before those visits ended. There is an adoptive placement available who is well bonded with S and who has demonstrated the ability to provide for her high needs, as well as her needs for \u201cvery strong parenting skills\u201d and \u201clots of patience and consistency.\u201d There is clear and convincing evidence that parents lack the ability to meet those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>needs based on their historical inability to follow through with positive recommendations and based on Ewell\u2019s evaluation that father is not capable of providing a stable home environment. Accordingly, we are persuaded that termination of their parental rights is in S\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-6\"> In fact, the pen was so filthy and the dog so emaciated that Brugato called animal control after leaving the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b114-7\"> The record does not reveal whether father contacted his grandmother at that time.
