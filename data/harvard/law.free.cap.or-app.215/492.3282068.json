We reject without discussion plaintiff-relator\u2019s argument that the court erred in dismissing the writ. Plaintiff-relator argues that the court erred in entering the supplemental judgment without making a determination that he had the ability to pay the fees. The state concedes that the trial court erred in that regard. We accept that concession. <em>See State ex rel Baker v. Cook, </em>171 Or App 719, 720, 16 P3d 1184 (2000) (in mandamus action, trial court erred in requiring plaintiff-relator to pay previously deferred filing fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Supplemental money judgment for filing fees reversed and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
