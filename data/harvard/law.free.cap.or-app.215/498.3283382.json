We write only to address defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in imposing an upward departure sentence and reject defendant\u2019s other contentions without discussion. As explained below, we affirm defendant\u2019s conviction but remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">First-degree sexual abuse is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 75 months\u2019 imprisonment. ORS 137.700. In this case, the trial court imposed an upward departure sentence of 80 months after finding that defendant had persistently been involved in similar crimes, that the victim was particularly vulnerable, and that the offense resulted in permanent injury to the victim. Defendant asserts that an enhanced sentence based on such judicial factfinding violates the rule of law announced in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004). We agree. Defendant is entitled to resentencing because the court imposed an upward departure sentence based on facts not found by the jury or admitted by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Although defendant\u2019s challenge to his sentence is unpreserved, in <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>205 Or App 113, 133 P3d 343, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>207 Or App 1, 139 P3d 981 (2006), <em>rev allowed, </em>342 Or 256 (2007), we held that the imposition of a departure sentence under similar circumstances constituted plain error. For the reasons set forth in <em>Ramirez, </em>we exercise our discretion to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Sentence vacated; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
