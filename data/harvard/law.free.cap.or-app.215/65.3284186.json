As part of youth\u2019s sentence, the court imposed restitution of $1,424.80 to the victim for damage to the victim\u2019s vehicle. Youth appeals, and her sole assignment of error concerns the trial court\u2019s order that she pay restitution. After youth filed her notice of appeal and her opening brief, however, the juvenile court entered an <em>ex parte </em>order waiving, at the request of the victim, the full amount of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Because the original restitution order has been withdrawn and youth is not required to pay any of the original restitution amount, review of the order would have no effect on any party\u2019s rights. \u201c \u2018Cases that are otherwise justiciable, but in which a court\u2019s decision no longer will have a practical effect on or concerning the rights of the parties,\u2019 are moot.\u201d <em>Barcik v.

We are limited to deciding existing controversies between parties. <em>Yancy v.
