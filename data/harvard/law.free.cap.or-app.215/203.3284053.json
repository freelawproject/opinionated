J.</author>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">Respondent Diane Baldwin moves to dismiss this appeal based on a settlement agreement between the parties. Appellant Karen Baldwin opposes the motion to dismiss the appeal, contending that there is not a final settlement agreement. We conclude that the parties entered into an enforceable agreement to settle this matter, which included an agreement to dismiss the appeal. The dismissal of the appeal is contingent upon the trial court entering an amended domestic relations order consistent with the parties\u2019 agreement. Accordingly, we hold in abeyance the motion to dismiss the appeal and the appeal pending the trial court\u2019s entry of such an order, after which time we will grant respondent\u2019s motion and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">This appeal arises from a dissolution of marriage proceeding between Diane Baldwin and John Baldwin. In 1993, the trial court entered a judgment of dissolution and a domestic relations order, which divided the then-present value of John Baldwin\u2019s PERS benefits. The PERS benefits were equally divided between Diane and John. In 1994, John Baldwin married Karen Baldwin. John died in 2005, before his PERS benefits became payable. Karen was appointed personal representative of John\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">A dispute arose between Diane and Karen regarding the distribution of the marital portion of John\u2019s PERS benefits. Karen, as personal representative, requested clarification of the 1993 domestic relations order. Following trial, the trial court denied the request for clarification and, as a result of that denial, Diane was entitled to 100 percent of the marital portion of John\u2019s PERS benefits. Karen timely appealed from the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The case was referred to the Appellate Settlement Conference Program. ORAP 15.05.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although efforts to settle through the program were not successful, the parties\u2019 attorneys continued to negotiate settlement terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>We describe the parties\u2019 post-settlement-conference negotiations in some detail. On June 9, 2006, Diane\u2019s attorney e-mailed a \u201cfinal\u201d settlement proposal to Karen\u2019s attorney. That proposal stated that Karen, or her assignee, would receive one-third of the disputed amount and Diane would retain two-thirds of the disputed PERS benefits. In addition, Diane agreed to make the settlement fully retroactive. On June 13, 2006, Karen\u2019s attorney e-mailed Diane\u2019s attorney that Diane\u2019s June 9,2006 offer was \u201cacceptable to Karen\u201d and that a formal acceptance would follow. On June 20, 2006, Diane\u2019s attorney e-mailed Karen\u2019s attorney confirming Karen\u2019s acceptance of Diane\u2019s June 9 offer. On June 26,2006, Karen\u2019s attorney wrote Diane\u2019s attorney \u201cconfirm [ing] that we have agreed to settle the parties\u2019 dispute about the distribution of John Baldwin\u2019s PERS account * * After noting that the domestic relations order would need to be amended, Karen\u2019s attorney wrote that, \u201cassuming that the rest of the deal is consummated, we will agree to dismiss the appeal * * * <em>\u00bb</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">A different attorney was responsible for drafting an amended domestic relations order. Over the next few months, the attorneys exchanged e-mails regarding the proposed order. On August 2, 2006, Karen\u2019s attorney wrote Diane\u2019s attorney, expressing some concern regarding paragraph eight of the proposed order. However, Karen\u2019s attorney wrote that it was Diane\u2019s attorney\u2019s \u201ccall\u201d regarding paragraph eight, and that \u201cthe rest of the order looks okay to me.\u201d That same day, Diane\u2019s attorney wrote to Karen\u2019s attorney regarding the changes to the proposed order. On September 20, 2006, Karen\u2019s attorney wrote Diane\u2019s attorney stating, \u201c[p] lease let me know whether the present DRO will be acceptable. We also want to get this wrapped up \u2014 or not \u2014 as soon as possible.\u201d On November 14, 2006, Diane\u2019s attorney e-mailed Karen\u2019s attorney stating that Diane was ready to sign the proposed order, with two exceptions. The exceptions concerned paragraph eight regarding the manner and timing of the retroactive payment, and paragraph nine regarding taxability. According to Diane\u2019s attorney, the retroactive payment issue was resolved, and he suggested deleting paragraph nine. Diane\u2019s attorney asked Karen\u2019s attorney if the two changes were acceptable. There was no response to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Diane\u2019s attorney\u2019s e-mail. On December 5,2006, Karen filed a substitution of attorney. Karen\u2019s new attorney informed Diane\u2019s attorney that Karen did not want to settle and that she wanted the appeal to go forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">Diane moves to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the parties had entered into a binding agreement that included an agreement to dismiss the appeal. Karen opposes the motion on the grounds that there was no final settlement and that, assuming that there was a final settlement, the appeal cannot be dismissed until the amended domestic relations order is entered. Therefore, Karen contends, the motion to dismiss her appeal should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The initial issue is whether the parties agreed to a final settlement of this matter. A settlement is a contract. <em>Hughes v. Misar, </em>189 Or App 258, 264, 76 P3d 111 (2003). Whether a contract exists is a question of law. <em>Dalton v. Robert Jahn Corp., </em>209 Or App 120, 132, 146 P3d 399, <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 416 (2006). As often stated, Oregon subscribes to an objective theory of contracts, which means that whether the parties entered into a contract does not depend on the parties having the same subjective understanding of the agreement. Rather, it depends on whether the parties agreed to the same express terms of the contract. <em>Newton/Boldt v. Newton, </em>192 Or App 386, 392, 86 P3d 49, <em>rev den, </em>337 Or 84 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">On these facts, we have no difficulty concluding that the parties agreed to settle this matter. The June 2006 exchange of e-mails between the parties\u2019 attorneys constituted the making of a contract. Diane\u2019s attorney\u2019s letter of June 9 to Karen\u2019s attorney was an offer, and Karen\u2019s attorney\u2019s response was an acceptance of that offer. Karen\u2019s attorney even wrote that a more formal \u201cacceptance\u201d would follow, and Karen\u2019s attorney\u2019s June 26, 2006, letter was that formal acceptance. The exchange of e-mails between the attorneys for the parties demonstrated the requisite agreement on the same essential terms of the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The lack of a signed agreement is not dispositive; \u201c[w]hen parties agree on the essential terms of a contract and there is nothing left for future negotiations, the fact that they also intended there to be a future writing that expresses their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>agreement more formally does not affect the immediately binding nature of the agreement.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>189 Or App at 264; <em>see also Kaiser Foundation Health Plan v. Doe, </em>136 Or App 566, 903 P2d 375 (1995), <em>modified on recons, </em>138 Or App 428, 908 P2d 850, <em>rev den, </em>324 Or 394 (1996) (Where attorneys reached agreement on the essential terms of a settlement and the defendant accepted those terms, the defendant\u2019s acceptance was sufficient to make the settlement immediately binding.).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">A related issue concerns the lack of agreement on certain terms. If those terms are material then there is no contract. \u201cA term is \u2018material\u2019 to an enforceable agreement when it goes to the substance of the contract and, if breached, defeats the object of the parties in entering into the agreement.\u201d <em>Johnstone v. Zimmer, </em>191 Or App 26, 34, 81 P3d 92 (2003) (citation omitted). The two material terms in this contract were (1) the portion, if any, of the PERS benefits that Karen should receive, and (2) the extent, if any, to which the payments would be retroactive. Karen and Diane agreed as to both material terms. Karen\u2019s argument, that Diane\u2019s attorney\u2019s November 14, 2006, e-mail regarding two additional changes demonstrates that the parties did not reach a settlement, is not persuasive. Those proposed changes regarding the manner and timing of the retroactive payment and taxation are, at best, subordinate details of performance. <em>Dalton, </em>209 Or App at 139-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Karen\u2019s new attorney\u2019s subsequent contact with Diane\u2019s attorney conveying Karen\u2019s intent to withdraw from the settlement was an attempt to repudiate the contract formed on Karen\u2019s behalf by her former attorney. However, once Karen had exercised the power to create a contract by accepting the offer made by Diane, the purported repudiation was ineffective. The settlement agreement is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\"> The settlement agreement provides for dismissal of this appeal once the \u201crest of the deal is consummated.\u201d The court has authority to decide enforceability of such an agreement. <em>Reich and Reich, </em>176 Or App 442, 444, 32 P3d 904 (2001). The \u201crest of the deal\u201d needs to be consummated before this court dismisses the appeal. The trial court must enter an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>amended domestic relations order consistent with the parties\u2019 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Accordingly, we will hold the motion and the appeal in abeyance pending the trial court\u2019s entry of an amended domestic relations order consistent with the parties\u2019 agreement, at which time we will dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Motion to dismiss appeal and appeal held in abeyance pending trial court\u2019s entry of an amended domestic relations order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-8\"> The proceedings before the Appellate Settlement Conference Program are confidential. ORAP 15.05(6) and ORS 36.220 to 36.238. Normally, Court of Appeals judges are not aware of which cases have been considered by the program. This case is an exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
