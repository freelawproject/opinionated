Henry sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief. The District Court dismissed the complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Henry appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-16\">Construing Henry\u2019s complaint liberally, it is best read as a habeas petition challenging the detainer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Haines v. Kernel) </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972). In order to invoke habeas jurisdiction, Henry must demonstrate that he was \u201cin custody\u201d pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)(3). Custody is measured as of the time that the petition was filed. <em>See Chong v. Dist. Dir., Immigration and Naturalization Serv., </em>264 F.3d 378, 382-83 (3d Cir.2001). When Henry filed his complaint in June 2008, he was serving his federal criminal sentence. <em>See United States v. Henry, </em>S.D. Fla.Crim. No. 93-cr-06107. He failed to demonstrate that he was being held pursuant to the detainer, that he was subject to a final order of removal, or even that removal proceedings had been initiated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that Henry was \u201cin custody.\u201d <em>See e.g., Zolicoffer v. United States Department of Justice, </em>315 F.3d 538, 541 (5th Cir.2003) (\u201cagree[ing] with the majority of the circuit courts considering this issue and hold[ing] that prisoners are not \u2018in custody\u2019 for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 simply because the INS has lodged a detainer against them.\u201d). Therefore, the District Court properly dismissed Henry\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The District Court\u2019s dismissal was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>without prejudice, and, if circumstances warrant, Henry may still appropriately challenge his detention and/or nationality status.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Because we conclude that there is no substantial question presented by this appeal, we will summarily affirm. Henry\u2019s Motion for a Permanent Injunction and Restraining Order is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-12\">. \"Filing a detainer is an informal procedure in which the INS informs prison officials that a person is subject to deportation and requests that officials give the INS notice of the person\u2019s death, impending release, or transfer to another institution.\u201d <em>Giddings v. Chandler, </em>979 F.2d 1104, 1105 n. 3 (5th Cir. 1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b201-13\">. It appears that Henry was released from Bureau of Prisons custody on August 22, 2008, but it is unclear whether he is being detained by the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement \"(BICE\u201d), or whether he is now subject to a final order of removal. In the absence of evidence of a final order of removal, we will not convert Henry\u2019s complaint into a petition for review. <em>Cf. Nnadika v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>484 F.3d 626, 632 (3d Cir.2007) (slating that \"only challenges that directly implicate [an] order of removal ... are properly the subject of transfer under the REAL ID Act.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b201-18\">.To the extent that Henry sought damages, this form of relief would not be available in the context of a habeas petition. In any event, damages would not be available based on Henry's arguments regarding the detainer; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>as noted above, Henry was in custody pursuant to his federal criminal sentence when his complaint was before the District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
