Marshall does not renew his .claims against F. Baxter, the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Doug Dretke, Timothy Simmons, and Leonard Ellis. Because Marshall does not brief any issue relating to these defendants, all issues are deemed abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-20\">Marshall argues that Dr. Patel demonstrated deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs because Dr. Patel\u2019s order to increase the dosage of Marshall\u2019s pain medication was inexplicably delayed for several months. Prison officials violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment when they demonstrate deliberate indifference to a prisoner\u2019s serious medical needs, constituting an unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain. <em>Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 297, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991). Acts of negligence or medical malpractice are insufficient to establish a constitutional violation. <em>Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991). Marshall fails to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>allege facts relating to the delay which are sufficient to support a claim of deliberate indifference to a serious medical need as is required to proceed under the Eighth Amendment and \u00a7 1983. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Marshall also contends that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint prior to discovery and by denying his post judgment motion to amend his complaint. Marshall has not shown that the district court\u2019s failure to allow him to conduct discovery was arbitrary or clearly unreasonable as he offers no indication what the discovery would have revealed that would have changed the underlying nature of the complaint.' <em>See Moore v. Willis Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>233 F.3d 871, 876 (5th Cir.2000). Additionally, Marshall\u2019s attempt to amend his complaint to add a new defendant would have been futile because it would not change the substance of Marshall\u2019s complaint, which simply does not state a claim of deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs; therefore, the district court did not err in denying Marshall\u2019s motion. <em>See Rosenzweig v. Azurix Corp., 332 </em>F.3d 854, 864-65 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Marshall\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and, thus, frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Therefore, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Marshall\u2019s complaint as frivolous and this court\u2019s dismissal of Marshall\u2019s appeal count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Marshall is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will no longer be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
