On appeal, he argues that the district court erred in finding that it lacked authority to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003) (citation omitted). However, in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context, \u201cwe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam). We have held that <em>\u201c[p]ro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1160 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant if that defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o) ... if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 lB1.10(b), a court calculating a defendant\u2019s amended guideline range under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cshall substitute only the amendments listed in [\u00a7 lB1.10(c) ] for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced. All other guideline application decisions remain unaffected.\u201d U.S. SENTENCING Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-13\">Amendment 706 reduced offense levels in certain crack eocaine cases by two levels, as reflected in the drug quantity table in U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual App. C, amend. 706. Amendment 713 made Amendment 706 retroactive. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual App. C, amend. 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-14\">A reduction in the term of imprisonment is not consistent with the Guidelines policy statement, and therefore not authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2), if \u201c[a]n amendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). A district court has jurisdiction to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence only if a guideline amendment actually lowers his sentencing range. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized when Amendment 706 had reduced the defendant\u2019s base offense level, but did not change his actual sentence range under the guidelines because he was sentenced as a recidivist under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.1). Where a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>district court lacks jurisdiction to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence because a retroactive amendment does not reduce his guideline range, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not constitute an independent jurisdictional basis for the court to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Jones, </em>548 F.3d at 1369.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">Here, Amendment 706 does not have the effect of lowering Williams\u2019 applicable guideline range. Williams\u2019 original base offense level under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2D1.1 was 38, and the application of Amendment 706 would reduce his base offense level to 36. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing' Guidelines Manual App. C, amend. 706. Because a district court must leave all original sentencing decisions not affected by a retroactive guideline amendment undisturbed, Williams\u2019 base offense level would be increased by four points for possession of a dangerous weapon and his role in the offense, yielding an amended total offense level of 40. <em>See United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 759-60 (11th Cir.1998). Based on an amended total offense level of 40 and a criminal history category of VI, Williams\u2019 amended guideline range would be the same as his original guideline range \u2014 360 months to life imprisonment. Accordingly, Amendment 706 does not have the effect of reducing Williams\u2019 guideline range. Therefore, the district court did not err in finding that Williams was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
