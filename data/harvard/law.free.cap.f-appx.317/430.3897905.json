On appeal, Rodriguez-Duberney challenges the district court\u2019s characterization of his prior conviction under the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952, as a drug trafficking offense for sentencing purposes. In <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Duberney, </em>326 F.3d 613, 616-18 (5th Cir.2003), we held that Rodriguez-Duberney\u2019s prior conviction warranted a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. Rodriguez-Duberney asserts that this prior decision is flawed because we relied upon the charge alleged in a dismissed indictment rather than the information to which he pleaded guilty. He also maintains that the ruling in <em>Rodriguez-Duberney </em>has been called into question by subsequent case law holding that transportation of narcotics does not generally constitute a drug trafficking offense. A panel of this court may not overrule a prior panel\u2019s decision in the absence of intervening contrary or superseding authority. <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Jaimes, </em>481 F.3d 283, 288 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-23\">The government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and its alternative motion for an extension of time to file <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>a brief is DENIED. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b452-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
