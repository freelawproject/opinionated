The Appellees have filed a motion for summary affirmance. Because this appeal does not present a substantial question, we will grant the motion. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Pierre pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and wire fraud. In July 2006, he was sentenced by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to forty-six months of incarceration. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment on July 17, 2008, 285 Fed.Appx. 828. On July 21, 2008, Pierre filed a petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the Distinct Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, the district where he was (and remains) confined. In his petition, Pierre alleged that the sentencing court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter judgment against him; the agents investigating his case violated due process, equal protection and the Fourth Amendment; and that he committed no crime. The District Court dismissed Pierre\u2019s petition. Pierre timely filed this appeal. For the reasons that follow, we will grant Appellee\u2019s motion for summary affirmance</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over the district court\u2019s legal conclusions, and review its factual findings for clear error. <em>See Lambert v. Blackwell, </em>134 F.3d 506, 512 (3d Cir.1998). Upon review, we conclude that the District Court properly dismissed the underlying 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition through which Pierre sought to challenge his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">A prisoner in custody may challenge his conviction and sentence in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding before the sentencing court. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>197 F.3d 644, 648 n. 2 (3d Cir.1999). An application for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief in the sentencing court, unless it appears that the remedy is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Cradle v. United States, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002). A motion pursuant to \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d only when some limitation of scope or procedures would prevent the prisoner from receiving adequate adjudication of his claims. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">As the District Court explained, the claims presented in Pierre\u2019s habeas petition fall within the purview of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, because Pierre sought to challenge his sentence and conviction. In addition, Pierre did not assert in his \u00a7 2241 petition that relief under \u00a7 2255 was ineffective or inadequate. Because the District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania is not the sentencing court and Pierre has not shown that relief under \u00a7 2255 would be inadequate or ineffective, the Court correctly concluded that he could not seek relief under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 538. We GRANT the Government\u2019s motion and will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Pierre\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
