He claims that he was only assisting in the robbery, had no supervisory authority, did not have a gun or partici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>pate in the murder, and was not the mastermind or organizer of the conspiracy. Finding no clear error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">We review a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). We have explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6J\">a trial court\u2019s choice between \u201ctwo permissible views of the evidence\u201d is the very essence of the clear error standard of review. So long as the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision is supported by the record <em>and </em>does not involve a misapplication of a rule of law, we believe that it will be rare for an appellate court to conclude that the sentencing court\u2019s determination is clearly erroneous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 945 (internal citation and footnote omitted). \u201cThe proponent of the downward adjustment ... always bears the burden of proving a mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 939. A district court may decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two levels if it finds that the defendant was a \u201cminor participant.\u201d U.S. SENTENCING GuideliNes Manual \u00a7 3B1.2(b) (2007). A \u201cminor participant\u201d is a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">In determining whether a minor-role adjustment applies, the district court should consider two principles: \u201cfirst, the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable at sentencing, and, second, [his] role as compared to that of other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940. As to the first prong, \u201c[o]nly if the defendant can establish that [he] played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which [he] has already been held accountable \u2014 not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy \u2014 should the district court grant a downward adjustment for minor role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. As to the second prong, a district court should look at other participants only to the extent that they (1) \u201care identifiable or discernable from the evidence\u201d and (2) \u201cwere involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The first prong may, in many cases, be dispositive. <em>Id. </em>at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">Jones knew of both the robbery plans and the use of guns to complete the robbery at Carlton Potts\u2019 residence. He also actively assisted in that robbery. He has not shown that he played a minor role in the relevant conduct for which he was held accountable.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">The district court\u2019s decision is also supported under the second prong. Jones argues that he was only assisting in a robbery and was not the supervisor, mastermind, or organizer of the conspiracy. But Jones, along with the other participants, beat the victims after forcing them to lie on the floor, searched the house, and stole drugs and money. And, according to the victims and his codefendant Jermaine Julian, he carried a gun into the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">Even if Jones were less culpable than Julian, who shot and killed Potts during the robbery, the district court did not clearly err in denying Jones a minor role reduction. <em>See id. </em>at 944 (stating that \u201c[t]he fact that a defendant\u2019s role may be less than that of other participants engaged in the relevant conduct may not be dispositive of role in the offense, since it is possible that none are minor or minimal participants\u201d). The district court\u2019s findings are supported by the record, and the court properly applied the two-prong <em>Rodriguez De Varon </em>analysis. The court\u2019s judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b919-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
