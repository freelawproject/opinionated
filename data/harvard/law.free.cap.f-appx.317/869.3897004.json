Six Unknown Named Agents of the Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>dismissed the complaint without prejudice because Martin\u2019s allegation of poverty was untrue, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(A). No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Martin\u2019s FTCA claim stemmed from an injury he received when he tripped on a sidewalk at the Federal Prison Camp Atlanta, where he was housed. He also alleged, under <em>Bivens, </em>that he received inadequate medical care for this injury in violation of the Eighth Amendment. With his complaint, on 26 July 2007, Martin submitted an affidavit of indigency, dated 22 May 2007, which indicated he received $200 a month from friends and relatives; and as of the date of the affidavit\u2019s execution, he had $33.36 in his prison bank account. His prison trust fund account statement \u2014 run on 24 May 2007 although it was supposed to cover the six-month period immediately preceding the filing of his complaint, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(2)\u2014 noted that he had received a total of <em>$1,818 in </em>deposits in the previous six months and had a maximum balance of $358.61 in the preceding 30 days. His average balance for the six-month period of the statement was $233.56 while the average monthly deposit was $303.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Martin had submitted the identical affidavit and prison trust fund account statement in another civil <em>action</em>\u2014Martin <em>v. Zenk, </em>1:06-CV-3065 (N.D.Ga.2007)\u2014filed in the same federal district and assigned to the same federal district court judge. In <em>Martin v. Zenk, </em>the district court concluded that Martin was unentitled to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and dismissed Martin\u2019s complaint without prejudice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-7\">Although it is true that as of May 22, 2007, the plaintiff had only $33.36 in his account, the prison records show that he had deposits of $1818.00 in the preceding six months and had a maximum balance of $358.61 in the preceding 30 days. The court finds that plaintiff had sufficient funds to prosecute this action but chose to spend those funds on matters other than this litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">This Court affirmed that dismissal stating that the dismissal without prejudice was proper in the light of Martin\u2019s failure to demonstrate poverty.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">In the instant suit, Martin again sought leave to proceed without the prepayment of fees or costs pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1) claiming that his poverty rendered him unable to make the required payments. In support of his request, Martin submitted the very same documents that he had submitted in <em>Martin v. Zenk </em>and on which the district court had ruled\u2014 a ruling we later affirmed \u2014 that the allegation of poverty was untrue. Again because the allegation of poverty was untrue, the district court denied Martin leave to proceed <em>informa pauperis. </em>Noting the compulsory language of section 1915(e)(2)(A) that a federal court \u201cshall dismiss\u201d a proceeding <em>in fomia pauperis </em>\u201cat any time if the court determines that the allegation of poverty is untrue,\u201d the district court dismissed Martin\u2019s case without prejudice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">Martin complains that the district court erred by not giving him the opportunity to explain the depletion in his account; and in support of his argument, Martin cites <em>Col</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number><em>lier v. Tatum, </em>722 F.2d 653 (11th Cir.1983). <em>Collier </em>was decided under a previous version of the IFP statute \u2014 then 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d) \u2014 which provided that the court \u201cmay dismiss the case if the allegation of poverty is untrue.\u201d <em>See Camp v. Oliver, </em>798 F.2d 434, 437 (11th Cir.1986) (noting that \u201c[u]nder the clear and unambiguous language of [former section 1915(d) ], dismissal is not mandatory, but discretionary.\u201d). Under that version of the statute, <em>Collier </em>said that where decreases in a prisoner\u2019s trust account are considered to be a basis for denial of indigent status, \u201cthe prisoner should be given some reasonable opportunity, after appropriate notice, to explain and refute any finding to that effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 656 <em>(quoting Evans v. Croom, </em>650 F.2d 521, 526 (4th Cir.1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Assuming arguendo that <em>Collier </em>applies to the revised IFP statute despite the use of the compulsory \u201cshall dismiss\u201d language over the now-discarded permissive \u201cmay dismiss\u201d language, we see no reversible error. Martin is not unfamiliar with the rules applicable to <em>in forma pauperis </em>applications. And Martin was on notice from his earlier submission of these documents that they failed to support his allegations of poverty. Fully advised of the inadequacy of this affidavit and prison trust statement to establish indigency, Martin relied on these documents without adding explanation or otherwise seeking to refute the district court\u2019s earlier rejection of these materials in <em>Martin v. Zenk. </em>Whatever process may be required to assure that a litigant has a full and fair opportunity to be heard, no litigant is entitled to be heard on the same question over and over again.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b892-6\">. Although the district court's dismissal was without prejudice, it may be that his FTCA claim was time-barred on the date of dismissal. Martin filed his complaint in July 2007, and the limitations period seems to have expired on his FTCA claim in August 2007, six months after the denial of his last administrative appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b). But be<em>cause </em>Martin has advanced no argument that the district court dismissal operated to prejudice his FTCA claim, we do not address the import of prejudice, if any exists. Also we make no intimations about prejudice on Martin\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim. From his complaint, it is unclear when the statute of limitations began.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
