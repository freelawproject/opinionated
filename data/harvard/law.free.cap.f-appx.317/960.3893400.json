The Board found that Ruiz failed to establish that he suffered past persecution on account of a protected ground. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-16\">Substantial evidence supports the finding by the Board that Ruiz failed to establish that his persecution was on account of a protected ground. <em>See Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004). Ruiz worked with a community organization to counsel youth against participation in guerilla activities, and he acknowledges that the guerillas threatened him and harmed his wife because his activities hampered their recruiting. \u201c[Evidence that ... is consistent with ... the petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with guerillas ... does not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 437-38 (11th Cir.2004). The record does not compel a finding of a connection between Ruiz\u2019s persecution and his political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-17\">We DENY Ruiz\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
