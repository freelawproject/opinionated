On appeal, Young argues that the district court erred by concluding that it lacked authority to grant his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">Generally, \u201c[w]e review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). However, in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context, we review <em>\u201cde novo </em>the district court's legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). We also review <em>\u201cde novo </em>questions of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Maupin, </em>520 F.3d 1304, 1306 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">A district court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except where expressly permitted by statute or by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B). One statutory exception to this general rule involves relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-13\">[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b979-14\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-15\">On November 1, 2007, the Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendment 706, which amended the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 706. The effect of Amendment 706 is to provide a two-level reduction in base offense levels for certain crack cocaine offenses. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b979-16\">Section 1B1.10 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides that a sentence reduction is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if \u201c[a]n amendment listed in subsection (c) [which includes Amendment 706] does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). The commentary elaborates that a reduction is not authorized if \u201can amendment listed in subsection (c) is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision <em>(e.g., </em>a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>ment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(A). In addition, Section 5G1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides that \u201c[w]here a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">In <em>United States v. Williams, </em>we considered whether the district court had the authority to grant a defendant a sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 706. <em>See </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1338 (11th Cir.2008). There, Williams\u2019s guideline range initially was 92 to 115 months\u2019 imprisonment, but because he faced a statutory minimum term of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, the district court determined that his range was 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 1338. Williams received a downward departure, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), based on his substantial assistance, and he was ultimately sentenced to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">In holding that the district court did not have the authority to grant Williams a sentence reduction, we recognized that \u201ca defendant whose original sentencing range was based on something other than \u00a7 2D1.1 is precluded from receiving a sentence reduction, since the amendment would not lower his applicable guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1339 (citing <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327). We concluded that the result was the same even if a defendant received a downward departure, because the departure would be from the statutory minimum and \u201cthe court\u2019s point of departure would not shift as a result of the amendment\u2019s lowering of the crack offense levels.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1340. In reaching this conclusion, we rejected Williams\u2019s argument that his \u201cguideline sentence\u201d was distinct from his \u201cguideline range,\u201d finding the \u201cattempted range/sentence distinction linguistically interesting but ultimately unpersuasive\u201d because, \u201c[f]or those situations in which the mandatory minimum exceeds the range for the entire offense level, the \u2018guideline sentence\u2019 would [ ] be the same as the \u2018guideline range,\u2019 even if it involves a \u2018range\u2019 of only one number.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1340-41. We also rejected the argument that a downward departure under \u00a7 3553(e) constituted a waiver or dispensing of the \u201cguideline range,\u201d seeing \u201cno indication in the statute that this decreased sentence should be read to somehow eliminate the otherwise applicable mandatory minimum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1341. In short, we concluded that \u201c[bjecause Williams was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum that replaced his original sentencing guideline range, he was not sentenced according to the base offense level in \u00a7 2D1.1, even taking into account the \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure. He thus would not fall within the scope of Amendment 706.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1342.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">Here, the district court correctly denied Young\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on its determination that Amendment 706 did not lower the guideline range that ultimately determined his sentence. Just as in <em>Williams, </em>Young\u2019s initial guideline range was entirely below the statutory minimum, so that his range became the statutory minimum. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). Also as in <em>Williams, </em>Young received a downward departure, so that the statutory minimum was the point from which the district court departed. Young\u2019s sentence was therefore based on the statutory minimum term of imprisonment, and the crack cocaine base offense level played no role in his sentence. <em>See Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1339-40. Because Young was not sentenced under the otherwise applicable base offense level found in \u00a7 2D1.1, the district court did not err in determining that Young was not eligible for relief under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>Amendment 706. <em>See id. </em>at 1339-40, 1342.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b981-18\">. Moreover, Young\u2019s assertion that defendants who provide substantial assistance should not be in a worse position than those who do not overlooks the fact that his substantial assistance enabled the district court originally to sentence him below the statutory minimum term of imprisonment, which it would not have been able to do otherwise. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e); <em>United States v. Ciszkowski, </em>492 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir.2007) (\"Even after <em>Booker, </em>the district court is bound by the statutoty mandatory minimums.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
