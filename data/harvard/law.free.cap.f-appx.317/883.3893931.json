We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-13\">In October 2005 Gunn received a loan of $500.00 from TitleMax and pledged the title to her car as a security. Gunn received a four-page Pawn Ticket that contained required federal and state disclosures. It also stated that the pledger could, by paying a \u201cpawnshop charge\u201d instead of any loan principal, create deferral periods in which TitleMax would continue to hold the security and delay the loan\u2019s due date for thirty more days. Repayment of the loan, in the amount of $579.95, was due on November 21, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-14\">Between November 2005 and July 2006 there were a number of transactions during which Gunn paid interest in the form of monthly pawnshop charges and, apparently, some of the principal but not all of it. On July 21, 2006 Gunn paid TitleMax interest in the amount of $63.93, and received a Customer Receipt showing that on August 21, 2006 she would owe $399.82 plus another interest payment in the amount of $63.93. The Customer Receipt contained no federal Truth in Lending Act (\u201cTILA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601 <em>et seq., </em>disclosures, but stated: \u201cYou are only required to pay the Interest Due amount in order to extend or renew the Pawn Ticket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b906-15\">Gunn filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in August 2006. TitleMax then made a claim in her bankruptcy case, asking for $463.75 and listing Gunn\u2019s car as collateral. Gunn responded by filing a two-count adversary complaint against Tit-leMax. Count 1 alleged that each of the monthly transactions between Gunn and TitleMax was a \u201cSubsequent Loan Agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>ment\u201d requiring new TILA disclosures. Count 2 asked the court to recognize that TitleMax\u2019s claim for $463.75 was independent of the original $500.00 pawn and thus unsecured. Gunn attached her original Pawn Ticket and her July 2006 Customer Receipt as Exhibits B and C to the complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">TitleMax filed a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), contending that the monthly transactions between November 2005 and July 2006 were merely extensions of the original pawn agreement and thus did not require TILA disclosures. The bankruptcy court granted TitleMax\u2019s motion, dismissing Gunn\u2019s complaint with prejudice. The district court affirmed. Gunn timely filed a notice of appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the legal conclusions of the bankruptcy court. <em>Asbestos Settlement Trust v. City of New York (In re Celotex Corp.), </em>487 F.3d 1320, 1328 (11th Cir.2007). In deciding a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, this Court accepts the factual allegations in the plaintiffs complaint and construes them in the light most favorable to her. <em>Young Apartments, Inc. v. Town of Jupiter, </em>529 F.3d 1027, 1037 (11th Cir.2008). However, the plaintiffs \u201cfactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). This Court is \u201cnot bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Papasan v. Attain, </em>478 U.S. 265, 286, 106 S.Ct. 2932, 2944, 92 L.Ed.2d 209 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">Gunn contends that TitleMax violated TILA\u2019s disclosure requirements in connection with their July 21, 2006 transaction. TILA requires meaningful disclosures to customers in consumer credit transactions, and in closed-end transactions like the ones between Gunn and TitleMax, the disclosures must be given before credit is extended. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601(a); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1638(b)(1); 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.18. The Federal Reserve Board has promulgated Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.1(a), to implement TILA. It has also issued Official Staff Interpretations of Regulation Z, and the Supreme Court has instructed that these interpretations be dispositive unless they are \u201cdemonstrably irrational.\u201d <em>Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, </em>444 U.S. 555, 565, 100 S.Ct. 790, 63 L.Ed.2d 22 (1980). Neither party disputes the applicability or rationality of Regulation Z and its Official Staff Interpretations.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">It is undisputed that \u201ca refinancing is a new transaction requiring new disclosures to the consumer,\u201d Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.20(a), but that a mere extension of an earlier deal, even if the terms change, does not trigger new disclosure requirements. 12 C.F.R. Pt. 226, Supp. I at \u00a7 226.20 (\u201cRedisclosure is no longer required for deferrals or extensions.\u201d).-Gunn labels the July 2006 transaction a \u201crefinancing\u201d of her November 2005 pawn. TitleMax labels the transaction a mere extension of the original pawn agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-14\">Gunn\u2019s- argument fails because it relies on two cases that were decided under an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>earlier, much friendlier set of regulations than those that existed in 2006 and on a contorted interpretation of the Alabama Pawnshop Act, Ala.Code \u00a7 5-19A-1 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Gunn relies primarily on <em>Dennis v. Handley, </em>453 F.Supp. 833 (N.D.Ala.1978), and on <em>Chapes, Ltd. v. Anderson (In re Scaife), </em>825 F.2d 357 (11th Cir.1987). Both cases involved diamond rings that were pawned. In both cases, further transactions repeatedly extended the pawns. Both courts, applying a pre-1982 version of Regulation Z, found that extensions of existing pawn agreements were refinancings and thus did require TILA disclosures. <em>Dennis, </em>453 F.Supp. at 835; <em>In re Scaife, </em>825 F.2d at 361. However, more than twenty years before the transactions between Gunn and TitleMax occurred in 2005 and 2006, the Federal Reserve Board created a new version of Regulation Z, which became mandatory in October 1982. <em>Compare </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8\u00a9 (1981) <em>with </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.20 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">The Official Staff Interpretation of the current Regulation Z states: \u201c1981 changes: While the previous regulation treated virtually any change in terms as a refinancing requiring new disclosures, this regulation limits refinancings to transactions in which the entire original obligation is extinguished and replaced by a new one. Redisclosure is no longer required for deferrals or extensions.\u201d 12 C.F.R. Pt. 226, Supp. I at \u00a7 226.20. Thus, the law has changed in a pivotal way since <em>Dennis </em>and <em>Scaife, </em>and the amended Regulation Z significantly narrows the field of transactions that qualify as \u201crefinancing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">The current regulations define \u201crefinancing\u201d as \u201cwhen an existing obligation ... is satisfied and replaced by a new obligation.\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.20(a). The Official Staff Interpretations of the regulation note that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-7\">[Wjhether a refinancing has occurred is determined by reference to whether the original obligation has been satisfied or extinguished and replaced by a new obligation .... Changes in the terms of an existing obligation, such as the deferral of individual installments, will not constitute a refinancing unless accomplished by the cancellation of that obligation and the substitution of a new obligation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">12 C.F.R. Pt. 226, Supp. I at \u00a7 226.20. Gunn contends that her original pawn was \u201ccancelled\u201d or \u201cextinguished\u201d within the meaning of 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.20 and its Official Staff Interpretation by the Alabama Pawnshop Act. Gunn argues that the Alabama Pawnshop Act cancelled her original November 2005 pawn because, in her view, the law \u201cdoes not make any provision whatsoever for the renewal or extension of the maturity date of the pawn transaction.\u201d However, Gunn\u2019s focus is misplaced. The provisions that she cites limit the amount of permissible pawnshop charges to 25 percent of the principal per month and grant the pledger thirty days\u2019 grace period beyond the original maturity date in which to redeem her pawn. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7\u00a7 5-19A-6; 5-19A-10(b); 5-19A-7(a). None of these sections of the Alabama Pawnshop Act prohibit pledgers and pawnbrokers from agreeing to extensions of the original maturity date. In fact, both the original Pawn Ticket given to Gunn in October 2005 and the Customer Receipt she received in July 2006 clearly provide for extensions of the original loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">The $579.95 that Gunn owed TitleMax was neither \u201csatisfied and replaced\u201d nor cancelled. Gunn\u2019s Customer Receipt, received in July 2006, gives no indication that TitleMax ever loaned Gunn any money beyond the $500.00 it had given her in October 2005, and Gunn does not claim otherwise. Neither party alleges that Gunn ever entirely paid the $579.95 that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>she owed TitleMax in November 2005, either on her own or with refinancing assistance from TitleMax.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Further, the receipt is divided into two categories, \u201cToday\u2019s Payment Details\u201d and \u201cNext Payment Information.\u201d It designates $399.82 as the \u201cPrincipal Due\u201d in August and refers to the possibility of extending or renewing the original Pawn Ticket. The only logical reading of the July 2006 Customer Receipt is that the \u201cPrincipal Due\u201d of $399.82 reflects the remaining principal due from the original loan. The Customer Receipt is not an inadequate new pawn ticket, but instead a receipt showing that Gunn made a monthly interest payment of $63.93 and that she owed another interest payment the next month. All of this relates to the original loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">There was no satisfaction and replacement nor cancellation, and thus no \u201crefinancing\u201d under TILA. No further disclosures were required. <em>See </em>Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 220(a). Accordingly, the facts that Gunn has pleaded do not state a claim under TILA, and the district court properly granted TitleMax\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">Gunn contends that because the Alabama Pawnshop Act allegedly cancelled the October 2005 pawn of her car, Title-Max\u2019s lien on her vehicle was extinguished and their July 2006 transaction was unsecured.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">However, the Alabama Pawnshop Act does not prohibit extensions or renewals of an initial maturity date, and the Pawn Ticket and Customer Receipt both allow for such extensions. Because we have concluded that the initial $500.00 pawn was merely extended, not satisfied and replaced nor cancelled, TitleMax\u2019s initial lien on Gunn\u2019s vehicle remains valid. Ala.Code \u00a7 5-19A-10(a) (\u201cA pawnbroker shall have a lien on the pledged goods for the money advanced and the pawnshop charge owed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-8\">. These documents are properly before us because Gunn incorporated them into her complaint. <em>See Bickley v. Caremark RX, Inc., </em>461 F.3d 1325, 1329 n. 7 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cwhere the plaintiff refers to certain documents in the complaint and those documents are central to the plaintiff's claim, then the Court may consider the documents part of the pleading for purposes of Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
