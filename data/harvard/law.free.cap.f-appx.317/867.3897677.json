No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-28\">Defendant offers no challenge to the revocation of his supervised release; he admitted to supervised release violations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>After considering the section 3553(a) factors, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court had the discretion to terminate Defendant\u2019s supervised release, extend it, or revoke it and sentence him to a term of prison. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). Defendant argues that the 24-month sentence imposed upon revocation is due to be reversed because the district court considered improperly Defendant\u2019s need for rehabilitation in imposing a prison term and because the sentence imposed was unreasonable under' section 3553(a). We review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Defendant cites 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a) in support of his contention that the district court abused its discretion when it factored rehabilitation into its decision to impose imprisonment upon revocation of Defendant\u2019s supervised release.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 3582(a) states in relevant part that \u201cimprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation.\u201d And in <em>United States v. Brown, </em>224 F.3d 1237, 1240 (11th Cir.2000), we said \u201ca court cannot impose an initial incarcerative sentence for the purpose of providing a defendant with rehabilitative treatment.\u201d But <em>Brown </em>also drew a distinction between an initial incarcera-tive sentence and a sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release: \u201ca court may consider a defendant\u2019s rehabilitative needs when imposing a specific incarcera-tive term following revocation of supervised release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). <em>See also, United States v. Wiggins, </em>220 F.3d 1248 (11th Cir.2000) (no abuse of discretion to consider drug treatment availability when imposing sentence upon revocation of supervised release). <em>Brown, </em>after examining the interplay between section 3583(e) \u2014 which, unlike section 3582, addresses revocation of supervised release specifically \u2014 and the section 3553(a) factors (which section 3583(e) requires a court to consider) identified a \u201cclear legislative mandate that a court must consider a defendant\u2019s need for correctional treatment when determining whether to revoke supervised release and sentence a defendant to prison.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1241. The district court\u2019s consideration of Defendant\u2019s need for rehabilitative treatment constituted no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">Defendant also contends that the 24-month within-guidelines-range sentence imposed just weeks before Defendant\u2019s term of supervised release was due to end was unreasonable. The deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of review applies to all sentences, \u201cwhether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Although we would ordinarily expect a sentence within the guideline range to be reasonable, that expectation still must be measured against the record. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). The section 3553(a) factors must be considered in fashioning a reasonable sentence upon revocation of supervised release, together with the advisory policy statements in Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">A review of the record shows that the district court considered the applicable guideline range, Defendant\u2019s criminal his<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>tory, the many opportunities he had been afforded, his need for rehabilitation and vocational training, and the need to protect the community. Also, the record demonstrates that Defendant already had violated the terms of his supervised release at least twice. The record offers scant support for Defendant\u2019s claim that the district court did not consider properly the section 3553(a) factors; nothing in the record undermines this Court\u2019s ordinary expectation of reasonableness for a within-guideline-range sentence. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-19\">. The warrant issued for Defendant's arrest for violation of supervised release included two new substantive violations \u2014 cocaine possession and tampering with evidence \u2014 and a number of technical violations. The government did not pursue the cocaine possession charge at the revocation hearing; Defendant admitted all other violations, except the evidence tampering charge. After hearing testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>mony, the district court found Defendant guilty of the evidence tampering charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b890-7\">. The government argues that plain error review applies because this sentencing challenge was not raised below. Because we conclude that no error \u2014 plain or otherwise \u2014 has been shown, we do not address this contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
