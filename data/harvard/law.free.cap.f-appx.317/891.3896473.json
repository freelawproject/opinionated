These charges stemmed from three transactions in which Leeks purchased eight firearms from federal firearms licensees. In each transaction, Leeks completed a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Form 4473, in which he indicated that he was the actual buyer of the firearms listed on the form. Subsequent events and investigation revealed that this information was false and that the firearms were later illegally transferred to other parties. Three of the guns were ultimately recovered by law enforcement: the first after a suicide in Virginia; the second during an arrest for delivery of crack cocaine in New York; and the third at the home of a convicted felon in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">On January 24, 2008, Leeks pleaded guilty to one count of the indictment. The sentencing hearing was held on May 6, 2008. At the hearing, the district court reviewed the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Neither party objected to the portion of the PSI that identified an offense level of 17<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and criminal history category of III,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which resulted in a guideline range of 30 to 37 months imprisonment. Leeks did object, however, to the portion of the PSI in which the probation officer recommended an upward departure to 51 months imprisonment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, because Leeks\u2019 criminal history category \u201csubstantially under-represented the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history, and particularly the likelihood that he will commit future crimes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-12\">Defense counsel acknowledged that Leeks had been convicted of ten other crimes, but only three of them were assigned criminal, history points. She argued that the convictions that did not receive points should not be. considered by the district court for two reasons: (1) consideration of these convictions would violate <em>Alabama v. Shelton, </em>535 U.S. 654, 122 S.Ct. 1764, 152 L.Ed.2d 888 (2002), as they were obtained without the aid of counsel; and (2) these crimes involved minor misdemeanors and traffic offenses. Leeks, his mother, and a woman with whom he has a daughter thereafter testified as to Leeks\u2019 rehabilitation and good relationship with his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-13\">The government agreed that the district court should not assign criminal history points for convictions that were unconstitutionally obtained, but argued that it could look at Leeks\u2019 prior conduct to show a high risk of recidivism. The government ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>gued that the convictions that did not result in criminal history points painted the true picture of Leeks: one of a repeat offender. The probation officer told the district court that the records for these convictions could not be obtained, and thus it could not be verified whether Leeks did or did not have counsel during those proceedings. She stated that by virtue of the inability to include these convictions in determining Leeks\u2019 criminal history, \u201che was spared a total of ten criminal history points.\u201d She also took issue with defense counsel\u2019s characterization of Leeks\u2019 crimes as minor, noting that one of these crimes involved, <em>inter alia, </em>fleeing from the police while an unrestrained toddler was in the car. She noted that the crimes for which points were assigned, including felony possession of cocaine and MDMA, did not tell the full story of Leeks\u2019 criminal activity because other charges were dropped after a plea agreement was procured, including charges related to Leeks\u2019 possession of marijuana and a gun at the time of the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">The district court ultimately imposed a sentence of 48 months imprisonment, 3 years supervised release, a $2,400 fine, and a $100 special assessment. In doing so, the court acknowledged the 30 to 37 month guideline sentence range and that it did not consider the allegedly uncounselled convictions in determining Leeks\u2019 criminal history, but stated that these convictions did nonetheless \u201cshow[] continual misbehavior and criminal conduct.\u201d The court emphasized that Leeks\u2019 arrest record indicated a pattern of criminal conduct, beginning at age 17 and continuing to his then present age of 27. The district court noted that Leeks\u2019 record indicated that he \u201cdoes not look as if [he has] been very interested in living within the confines of the law.\u201d The district court listened to Leeks\u2019 witnesses who testified that despite his past indiscretions, Leeks had matured. The court disagreed, however, noting that Leeks\u2019 most recent crime was the possession of cocaine and MDMA, evidencing that he had recently \u201cgraduated from misdemeanors into felonies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">The district court also discussed the distinct circumstances of this case. The guns that were recovered had fallen into the hands of criminals and were used for the purposes of criminal activity. The court noted that five guns were still unaccounted for and \u201cpeople who are otherwise law abiding will in all likelihood suffer.\u201d Lastly, the court pointed out that there was very little evidence in Leeks\u2019 record of legitimately earned income, positing that Leeks might support himself through ill-gotten gains.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">Leeks now appeals his sentence, arguing that its imposition was procedurally unreasonable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">At the outset, this court must determine whether the district court\u2019s deviation from the Guidelines sentencing range represents an upward departure, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a), or a variance, under 18 U.S.G. \u00a7 3553(a). Although either section can be used by a district court in concluding whether to deviate from the Guidelines range, they require the consideration of different factors. <em>See United States v. Irizarry, </em>458 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>Based on a review of the record and applicable factors, we conclude that the district court imposed a variance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(a). First, in the \u201cStatement of Reasons,\u201d which was issued by the court on the date of sentencing, the court checked boxes under a section entitled \u201cReason(s) for Sentence Outside the Advisory Guideline System,\u201d indicating that it relied upon three \u00a7 3553(a) factors in deviating from the Guidelines range. Notably, it did not check any boxes under another section entitled \u201cReason(s) for Departure,\u201d which included \u201c4A1.3 Criminal History Inadequacy.\u201d Second, although the district court did not expressly reference \u00a7 3553(a) at sentencing, a review of the record indicates that its analysis focused upon \u00a7 3553(a) factors, such as the nature and circumstances of the offense and the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense. The district court\u2019s application of these factors is discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">We review the procedural reasonableness of a district court\u2019s sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing unreasonableness. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Although the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer considered mandatory, they must be consulted and considered by the district court. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 264, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The Supreme Court has explained that our review of the procedural reasonableness of a district court\u2019s sentencing decision should focus upon considerations \u201csuch as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">Both parties agree that Guidelines range was properly calculated and was considered by the district court. Leeks contends, however, that the district court subsequently erred in granting a variance from the Guidelines range. Leeks argues that the court did not consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, its analysis included an overemphasized and inaccurate categorization of Leeks\u2019 criminal history, and it im-permissibly considered the circumstances surrounding the instant offense for which Leeks was being sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">Section 3553(a) includes a list of factors which a court should consider before granting a variance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-9\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need \u201cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant;\u201d (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the sentencing guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-10\"><em>Irizarry, </em>458 F.3d at 1211 n. 2. The weight given to particular sentencing factors is committed to the sound discretion of the district court. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">In this case, the district court\u2019s \u201cStatement of Reasons\u201d indicates, and the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>confirms, that it chiefly relied on three \u00a7 3553(a) factors in choosing to impose a sentence greater than that of the Guidelines range: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; and (3) the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant. We have held that when considering a variance, a district court need not \u201cstate on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or [ ] discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Although uncounselled convictions may not be used to compute a defendant\u2019s criminal history category, <em>United States v. Gray, </em>367 F.3d 1263, 1273 (11th Cir.2004), they may be used to determine the defendant\u2019s character. <em>United States v. Peagler, </em>847 F.2d 756, 758 (11th Cir.1988). Leeks has ten convictions, three of which are for drugs offenses involving possession of three types of drugs. Leeks has enabled guns to fall into the hands of felons and drug dealers and has almost no legitimate income. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Leeks\u2019 \u201ccriminal activity has been consistent for many years,\u201d \u201chis arrest[s] have increased in frequency and severity over time,\u201d and he \u201chas not demonstrated at this point that he is anything but a drug dealer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">The district court\u2019s consideration of the circumstances surrounding the crime for which it sentenced him were also proper. Leeks argues that the Guidelines range already reflected the circumstances of this case, and that a variance based on consideration of these facts essentially results in double-counting. This position, however, is undermined by both the purpose of the Sentencing Guidelines and the text of \u00a7 3553. The Supreme Court\u2019s holding that the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, as articulated in <em>Booker, </em>reflects the understanding that although the Guidelines estimate a reasonable sentence, they cannot account for the individual particularities of each case. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 264-65, 125 S.Ct. 738 (treating the Guidelines as advisory helps \u201cto avoid excessive sentencing disparities while maintaining flexibility sufficient to individualize sentences where necessary\u201d). Moreover, the text of \u00a7 3553 specifically mandates that in reaching a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d the court should consider factors such as the circumstances and seriousness of the offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In concluding that a variance was warranted, the district court did not abuse its discretion in considering that Leeks\u2019 crime involved three separate unlawful purchases. It noted that the guns procured in these transactions have fallen into the hands of felons, have been used during the commission of crimes, and have already resulted in one death. The district court also noted that the public may later be harmed by Leeks\u2019 crime because five other guns are yet to be recovered and may be used to harm others.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">For the aforementioned reasons, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a variant sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-9\">.
