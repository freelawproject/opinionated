Vining, proceeding pro se, then filed on October 12, 2005, a motion to reopen the case in the District Court, stating only that the \u201cDistrict Court decision conflicts with decision of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.\u201d The District court denied his motion without explanation on October 18, 2005. Nearly three years later, Vining filed a motion to proceed in forma pauperis and a motion for leave to file an amended complaint, both of which the District Court denied without explanation. Vining then filed the instant appeal on September 11, 2008, and this Court granted his IFP motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">We have appellate jurisdiction over this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and review it for possible dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). An appeal must be dismissed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if it has no arguable basis in law or fact. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). Because we determine that the appeal is lacking in arguable legal merit, we will dismiss it under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">Vining\u2019s motions are subject to the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 7(b)(1), which states that motions must \u201cbe in writing unless made during a hearing or trial; state with particularity the grounds for seeking the order; and state the relief sought.\u201d However, Vining offered the District Court nothing in support of any of his motions. The District Court had no basis on which to reopen his case, grant his IFP motion, or grant him leave to amend his complaint. Similarly, this Court finds nothing, construing his submissions as broadly as possible, that demonstrates the District Court erred in dismissing Vining\u2019s motions. <em>See Alston v. Parker, </em>363 F.3d 229, 234 (3d Cir.2004)(\u201cpro se complaints in particular should be construed liberally.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">As a result, we determine that Vining\u2019s appeal is lacking in arguable legal merit, and will dismiss it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
