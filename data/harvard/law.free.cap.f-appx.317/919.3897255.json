Mantecon-Zayas argues that the district court committed harmful Booker<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth below, we vacate and remand for re-sentencing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">\n<em>1.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">In a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), a probation officer outlined the drug importation activities for which Mantecon-Zayas was charged and other, activities learned by the government before and during trial. The probation officer used the drug amounts associated with this offense conduct and (1) set Mantecon-Zayas\u2019s base offense level at 40, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.4, because he was responsible for 162,404 kilograms of marijuana; (2) applied a 4-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, because Mantecon-Zayas was an organizer and leader of the conspiracy; (3) set Mante-con-Zayas\u2019s criminal history category at II; and (4) determined that, given these calculations, Mantecon-Zayas\u2019s guideline imprisonment'range was life. Mantecon-Zayas objected to, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) the calculation of the drug amount for which he was responsible; (2) the calculation of his criminal history category; (3) the consideration of Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) evidence learned before and during trial, and (4) the refusal to grant a downward departure based on Mantecon-Zayas\u2019s substantial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-14\">At a sentencing hearing, Mantecon-Za-yas argued, with regard to his Rule 404(b) objection, that the activities were not charged or proven beyond a reasonable doubt and that the Supreme Court repeatedly had held that a sentencing court should not use such uncharged, unproven evidence. Mantecon-Zayas also objected to receiving a four-level role enhancement. The district court (1) sustained the criminal-history-category objection, reasoning that the appropriate category was I; (2) overruled the Rule 404(b) objection, reasoning that the amounts of drugs associated with the charged drug-importation activities were sufficient to support the base offense level; (3) denied the downward-departure request, reasoning that government had not filed a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion; and (4) sustained the role-enhancement objection, reasoning that, though there was evidence that Mantecon-Zayas organized the conspiracy, there also was evidence that Mantecon-Zayas played <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>a lesser role and the sentences contemplated already were large. The district court acknowledged that sustaining the criminal-history-category objection was a \u201cstretch,\u201d but stated that it believed the \u201cmild stretch\u201d was warranted because it was \u201cbother[ed]\u201d that Mantecon-Zayas was subject to approximately 25 years\u2019 or more imprisonment while one of his co-conspirators only was subject to less than half that term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">The district court determined that, given its rulings, Mantecon-Zayas\u2019s base offense level was 40, criminal history category was I, and guideline imprisonment range was 292 to 365 months. The district court sentenced Mantecon-Zayas to 300 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court indicated that, while another district court might sentence Mantecon-Zayas to a harsher sentence given the amount of cocaine involved in the offense, it \u201c[did not] believe in burying someone\u201d and was influenced to be lenient by Mantecon-Zayas\u2019s age and family. The district court also indicated that it would not be too lenient because it recognized that whether Mantecon-Zayas deserved a harsh or lenient sentence could be \u201cargued both ways.\u201d Pursuant to Mantecon-Zayas\u2019s motion to modify his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in 1997, the district court re-sentenced Mantecon-Zayas to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">In <em>Booker, </em>decided in January 2005, the Supreme Court reaffirmed that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 543 U.S. at 243^4, 125 S.Ct. at 755-56. The Supreme Court also determined that the then-mandatory nature of the Guidelines implicated the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial and excised those provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act that made the Guidelines mandatory and binding on federal courts and held that courts of appeals must review sentences for \u201cunreasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244-245, 259, 125 S.Ct. at 756-57, 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">Under <em>Booker, </em>there are two types of error that a district court might commit in sentencing a defendant: constitutional and statutory. <em>United States v. Lee, </em>427 F.3d 881, 891 (11th Cir.2005). A constitutional <em>Booker </em>error under the Sixth Amendment \u201coccurs when extra-verdict enhancements are used to reach a result under [the Guidelines] that is binding on the sentencing judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A statutory <em>Booker </em>error \u201cconsists in sentencing a defendant under the Guidelines as if they were mandatory and not advisory, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment violation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">A defendant who wishes to argue that a district court committed a <em>Booker </em>error may preserve such an argument in a number of ways. <em>See United States v. Munoz, </em>430 F.3d 1357, 1374 (11th Cir.2005). For example, a defendant successfully preserves a <em>Booker </em>claim when he objects before the district court that a fact relevant to a sentencing enhancement \u201cshould go to the jury\u201d or be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Dowling, </em>403 F.3d 1242, 1245 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">When the defendant successfully preserves the issue, we review the <em>Booker </em>claim under a harmless error standard. <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291-92 (11th Cir.2005). There are two applicable harmless error standards: one standard that applies to constitutional <em>Booker </em>errors and one standard that applies to statutory <em>Booker </em>errors. <em>Id. </em>A constitutional <em>Booker </em>error is harmless if the government can show, beyond a rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>sonable doubt, that the error did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence. A statutory <em>Booker </em>error is harmless if we determine that, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, the error did not affect or had a very slight effect on the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">\n<em>III.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">The district court committed a <em>Booker </em>error that affected Mantecon-Za-yas\u2019s sentence. <em>See Lee, </em>427 F.3d at 891; <em>Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1291-92. First, the district court committed at least statutory <em>Booker </em>error, as it sentenced Mantecon-Zayas before the Guidelines were rendered advisory only. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244-245, 259, 125 S.Ct. at 756-57, 764; <em>Lee, </em>427 F.3d at 891. It is not clear if the district court also committed constitutional <em>Booker </em>error. We need not determine, however, if the district court committed a Sixth Amendment violation because Mantecon-Zayas merits relief based on the statutory <em>Booker </em>error alone, as discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">Also, Mantecon-Zayas preserved the <em>Booker-error </em>claim, as he argued at sentencing that the extra-verdict activities were not charged or proven beyond a reasonable doubt and, therefore, should not be used in determining his sentence. <em>See United States v. Munoz, </em>430 F.3d 1357, 1374 (11 Cir.2005); <em>Dowling, </em>403 F.3d at 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">Furthermore, this statutory <em>Booker </em>error does not pass harmless error review, since the record viewed as a whole does not suggest that it did not affect or had a very slight effect on Mantecon-Zayas\u2019s sentence, as the district court indicated some desire to impose a sentence lower than the guideline imprisonment range. <em>See Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1291-92. Specifically, the district court sustained the role-enhancement objection, although it was a \u201cstretch\u201d to do so, in part because it believed that Mantecon-Zayas\u2019s sentence already was large enough and in part because it was bothered that Mantecon-Za-yas\u2019s guideline imprisonment range was higher than that of a codefendant. The district court thereby indicated that it did not believe that a Guideline sentence was entirely appropriate for the circumstances presented. Therefore, because the district court committed a harmful <em>Booker </em>error, we vacate the sentence imposed and remand <em>for </em>resentencing under an advisory Guidelines scheme.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-10\">. <em>United. States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b942-11\">. Mantecon-Zayas also argues that the district court erred in sentencing him when he was not present and in failing to verify that he had reviewed the presentence investigation report (\"PSI\u201d). Because we must vacate and remand on the <em>Booker </em>issue, however, we need not address these arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b942-12\">. We note that the district court originally sentenced Mantecon-Zayas in 1993. However, pursuant to a granted 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence, the district court vacated Mantecon-Zayas\u2019s original sentence and imposed an identical sentence, on August 29, 2007. The purpose of the amended judgment was to allow Mantecon-Zayas to file a technically out-of-time direct appeal, under <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>225 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2000). Accordingly, the instant notice of appeal, filed on August 30, 2007, was timely, and we have jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b944-8\">. The government agrees that Mantecon-Za-yas should be resentenced and we appreciate such candor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
