McCann appeals a condition of probation that was imposed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3563 after he pleaded guilty to taking over the limit of ducks, violating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>non-toxic shot requirements, and hunting migratory birds with an unplugged gun in violation of 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 703. McCann\u2019s argument that the hunting restriction that was imposed as a condition of his probation is an occupational restriction that runs afoul of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5F1.5 is unavailing. The Sentencing Guidelines do not apply to misdemeanor convictions such as McCann\u2019s. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">McCann\u2019s argument that the hunting restriction is a greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary to meet the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 is likewise unavailing. The number of ducks attributed to McCann in connection with the instant conviction was double the daily bag limit. The offense occurred on McCann\u2019s property. McCann\u2019s criminal history included other hunting violations. Thus, the hunting restriction satisfied those \u00a7 3553(a) factors directed at deterrence, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and McCann\u2019s history and characteristics. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3563(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Moreover, the hunting restriction does not deprive McCann of liberty or property beyond what is reasonably necessary to meet the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a)(2). McCann is not restricted from being on his farm for purposes unrelated to hunting when hunting is not occurring; nor is he precluded from managing or supervising activities on his property through an agent when hunting is occurring. Given that McCann committed the hunting violations on property he owns, the hunting restriction as a condition of his probation was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Cothran, </em>302 F.3d 279, 290 (5th Cir. 2002); <em>United States v. Merritt, </em>639 F.2d 254, 256 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b427-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4. \u2022</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
