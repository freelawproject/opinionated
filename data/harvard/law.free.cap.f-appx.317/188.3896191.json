The District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>also denied Barger\u2019s motions to file an amended complaint, for reconsideration, and to vacate. Barger filed the instant appeal on August 11, 2008. Because the appeal is lacking in arguable legal merit, we will dismiss it under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">In December 2006, Barger, an inmate at Westmoreland County Prison, initiated a pro se civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Barger alleged that he was deprived timely medical treatment for a sprained right ankle, a staph infection in his ears, and hemorrhoids. In his complaint, Barger checked the \u201cNo\u201d box when asked if he first exhausted his claims in the state prisoner grievance procedure, stating that he \u201cfiled once before on similar matter (medical), dismissed by Warden!\u201d Barger named both the warden of his prison, John Walton, and Naph-Care, Inc. as defendants in his action, and sought both monetary and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">In May 2008, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). Bar-ger, in turn, filed a response, admitting that he had not filed an administrative grievance because a prison guard had allegedly threatened to put him in the \u201chole\u201d (administrative custody) if he pursued this remedy. To substantiate this claim, Bar-ger attached an \u201cInmate Request Slip\u201d dated November 29, 2006, where he wrote that an unnamed Sergeant intimidated him and, consequently, he \u201cwill not be filing a grievance against jail/medical for not responding to my request for medical attention on July 12, 2006.\u201d The form did not contain a response by prison personnel; however, Barger attached another Inmate Request Slip that indicated that his previously filed grievances received official responses. Barger also filed a motion to amend the complaint to include the allegation that Defendant Naph-Care, Inc. acted under color of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">In June 2008, the Magistrate Judge filed an R &amp; R recommending that Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss be granted and Barger\u2019s motion to file an amended complaint be denied. Barger filed a motion for reconsideration and two motions to vacate the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation, in which he reaffirmed his contention that he did not pursue an administrative grievance because he was intimidated. The District Court dismissed Barger\u2019s action and denied his motions to file an amended complaint, for reconsideration, and to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">We have appellate jurisdiction over this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our standard of review of the District Court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is plenary. <em>Atkinson v. LaFayette College, </em>460 F.3d 447, 451 (3d Cir.2006). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), an appeal must be dismissed if it has no arguable basis in law or fact. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">The Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) mandates that a prisoner exhaust any available administrative remedies before bringing a \u00a7 1983 suit in federal court. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a); <em>Spruill v. Gillis, </em>372 F.3d 218 (3d Cir.2004). An inmate must exhaust his administrative remedies irrespective of the forms of relief sought and offered through administrative avenues. <em>Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 741 n. 6, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">Barger admitted when he filed his complaint on December 6, 2006 that he had not filed an administrative grievance. He justified this omission by citing the dismissal of a previously filed administrative grievance that also challenged the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>prison\u2019s medical care. However, futility is not an exception to the mandatory requirement of exhaustion. <em>Nyhuis v. Reno, </em>204 F.3d 65, 71-72 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Barger also argues that his failure to exhaust should be excused because he was threatened with retaliation. We have never addressed in a precedential opinion whether threats of retaliation excuse exhaustion. Assuming arguendo that they do, we agree with the District Court that Barger has not made a sufficient showing of intimidation. As the District Court noted, the evidence Barger provided is also inconsistent with his main allegation. Bar-ger\u2019s contention that he was too intimidated to file an administrative grievance conflicts with his submission of an \u201cInmate Request Form\u201d directly to the Warden in which he documents this threat. Furthermore, Barger was evidently not deterred from filing the instant lawsuit regarding his medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Failure to properly exhaust is sufficient to warrant dismissal of a \u00a7 1983 action, and, therefore, we need not address whether the District Court properly denied Barger\u2019s remaining motions. Because Barger\u2019s appeal is lacking in arguable legal merit, we will dismiss it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). The motions for appointment of counsel are denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
