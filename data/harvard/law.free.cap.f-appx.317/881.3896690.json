Rich argues that (1) his federal habeas petition was timely because he filed it within one year of exhausting all state remedies, and the time spent learning and preparing before filing state challenges should not count towards the one-year statute of limitations for filing federal habeas claims; (2) equitable tolling should ajoply because his pleadings were properly filed with no undue delay, no prejudice to the state, and no files lost or misplaced; and (3) the time-bar should not apply to him because he is actually innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination that a petition for federal habeas relief is time-barred, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). <em>Bond v. Moore, </em>309 F.3d 770, 772 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">The AEDPA imposes a one-year statute of limitations for filing \u00a7 2254 habeas petitions. The statute of limitations begins to ran following one of four events, including \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final....\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). The AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations is tolled when a \u201cproperly filed\u201d motion for post-conviction relief is \u201cpending\u201d in state court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2); <em>Webster v. Moore, </em>199 F.3d 1256, 1257-58 (11th Cir.2000). However, the two-year period allowed for filing a Florida post-conviction motion does not expand the AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitation period. <em>Tinker v. Moore, </em>255 F.3d 1331, 1334-35 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">The statute of limitations can also be equitably tolled when a petitioner \u201cuntimely files because of extraordinary circumstances that are both beyond his control and unavoidable even with diligence.\u201d <em>Steed v. Head, </em>219 F.3d 1298, 1300 (11th Cir.2000) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). This remedy is extraordinary, and the petitioner bears the burden of showing that it is warranted. <em>Drew v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>297 F.3d 1278, 1286 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">We have not ruled whether the time-bar for filing a federal petition constitutes an unconstitutional suspension of the writ of habeas corpus when the petitioner can show actual innocence and \u00a7 2244(d)\u2019s limitation period has expired. <em>See Wyzykowski v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>226 F.3d 1213, 1218 (11th Cir.2000) (declining to rule upon the constitutional question until the district court reviewed the merits of the actual innocence claim). Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has held that \u201c \u2018[ajctual innocence\u2019 means factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency.\u201d <em>Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 1611, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998). Thus, to meet the actual innocence standard, a habeas petitioner must show that \u201cin light of all the evidence, it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Actual innocence claims must also be supported \u201cwith new reliable evidence \u2014 whether it be exculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence \u2014 that was not presented at trial.\u201d <em>Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 324, 115 S.Ct. 851, 865, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">We find no reversible error here. First, the district court did not err in dismissing Rich\u2019s petition as time-barred under \u00a7 2244(d). Although Rich filed a motion for state post-conviction relief within the two-year period allowed by Florida <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>law, his doing so did not preclude \u00a7 2244(d)\u2019s one-year time limit to file a federal habeas petition. <em>Tinker, </em>255 F.3d at 1334-35. Because about two-and-a-half years of untolled time passed between Rich\u2019s conviction becoming final and his filing for federal habeas relief, his federal habeas petition is time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Second, Rich is not entitled to equitable tolling because he has not shown that extraordinary circumstances prevented him from timely filing his federal habeas petition. Rich fails to allege any circumstances beyond his control, but instead argues that equitable tolling should apply because he is a pro <em>se </em>litigant who actively pursued his legal remedies by timely filing his motion for state post-conviction relief, without undue delay or prejudice to the state. But Rich\u2019s pro se status and his conformity with state law are not extraordinary circumstances that could have prevented him from filing his federal habeas petition on time. <em>See Tinker, </em>255 F.3d at 1334-35. Consequently, Rich fails to meet his burden of showing that equitable tolling should apply. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Finally, Rich is not entitled to an actual innocence exception to the \u00a7 2244(d) time-bar because he has presented no new evidence of his factual innocence. Instead, he argues that the state\u2019s evidence at his trial was insufficient to support his conviction. Rich\u2019s argument is not based on new reliable evidence and fails to show that \u201cit is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him.\u201d <em>Bousley, </em>523 U.S. at 623, 118 S.Ct. at 1611.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Rich\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
