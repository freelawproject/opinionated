Specifically, Boles contends that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A) by finding that the gun was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-11\">The sentencing guidelines provide for an increase in a defendant\u2019s base offense level by two points if the offense involved a stolen firearm. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A). At his sentencing hearing, Boles objected to that enhancement. \u201cWhen a defendant objects to a factual finding that is used in calculating his guideline sentence, the government bears the burden of establishing the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1022 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation and alterations omitted). Here the district court found, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that Boles\u2019 sawed-off shotgun had been stolen. We review that finding only for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d 1134, 1136-37 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-13\">Boles contends that the district court clearly erred because the government did not prove the gun was stolen. We disagree. We need look no further than Boles\u2019 own statements. In a post-arrest interview, Boles told Agent Luis Valoze that the man who sold him the gun had said that the gun was stolen. Boles also told the agent that he purchased the gun for $10. Agent Valoze testified to those facts at the sentencing hearing. Boles argues that his statements are insufficient to establish that the gun was stolen because they are hearsay and otherwise unreliable. Even if Boles\u2019 statements contain hearsay, they may be considered during sentencing because they contain \u201csufficient indicia of reliability.\u201d <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>231 F.3d 750, 760 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6Al.3(a). Boles\u2019s statements were made during a videotaped interview shortly after his arrest. He described in detail how he acquired the weapon and he told the officers that the man who sold it to him had stolen the weapon from another man\u2019s house on the west side of Savannah, Georgia. The district court did not err in relying on those statements. Based on Boles\u2019 testimony and the extremely low purchase price for the gun \u2014 $10\u2014we are not left with a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\u201d in the district court\u2019s findings of fact. <em>See United States v. Foster, </em>155 F.3d 1329, 1331 (11th Cir.1998). The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>court properly enhanced Boles sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
