The District Court granted Appellees AUSA <em>Sheth</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>AUSA McGettigan, BOP attorney Howard, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>FDC-Philadelphia\u2019s motion to dismiss Thomas\u2019 complaint. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Thomas is a federal inmate who was incarcerated at FDC-Philadelphia between April 27, 2005, and August 27, 2007, while awaiting trial on narcotics and money laundering charges. On two occasions in March 2007, AUSAs Sheth and McGetti-gan, the prosecutors assigned to Thomas\u2019 case, requested and acquired Thomas\u2019 prison records from FDC-Philadelphia. The records contained, among other things, approximately 1,500 of Thomas\u2019 telephone calls from within the prison. Thomas filed suit, alleging that Howard and FDC-Philadelphia lacked authority to give, and that Sheth, McGettigan and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office lacked authority to receive, these records per provisions of the federal Privacy Act, the Stored Communications Act, and the Wiretap Act. We now turn to those statutes in that order.</p>\n<p id=\"A0r\">\n<em>Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551, et seq.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In his complaint, Thomas alleged that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and FDC-Philadelphia violated \u00a7 552a(b) of the Privacy Act, which prevents a government agency from disclosing \u201cany record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency,\u201d barring certain exceptions. An agency\u2019s failure to comply with that provision subjects the agency to civil liability, if the aggrieved party can demonstrate that he or she was adversely effected by that failure to comply. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(g)(l)(D). Here, the District Court correctly found that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and FDC-Philadelphia\u2019s actions were shielded by exceptions to \u00a7 552a(b). <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552a(a)(7), (b)(3), (e)(4), and (j)(2); Privacy Act of 1974, 63 Fed. Reg. 8659-02 (Feb. 20, 1998), 1998 WL 66517. Therefore, Thomas has failed to state a claim under the Privacy Act.</p>\n<p id=\"A5V\">\n<em>Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701, et seq.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Thomas next alleged that each one of the Appellees violated \u00a7 2703(c) of the \u2022Stored Communications Act. That provision prevents a \u201cprovider of electronic communication service or remote computing service\u201d from disclosing certain records of \u201ca subscriber to or customer of such service\u201d to a \u201cgovernmental entity,\u201d unless the entity is, for example, acting pursuant to valid warrant, a court order, or the consent of the \u201csubscriber or customer.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2703(e)(1)(A)-(C). As a preliminary matter, it is most doubtful that FDC-Philadelphia is a \u201cprovider of electronic communication service or remote computing service,\u201d or that Thomas is a \u201csubscriber or customer\u201d of FDC-Philadelphia, for purposes of the Stored Communications Act. Nonetheless, the District Court properly found that the Appellees were exempt from liability under the statute. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2703(c)(1)(A), (e), 2707(a) and 2707(e). Therefore, Thomas has failed to state a claim under the Stored Communications Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">\n<em>Wiretap Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510, et seq.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">Finally, Thomas alleged that each of the Appellees violated \u00a7 2511(1) of the Wiretap Act, which proscribes the intentional, unauthorized interceptions and disclosures of wire, oral and electronic communications. As Thomas concedes, however, he had given prior consent for FDC-Philadelphia to monitor and record his phone calls. This is fatal to his claims against Sheth, McGettigan, and Howard. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(c) (\u201cIt shall not be unlawful under this chapter for a person acting under color of law to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication, where ... one of the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>to the communication has given prior consent to such interception\u201d). In addition, the Wiretap Act exempts the United States, and therefore the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and FDC-Philadelphia, from liability, barring certain conditions not present in this case. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2520(a) and 2712. Therefore, the District Court correctly found that Thomas failed to state a claim under the Wiretap Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\n<em>Futility of Amending the Complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\u201c[I]n the event a complaint fails to state a claim, unless amendment would be futile, the District Court must give a plaintiff the opportunity to amend her complaint.\u201d <em>Phillips v. County of Allegheny, </em>515 F.3d 224, 228 (3d Cir.2008); <em>see also Alston v. Parker, </em>363 F.3d 229, 235 (3d Cir.2004) (\u201ceven when a plaintiff does not seek leave to amend, if a complaint is vulnerable to 12(b)(6) dismissal, a District Court must permit a curative amendment, unless an amendment would be inequitable or futile\u201d) (citing <em>Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 108 (3d Cir.2002)). Because Thomas cannot circumvent the layers of exemptions from liability in each of the relevant statutes, and there appearing to be no other statutes applicable to Thomas\u2019 specific grievance, we are satisfied that it would have been an exercise in futility for the District Court to have given him leave to amend the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">There being no substantial question presented by Thomas\u2019 appeal, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b302-13\">. As noted by the District Court, AUSA Mani-sha Sheth\u2019s name is spelled incorrectly in the caption.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
