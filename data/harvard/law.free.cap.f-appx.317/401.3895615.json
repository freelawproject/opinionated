He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a induction of sentence based on the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s adoption of Amendment 706, which modified the sentencing ranges applicable to crack cocaine offenses to reduce the disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine sentences. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>Supp. to Appendix C, Amendment 706, p. 226-31 (Nov. 1, 2007) (amending U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)). The Government has filed a motion for summary affirmance or, alternatively, for an extension of time in which to file a brief on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">\u201cSection 3582(c)(2) permits a district court to reduce a term of imprisonment when it is based upon a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by an amendment to the Guidelines, if such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). The decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is discretionary, and we review the denial of a \u00a7 3582 motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Boe, </em>117 F.3d 830, 831 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-14\">Cox contends that the district court abused its discretion when it denied his motion for a reduction of sentence because Amendment 706 applies to career offenders sentenced pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. He also argues that a mandatory application of the policy statements set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 would violate the plain language of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court\u2019s obligation to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-15\">Cox has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a reduction of sentence. A reduction in Cox\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 pursuant to Amendment 706 would not affect his guideline range because the range was calculated under \u00a7 4B1.1. Because Cox\u2019s guideline range was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense, he was not sentenced based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). Further, to the extent Cox argues that the district court had the discretion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in light of <em>Booker, </em>the argument is unavailing because <em>Booker </em>was not \u201cbased on a retroactive amendment to the Guidelines.\u201d <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994). Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Cox\u2019s motion for a reduction of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Cox also contends the district court erred when it denied his motion for reconsideration and clarification. Citing Rules 52(a) and 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, he argues that the district court was required to state specific findings of fact and conclusions of law as to each claim in his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and that the court\u2019s failure to do so precluded him from appealing the order. The denial of a motion for reconsideration is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Martinez v. Johnson, </em>104 F.3d 769, 771 (5th Cir.1997) (Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion); <em>Travelers Ins. Co. v. Liljeberg Enterprises, Inc., </em>38 F.3d 1404, 1408 (5th Cir.1994) (Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6) motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The district court was not required to state findings of facts and conclusions of law on its denial of Cox\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CivP. 52(a)(3). Further, the district court did not enter a partial judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b). <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Cox\u2019s motion for reconsideration and clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the Government\u2019s motion for an extension of time is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm.
