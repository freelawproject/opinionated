Barry Gray appeals the District Court\u2019s order denying his motion to proceed <em>informa, pauperis </em>and dismissing the action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. In June 2008, Gray filed a motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>with a caption listing himself as a defendant and TCIF REO CIT, LLC as plaintiff. He did not describe any claims he wished to bring or explain whether he was attempting to remove an action from state court. The District Court' denied Gray\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and dismissed the action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Gray filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-21\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the denial of a motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>for abuse of discretion. <em>Adkins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>335 U.S. 331, 337, 69 S.Ct. 85, 93 L.Ed. 43 (1948); <em>Bullock v. Suomela, </em>710 F.2d 102, 103 (3d Cir.1983). The District Court denied Gray\u2019s motion on the grounds that the action was legally frivolous. However, if the application is complete, the District Court should only consider whether the applicant is economically eligible. <em>Sinwell v. Shapp, </em>536 F.2d 15, 19 (3d Cir.1976). It is only after leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>has been granted that the analysis under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) is undertaken and a complaint may be dismissed as frivolous. Thus, we conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in denying the motion to proceed <em>informa pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-22\">Although the District Court noted that the motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>was filed without a complaint, it proceeded to assume that the case was based on a state court action in ejectment and determined that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction. Because the motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>was' denied and no action had been filed, the question of subject-matter jurisdiction was not before the District Court. Moreover, a court should not dismiss a matter when it does not know the basis for the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-23\">Summary action is appropriate if there is no substantial question presented in the appeal. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4. For the above reasons, we will summarily vacate the District Court\u2019s order and remand the matter for further proceedings. <em>See </em>Third Circuit I.O.P. 10.6. On remand, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>District Court should give Gray an opportunity to state the factual and legal basis for his action and determine whether Gray is financially eligible to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>before undertaking an analysis pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
