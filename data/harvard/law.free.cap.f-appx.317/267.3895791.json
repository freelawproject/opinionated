Sanehez-Cordero filed pro se a motion in the District Court of New Jersey seeking to have his sentence reduced pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The District Court denied his motion, finding that Sanehez-Cordero was ineligible for any reduction because he was sentenced to a statutory mandatory minimum. Petitioner timely appeals. <em>See United States v. Grana, </em>864 F.2d 312, 316 (3d Cir.1989). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We may summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment if the appeal presents no substantial question. 3d Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. For the reasons that follow, we will do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-24\">Sanehez-Cordero is not eligible for a sentence reduction because he was sentenced to a mandatory minimum. He pleaded guilty to a crime involving more than fifty grams of crack cocaine with a statutory minimum of 10 years. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b). Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines lowered the base offense levels for cocaine base offenses. Amendment 706 is inapplicable in this instance because the Sentencing Commission has not altered and cannot alter a statutory mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 app. note 1(A) (\u201c[A] reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) and is not consistent with this policy statement if ... the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of ... another statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment\u201d)). As this appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Court\u2019s order. See 3d Cir. LAR 27.4 and 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
