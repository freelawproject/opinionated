The District Court sentenced Lloyd to a term of 110 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-21\">Soon thereafter, Lloyd, proceeding pro se, filed a motion identified as a \u201cmotion pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(e)(2).\u201d (Dist. Ct. Dkt. # 32.) In his motion, Lloyd challenged the constitutionality of his detention on various grounds, including that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel. The District Court determined that the motion should have been filed as a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, and, pursuant to <em>United States v. Miller, </em>197 F.3d 644 (3d Cir.1999), directed Lloyd to inform the court whether \u201che consented] to reclassification of his ... motion as a petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, or whether he wishe[d] to resubmit his petition, including the same or additional claims, on the standard \u00a7 2255 form.\u201d (Dist. Ct. Order, May 5, 2008, Dkt.# 33.) In response, Lloyd submitted a \u00a7 2255 motion on the standard form. (Dist. Ct. Dkt. # 35.) Because he chose to resubmit his petition, the District Court then entered an order dismissing as moot Lloyd\u2019s previously filed \u201cmotion pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(e)(2).\u201d (Dist. Ct. Dkt. #37.) Lloyd now appeals from that order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-22\">In his notice of appeal, Lloyd states that he seeks review of the District Court\u2019s order \u201cdenying the relief requested (Sentence Modification) pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d (Dist. Ct. Dkt. # 38.) Thus, it appears that Lloyd believes that he has been denied habeas relief. As noted above, however, the order from which Lloyd appeals simply dismissed his initial filing as moot in light of the properly filed \u00a7 2255 motion that followed; Lloyd\u2019s \u00a7 2255 is still pending in the District Court. As such, we see no error in the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-23\">Because this appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>firm the District Court\u2019s order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Third Cir.
