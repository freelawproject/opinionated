They argue that the district court should have considered the merits of them claims against One Beacon Insurance Company (\u201cOne Beacon\u201d) instead of dismissing them complaint as barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b938-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-18\">We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Davila v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>326 F.3d 1183, 1185 (11th Cir.2003). We may affirm a dismissal \u201con any grounds supported in the record.\u201d <em>See Koziara v. City of Casselberry, </em>392 F.3d 1302, 1306 n. 2 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-19\">Dismissal is appropriate if, when accepting the plaintiffs factual allegations as true, \u201cthe plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would support the claims in the complaint.\u201d <em>Davila, </em>326 F.3d at 1185. \u201cGenerally, the existence of an affirmative defense will not support a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Quitter v. Barclays American/Credit, Inc., </em>727 F.2d 1067, 1069 (11th Cir.1984), <em>en banc reh\u2019g, </em>764 F.2d 1400, 1400 (11th Cir.1985) (per curiam) (reinstating panel opinion). \u201cNevertheless, a complaint may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) when its own allegations indicate the existence of an affirmative defense, so long as the defense clearly appears on the face of the complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When determining a motion to dismiss, a court may consider the complaint, its attachments, and documents attached to the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss if the attached documents are central to the plaintiffs claims and referred to by the plaintiff without converting the motion to a motion for summary judgment. <em>Brooks v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Fla., Inc., </em>116 F.3d 1364, 1368-69 (11th Cir.1997) (per curiam). We also review <em>res judicata </em>determinations <em>de novo. Jang v. United Techs. Corp., </em>206 F.3d 1147, 1149 (11th Cir.2000). Although <em>pro se </em>pleadings are liberally construed, \u201cthis leniency does not give a court license to serve as <em>de facto </em>counsel for a party or to rewrite an otherwise deficient pleading in order to sustain an action....\u201d <em>GJR Invs., Inc. v. County of Escambia, Fla., </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">In a diversity case, federal courts will \u201cgive preclusive effect to the judgment of a state court provided that two conditions are met: first, that the courts of the state from which the judgment emerged would do so themselves; and second, that the litigants had a full and fair opportunity to litigate their claims and the prior state proceedings otherwise satisfied the applicable requirements of due process.\u201d <em>Shields v. Bellsouth Adver. &amp; Publ\u2019g Co., Inc., </em>228 F.3d 1284, 1288 (11th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\"><em>\u201cRes judicata </em>and collateral estoppel ... are two separate rules or sets of rules for determining the conclusiveness of judgments.\u201d <em>Wheeler v. First Alabama Bank of Birmingham, </em>364 So.2d 1190, 1199 (Ala.1978). \u201cUnder Alabama law, the essential elements of res judicata are (1) a prior judgment on the merits, (2) rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, (3) with substantial identity of the parties, and (4) with the same cause of action presented in both suits.\u201d <em>Wesch v. Folsom, </em>6 F.3d 1465, 1471 (11th Cir.1993); see <em>also Wheeler, </em>364 So.2d at 1199 (state supreme court case stating elements of <em>res </em>judicata). \u201cIf these elements are present, then the former judgment is an absolute bar to any subsequent suit on the same cause of action, including any issue which was or could have been litigated in the prior action.\u201d <em>Wheeler, </em>364 So.2d at 1199.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">\u201cCollateral estoppel operates where the subsequent suit between the same parties is not on the same cause of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Collateral estoppel requires that: (1) the issue be identical to one the issue involved in previous suit; (2) the issue be actually litigated in prior action; and (3) the resolution of the issue be necessary to the prior judgment. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf these elements are present, the prior judgment is conclusive as to those issues actually determined in the prior suit.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\"><em>\u201c[RJes judicata </em>is an affirmative defense....\u201d <em>Norfolk S. Corp. v. Chevron, U.S.A., Inc., </em>371 F.3d 1285, 1289 (11th Cir.2004). The doctrine of res judicata in conjunction with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738, the Full Faith and Credit Statute, bars relitigation of matters that were previously litigated in a prior state suit. <em>Saboff v. St. John\u2019s River Water Mgmt. Dist., </em>200 F.3d 1356, 1359 (11th Cir.2000). Section 1738. requires \u201ca federal court must give to a state-court judgment the same preclusive effect as would be given that judgment under the law of the State in which the judgment was rendered.\u201d <em>Migra v. Warren City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., </em>465 U.S. 75, 81, 104 S.Ct. 892, 896, 79 L.Ed.2d 56 (1984). Thus, the \u201crelevant inquiry is whether [Alabama\u2019s] law of res judicata <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>would ordinarily bar [the plaintiffs\u2019] subsequent federal claim[ ]\u201d. <em>Saboff </em>200 F.3d at 1360.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">When the parties \u201cconsent\u201d to the dismissal of a suit \u201cbased on a settlement agreement ... the principles of <em>res judica-ta </em>apply (in a somewhat modified form) to the matters specified in the settlement agreement, rather than the original complaint.\u201d <em>Norfolk, </em>371 F.3d at 1288. \u201cIn determining the <em>res judicata </em>effect of an order of dismissal based upon a settlement agreement, [the court] should also attempt to effectuate the parties\u2019 intent. The best evidence of that intent is, of course, the settlement agreement itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1289. Ultimately, Alabama law does give judgments approving settlements conclusive and binding effect. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 25-5-56; <em>see also Lawrence v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>226 Ala. 161, 145 So. 577 (1933) (holding that judgment approving settlement may be given <em>res judicata </em>effect).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Alabama uses the substantial evidence test to determine whether two causes of action are the same for <em>res judicata </em>purposes. <em>Equity Res. Mgmt., Inc. v. Vinson, </em>723 So.2d 634, 637 (Ala.1998). Under this test, <em>res judicata </em>applies when the same evidence substantially sujoports both actions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">As the Supreme Court of Alabama has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-7\">it is well-settled that the principal test for comparing causes of action [for the application of <em>res judicata] </em>is <em>whether the primary rigid and duty or wrong are the same in each action. </em>Res judi-cata applies not only to the exact legal theories advanced in the prior case, but to all legal theories and claims arising out of the same nucleus of operative facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b940-8\"><em>Old Republic Ins. Co. v. Lanier, </em>790 So.2d 922, 928 (Ala.2000) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-10\">Here, the Insured filed a claim in state court against One Beacon for breach of contract. The parties mediated their claims, and in 2005, One Beacon settled with the Insured. Subsequently, the Insured alleged to the state trial court that One Beacon had failed to pay the full amount required by the mediation settlement agreement. However, the state trial court enforced the agreement against the Insured, terminating the litigation. The Insured were unsuccessful in their appeal to the Alabama Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-11\">The Insured then brought suit against One Beacon in federal court. In their federal complaint, the Insured request compensation for their destroyed home and furnishings and for living expenses incurred, as well as for One Beacon\u2019s malicious, grossly negligent, and willful breach of their insurance contract. Because the Insured have fully litigated these claims in state court, their federal complaint is barred by <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b940-12\">The Insured\u2019s complaint demonstrates that their federal action involves the same parties and causes of action that were fully and previously resolved by a state court of competent jurisdiction. The district court properly dismissed the action under Rule 12(b)(6) as barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>in accord with Alabama law. <em>See Saboff </em>200 F.3d at 1359. Moreover, to the extent the cause <em>of </em>action in state court action differed from any cause of action which could be liberally construed as underlying the present case <em>(e.g., </em>breach of the state court settlement agreement), collateral estoppel applied to preclude reliti-gation of whether the settlement agreement was binding and should be enforced, and warranted dismissal on that basis. <em>See Wheeler, </em>364 So.2d at 1199.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b938-13\">. Brown and Russell did not personally sign the complaint filed with the district court. The parties did not raise this issue on appeal. Every pleading must be signed by either an attorney of record or by a party personally, if the party is unrepresented. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(a). \u2018\u2018[T]he requirements of the rules of procedure should be liberally construed,\u201d however, and \" 'mere technicalities' should not stand in the way of consideration of a case on the merits.\u201d <em>Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., </em>487 U.S. 312, 315, 108 S.Ct. 2405, 2408, 101 L.Ed.2d 285 (1988). This applies to situations where \"a litigant files papers in a fashion that is technically at variance with the letter of a procedural rule ... [but is nevertheless] the functional equivalent of what the rule requires.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 316-17, 108 S.Ct. at 2408. In light of the plaintiffs\u2019 <em>pro se </em>status, Brown's appearance before the district court in support of the complaint, and the filing of a post-judgment motion properly signed by Brown and Russell referencing the signature dispute, we deem Brown and Russell to have cured their failure to sign the complaint in the first instance and confirm their status as plaintiffs \u2014 and now appellants \u2014 in the action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
