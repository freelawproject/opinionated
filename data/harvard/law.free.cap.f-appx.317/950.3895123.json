In 2008 he moved for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief and, specifically, for a sentence below the guidelines range as reduced by Amendment 706. The district court found that his amended guidelines range was 235 to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment and it reduced his sentence to 264 months, the midpoint of that amended range.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-19\">Moorman contends that the district court should have reconsidered factual issues that were decided at his original sentencing hearing. He also contends that he was entitled to a below-amended guidelines range sentence under <em>Booker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>and that his amended sentence was unreasonable because the district court did not consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-20\">\u201cIn a proceeding to modify a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant if that defendant \u201chas been sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>tenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently-been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In such a case, the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence, after considering applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">The Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement on retroactive reduction of sentences, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4V\">In a case in which a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (c) below, the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and any such reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment shall be consistent with this policy statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">Amendment 706, which is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c), was made retroactive by Amendment 713. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c); <em>see also. United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1325 (11th Cir.2008). Amendment 706 reduced offense levels in certain crack cocaine cases by two levels, as reflected in the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e). <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">When considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, a district court must engage in a two-part analysis. \u201cInitially, the court must recalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines, first determining a new base level by substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780. Next, the court must decide, in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and in its discretion, whether it will impose the newly calculated sentence or retain the original sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-10\">If the defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction, the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in deciding whether to grant the reduction and, if so, the extent of it. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256-57 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cThe district court is not required to articulate specifically the applicability, if any, of each factor, as long as the record as a whole \u2018demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 762 (11th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997)). We have held that a record adequately demonstrated that a district court took into account the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when the court briefly stated that it had reviewed the government\u2019s brief, and the government had set out in its brief the pertinent factors and facts relevant to those factors. <em>Eggersdorf </em>126 F.3d at 1322-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-11\">A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce sentence does not provide a basis for <em>de novo </em>resentencing. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(3); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number><em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not \u201cgrant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous sentencing issues.\u201d <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781-82. \u201c[A]ll original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781. For example, in <em>United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560 (11th Cir.1997), we held that the district court in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding correctly declined to re-examine the number of marijuana plants involved in the drug offense. <em>Id. </em>at 1563.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">We recently held that a district court does not have the authority pursuant to <em>Booker</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>or its progeny to reduce in the \u00a7 3582(e)(2) context a defendant\u2019s sentence in a manner inconsistent with the applicable policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>No. 556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009). We concluded in <em>Melvin </em>that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings and, therefore, does not override the limitations placed on the district court\u2019s discretion found in the applicable policy statements for such proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 1192-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">The district court did not err in denying Moorman\u2019s request that he receive a reduced sentence below the amended guidelines range. First, the district court properly declined to revisit extraneous issues decided at the original sentencing hearing. Second, the holding in <em>Melvin </em>forecloses Moorman\u2019s argument that the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements were not controlling and he was entitled to have the district court consider imposing a below-amended guidelines range sentence. Finally, to the extent that Moorman has preserved the argument, the record demonstrates that the district court adequately accounted for the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in arriving at his amended 264-month sentence. Therefore, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b973-14\">. <em>United. States v.
