Pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 24(a), this court may entertain a motion to proceed IFP on appeal when the litigant has been denied leave to proceed IFP on appeal by the district court. A litigant may not proceed IFP on appeal unless he demonstrates financial eligibility and the existence of a nonfrivolous issue for appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 24(a); <em>Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">The district court determined that Torns was barred from proceeding IFP in his civil rights action because Torns had accumulated three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Our review, however, shows that the district court erred in attributing a strike to Torns for his appeal in <em>Simpson v. Fordice, </em>No. 96-60305, 1998 WL 413801 (5th Cir. June 17, 1998) (unpublished). In that matter, Torns\u2019s appeal was dismissed for failure to prosecute; Torns therefore does not incur a strike under \u00a7 1915(g) for a frivolous appeal. As we are unaware of any additional strikes that may properly be attributed to Torns at this time, we grant Torns\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal and vacate the district court\u2019s denial of Torns\u2019s motion to proceed IFP in the district court. We remand this aspect of the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-17\">Should the district court, on remand, grant Torns\u2019s motion to proceed IFP in the district court, the case may proceed by means of Fed.R.CivP. 60(b)(1), either on Torns\u2019s motion or sua sponte. <em>See McDowell v. Celebrezze, </em>310 F.2d 43, 44 (5th Cir.1962). Because Torns did not timely appeal from the district court\u2019s final judgment \u2014 but only from the denial of his motion to proceed IFP in the district court\u2014 the district' court was never divested of jurisdiction over the former aspect of the case. <em>See Alice L. v. Dusek, </em>492 F.3d 563, 564-65 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-18\">IFP GRANTED; DENIAL OF MOTION TO PROCEED IFP IN THE DISTRICT COURT VACATED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b426-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
