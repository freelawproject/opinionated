The District Court also denied Futch\u2019s motions for an injunction and to amend his complaint. Appellees have filed a motion for summary affirmance. For the reasons provided by the District Court, we will grant the motion and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-24\">On July 21, 2008, Futch, a prisoner at the Federal Correctional Institution at Al-lenwood (\u201cFCI-Allenwood\u201d), filed a complaint against Keith Dewey, Case Manager, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and the United States of America under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Futch alleged that he provided a confidential statement to Dewey regarding a fight that occurred between inmates in November 2007, and that Dewey \u201cmistakenly\u201d published that statement to the inmates who had been fighting. As a result, Futch was placed in the Special Housing Unit (\u201cSHU\u201d) and then transferred to FCI-Fort Dix. At Fort Dix, Futch alleged that inmates learned of his statement and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>he was placed in protective custody. Futch requested that the court transfer him to a \u201ccamp,\u201d restore his job, and provide compensation for the time he spent in SHU, as well as grant any other relief deemed necessary. Futch also filed a letter with the District Court, which it construed as a motion for an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Based on recommendations by the Magistrate Judge, the District Court dismissed Futch\u2019s action. The court found that the Board of Prisons and the United States were immune from damages, that Dewey\u2019s inadvertent disclosure of confidential information did not constitute an Eighth Amendment violation, and that the prison responded reasonably by placing Futch in protective custody and transferring him to another facility. The court also found that Futch had no right to be placed in a particular prison or to have a particular custody status. The court dismissed Futch\u2019s request for preliminary injunction and denied him leave to amend the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Futch filed the instant appeal, along with motions for appointment of counsel, to stay the appeal, and a document construed as a motion demonstrating imminent danger. Futch also filed several letters with the Court in response to Appellee\u2019s motion for summary affirmance. We have appellate jurisdiction over this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our standard of review of the District Court\u2019s dismissal is plenary. <em>Atkinson v. LaFayette College, </em>460 F.3d 447, 451 (3d Cir.2006). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), an appeal must be dismissed if it has no arguable basis in law or fact. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). Alternatively, we may grant appellee\u2019s motion for summary affirmance if the appeal presents no substantial question. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4 and 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The District Court correctly dismissed the damages portion of Futch\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim against the Board of Prisons and the United States based on sovereign immunity. <em>F.D.I.C v. Meyer, </em>510 U.S. 471, 485-86, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(iii); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(2). With respect to Futch\u2019s claim that the prison failed to protect his safety, Futch conceded that Dewey\u2019s disclosure of information was done \u201cmistakenly\u201d and \u201cinadvertently.\u201d As a result, he cannot show that Dewey had a \u201csufficiently culpable state of mind\u201d when he released Futch\u2019s confidential statement. <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 833, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (citing <em>Wilson v. Setter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 297, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991)). Besides, Futch did not allege any actual harm, and thus cannot show that the prison violated his constitutional rights by failing to ensure his \u201creasonable safety.\u201d <em>Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 834, 844-45, 114 S.Ct. 1970. Furthermore, prison officials reasonably responded to any risk of harm by immediately placing Futch in protective custody and later transferring him to a different prison where he was also housed in protective custody. Because Futch cannot show the prison was deliberately indifferent to his safety, the District Court properly dismissed Futch\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Finally, for the reasons given by the District Court, there was no basis to grant Futch\u2019s request for injunctive relief. Although he desired to remain in protective custody and sought a preliminary injunction to secure this housing request, he has not adequately demonstrated the elements required to receive such relief. Moreover, Futch does not have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in his place of confinement, transfer, or classification. <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>483, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995); <em>Meachum v. Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976); <em>Moody v. Daggett, </em>429 U.S. 78, 88 n. 9, 97 S.Ct. 274, 50 L.Ed.2d 236 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Therefore, as this appeal presents no substantial question, we will grant appel-lee\u2019s motion for summary affirmance. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4 and 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6. Appellant\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel and to stay the appeal are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-15\">. <em>Bivens v.
