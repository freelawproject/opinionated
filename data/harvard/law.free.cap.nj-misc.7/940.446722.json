The father who sued for loss of service, in the same action, obtained a verdict of $500, and his mother appears to have also recovered a verdict of one dollar.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-12\">The controversy arose out of an automobile accident, in which the infant plaintiff sustained a skull fracture and other serious and permanent injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-13\">It is practically conceded in brief of counsel of defendant, that if there was liability, the damages awarded to the plaintiffs are wholly inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-14\">From a reading of the testimony, we have reached the conclusion that the verdicts are inadequate and require a new trial, but that the new trial shall not be limited to the measure of damages only, but shall be on all the issues involved in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-15\">Rule made absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
