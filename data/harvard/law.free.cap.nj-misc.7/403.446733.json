So-far as we can discover, the company made no attempt to enforce the above clause conferring the right in case of undue-delay to dismiss the plaintiffs and hire other contractors; they were allowed to complete,, but the company refused to-pay on account of the delay, and when suit was brought,, counter-claimed that the steam shovel was insufficient and in bad order, that it broke down constantly, and, in short, that there had been unreasonable delay, for which defendants-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>claimed $5,000 damages, particularly in that the completion of the building was delayed and rents lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">At the trial the primary claim was conceded, and the evidence related wholly to the counter-claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Of the seven grounds of appeal, the last is abandoned. The others will be taken up in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Ground 1. A. Exclusion of a question to the witness Goldblatt. There was no exception to this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Ground 1. B. Exclusion of question to Goldblatt: \u201cWhen was your mason contractor to commence work?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">The court ruled, in substance, that unless it appeared that haste in the completion of the building, and the dependence on prompt performance of the excavation for other contractors to begin', was expressly within the contemplation of the parties, consequential damages were not cognizable. This was in accordance with the celebrated case of <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Baxendale, </em>9 <em>Exch. </em>341. We see no legal error in the exclusion of the question at this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">The second ground is that in the course of the charge the judge instructed the jury: \u201cThe terms of a contract may be changed, that is, permit a later commencement or performance; that is for you to consider.\u201d To this exception was taken on the ground that there was nothing in the pleadings to support it. But conceding this, if there was error it was harmless. On rebuttal, the plaintiffs undertook to explain why they had not begun work until May 22d, and were allowed without objection to explain that they were busy on another job, and defendant\u2019s agents knew it, and had agreed that plaintiffs should begin on this job as soon as they had finished the other. The instruction excepted to was directed to this point; as a proposition of law it was correct; as cognizable in the case, it was appropriate to a situation that arose on the evidence without any objection because of not being present in the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">The third ground attacks the charge on what would be reasonable dispatch. The instruction is not quoted in full; when read in its entirety, we think it was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>The fourth ground has no exception to support it, so we-have not considered it.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The fifth ground relates to the refusal of a request to charge what amounts to more than arithmetical computation, which the court might well have charged, but was not required to charge, as it contained no principle of law applicable to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The sixth ground relates to the refusal of the defendant\u2019s fifth request to charge, the substance of which is that plaintiffs are not entitled to invoke unforeseen accident, such as the breaking down of the shovel, as an excuse for delay in performance, but were required absolutely and at all events to have a- proper shovel in proper order and proof against any possibility of breaking down. This is not the language of the request, but is what we understand to be its meaning. It will be remembered that the contract does not call for absolute completion at any specified time, but merely requires that plaintiffs shall complete with reasonable dispatch. Such language cannot be construed as imposing more than diligence in completion. The request was properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">This disposes of all the grounds argued. The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
