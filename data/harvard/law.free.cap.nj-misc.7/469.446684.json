He is her sole next of kin.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">The single ground urged under this rule is that the verdict is excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">We think it is. If the plaintiff will consent to a reduction of the verdict to the sum of $15,000, it may stand for that amount, otherwise the rule to show cause will <em>be made </em>absolute and a <em>venire de novo </em>issue as to the question of damages only.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
