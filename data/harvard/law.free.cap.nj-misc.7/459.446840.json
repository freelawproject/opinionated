The trial resulted in a verdict in her favor, the jury awarding her $1,200.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">Our examination of the evidence sent up with the rule satisfies us that, on her own testimony, the collision is shown to have been the result in part, if not altogether, of her own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-13\">For this reason, the rule to show cause will be made absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
