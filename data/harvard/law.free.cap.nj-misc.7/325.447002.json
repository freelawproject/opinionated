The testimony showed with substantial clearness that the plaintiff\u2019s right hand was permanently crippled.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-13\">The jury found a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $3,000, and counsel for the defendant conceded on the argument that this verdict is inadequate, but claimed that it ought to stand because as they said the jury had serious doubt whether the plaintiff ought to recover anything under the circumstances, and that the verdict was the result of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>compromise. It is well settled that a verdict under such circumstances cannot stand. The question then remains whether the new trial should be limited to damages only. The trial judge undertook to make, this limitation of the rule, but we do not feel controlled by such limitation in this court. <em>Faggioni </em>v. <em>Weiss, </em>128 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>540; 3 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>371; <em>De Peole </em>v. <em>Passaic City Steam Laundry, </em>137 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>890; 5 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>687; <em>Infirri </em>v. <em>Staseak, </em>4 <em>Id. </em>915; <em>Wilentz </em>v. <em>Lonky, </em>6 <em>Id. </em>711. We incline to the view that there should be a new trial at large. Such will be the order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
