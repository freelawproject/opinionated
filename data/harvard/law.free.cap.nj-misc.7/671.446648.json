The plaintiff moved to strike the answer and counter-claim and for the entrance of summary judgment on the ground that the answer was false and the pleadings sham. The trial judge granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion. Thirteen days after the motion was granted the defendant filed certain affidavits tending to show that it had a defense on the merits, and purporting to be in answer to the plaintiff\u2019s motion affidavits. A notice of appeal, was also served. The trial judge expunged the defendant\u2019s affidavits from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Since the affidavits have been expunged from the record they are not before us, and there is nothing before us to show that they were before the 'trial judge or that the entry of summary judgment was not in all respects proper. <em>Larner </em>v.
