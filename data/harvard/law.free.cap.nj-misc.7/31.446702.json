The complaint alleges the defendant was engaged in interstate commerce; that on the 18th day of January, 1921, the plaintiff was employed as assistant station boy at removing and loading mail into and from cars on the mail trains operated by the defendant company, at its eastbound Plainfield station; that the plaintiff slipped upon the truck and fell between the truck and the baggage coach, the cause of the slipping upon the truck platform of the truck was due to the faulty condition of the platform of the truck and the iron band binding the platform boards upon the truck, of which the defendant company had prior notice, but neglected to remedy the same, charging negligence in that respect as the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. The trial resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff for $3,000. The defendant obtained a rule to show cause and writes down eight reasons for a new trial. The view, which we take after reading the testimony, renders it unnecessary to consider only one of the reasons, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>viz., the verdict was contrary to the clear weight of the evidence. This we think is so. The only issue submitted by the trial court to the jury was a duty to provide \u201ca safe truck,\u201d if you come to the conclusion that this truck was not in a defective condition, that ends the case\u2014the plaintiff has no claim whatever.\u201d This was the sole issue upon the question of the defendant\u2019s negligence. To support the affirmative of that issue, the plaintiff was sworn and a witness, Fred H. Lanning, the night baggage agent at the Plain-field station, he testified, among other things, the plaintiff \u201cslipped and fell off the truck.\u201d This testimony is rather unsatisfactory, both as to accuracy and truthfulness, in some of the details. As against this, the defendant produced four witnesses, Frank 0. Webster, John Urquhart, Joseph Faulkaver and Tobias Nolan.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">Our conclusion is the rule to show cause should be made absolute and a <em>venire de novo </em>should issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
