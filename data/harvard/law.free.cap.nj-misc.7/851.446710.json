The trial judge awarded judgment for the plaintiff, and if the ordinary rule in such cases had been applicable, this would have been correct; but it appeared on the trial without contradiction that the check had originally been given as the result of a gambling transaction and to settle a gambling debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">The case of <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Brehm, </em>100 <em>N. J. L. </em>341, in the Court of Errors and Appeals, lays down the rule, of course,</p>\n<p id=\"AQX\">controlling here, that such an instrument is void and unenforceable when in the hands of a <em>Iona fide </em>holder. This rule seems to have been disregarded in the trial court, and the judgment was consequently erroneous, and must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-13\">Appellee has not appeared by counsel and has submitted no brief.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
