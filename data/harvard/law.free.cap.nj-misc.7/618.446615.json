The defendant, Anspach, was indebted, as evidenced by his letter of May 5th, 1937, to the Eidelity Mortgage Company for commissions for leasing a store in Asbury Park. The letter is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-12\">\u201cAnspach Bros.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-13\">Opticians,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-14\">. 833 Broad Street,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-15\">Newark, N.

The mortgage company assigned to the plaintiff in this action the indebtedness evidenced by this letter for which judgment was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">The admission of the assignment in evidence is challenged, because it is said (1) that consideration between the assignor and assignee was not shown, and (2) because there was no proof of corporate action. This is not, in fact, true.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">The court was not concerned with the prevailing rate of commission, and hence refused to receive evidence with respect thereto. The other assignments of error deserve no further comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-13\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
