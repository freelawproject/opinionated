The court also directed by rule that upon any motion which might be made depositions could be taken to be used on such a motion. We think the motion should be denied, with costs.. Our examination and reading of the briefs and the depositions; taken under the rule, after considering the oral argument, of counsel, lead us to the conclusion that the return is not frivolous or sham. The motion is denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
