There was a verdict for the plaintiff and the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The defendant\u2019s sole contention in-the case, as stated in appellant\u2019s brief, is that the accident is governed by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation law, and that recovery could only be had thereunder. The court below held to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The plaintiff was going to work. She had been employed by the defendant but four days and without, prior arrangement of any kind, or without any understanding arising out of the terms of her employment, the latter invited her and her companion, a man named Potoker, to get in his car, saying \u201che would take them down.\u201d In the course of the trip an accident happened and plaintiff was injured. The act of the employer was simply one of courtesy wholly disconnected from the relation of master and servant.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The learned trial judge rightly held that the injury did not \u201carise out of and in the course of\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
