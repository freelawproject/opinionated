The accident occurred September 1st, 1927, while the plaintiff was attempting to cross Bound Brook road, in the borough of Middlesex in Middlesex county.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-15\">We have examined with care the testimony in relation to damages. It would serve no useful purpose to set it forth in detail. Our conclusion is that we cannot say that the verdict is so small as to justify us in saying that it is inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-16\">The rule to show cause will be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
