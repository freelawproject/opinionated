The case comes up on defendants\u2019 rule to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-12\">The reasons as filed enumerate five points, namely, that the verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence; that the evidence did not prove negligence on the part of the defendants; that the evidence did prove the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence; that the verdict of the jury was excessive, and that the verdict was actuated by mistake, passion, prejudice and partiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-13\">Defendants\u2019 counsel argues vigorously that the defendants were not in any way participants in plaintiff\u2019s injuries, and that if the accident was caused by a car, it was a car of some persons other than the defendants. However, there is persuasive evidence that the damage was caused by the car driven by defendant Silverman and owned by his co-defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-14\">Defendants\u2019 counsel also contends that the verdict was the result of a religious prejudice against Mr. Silverman and was the result of mistake. There was not a word in the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>p\u00edete record to sustain the contention of religious prejudice or prejudice of any character.. The argument is entirely without a vestige of support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">We have examined the entire testimony in the light of the reasons as filed and of defendants\u2019 brief, and find no cause for granting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The rule, therefore, will be discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
