The case was tried by the court without a jury, resulting in a judgment for the plaintiff for $150.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-13\">This case turned upon a question of fact. The trial court found that the plaintiff\u2019s contention was the correct one. We cannot disturb a judgment when based upon evidence found to be correct by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-14\">The judgment of the District Court of Bayonne is therefore affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
