The reasons for that rule are explained in a long line of cases, of which late instances are the following: Kar<em>gman </em>v. <em>Carlo, </em>85 <em>N. J. L. </em>632; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Transportation Co., Id. </em>700; <em>Lams </em>v. <em>Fish, </em>86 <em>Id. </em>321; <em>Daly </em>v. <em>Ewald, </em>88 <em>Id. </em>707; <em>Chrisafides </em>v. <em>Motor Co., </em>90 <em>Id. </em>313; <em>Burt </em>v. <em>Brownstone Realty Co., </em>95 <em>Id. </em>457; <em>Leiferant v. Progressive Agency, </em>98 <em>Id. </em>526.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-12\">We deal with this point at some length, because the only-ground of appeal argued is that \u201cthe trial court erroneously directed a verdict for the defendants.\u201d Such a verdict was in fact directed, and after rather extended argument; but no exception to that direction was taken, and consequently it stands legally unchallenged, and the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
