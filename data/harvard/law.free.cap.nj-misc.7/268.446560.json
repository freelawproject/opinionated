Eiding with the plaintiff, in the same car, was his. son, Samuel. The defendant\u2019s servant was driving a Ford truck in the same direction that the plaintiff was proceeding, and passed plaintiff\u2019s car at some point between Harrison street and President street.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">There was testimony, on part of the plaintiff, to 'the effect that as he was driving along the highway, about four feet from the curb, at a rate of speed, estimated between fifteen and twenty miles per hour, when the defendant\u2019s truck came along, at a speed estimated between thirty and thirty-five miles an hour, and while passing the plaintiff\u2019s automobile, pn its left side, at that rate of speed, the truck swung over to the right, and as it did so, the rear of the truck struck the left front of the plaintiff\u2019s automobile, damaging it and also causing the plaintiff to sustain severe injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s story was corroborated by three disinterested witnesses. The only witness who testified, on behalf of the defendant, was his driver, and if his story is to be believed, the plaintiff\u2019s car was standing still, when the former passed with his truck, and there was no collision between defendant\u2019s truck and the plaintiff\u2019s automobile. The truck driver testified he heard no noise, felt no shock and was unaware of the fact he had come in contact with plaintiff\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">From a fair reading of the testimony, it seems to us that the verdict of the jury was so clearly against the weight of the evidence as to indicate partiality, prejudice, passion or mistake. The verdict is set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s rule is made absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
