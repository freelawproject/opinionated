The state of demand declares on a promissory note for $500. The following is a copy of the promissory note sued on.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-7\"><em>\u201c$500.00/00 </em>Newark, <em>N.

The defendants file four specifications of determinations with respect to which the appellants are dissatisfied in point of law. The fourth is the only one that calls for any discussion, viz.: The court erred in finding that the plaintiff was a holder of the instrument without notice of any defect therein. An examination of the promissory note with the testimony explaining the same shows that the following portions of the note were left blank, when signed by the <em>defendants\u2014$500.00/00\u2014Three months\u2014Fred Walter\u2014Five Hundred no\u2014Federal Trust Co. \u2014with 6% interest.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b880-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>The claim of the defendants was that they signed a receipt for $200. The trial judge found as a fact this was not so. The findings of fact by the trial court is supported by reliable evidence. With that conclusion of the trial court on the testimony in the record, we concur. The testimony of the defendants is uncertain and unreliable. The case is controlled by the Uniform Negotiable Instrument law. 3 <em>Comp. Skat. p. </em>3736, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 15, 16. The cases of <em>Autographic Register Co. </em>v. <em>Lirio, </em>6 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>134; <em>Maurer </em>v. <em>Hahn, </em>6 <em>N. J. Adv. R. </em>337; <em>Asbury Path Electric Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Megill, </em>102 <em>N. J. L. </em>496, are not in point. They are distinguished on the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">The judgment of the First District Court of Newark is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
