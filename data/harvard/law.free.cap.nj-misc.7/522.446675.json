The proofs were ample to establish that Gibbs had carnal knowledge of the girl and that this was against her will. In this he was aided by the defendant Herman, who assisted Gibbs in forcing her into an automobile, knowing full well the purpose of Gibbs to assault her. The intercourse by Gibbs is not denied, and the bruises and marks on the girl\u2019s body after the assault were strong corroborative evidence that it was against her will. We find no error in the rulings on evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
