In view of the law and of the undisputed evidence it is quite apparent that a judgment for the plaintiff below for some amount must be rendered. But because of the presence of the counter-claim (as to the precise extent of which we express no opinion) the amount which plaintiff! is entitled to recover is in dispute. In order that the amount of the palintiff\u2019s recovery may be determined in the trial court, we award a <em>venire de novo.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
