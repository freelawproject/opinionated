TOWN OF WESTFIELD, AND SAMUEL ARMSTRONG, HJALMAR L. BECKER, EUGENE C. HANFORD, THEODORE H. LUDWIG AND DENNIS M. LEVER, CONSTITUTING THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT OF THE ZONING ORDINANCE OF SAID TOWN OF WESTFIELD, DEFENDANTS.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b991-9\">Submitted May 18, 1929</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Af6\">Decided November 7, 1929.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b992-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>Before Justices Teenchaed, Lloyd and Case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b992-5\">For the prosecutor, <em>Stamler &amp; Koestler.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b992-6\">For the defendants, <em>Paul Q.

Prospect street at the point in question is but twenty-nine feet wide between the curbs. Near by is a school where congestion has resulted in accidents. In short, we think it appears that there was evidence before the board to justify the finding of the board that the erection of an apartment house \"would tend to further congest traffic at an already dangerous spot and would add greatly to the peril of school children who were obliged to pass that way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b992-11\">It therefore appears to us that the decision of this court in <em>Bellofatto </em>v. <em>Board of Adjustment of </em>Montclair, 6 <em>N. J. Mis. R. 512, </em>a case where the action of the board was the same and for the same reason, and where the action of the board was sustained, is for all practical purposes conclusive as to the ease at bar. The case is also controlled so far as this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>court is concerned, by <em>Kilay </em>v. Quigley, 6 <em>Id. </em>623, a case very similar to this in all essential features.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\">The writ of <em>certiorari </em>(which may be assumed to have been issued) will be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
