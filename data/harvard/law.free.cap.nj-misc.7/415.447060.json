The title of the ordinance is:. \u201cAn ordinance relating to licenses and regulating fees and penalties.\u201d The ordinance provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">\u201c(D) Peddlers.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">\u201cPeddlers and vendors with one-horse vehicles shall pay an annual license fee of $10; with two-horse vehicle or automobile, an annual fee of $15 shall be paid.

Over one ton and three tons and under, $10, and over three ton $15.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">Approved May 9th, 1931.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">\u2022 ' The judgment of -the recorder was \u201cthat the defendant, Ckstl\u00e9s Ice Cream Company, is guilty of violating paragraph T)\u2019 and paragraph \u2018E\u2019 of section two of ordinance No. 91 and fined $15 penalty and $10.90 costs of suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-13\">The General Borough act, Eevision of 1897 <em>(Pamph. L. 1897,- pp. </em>385, 398,. \u00a7 38), provides as follows: \u201cThat no person or persons shall be- required to take out a license in order to sell at wholesale nor to sell any product of his farm.\u201d This section was carried into the amendment of the revision. <em>Pamph. L. </em>1914, <em>p. </em>350, \u00a7 38. Then came the \u201cHome Eule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>act.\u201d <em>Pamph. L. </em>1917, <em>p. </em>358, <em>art. </em>lo. A somewhat similar section in the act of 1885 was considered by the Supreme Court in the case of <em>Cary </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c., of North Plainfield, </em>49 <em>N. J. L. </em>110. So, the act <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1905, <em>p. </em>360) was considered by the Supreme Court in the case of <em>Wilkinsone, Gaddis &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>The Borough of Neptune City, </em>85 <em>N. J. L. </em>21, in this case, it was held, that the borough councils were deprived of the power to impose license fees upon merchants whose places of business are located in other municipalities, but who deliver wagon articles purchased at their respective places of business to customers residing within the limits of such boroughs. So, the act <em>Pamph. L. </em>1917, <em>p. </em>358, that is, the \u201cHome Rule act,\u201d was considered in the case of the <em>City of North Wildwood </em>v. <em>Coney, </em>100 <em>Id. </em>38. The testimony shows, in this case, that the prosecutor, Castles Ice Cream Company, furnished retail store owners with ice cream. That no deliveries were made to private dwellings. The deliveries were made to retail stores. The prosecutor had plants at Perth Amboy, Irvington, New Jersey, and Staten Island. It was in the business of manufacturing ice cream, and the ice cream is sold by the wholesale to retail dealers in the different municipalities of the state. The drivers load up their trucks at Perth Amboy or a point where the ice cream is manufactured to fill orders that have been previously given by the retail customers. There is no peddling of ice cream indiscriminately to individuals. The ice cream is delivered upon orders received by the plant or to the driver of the truck, and sometimes the customer leaves the order to the judgment of the driver because of his knowledge of weather conditions. In no case are deliveries made other than to stores or customers, who buy at wholesale from the prosecutor selling the ice cream product in the retail trade. There was no peddling of ice cream by the prosecutor. We think that under this ordinance the prosecutor was not guilty of peddling or delivering without a license, under the ordinance. The result is that the conviction is set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
