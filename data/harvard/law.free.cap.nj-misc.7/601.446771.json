A new trial is asked on, among others, two grounds: (1) that the verdict on the liability of the defendant was against the weight of the evidence, and (2) that the damages are excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">The rule should be made absolute on both grounds. Plaintiff was driving his touring car toward New York on the Lincoln Highway between Princeton and Kingston. While proceeding he came into collision with the rear left wheel of the bus of the defendant company proceeding toward Trenton, as a result of which the plaintiff was injured and his car damaged. The plaintiff stood alone in his evidence as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>how the accident happened, his contention being that the defendant\u2019s bus turned out. from behind a truck a short distance ahead of it and collided with the plaintiff\u2019s car which was on its proper side of the highway. The bus driver testified that there was no truck in front of him; that the driver of plaintiff\u2019s car was observed a long distance ahead zigzagging across the road; that the bus remained on its own side of the highway, and had almost stopped to avoid the zigzagging of plaintiff\u2019s car when the plaintiff ran into the left rear wheel, throwing the car around and turning it over. In this he was corroborated by a number of disinterested witnesses. In addition, there was evidence that the plaintiff was in an intoxicated condition when he reached the hospital, to which he was taken, and that a bottle of liquor was found in his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">We think also that the damages are grossly excessive. Plaintiff\u2019s injuries were not greatly severe nor permanent in character. The value of the car was small and plaintiff\u2019s earnings doubtful.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The rule will be made absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
