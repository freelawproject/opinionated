EDWARD C. WALKER, DEFENDANT.</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b919-5\">Decided October 16, 1929.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b919-8\">Before Gummere, Chibe Justice, and Justices Parker and Bobine.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b919-9\">Eor the defendant, <em>Collins &amp; Corbin (Edward A. Ma/rlcley, </em>of counsel).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b919-10\">For the plaintiffs, <em>David T.

If the negligence of Joseph Garino was the sole proximate cause of the accident, then the plaintiffs cannot recover, and your verdict must be for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-14\"><em>\u201c2. </em>If you find as a fact, that the accident was unavoidable, then I charge you that your verdict must be in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-15\">\u201c3. The mere happening of an accident is no evidence of negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b919-16\">We think these requests were good in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-17\">Our examination of the charge of the learned trial judge leads us to the conclusion that these requests were not sub-, stantially charged by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-18\">This conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to consider the other grounds for reversal submitted in a brief of fifty-eight pages in length.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-19\">The rule will be made absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
