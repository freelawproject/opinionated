These notes were given to the plaintiffs in payment for paint and merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">The defendant offered himself as a witness in an attempt to show that the plaintiffs were not holders in due course for value. His testimony was to the effect that a man who said he was Citrin, whom he could not identify, said that the notes were put in for collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">The District Court judge quite properly took the case from the jury and directed a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-14\">The testimony of Mr. Tansey was not legal evidence, such as would bind the plaintiffs. Parties to a suit cannot bo deprived of their legal rights by the statements of someone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>whom somebody thought might be one of the parties to the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">The testimony of Mr. Tansey respecting the giving of the notes violates the parol evidence rule and was quite properly dealt with by the learned District Court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">The judgment appealed from will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
