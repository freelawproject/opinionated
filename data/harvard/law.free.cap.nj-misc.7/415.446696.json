The trial resulted in a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant Adolph Shryer for $3,500. A rule to show cause was obtained by the defendant Adolph Shryer, he writes down seven reasons for granting a new trial. Our reading of the reasons and the testimony sent up with the rule lead us to the conclusion that the rule should be discharged, and it is discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
