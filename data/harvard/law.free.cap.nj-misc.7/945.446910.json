It was further conceded that the rate which the company should have charged was forty and one-half cents per hundred on fifty-two thousand pounds, and according to that rate, would have amounted to $210.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-13\">The appellant company therefore claimed the difference of $78 in freight charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>It is conceded that a counter-claim filed by the defendantsappellees for losses sustained by <em>them </em>on previous shipments, over plaintiff-appellant\u2019s lines at the replacement value of the damaged items, in Atlantic City, is $21.21, and the replacement value in wholesale quantities is $16.74.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">The trial judge nonsuited the appellant on its claim and gave judgment for the defendants on their counter-claim.
