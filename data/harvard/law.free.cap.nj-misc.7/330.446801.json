The only reason argued is that the verdict was against the weight of evidence. We have examined the evidence with care and conclude that this ground is without substance. The question for the jury to determine was merely one of veracity as between the plaintiff and the defendant, and the jury resolved this question by determining it in favor of the plaintiff, and, as we think, with good reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">The rule to show cause will therefore be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
