The plaintiff\u2019s truck was being driven by his son, a boy eighteen years old, who had no driver\u2019s license. The trial resulted i'n a verdict in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, the jury awarding him $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">Our examination of the testimony in the case satisfies us that the finding of the jury, which exonerates the plaintiff\u2019s driver from negligence contributing to the accident, is contrary to the great weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">Eor this reason the rule to show cause will be made absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
