The trial resulted in a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, the jury awarding him $500. He now asks to have this verdict set aside on the ground that the award is inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">A consideration of the character of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries and the results thereof satisfies us that the sum awarded by the jury as compensation therefor is not so inadequate as to justify us in setting the verdict aside. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b480-13\">The rule to show cause will be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
