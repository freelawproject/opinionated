There was some testimony in which the jewelry was described. Insurance papers, money and other documents seem to have been taken, and there was testimony with respect to these.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">The verdict should not be disturbed unless clearly improper, and we think this verdict reasonably supported by the evidence in all aspects in which it is challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The rule to show cause will be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
