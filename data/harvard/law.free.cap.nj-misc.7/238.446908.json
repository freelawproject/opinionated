JULIUS GREGORY, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b254-8\">Submitted October 13, 1928</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ant\">Decided March 7, 1929.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b254-11\">Before Justices Tkenchabd, Kalisch and Lloyd.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b254-12\">Eor the plaintiff in error, <em>Robert Newton Crane..</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b254-13\">Eor the defendant in error, <em>Abe J.

But we think that the question whether or not death resulted from gross negligence was properly submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">It is next argued that the judgment should be reversed because the trial judge overruled a question put by defendant\u2019s counsel to a witness produced by him as follows: \u201cDo you know what his (defendant\u2019s) reputation is in the city of Plain-field for being a careful automobile driver?\u201d Certainly in the circumstances the exclusion of that question was not prejudicial to the defendant, for the court recognized the right of the defendant to prove his reputation as a peaceable, orderly and law-abiding citizen and permitted him to do so. Questions as to defendant\u2019s reputation as a peaceable, orderly and law-abiding citizen were twice put to the witness by defendant\u2019s counsel and were twice answered that it was \u201cvery good,\u201d and this we think in effect was a sufficient answer to the excluded question.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">It is next argued that the court below erred in refusing to direct a verdict of acquittal at the close of the entire case, for the reason indicated in the like motion at the end of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>state\u2019s case. We think it quite plain that the motion was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Lastly, it is argued that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence. To this it is a sufficient answer to say that the contention is without merit in our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
