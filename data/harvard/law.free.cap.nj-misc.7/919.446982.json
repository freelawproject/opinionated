J. L. </em>93; <em>Van Duyne </em>v. <em>Senior, 5 N. J. Mis. R. </em>158. It becomes unnecessary therefore to consider at this time the legal merit of the second and third defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-13\">With respect to the claim that the defenses are sham, <em>i. e., </em>not made in good faith, it goes to all of the defenses and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>motion is to strike out the entire return. Hence, if the motion fails as to any of the defenses, it fails altogether. We are clear that fet least some of the four defenses are meritorious, and are by no means clear that they are not advanced in good faith, to say the least.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">These views lead to a denial of the motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
