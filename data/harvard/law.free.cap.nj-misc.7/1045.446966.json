The complaint, dated December 8th, 1928, charged the defendant below-\u2014-the prosecutor herein\u2014with violating the Montclair zoning ordinance \u201con September 26th, 1928, and evepy day thereafter,\u201d' in that he conducted a car washing and garage business in a building located within a prohibitive area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">Nine points are presented in prosecutor\u2019s brief, but we-shall advert to only one, the sixth, for the reason that that is dispositive. The point turns on the refusal of the trial court to admit- competent evidence. The prosecutor endeavored to introduce evidence showing a continuous application of the premises to the disputed use from May, 1921,(until the time of the alleged offense. The court ruled that such proof must be confined to a period prior to May, 1921, the date of the adoption of the zoning ordinance, and refused to permit proof of a later continuance. That ruling was erroneous. The prohibited use was not within the lawful purview of a zoning ordinance until April 3d, 1928, the date of the passage of the enabling statute <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1928, <em>ch. </em>274) and a use that had been theretofore actually and lawfully instituted, and that had been until then actively and constantly maintained, was a non-conforming use entitled, under the statute, to be continued. <em>Frank J. Durkin Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Belleville </em>(decided by <em>Court of Errors and </em>Appeals, October, 1929). Proof of the use at and preceding the passage of the statute was relevant and therefore competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">The judgment below is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
