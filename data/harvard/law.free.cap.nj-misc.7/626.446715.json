The case was heard by the judge of the District Court, without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>The plaintiff proved that it took the cheek on the day it bore date, partly in payment of tires, and party for cash; that on presentation the check was not paid. The defendant\u2019s contention was illegality in the contract; this illegality consisting of the fact that it was given for the purchase of liquors. The trial judge, deeming this a good defense, rendered judgment for the defendant and the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">In thus ruling we think there was error. \"Under the proofs plaintiff was a holder in due course <em>(Rice </em>v. Barrington, 75 <em>N. J. L. </em>806), and as such was entitled to recover the amount of the check. Assuming that the evidence offered'by the defendant established that a sale of intoxicating liquors was the consideration for which the check was given, this was not a defense against a <em>tona fide </em>holder, whatever the effect of the illegal consideration might bo as between the immediate parties. <em>Pamph.
