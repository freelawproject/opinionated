Lovett, and that she had his permission to drive it when she wanted to. This evidence raised a jury question <em>(Missell </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>86 <em>N. J. L. </em>348), which was left to the jury in an admirable charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>Our examination of the record leads us to the conclusion that the jury\u2019s finding on the question of agency was supported by evidence, and that the refusal of the trial judge to grant a nonsuit, or direct a verdict for the defendant Lester C. Lovett was in all respects proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">The rule will be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
