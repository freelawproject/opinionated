LEHIGH VALLEY RAILROAD COMPANY, DEFENDANT.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b176-4\">Argued January 17, 1929</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AWt\">Decided January 30, 1929.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b176-7\">Before Justices Mintuen, Black and Campbell.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b176-8\">For the relator, <em>John 0.

The application is based upon two affidavits; one by Alfred M. Barber, secretary of the board of public utility commissioners of New Jersey; one by Charles A. Mead, engineer; copies of two orders of the board of public utility commissioners, dated respectively, November 24th, 1926, and April 26th, 1927. Two answering affidavits, one by Ralph D. Van Duzer and one by William R. Johnstone, <em>Exhibit B </em>a petition for a rehearing before the board of public utility commissioners filed January 14th, 1929.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-12\">We cannot find any case in our reports, that would justify us in ordering a writ of <em>mandamus </em>in this case at this time. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>The power to issue the writ of <em>mandamus </em>is a discretionary one. <em>Jones Co. </em>v. <em>Guttenberg, </em>66 <em>N. J. L. </em>58; <em>Ibid. </em>659; <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Champion, </em>101 <em>Id. </em>569; 2 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>1135.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">The right to a writ of <em>mandamus </em>must be clear, it will be denied where it creates disorder and confusion. <em>English </em>v. <em>City of Asbury Park, </em>115 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>64; <em>Hugg </em>v. <em>Ivins, </em>59 <em>N. J. L. </em>139.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The public duty sought to be enforced must be clear and specific. <em>Uszkay </em>v. <em>Dill, </em>92 <em>N. J. L. </em>327.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The application is therefore denied at this time, but without prejudice to renew the same at a future time.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
