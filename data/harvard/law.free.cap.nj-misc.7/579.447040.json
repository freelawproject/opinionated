The brief for the defendant states that these motions were made. The record, however, is not in accord. Coming to the merits, no negligence of the railroad company was proved, and there was no proof that the door, the hinges or the jamb were out of order. Lurches of trains are to be expected. Persons who put their hands in door jambs do so <em>at </em>their own peril.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
