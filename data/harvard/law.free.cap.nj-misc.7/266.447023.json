The accident occurre\u2019d at five-thirty p. m. on November 13th, 1923. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that having reached the crosswalk of Main street, she looked both ways for traffic and saw no moving vehicles. She then started across the crosswalk of Main street and had got perhaps a little more than half way across when she was struck and injured by the automobile driven by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">This automobile of the defendants had been proceeding north on Lincoln avenue, and the driver wishing to make a turn west on Main street, instead of making a wide turn, made a short turn and so hit the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">It seems to us, therefore, that if the plaintiff\u2019s testimony is to be believed, she was justified in starting across the street at the time and in the manner that she did, and that it was open to the jury to find that the defendants\u2019 negligence (in view of traffic regulations and plaintiff\u2019s rights) caused the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">On the other hand, if defendants\u2019 proof was to be believed, it might perhaps be said that defendant was not guilty of negligence, and that plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence was the cause of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">In this state of the proof the only argument made before us is that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Our careful examination of the evidence results in the conclusion that we cannot say that the jury\u2019s finding with respect to the negligence of the defendant and want of contributory negligence of the plaintiff was against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">The result is that the rule to show cause will be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
