The testimony on behalf of the defendant shows that the sudden stopping of the bus was due to a Pord car suddenly cutting in in traffic in front of the bus, so that the bus driver, to avoid a collision, applied his brakes suddenly. There is some conflict of testimony as to the rate of speed of the bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-13\">On this state of proofs, the judgment below seems not erroneous and will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
