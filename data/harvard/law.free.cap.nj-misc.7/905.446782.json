Whatever may be the right of Beilig to attach the rights and credits of prosecutor, we are unable to see any jurisdiction in the Orange court to interfere with the execution of the process of a court of co-ordinate jurisdiction. Indeed, counsel for defendant admit this but say they have discontinued the attachment suit \u201cwithout prejudice, however, to the right of the plaintiff [Beilig] to commence a new suit.\u201d Notwithstanding this, we think prosecutor is entitled to the action of this court specifically vacating the injunctive order under review; and rule may therefore be entered overruling the same and setting it aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
