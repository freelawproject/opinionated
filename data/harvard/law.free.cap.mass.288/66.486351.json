On the aspect of the evidence most favorable to the plaintiffs these facts might have been found: Arnold was employed by the defendant; according to an employee\u2019s service card issued to him by the defendant his occupation was stated to be \u201cChauffeur.\u201d Bis duties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>primarily were not those of a chauffeur. Among his duties were acting as foreman of the defendant\u2019s garage, repairing its trucks and occasionally driving one of those trucks. He owned the automobile in question and was accustomed with it to take men out on jobs for the defendant and to bring them back, to carry bundles to the post office and to collect mail at the post office, and to transport experts to repair machines at different places. The general manager of the defendant on occasions told the company\u2019s shipper to have Arnold take him on company errands. Arnold had taken an electrician employed by the defendant in his car to do work for the defendant in Somerville and was bringing him back at the time of the accident. When the automobile of Arnold was used'on the company\u2019s business \"he got gas and oil from his employer.\u201d There was no evidence to the effect that Arnold was given any instructions how or at what speed he should drive his automobile or what route he should take, but the testimony was that all these things were determined by Arnold without any direction from the defendant. The case is very close but we are of opinion that it is governed by <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Coleman Bros. Inc. </em>277 Mass. 319, where the pertinent authorities are reviewed. In each case the entry may be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-3\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
