It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>rarely that such a ruling can rightly be made. <em>Castano </em>v. <em>Leone, </em>278 Mass. 429, 431. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 85. The plaintiff was a pedestrian. At about eight o\u2019clock in the evening of the last day of September, 1933, he left the curb of a reservation to cross a well lighted street when the automobiles of the defendant and of several others were two hundred to two hundred and fifty feet away, shortly after having been stopped by a traffic officer, and was struck by the automobile of the defendant. There was testimony that the defendant had said that he was responsible for the accident, that he was in a hurry and was going too fast. The evidence need not be recited. A careful examination of it convinces us that there was no error of law in denying the request for ruling that a finding be entered for the defendant. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 17. The case falls within the class of cases illustrated by <em>McGuiggan </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>278 Mass. 264, <em>McSorley </em>v. <em>Risdon, </em>278 Mass. 415, <em>Legg </em>v. <em>Bloom, </em>282 Mass. 303, and <em>Sooserian </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>287 Mass. 65, and is distinguishable from cases like <em>Will </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>247 Mass. 250, and <em>O\u2019Callaghan </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>249 Mass. 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
