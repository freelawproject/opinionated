There was evidence for the plaintiff that the trench was left insufficiently lighted.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">Subject to exception by the defendant, the plaintiff was permitted to prove that shortly after the occurrence of the injury, the superintendent of public works of the defendant was notified, and sent an inspector who changed the position of the \u201chorse\u201d or barrier so that it stretched across the sidewalk, and then hung four lanterns on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">There was no question that the trench was dug and maintained by the water department, and consequently the admission of the evidence cannot be supported on the ground that it bore upon the question of control over, and responsibility for, the excavation. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>187 Mass. 28. <em>Baum </em>v. <em>Ahlborn, </em>210 Mass. 336.
