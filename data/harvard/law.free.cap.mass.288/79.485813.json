The case was referred to an auditor who made findings of fact. The plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment was allowed and the defendants excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">The motion for judgment was allowed rightly. See <em>Ballou </em>v. <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>283 Mass. 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">The auditor found that on December 1, 1928, the plaintiff sustained personal injuries when, in attempting to get into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>parked automobile, she fell into a greasing pit on premises leased to the defendants, \u201cused- as a gasoline filling station and a place for oiling and greasing automobiles and for the parking out of doors of automobiles upon the payment of a' required charge.\u201d And he found that the owner and operator of the parked automobile paid the defendants the required charge for parking it. The auditor also found, as a conclusion from other facts found, that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care at the time of the accident, that the defendants extended to the operator of the automobile and \u201cto those riding in it an invitation to enter said premises for the purpose of parking\u201d the automobile thereon, and that the plaintiff\u2019s accident was due to negligence of the defendants or their agents. And the plaintiff\u2019s damages were assessed. These findings support the judgment and so far as they are conclusions from other facts found are warranted by such facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The defendants\u2019 duty \u2014 breach of which would constitute negligence \u2014 to persons invited to enter the premises for the purpose of parking an automobile thereon for hire was to use reasonable care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition for such persons\u2019 use according to the invitation, or at least to warn them against any dangers attendant upon this use which were not known to them or obvious to any ordinarily intelligent person and either were known or in the exercise of reasonable care ought to have been known to the defendants. <em>Crone </em>v. <em>Jordan Marsh Co. </em>269 Mass. 289, 291. <em>Fielding </em>v. <em>S. Z. Poli Realty Co. </em>274 Mass. 20, 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The subsidiary facts found warranted the conclusion that the plaintiff, when injured, was using the premises according to the defendants\u2019 invitation. The premises were seven thousand square feet in area, of which about three thousand square feet were paved with concrete. A sign conspicuously displayed bore the words \u201cParking \u2014 25 cents.\u201d The owner and operator of the automobile, which was occupied also by the plaintiff and two other women, drove it into the parking space for the purpose of parking it. The four women got out of the automobile and an attendant in the employ of the defendants parked the automobile lengthwise over a greasing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>pit within the paved area. About three feet in front of this automobile another automobile was parked partly over the pit. Later in the day, about 5:45 in the afternoon, the owner and the plaintiff returned to the parking space. The two other women, already in the automobile, called to them and an attendant in the employ of the defendants indicated by motion of his hand where the automobile was parked. An attendant would have driven the automobile from its position over the pit if the owner had requested him to do so. The owner opened the door on the left side and placed some packages in the automobile and the plaintiff at the same time started to go around in front of the automobile in order to enter it on the right side and in so doing fell into the pit. The nature of the parking space and the conduct of the defendants\u2019 employees warranted the inference that the defendants\u2019 invitation to use the parking space for hire contemplated that the owner and operator might drive the automobile from the space where it was parked, and that both she and her companion, the plaintiff, might get into it at that place. <em>Fielding </em>v. <em>S. Z. Poli Realty Co. </em>274 Mass. 20, 22. See also <em>Sweeny </em>v. <em>Old Colony &amp; Newport Railroad, 10 </em>Allen, 368; <em>Statkunas </em>v. <em>L. Promboim &amp; Son Inc. </em>274 Mass. 515, 520. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Huntley, </em>251 Mass. 555, is distinguishable in its facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The finding that the plaintiff\u2019s injury was caused by negligence of the defendants or their agents was warranted by the subsidiary facts found. The greasing pit was rectangular, constructed of concrete and approximately nineteen and three fourths feet long, three feet wide, and six feet deep. There was a curbing of concrete around it, close to the edge of the opening, about four or five inches high, about four or five inches wide at the sides and somewhat wider at the front and back. The wheels of the automobiles parked over the pit rested on the concrete pavement outside the curbing. There was not sufficient light between the two automobiles to enable any one attempting to pass in the three-foot space between them \u201cto discern the existence of the pit,\u201d there \u201cwas no fence, rail or barrier of any kind, other than said . . . curbing, surrounding said pit . . . there was no warn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>ing light thereon ... no notice of the existence of the pit was posted upon said premises and ... no one warned the plaintiff or either of her companions of the existence of the pit\u201d or that the automobile had been parked over it. These findings warranted the conclusion that the defendants did not use reasonable care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition for the plaintiff\u2019s use according to the invitation or give her the required warning of the danger attendant upon such use. <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>152 Mass. 513. <em>Marston </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>211 Mass. 590. <em>Blood </em>v. <em>Ansley, </em>231 Mass. 438. <em>Grogan </em>v. <em>O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s Inc. </em>267 Mass. 189, 193. <em>Statkunas </em>v. <em>L. Promboim &amp; Son Inc. </em>274 Mass. 515, 520. And the inference of a causal relation between this breach of duty on the part of the defendants and the plaintiff\u2019s injury could properly be drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The burden of proving contributory negligence \u2014 want of due care \u2014 of the plaintiff was on the defendants. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 85. <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>268 Mass. 454, 461. Neither the plaintiff nor any one of her companions had noticed the greasing pit before the accident. In view of this finding and of the findings in regard to insufficient light and to the conduct of the attendants, the conclusion that the plaintiff was not in the exercise of due care was not required as matter of law. <em>Marston </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>211 Mass. 590. <em>Sleeper </em>v. <em>Park, </em>232 Mass. 292, 296. <em>Goldstein </em>v. <em>Slutsky, </em>254 Mass. 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
