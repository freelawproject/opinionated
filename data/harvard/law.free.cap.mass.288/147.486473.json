The only questions sought to be raised are the jurisdiction of the court to try the offence charged, and the sufficiency of the indictment to charge a crime. It is recited in the record that no question is raised as to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the indictment if it is legally sufficient. At the close of the testimony the defendants moved in writing that the judge direct verdicts of not guilty. The motions were denied subject to the defendants\u2019 exceptions. The jury returned a verdict of guilty as to each defendant. Thereafter each defendant filed a motion in arrest of judgment, assigning as reasons therefor that the court had no jurisdiction of the alleged offence sought to be charged in the indictment, and that it failed to charge any offence cognizable at common law or by statute. These motions were denied and the defendants excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The indictment plainly alleges a conspiracy to violate G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 268, \u00a7 8A. In a charge of conspiracy \u201cthe conspiracy is the gist of the crime, and certainty, to a common intent, sufficient to identify the offense which the defendants conspired to commit, is all that is requisite in stating the object of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number><em>States, </em>207 U. S. 425, 447. It is the contention of the defendants that the indictment is fatally defective because the crime which it intends to charge is conspiracy \u201cto become accessories before the fact\u201d to bribery. They rely upon the case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>132 Mass. 242, to sustain their contention. That case was decided in the year 1882 and before St. 1899, c. 409, entitled \u201cAn Act to provide for the simplification of criminal pleadings,\u201d was enacted (now G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 277). It is provided in \u00a7 34 of c. 277 as follows: \u201cAn indictment shall not be quashed or be considered defective or insufficient if it is sufficient to enable the defendant to understand the charge and to prepare his defence; nor shall it be considered defective or insufficient for lack of any description or information which might be obtained by requiring a bill of particulars under section forty.\u201d Section 40 of the same chapter provides that the judge may order the prosecution to file a statement of such particulars as may be necessary to give the defendant and the judge reasonable knowledge of the nature and grounds of the crime charged. It was said in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>132 Mass. 242, at page 243: \u201cAn act which makes the one who commits it an accessory before the fact to a felony is an unlawful act, and a conspiracy to do such an act is a conspiracy to do an unlawful act, and indictable. We have no doubt that an indictment properly alleging a conspiracy to do an act for the purpose of inducing a person to commit a felony, or of aiding him in committing it, would be a good indictment.\u201d If the defendants did not have reasonable knowledge of the nature of and grounds of the crime charged they could have requested further particulars under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 277, \u00a7 40. The indictment in the present case specifically alleges a conspiracy to solicit bribes under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 268, \u00a7 8A. The motions filed by the defendants could not properly have been granted. There is nothing inconsistent with this conclusion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>132 Mass. 242. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>163 Mass. 411, an indictment charging conspiracy to bribe framed in much the same language as the indictment herein considered was held sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
