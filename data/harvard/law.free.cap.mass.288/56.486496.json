In January, 1930, a libel for divorce on the ground of cruel and abusive treatment was filed by the libellant against the libellee, which on February 27, 1933, was \u201cdismissed without prejudice.\u201d A request by the libellant for a ruling that he was entitled to proceed and be heard was denied and the libel was dismissed as matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-15\">The ruling was right. <em>Najjar </em>v. <em>Najjar, </em>227 Mass. 450. The dismissal of the earlier libel without prejudice does not extinguish the force of its allegations as binding on the libellant. That libel raised a conclusive presumption of fact that the desertion of his wife after that time was with his consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-16\">\n<em>Order dismissing libel affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
