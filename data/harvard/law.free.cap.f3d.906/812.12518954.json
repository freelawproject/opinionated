Payton argues that the district attorney who secured his conviction and death sentence made false sworn statements during the federal habeas proceedings, and that these statements were part of a larger scheme involving assignment of inmate informants to cells next to defendants incarcerated in Orange County, California, in hopes of obtaining incriminating admissions. Payton's motion also presents the threshold question-one of first impression in our circuit-whether Rule 60(d) is subject to the COA requirement in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202253\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). We conclude that a COA is required, but that Payton is not entitled to one. We DENY his request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Thirty-eight years ago, on May 26, 1980, Payton raped Pamela Montgomery and\n   stabbed her to death with a butcher knife.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the frenzied attack, he also attempted to kill Patricia Pensinger and her young son. Both survived and identified Payton as the attacker. A jury convicted him in 1981 and found the circumstances sufficient to sentence Payton to death. Nearly forty years later, the parties are still litigating Payton's conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Sometime before May 26, 1980, Payton had been a boarder at Patricia Pensinger's home in Garden Grove, California. On that date, Pamela Montgomery and Patricia's 10-year-old son, Blaine, were living in the house. But Payton no longer resided there. At 4:00 a.m., Payton entered the kitchen, where Patricia-unable to sleep-was working on a crossword puzzle. Payton said he'd had car trouble. The two chatted, and Payton drank a few beers. Pamela Montgomery came in for a glass of water, and Patricia introduced her to Payton. He later asked Patricia if he could sleep on the couch, and she obliged. Patricia went to her bedroom, where Blaine was already sleeping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Patricia was startled awake some time later when Payton stabbed her in the back with a butcher knife. She rolled over and he began to stab her in the face and neck. The vicious attack awakened Blaine. When Blaine tried to snatch the knife away, Payton stabbed him, too. When Payton tried to stab Patricia in the abdomen, the knife blade bent. Payton got off the bed and yelled he was leaving. Patricia told Blaine to escape while she distracted Payton. She found him in the kitchen with a second knife. Payton stabbed Patricia repeatedly in the back and attacked Blaine as he ran through the kitchen. When a male boarder woke up, Payton dropped the knife and fled. Patricia suffered a total of 40 stab wounds to her face, neck, back, and chest. Blaine incurred 23 stab wounds to his face, neck, and back. Miraculously, both survived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Pamela Montgomery was found dead on her bedroom floor, lying in a pool of blood. Her body had 12 stab wounds, half of which formed a line from her stomach to pubic area. Pamela had been sexually assaulted. She also had defensive wounds. The saliva and semen collected from her body were consistent with Payton's. Pamela had been dead 15 to 30 minutes before her body was found. Payton fled that morning and was eventually arrested in Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Orange County District Attorney charged Payton with the rape and special circumstance murder of Pamela Montgomery, and the attempted murders of Patricia and Blaine Pensinger. While incarcerated in the Orange County Jail, Payton made incriminating statements to two inmates, Alejandro Garcia and Daniel Escalera, who reported his admissions to law enforcement. After an evidentiary hearing, the state trial court determined the two inmates were not police agents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the guilt phase of the trial, the prosecution offered Patricia's and Blaine's eyewitness accounts. Forensic experts testified about the bodily fluids taken from the\n   victim's body, and law enforcement officers testified to the crime scene. Payton's wife testified that Payton had returned home with fingernail scratches on his back and covered in blood, some of which was still wet, including blood on his genital area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Alejandro Garcia testified that Payton had confessed to him, while the two were in jail, that he had raped and stabbed Pamela Montgomery because he had \"this urge to kill.\" Defense counsel impeached Garcia with his extensive criminal record and previous deals with law enforcement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Garcia testified that he was not offered nor did he receive anything in exchange for his testimony against Payton. The defense called no witnesses. The jury convicted Payton on all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the penalty phase, a former girlfriend of Payton's testified that she once awoke, after intercourse, to Payton standing over her holding a kitchen knife to her neck, and that he began stabbing her chest and arms. Escalera, the other jailhouse informant, testified to his conversation during which Payton confessed he had \"severe problems with sex and women,\" that he would \"stab and rape them,\" and that every woman \"was a potential victim, regardless of age or looks.\" Escalera admitted that he hoped for leniency in exchange for testifying against Payton; he too was impeached with his criminal record. The defense called eight witnesses. Their testimony focused on Payton's religious conversion in prison. In December 1981, the Orange County Superior Court jury returned a sentence of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The California Supreme Court consolidated and reviewed Payton's automatic direct appeal and a separate habeas petition alleging ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    People v.

At the COA stage, the only question is whether the applicant has shown that jurists of reason could disagree with the district court's resolution of his constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further. This threshold question should be decided without full consideration of the factual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims. When a court of appeals sidesteps the COA process by first deciding the merits of an appeal, and then justifying its denial of a COA based on its adjudication of the actual merits, it is in essence deciding an appeal without jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    Buck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609620\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/759/#p777\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations and internal quotations omitted).
