After visiting a casino on the Lummi reservation, Wilson was stopped by Lummi police and found with marijuana in his truck. Citing a violation of tribal drug laws, the Lummi Tribe issued a notice of civil forfeiture and took possession of Wilson's truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Wilson sued Officer Gates, who had served the forfeiture notice, and Horton's Towing, the towing company that had released the car to Officer Gates. The district court then substituted the United States as a defendant for Officer Gates pursuant to the Westfall Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202679\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the summary judgment phase, Wilson's sole remaining claim was one for conversion against Horton's Towing and the United States (collectively, \"Defendants\"). The district court entered summary judgment against Wilson and dismissed the action with prejudice. It held that Wilson had failed to exhaust his tribal remedies against Horton's Towing, and that Wilson had also failed to exhaust his administrative remedies against the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and we affirm the district court's order entering summary judgment.

Wilson was stopped on this road by Grant Assink, a Lummi tribal police officer, who suspected that Wilson was driving while intoxicated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Officer Assink searched Wilson's pickup truck and found several containers of marijuana inside. Officer Assink then alerted the Washington State Patrol, who arrested Wilson for driving under the influence. At the direction of the Washington State Patrol, Horton's Towing impounded the truck and towed it off the reservation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The next day, the Lummi Tribal Court issued a \"Notice of Seizure and Intent to Institute Forfeiture.\" The notice cited Section 5.09A.110(d)(2) of the Lummi Nation Code of Laws, which prohibits the possession of marijuana over one ounce, as the grounds for civil forfeiture. Lummi Tribal Police Officer Brandon Gates presented Horton's Towing with the forfeiture notice, and Horton's Towing released the truck to Officer Gates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On the basis of these events, Plaintiff brought suit against Horton's Towing and Officer Brandon Gates. After the filing of a certification by the Attorney General, the district court substituted the United States as a party for Officer Gates pursuant to the Westfall Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202679\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Subsequently, Defendants filed motions for summary judgment. The district court entered summary judgment in Defendants' favor. It held that principles of comity required Wilson to exhaust his tribal remedies against Horton's Towing.
