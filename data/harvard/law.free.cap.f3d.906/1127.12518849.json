After his trial ended in a hung\n   jury, the trial court dismissed the case under California Penal Code \u00a7 1385. The state filed a new complaint, charging Dominguez with murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Dominguez filed a demurrer, arguing the second prosecution violated his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause and California law, but the trial court overruled his demurrer, and Dominguez was tried and convicted. Dominguez then asserted his double jeopardy claim in a federal habeas petition under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The state placed Dominguez in pretrial custody, where he remains. Citing the state court's decision vacating the earlier convictions, the district court dismissed Dominguez's federal habeas petition as moot. Dominguez appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We hold Dominguez's petition is not moot. It continues to present a live controversy because he remains in custody, continues to claim he is in custody in violation of the Constitution of the United States and continues to present precisely the same legal claim that he presented when his petition was filed - that the state's second prosecution of him, which remains ongoing, violates his federal constitutional right not to be twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We hold, however, that Dominguez is no longer required to proceed under \u00a7 2254. Section 2254 limits the general grant of habeas authority under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   by placing additional obstacles in the path of a person seeking habeas relief when he is \"in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Where a petitioner is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   challenging custody attributable to a state court judgment, his custody does not bear a presumption of validity. Section 2254 therefore does not apply, and he is free to seek habeas relief under \u00a7 2241(a) and (c)(3) instead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Finally, we hold that, to proceed under \u00a7 2241, Dominguez is not required to dismiss his \u00a7 2254 petition and file a new petition under \u00a7 2241. Just as a court may convert a \u00a7 2241 petition to a \u00a7 2254 petition when a pretrial detainee is convicted while a petition is pending, we hold that a court has the authority to convert a \u00a7 2254 petition into a \u00a7 2241 petition when a petitioner's convictions are vacated during the pendency of the petition and the petitioner has become a pretrial detainee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We vacate the judgment and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Dominguez was charged with murder in 2010 (San Diego County Superior Court No. SCD225579).

The state trial court overruled the demurrer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The second prosecution proceeded to trial, and Dominguez was convicted on both charges. Dominguez appealed the convictions, arguing again that the second prosecution violated double jeopardy. In a reasoned decision, the California Court of Appeal denied relief, disagreeing with Dominguez's contention that the 2010 dismissal constituted a finding of insufficient evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

Dominguez argued \"the second trial was barred under the Fifth Amendment\" and asked the district court to \"remand the case back to trial court directing it to grant [his] demurrer on Double Jeopardy grounds.\" A federal magistrate judge recommended the district court grant the writ, agreeing with Dominguez that the 2010 dismissal operated as an acquittal, and concluding that the California Court of Appeal's decision to the contrary was both an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) and based on an unreasonable determination of the facts under \u00a7 2254(d)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Before the district court could rule on the magistrate judge's recommendation, a state trial court granted Dominguez post-conviction relief on an independent ground, vacating his murder and conspiracy convictions under\n   <em>\n    Brady v.

But the state court has since vacated this conviction. In doing so, it extinguished Dominguez's two claims under \u00a7 2254. His claim that ... his second prosecution violated the Double Jeopardy Clause ... does not present a live controversy. He is no longer in custody pursuant to the conviction procured by the second prosecution. Moreover, unlike cases where petitioners have completed their sentences but are still permitted to challenge their convictions because the convictions cause collateral consequences, there is no conviction here for Dominguez to seek to set aside. At this point, opining on the constitutional condition of Dominguez's second prosecution would be advisory. Therefore, the two claims raised in Dominguez's \u00a7 2254 petition are moot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The court also declined to treat Dominguez's petition as a \"pre-trial custody petition\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , explaining that doing so would require the court to address three undeveloped issues:\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention; exhaustion; and the merits of Dominguez's double jeopardy claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court dismissed Dominguez's petition as moot and declined to issue a certificate of appealability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Dominguez timely appealed, and we issued a certificate of appealability \"with respect to ... whether the district court erred by dismissing the petition as moot, including whether the petition should be\n   construed as a petition under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"We review de novo the district court's dismissal of a habeas petition on the ground of mootness.\"\n   <em>\n    Zegarra-Gomez v.

Where a petition is filed by a post-conviction detainee under \u00a7 2254 and the conviction\n   subsequently is vacated, the federal court has the authority - at the petitioner's request or with the petitioner's consent - to convert the \u00a7 2254 petition to a \u00a7 2241 petition.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stow\n   </em>\n   , 389 F.3d at 885 (holding the petitioner's pretrial double jeopardy challenge, filed under \u00a7 2254, should be treated as a petition under \u00a7 2241 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Remaining Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The district court cited two additional potential obstacles to Dominguez's double jeopardy claim: (1) whether Dominguez has adequately exhausted the claim; and (2) whether the Double Jeopardy Clause bars his prosecution on a charge of conspiracy to commit murder when his previous acquittal applied, if at all, solely to the charge of murder. As the district court noted, these additional issues were not adequately developed, and the district court did not reach them. We leave them for the district court to address in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   We hold Dominguez's federal habeas petition continues to present a live controversy challenging his ongoing second prosecution as a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. We further hold Dominguez is no longer required to proceed under \u00a7 2254. Finally, we hold a district court has the authority to convert a \u00a7 2254 petition into a \u00a7 2241 petition where the petitioner's circumstances change during the pendency of the proceedings. We vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Because Dominguez's detention is no longer attributable to a state court judgment, proceeding under \u00a7 2254 is no longer appropriate. On remand, the district court shall, either upon Dominguez's request or at the court's initiation but with Dominguez's consent, convert the petition to one arising under \u00a7 2241. If Dominguez elects not to convert the petition, the district court shall dismiss the petition without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Costs of appeal are awarded to Dominguez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    VACATED AND REMANDED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201385\">\n     Cal.
