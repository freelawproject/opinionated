Child slavery on cocoa farms in the Ivory Coast, where seventy percent of the world's cocoa is produced, is a pervasive humanitarian tragedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs are former child slaves who were kidnapped and forced to work on cocoa farms in the Ivory Coast for up to fourteen hours a day without pay. While being forced to work on the cocoa farms, plaintiffs witnessed the beating and torture of other child slaves who attempted to escape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants are large manufacturers, purchasers, processors, and retail sellers of cocoa beans. Several of them are foreign corporations that are not subject to suit under the ATS.\n   <em>\n    Jesner v.

The effect of\n   <em>\n    Jesner\n   </em>\n   in tandem with plaintiffs' habit of describing defendants en masse presents a challenge we address below. For now, we describe the case as plaintiffs present it. We take\n   their plausible allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in their favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nestle I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201239\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/1013/\">\n    766 F.3d at 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Because of their economic leverage over the cocoa market, defendants effectively control cocoa production in the Ivory Coast. Defendant Nestle, USA is headquartered in Virginia and coordinates the major operations of its parent corporation, Nestle, SA, selling Nestle-brand products in the United States. Every major operational decision regarding Nestle's United States market is made in or approved in the United States. Defendant Cargill, Inc. is headquartered in Minneapolis. The business is centralized in Minneapolis and decisions about buying and selling commodities are made at its Minneapolis headquarters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants operate with the unilateral goal of finding the cheapest source of cocoa in the Ivory Coast. Not content to rely on market forces to keep costs low, defendants have taken steps to perpetuate a system built on child slavery to depress labor costs. To maintain their supply of cocoa, defendants have exclusive buyer/seller relationships with Ivory Coast farmers, and provide those farmers with financial support, such as advance payments and personal spending money. 19 Malian child slaves were rescued from a farm with whom Cargill has an exclusive buyer/seller relationship. Defendants also provide tools, equipment, and technical support to farmers, including training in farming techniques and farm maintenance. In connection with providing this training and support, defendants visit their supplier farms several times per year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants were well aware that child slave labor is a pervasive problem in the Ivory Coast. Nonetheless, defendants continued to provide financial support and technical farming aid, even though they knew their acts would assist farmers who were using forced child labor, and knew their assistance would facilitate child slavery. Indeed, the gravamen of the complaint is that defendants depended on-and orchestrated-a slave-based supply chain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs began this lawsuit over a decade ago, and we had occasion to consider it once before in\n   <em>\n    Nestle I\n   </em>\n   . On remand after\n   <em>\n    Nestle I\n   </em>\n   , defendants moved to dismiss the operative complaint and the district court granted the motion. In its order, the district concluded that the complaint seeks an impermissible extraterritorial application of the ATS because defendants engaged domestically only in ordinary business conduct. The district court did not decide whether plaintiffs stated a claim for aiding and abetting child slavery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We review a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction de novo.\n   <em>\n    Corrie v.

Contrary to the district court's reasoning, providing personal spending money to maintain relationship above the contract price for cocoa is not ordinary business conduct, and is more akin to \"kickbacks.\"\n   <em>\n    Mastafa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4267427\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/770/170/#p185\">\n    770 F.3d at 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants also had employees from their United States headquarters regularly inspect operations in the Ivory Coast and report back to the United States offices, where these financing decisions, or \"financing arrangements,\" originated.\n   <em>\n    Licci by Licci\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056201\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/201/#p214\">\n    834 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   217 (citing\n   <em>\n    Mastafa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4267427\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/770/170/#p185\">\n    770 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   191 ).

We think it unnecessary to reach that issue at this time. As we have explained,\n   <em>\n    Jesner\n   </em>\n   changed the legal landscape on which plaintiffs constructed their case. The operative complaint names several foreign corporations as defendants, and plaintiffs concede those defendants must be dismissed on remand. The operative complaint also discusses defendants as if they are a single bloc-a problematic approach that plaintiffs would do well to avoid. In light of\n   <em>\n    Jesner\n   </em>\n   , it is not possible on the current record to connect culpable conduct to defendants that may be sued under the ATS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As we observed in\n   <em>\n    Nestle I\n   </em>\n   , \"[i]t is common practice to allow plaintiffs to amend their pleadings to accommodate changes in the law, unless it is clear that amendment would be futile.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nestle I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201239\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/1013/\">\n    766 F.3d at 1028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). We are mindful that this case has lingered for over a decade, and that delay does not serve the interests of any party. But we cannot conclude that amendment would be futile, so we remand with instructions that plaintiffs be given an opportunity to amend their complaint. On remand, plaintiffs must remove those defendants who are no longer amenable to suit under the ATS, and specify which potentially liable party is responsible for what culpable conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, we\n   <strong>\n    REVERSE\n   </strong>\n   the district court and\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   to allow plaintiffs to amend their complaint to specify whether aiding and abetting conduct that took place in the United States is attributable to the domestic corporations in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   SHEA, District Judge:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   I concur in the result.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed ADM from this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
