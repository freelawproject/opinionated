That withdrawal did not extinguish \"valid existing rights.\" In these consolidated appeals, we consider challenges by the Havasupai Tribe (\"the Tribe\") and three environmental groups-Grand Canyon Trust, Center for Biological Diversity and Sierra Club (collectively, \"the Trust\")-to the determination of the United States Forest Service (the \"Forest Service\") that Energy Fuels Resources (USA), Inc., and EFR Arizona Strip LLC (collectively, \"Energy Fuels\") had a valid existing right to operate a uranium mine on land within the withdrawal area. As elaborated below, we affirm, with one exception, the district court's order rejecting those challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Much of what we said in\n   <em>\n    National Mining Association\n   </em>\n   concerning the history of uranium mining in the area and the Secretary's withdrawal decision is also relevant here. To that we add some additional background regarding the particular mine at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Grand Canyon National Park is bordered to the north and south by the Kaibab National Forest. The southern portion of the forest-which is included in the withdrawal area-contains Red Butte, a site of religious and cultural significance to the Tribe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 1988, the Forest Service approved a plan to build and operate what became known as Canyon Mine, a 17.4-acre uranium mine in the area around Red Butte. During the approval process, the Forest Service prepared an Environmental Impact Statement (\"EIS\") pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (\"NEPA\"). NEPA requires an EIS for any \"major Federal action[ ] significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At that time, the Forest Service also addressed the mine's impact under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (\"NHPA\"). Section 106 of the NHPA requires federal agencies, prior to issuing a license for any \"undertaking,\" to \"take into account the effect of the undertaking on any [historic property].\" Pub. L. No. 89-665, \u00a7 106 (codified, as amended, at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20306108\">\n    54 U.S.C. \u00a7 306108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

The review did not include nearby Red Butte because that site was not eligible for inclusion on the National Register until 1992.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   National Historical Preservation Act Amendments of 1992, Pub. L. No. 102-575, tit. XL, \u00a7 4006 (making \"[p]roperties of traditional religious and cultural importance to an Indian tribe\" eligible for inclusion on the National Register).

The mine operator built surface facilities and sank the first fifty feet of a 1,400-foot shaft, but placed the mine on \"standby\" status in 1992 due to the unfavorable conditions in the uranium market that we described in\n   <em>\n    National Mining Association\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As noted, the Secretary's withdrawal decision was \"subject to valid existing rights.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%202563\">\n    77 Fed. Reg. 2563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Jan. 18, 2012). A few months before the decision became final, Energy Fuels-which had become Canyon Mine's owner-notified the Forest Service that it intended to return the mine to active operations. At the Service's request, Energy Fuels agreed not to resume sinking the mineshaft pending review of its claim of existing rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On April 18, 2012, the Forest Service issued a \"Mineral Report.\" It found that Energy Fuels' predecessors-in-interest had \"located\" mining claims at the site in 1978 and \"discovered\" uranium ore there between 1978 and 1982. It further found that there were 84,207 tons of uranium ore on the site, and that \"under present economic conditions, the uranium deposit on the claims could be mined, removed, transported, milled and marketed at a profit.\" Based on those findings, the Forest Service concluded that Energy Fuel had \"valid existing rights that were established prior to the mineral withdrawal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Forest Service also reviewed its 1988 decision, including its EIS and the mine's approved plan of operations (\"PoO\"), \"for any changes in laws, policies or regulations that might require additional federal actions to be taken before operations resume.\" In a \"Mine Review\" dated June 25, 2012, it concluded that the existing PoO was \"still in effect and no amendment or modification to the PoO is required before Canyon Mine resumes operations under the approved PoO.\" It further concluded that \"[n]o new federal action subject to further NEPA analysis is required for resumption of operations of the Canyon Mine.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   With respect to historic preservation, the Mine Review concluded that \"there will be no new federal undertakings subject to NHPA Section 106 compliance.\" It noted, however, that Red Butte had become eligible for inclusion on the National Register, and opined that the site \"could be considered a newly 'discovered' historic property.\" Applying the regulation applicable to such discoveries,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20800.13\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3), the Forest Service immediately contacted the Tribe to \"enter into government-to-government consultation\" to \"develop 'actions' to resolve or minimize the adverse effects\" on Red Butte. In response, the Tribe insisted on a revised PoO, a supplemental EIS and a full consultation under section 106 of the NHPA. The Forest Service and the Tribe continued to correspond, but never settled on a specific plan of action. The Mine Review alludes to the likely reason: \"Tribes have commented that most anticipated impacts, including\n   the most serious impacts, cannot be mitigated if uranium mining is conducted at the Canyon Mine site.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Consultation with the Tribe ended in March 2013, when the Tribe and the Trust jointly filed suit against the Forest Service in the district court. Energy Fuels intervened as a defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As amended, the complaint asserted four claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   1. the Forest Service's determination that Energy Fuels had valid existing rights to operate the Canyon Mine notwithstanding the January 2012 withdrawal was a \"major federal action significantly affecting the environment,\" and, therefore, the service violated the NEPA by not preparing an EIS in connection with its determination;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   2. the Forest Service's determination was an \"undertaking,\" and, therefore, the service violated the NHPA by not conducting a full consultation under section 106 in connection with its determination;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   3. alternatively, the Forest Service violated the NHPA by not properly updating its original section 106 analysis to account for the impact on Red Butte; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   4. the Forest Service violated several federal laws by failing to take various costs into account in its determination that Canyon Mine could be operated at a profit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As relief, the plaintiffs sought a declaration that the Forest Service was acting in violation of the NEPA, the NHPA and other laws; an order setting aside any \"approvals or authorizations\" for operations at Canyon Mine; and an injunction prohibiting \"any further uranium exploration or mining-related activities at the Canyon Mine unless and until the Forest Service fully complies with all applicable laws.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The parties cross-moved for summary judgment. In an order dated April 7, 2015, the district court held (1) that the plaintiffs had Article III standing, (2) that the plaintiffs lacked prudential standing with respect to their fourth claim, and (3) that the Mineral Report-which the district court referred to as the \"VER [Valid Existing Rights] Determination\"-was a final agency action subject to review under the APA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grand Canyon Tr. v.

Turning to the merits, the district court held (1) that the Mineral Report was not a \"major federal action\" requiring an EIS under the NEPA; (2) that the report was not an \"undertaking\" requiring a full section 106 consultation under the NHPA; (3) that the Forest Service's decision to consider the effect on Red Butte under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20800.13\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3) was reasonable; and (4) that the Forest Service had complied with that regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20800.13\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20800.13\">\n    at 1062-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Both the Tribe and the Trust timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Forest Service argues that we lack jurisdiction because its determination that Energy Fuels has valid existing rights was not a final agency action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ukiah Valley Med.

Here, too, we agree with the district court that the Mineral Report did not \"permit, license, or approv[e]\" resumed operations at Canyon Mine; it simply acknowledged the continued vitality of the original approval of the PoO. Just as that approval was the only \"major federal action\" requiring an EIS under the NEPA, it was the only \"undertaking\" requiring consultation under the NHPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Tribe concedes that the approval process in 1986 included the necessary consultation, and that the cultural and religious impacts on Red Butte were not included because they were not required to be at that time. It argues, however, that the NHPA imposes a continuing obligation on federal agencies to address the impact on historic property at any stage of an undertaking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The statutory definition of \"undertaking\" dates from 1992. Prior to that, it was defined by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (\"ACHP\"), the agency charged with implementing the NHPA, to include \"continuing projects, activities, or programs and any of their elements not previously considered under section 106.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20800.2\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (o) (1991).

We therefore disagree with the Tribe that the current definition of \"undertaking\" encompasses a continuing obligation to evaluate previously approved projects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Although continuing obligations have been removed from the definition of \"undertaking,\" they remain in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20800.13\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   If historic properties are discovered or unanticipated effects on historic properties found after the agency official has completed the section 106 process ..., the agency official shall make reasonable efforts to avoid, minimize or mitigate adverse effects to such properties and:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (1) If the agency official has not approved the undertaking or if construction on an approved undertaking has not commenced, consult to resolve adverse effects pursuant to \u00a7 800.6; or ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   (3) If the agency official has approved the undertaking and construction has commenced, determine actions that the agency official can take to resolve adverse effects, and notify the [state or tribal historical office], any Indian tribe ... that might attach religious and cultural significance to the affected property, and the [Advisory Council on Historic Preservation] within 48 hours of the discovery.

It further concluded that subsection (3) applied because construction had begun in the early 1990s, although it acknowledged that the 20-year hiatus presented a \"somewhat unusual situation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Tribe objects that Red Butte was not a newly discovered historic property-and that the effect of operating a uranium mine near it was not unanticipated-because it had informed the Forest Service of the religious and cultural significance of this site decades earlier. While that is true, the Tribe does not dispute that Red Butte was not a \"historic property\" eligible for inclusion on the National Register until 2010. As a result, the NHPA did not obligate the Forest Service to take the site into account when it conducted a full section 106 consultation in 1986. And while we agree that eligibility for inclusion on the National Register is not exactly a \"discovery,\" there is no other regulation requiring an agency to consider the impact on newly eligible sites after an undertaking is approved. In other words, by invoking \u00a7 800.13(b), the Forest Service may have given the Tribe more than it was entitled to demand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Tribe further argues that\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 800.13(b) applies, the Forest Service should have proceeded under \u00a7 800.13(b)(1), instead of \u00a7 800.13(b)(3). In sum, the agency must engage in a full section 106 consultation if it \"has not [yet] approved the undertaking or if construction on an approved undertaking has not [yet] commenced.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20800.13\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).

Having reviewed the record, we conclude that the Forest Service made a good-faith effort to ascertain steps it could take to resolve the possible adverse effects of mining on Red Butte. If that effort was not successful, it is because the Tribe insisted on a full consultation under section 106, which was not legally required, and a complete ban on mining around Red Butte, which the Forest Service lacks the authority to impose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

However, that does not conclusively establish that the Mining Act, and not the FLPMA, forms the \"legal basis\" of the Trust's fourth claim. Had Energy Fuels claimed rights of a different nature, the Forest Service would have consulted a different statutory scheme, but it still would have made a VER determination. Regardless of the statute consulted, a VER determination affects whether activities on federal land can be limited under the FLPMA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201703\">\n    43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j) (stating that the purpose of a withdrawal is to \"limit[ ] activities ... in order to maintain\n   other public values\").
