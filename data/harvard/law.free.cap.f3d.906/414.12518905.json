In denying the motion, the district court correctly highlighted that\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Trevino\n   </em>\n   , \"alone, are not extraordinary circumstances warranting relief from a final judgment in a habeas corpus action.\" (Citing\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

Yet, the district court recognized the issues presented in petitioner's motion were not frivolous and were raised in good faith. Further, the district court ruled that Zagorski made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202253\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2). The court held that reasonable minds could differ on the issues raised and thus granted a certificate of appealability on two issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [P]etitioner's motion raises a question about whether\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   applies in conjunction with\n   <em>\n    Edwards v.

He also raises a non-frivolous claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The court's disposition of both of those issues, and whether they might merit relief in combination with\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   , are reasonably debatable. Because an appeal from this order would not be in bad faith, the court also GRANTS the petitioner permission to appeal\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Petitioner filed a timely appeal on October 5, 2018. He then filed concurrent motions to stay the execution in the district court and in this court. Yesterday, the district court denied Zagorski's motion to stay his execution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Federal courts have the authority to stay an execution when a \"habeas corpus proceeding is ... pending appeal.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). We generally apply a four-factor test in deciding whether to grant a stay: \"1) whether there is a likelihood he will succeed on the merits of the appeal; 2) whether there is a likelihood he will suffer irreparable harm absent a stay;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   3) whether the stay will cause substantial harm to others; and 4) whether the injunction would serve the public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Workman v. Bell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734810\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/484/837/#p839\">\n    484 F.3d 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 839 (6th Cir. 2007). After balancing these competing factors, we hold that a stay is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In doing so, we conclude that this case presents exceptional circumstances warranting a stay. We acknowledge, as the district court did, that petitioner faces an uphill battle on the merits. Yet, balancing this factor with the others, petitioner's motion presents conditions rarely seen in the usual course of death penalty proceedings. Zagorski timely sought Rule 60(b) relief, which the district court recently denied after a lengthy stay of proceedings that began in 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In denying petitioner's motion for relief from judgment, the district court also granted Zagorski an appeal by right when it granted him a certificate of appealability.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Slack v. McDaniel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508758\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/473/\">\n    529 U.S. 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508758\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/473/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508758\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/473/\">\n    146 L.Ed.2d 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000) (discussing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202253\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ). Zagorski timely exercised that right by filing a notice of appeal in our court. If we do not grant a stay, we will necessarily be deciding or rendering moot his appeal, without affording Zagorski the opportunity to present his appeal to us in the first instance. Briefing on petitioner's appeal of right is incomplete and we have yet to decide the issues raised. At a minimum, due process requires that Zagorski be afforded an opportunity to present his appeal to us.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boddie v.

The majority balances four competing factors and determines that Zagorski's appeal warrants a stay. I come to the opposite conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As the majority acknowledges, Zagorski's appeal is virtually unwinnable. The district court's decision to grant a certificate of appealability, with its easier-to-meet standard, coincided with her thorough analysis in deciding to\n   <em>\n    deny\n   </em>\n   Zagorski's Rule 60(b) motion, and her later\n   <em>\n    denial\n   </em>\n   of the stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The district court granted a certificate of appealability because Zagorski raised a novel question of law in arguing that a combination of\n   <em>\n    Martinez v.

But our cases make clear that\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   did not change a criminal defendant's constitutional rights, but instead equitably adjusts his eligibility for federal statutory relief.\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Mays\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265540\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/691/#p698\">\n    879 F.3d 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 699 (6th Cir. 2018). These changes in decisional law are usually not, by themselves, extraordinary circumstances meriting Rule 60(b)(6) relief.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265540\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/691/#p698\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Henness v.

Additionally, Zagorski asks us to broadly apply an exception that the Supreme Court has repeatedly called especially narrow.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Davila v. Davis\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605155\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/2058/#p2065\">\n    137 S.Ct. 2058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2065,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605155\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/2058/#p2065\">\n    198 L.Ed.2d 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017),\n   <em>\n    Carruthers v.

Even if we credited this theory, the district court thoroughly evaluated the merits of each of Zagorski's underlying constitutional claims and found that none weighed in favor of granting relief under Rule 60(b)(6). Because of the underlying\n   equitable principles involved, we give especially broad deference to the district court's discretionary denial of Zagorski's motion. None of the arguments in Zagorski's appeal undercut this analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Zagorski will certainly suffer the most irreparable of harms absent a stay, but the Supreme Court has warned us to also account for \"the State's significant interest in enforcing its criminal judgments\" in our deliberations.\n   <em>\n    Nelson v.
