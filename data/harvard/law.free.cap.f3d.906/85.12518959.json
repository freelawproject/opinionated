Our answer is yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Trainer Custom Chemical, LLC (\"Trainer\") acquired a property known as the Stoney Creek Site (the \"Site\") for $20,000, after Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection (\"PADEP\") had already incurred over $818,000 in environmental cleanup costs at the Site. The cleanup costs continued to mount following Trainer's acquisition of the property, both because of pre-existing pollution and because buildings on the Site were demolished by one or both of Trainer's principals, Jeremy Hunter and James Halkias, which caused further contamination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   PADEP sued Trainer, Hunter, and Halkias for violations of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%209601\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 28,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Pennsylvania's Hazardous Sites Cleanup Act (\"HSCA\"), 35 Pa. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 6020.101-.1305, and sought to recover all of its response costs related to the Site, regardless of when those costs arose. At summary judgment, the District Court drew a temporal line, holding Trainer liable under both statutes for the response costs incurred after Trainer took ownership of the Site but not for the costs that arose before. Although the Court directed the parties to proceed to trial on damages, PADEP disagreed with the temporal distinction drawn by the Court and filed this interlocutory appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We conclude that a current owner of real property is liable under both CERCLA and HSCA for all response costs in an environmental cleanup, including costs incurred before the owner acquired the property. Accordingly, we will affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Site Before Trainer Acquired It\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Site is located in Trainer Borough, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. In 2007, it was owned by Stoney Creek Technologies (\"SCT\"), which primarily used it for making corrosion inhibitors, fuel additives, and oil additives. Buildings and equipment used in creating SCT's products were located on the Site, including a laboratory and a water treatment facility. SCT also kept various hazardous substances at the Site, including about three million gallons of flammable or combustible chemicals that posed a threat of release, and over seventeen million pounds of other chemical inventory, which included flammable, combustible, and corrosive chemicals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   PADEP investigated the environmental risk at the Site and determined in 2007 that \"there is a release or threat of release of hazardous substances or contaminants, which presents a substantial danger to human health or the environment[.]\" (App. at 34.) Accordingly, PADEP and the United States Environmental Protection Agency\n   (\"EPA\") initiated removal actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   SCT was in financial trouble and could not afford the expenses involved in the cleanup. One such expense was for the electricity to power pollution control and security equipment, including a vaporized nitrogen system. The nitrogen system was necessary to minimize the threat of fire posed by the flammable and combustible chemicals on the Site. Due to lack of payment, the power company was going to shut off the electricity to the Site, so PADEP assumed responsibility for paying the electrical bills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Trainer's Acquisition of the Site\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The same financial straits that had apparently led SCT to fall behind in paying for electricity also led it to become delinquent in paying real estate taxes. Consequently, the Tax Claim Bureau of Delaware County forced a sale of the Site. In what was evidently a coordinated effort, Hunter and Halkias purchased the property and put its title in Trainer's name. Hunter signed the purchase agreement, the recitals of which plainly stated that the Site had ongoing \"environmental issues ... [and] environmental remediation.\" (App. at 53.) Despite that warning, on October 4, 2012, Halkias tendered a cashier's check for $20,000 and a handwritten note indicating that the deed to the property should be made out to Trainer Custom Chemical LLC. The next day, Halkias and Hunter officially formed Trainer Custom Chemical LLC by filing a Certificate of Organization with the Pennsylvania Department of State. On October 9, 2012, the deed to the Site was executed and put in Trainer's name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Site After Trainer Acquired It\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The EPA and PADEP completed their removal actions at the Site on December 12, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   But that was not the end of the problems there. After Trainer acquired the Site, either Hunter or Halkias or both - they point the finger of blame at each other - demolished many of the Site's structures. Regardless of who was responsible, it is undisputed that metals and other salvageable materials reclaimed from the Site were sold for at least $875,000 to JK Myers Contracting, a business that Halkias had registered with the Pennsylvania Corporations Bureau in April 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In June 2014, PADEP received two reports assessing environmental concerns at the Site. One noted that \"[t]he [ ]EPA has acknowledged that hazards still exist at the Site[.]\" (App. at 61.) The report further said that, during a recent visit to the Site, PADEP \"observed active demolition activities being conducted on several structures throughout the Site[,]\" and \"[s]everal storage tanks were observed to be cut open and unknown contents were noted to be spilling onto the ground.\" (App. at 62.) The other report indicated that buildings on the Site had asbestos-containing materials\n   that needed to be removed before demolition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   PADEP sued Trainer, Halkias, and Hunter under CERCLA and HSCA to recover the costs incurred in cleaning up the Site. The complaint was in six counts: separate ones against each of the three defendants under CERCLA \u00a7 107(a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209607\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and, again, separate ones against each of them under HSCA \u00a7\u00a7 701 and 702, 35 Pa. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 6020.701, 6020.702.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Eventually, PADEP moved for summary judgment, arguing that the defendants should be jointly and severally liable for all of the environmental response costs. In total, those costs were $932,580.12, through November 2015. The most significant charges were payments for electricity amounting to $818,730.50 through June 2009, before Trainer acquired the Site. PADEP also bore other response costs after Trainer took ownership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The District Court granted summary judgment in part and denied it in part. The Court noted that PADEP's claims against Halkias and Hunter were based on a theory of piercing Trainer's corporate veil, so the initial question it sought to answer, and the question before us in this interlocutory appeal, is whether Trainer was liable for violations of CERCLA and HSCA. With respect to CERCLA liability, \"the Court [held] [Trainer] liable for any response costs incurred after [Trainer] took ownership of the Site, but not for costs incurred beforehand.\" (App. at 99-100.) As to CERCLA damages, it denied summary judgment because there was a genuine dispute of material fact concerning the amount of damages for which Trainer was liable. The Court reached the same conclusions with respect to HSCA liability and damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   PADEP disagreed with the District Court's decision to grant summary judgment only in part. It sought an order certifying for interlocutory appeal the issue of whether federal and Pennsylvania law \"make an owner liable for response actions and response costs attributable to an identified release of hazardous substances which continues at the time of that person's ownership, regardless of when such actions or response costs were taken or incurred.\" (App. at 114-15.) The District Court granted certification, and PADEP then petitioned us for permission to appeal, which we gave pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Like CERCLA, HSCA defines classes of persons who are legally liable for a release or threatened release of hazardous substances, and the owner of a contaminated site is one such person. 35 Pa. Stat. \u00a7 6020.701(a). A current owner is strictly liable for environmental response costs, including those incurred by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9415744,9409661\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/294/482/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6020.702(a).

Taking that concession as our starting point, our task is to decide whether the meaning of \"all costs\" in \u00a7 107(a) includes response costs incurred before Trainer acquired the Site. We conclude that, given the structure and text of CERCLA, a current owner under \u00a7 107(a)(1) is indeed liable for all response costs, whether incurred before or after acquiring the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"Statutory interpretation, as we always say, begins with the text.\"\n   <em>\n    Rotkiske v.

The term \"all costs\" means just that; it does not distinguish between costs that were incurred before ownership and those incurred afterwards. Because there is no such distinction, there is no temporal limitation on the liability for costs.

One was a corporation that had owned the property while all cleanup costs were incurred, and the other was the state's land commission that owned the property at the time the lawsuit was filed but not at any time when costs had been incurred.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703570\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/910/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703570\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/910/\">\n     at 912\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The court held that an owner of a property at the time cleanup costs are incurred cannot avoid liability for such costs by selling the property prior to the filing or initiation of a response action by the government and, therefore, that the party who owned the property at issue at the time the cleanup costs were incurred was a responsible party.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703570\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/910/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703570\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/910/\">\n     at 911, 916\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Hearthside\n    </em>\n    does not stand for the proposition that it is permissible to temporally partition \u00a7 107(a)(1) liability with respect to cleanup costs. Here, because Trainer \"[did] not dispute that [it], as the owner and operator of the Site, [was] a responsible party under CERCLA[,]\" (App. at 94);\n    <em>\n     see supra\n    </em>\n    Section III, there was no need to turn to\n    <em>\n     Hearthside\n    </em>\n    to determine again whether Trainer was a current owner of the Site.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Specifically, as under CERCLA, there is no ambiguity under HSCA that Trainer is liable for all response costs, including those incurred prior to its ownership. First, Trainer is a \"responsible person\" because it \"own[ed] or operate[d] the site\" (1) \"when a hazardous substance [wa]s placed or [came] to be located in or on the site,\" \u00a7 6020.701(a)(1)(i), or (2) \"during the time of the release or threatened release,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 60020.701(a)(1)(iii). There were hazardous substances located on the site at the time Trainer took ownership and there has been a release or threatened release since that time. Second, a responsible person is \"strictly liable for response costs and damages which result from the release or threatened release of hazardous substances,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 6020.702(a), which includes \"[r]easonable and necessary or appropriate costs of remedial response incurred by the United States [or] the Commonwealth.\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 6020.702(a)(2). Here, PADEP has incurred \"[r]easonable and necessary or appropriate costs of remedial response,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 6020.702(a)(2), resulting from the release or threatened release. Third, exceptions to responsible party status do not apply because at least one of the defendants knew or had reason to know \"a hazardous substance which is the subject of the release or threatened release was disposed of on, in, or at the site.\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 6020.701(b)(vi)(A).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
