Because Hancock has not presented new evidence of actual innocence under\n   <em>\n    Moore v. Quarterman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066248\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/534/454/\">\n    534 F.3d 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2008), he has not made the showing necessary for this court to consider his claims despite the expired limitations period. Therefore, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2002, a Texas jury convicted Hancock of murder, and he was sentenced to ninety-nine years' imprisonment. On direct appeal, in 2004, the state court of appeals affirmed, and Hancock did not seek discretionary review with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (\"TCCA\"). In 2014, Hancock filed a state postconviction application, asserting that he suffered a due process violation based on a biased in-court identification procedure, that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance, and that the state presented false evidence. The TCCA denied relief without written order in 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Hancock filed a federal habeas corpus petition under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , raising the same claims (of ineffective assistance of counsel and an impermissibly suggestive in-court identification process) that he had presented in the state court. That petition was untimely. Hancock had one year from the date his state court judgment became final, in 2004, to file a federal habeas petition.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Hancock acknowledged that his petition was untimely but maintained that the court could nevertheless exercise jurisdiction under the \"actual innocence\" gateway of\n   <em>\n    Schlup v. Delo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/\">\n    513 U.S. 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/\">\n    130 L.Ed.2d 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995), and\n   <em>\n    McQuiggin v.

Hancock attached to his habeas petition affidavits obtained by law enforcement, close to the date of the murder, from four state witnesses that, he alleges, contradict their trial testimony regarding the shooter's physical description.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The district court dismissed Hancock's petition as untimely under \u00a7 2244(d)(1), determining that he had not proffered new evidence or demonstrated actual innocence. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066248\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/534/454/\">\n    534 F.3d at 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the court concluded that Hancock had not \"establish[ed] that the affidavits were unavailable to trial counsel at the time of trial,\" a prerequisite to constitute new evidence. Alternatively, the court determined that even if the affidavits constituted new evidence, Hancock had failed to establish that \"no reasonable juror would have found [him] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,\"\n   <em>\n    Schlup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/\">\n    513 U.S. at 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because the jury was already presented with differing, impeached descriptions of the shooter. The district court therefore denied Hancock a certificate of appealability (\"COA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Hancock timely appealed, and this court granted a COA on four issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1. Whether \"new\" evidence for the purpose of the actual-innocence gateway of\n   <em>\n    Perkins\n   </em>\n   must be newly discovered, previously unavailable evidence or if, instead, it includes reliable evidence that was available but not presented at trial,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright v.

Whether, if the record is sufficient, the district court was correct in its determination that a reasonable juror still could have found Hancock guilty in light of the affidavits,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697052\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/383/\">\n    569 U.S. at 386-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697052\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/383/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   4.

Nor does this case require us to do so, because\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   squarely answers that the four affidavits Hancock presents do not constitute \"new\" evidence under\n   <em>\n    Schlup\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Evidence does not qualify as \"new\" under the\n   <em>\n    Schlup\n   </em>\n   actual-innocence standard if \"it was always within the reach of [petitioner's] personal knowledge or reasonable investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066248\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/534/454/\">\n    534 F.3d at 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, though we have not decided what affirmatively constitutes \"new\" evidence, we have explained what does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Hancock supported his claim of actual innocence with affidavits, obtained close to the date of the murder, from four state witnesses who testified at trial. The district court determined that Hancock did not establish that the affidavits were unavailable to counsel at the time of trial, and therefore the court held that Hancock had offered no \"new\" evidence. Hancock did not contend in the district court, and does not contend in this appeal, that the affidavits were unavailable to him or trial counsel at or before trial.\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   thus prohibits Hancock from supporting his actual-innocence gateway claim with the proffered affidavits as \"new\" evidence, so he is unable to overcome \u00a7 2244(d)(1) 's limitations bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Accordingly, the district court correctly interpreted and applied\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   .

The disagreement centers on whether \"new reliable evidence\" for the purpose of the\n    <em>\n     Schlup\n    </em>\n    actual innocence gateway must be newly discovered, previously unavailable evidence, or, instead, evidence that was available but not presented at trial.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Osborne v.
