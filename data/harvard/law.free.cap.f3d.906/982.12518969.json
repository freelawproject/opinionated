We possess jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201295\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) (2012). Because the Court of Federal Claims did not apply the proper legal standard and we determine the Army's corrective action was reasonable under that standard, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I. The Solicitation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In May 2016, the Army solicited proposals for indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts for \"commercial-off-the-shelf\" computer hardware such as desktop computers, tablet computers, and printers under Solicitation No. W52P1J-15-R-0122 (\"the Solicitation\"). J.A. 1341;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   J.A. 1339-87. The total estimated contract value was $5 billion over a ten-year period. J.A. 1341. While the Army anticipated \"mak[ing] at least eight [contract] awards, with up to five reserved for small business[es],\" J.A. 1341, the Solicitation left open the possibility that \"the [Army] ... may make as many, or as few, awards as deemed appropriate,\" J.A. 1384.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Solicitation stated that the competition would be conducted in accordance with the procedures outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulations (\"FAR\") Part 15, \"Contracting by Negotiation,\" and the Army would therefore award contracts to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offerors. J.A. 1384;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FAR 15.101-2(a) (2015) (explaining that the \"lowest price technically acceptable source selection process is appropriate when best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price\"). The Solicitation further stated offerors would be evaluated based on \"an integrated assessment of three evaluation factors\" of \"Technical Approach, Past Performance, and Price,\" and any\n   relevant attendant sub-factors. J.A. 1385. To be considered for an award, the Solicitation required offerors to achieve an \" 'Acceptable' [rating] ... for the Technical Approach and its two sub-factors and the Past Performance [f]actor.\" J.A. 1385. For the two Technical Approach sub-factors, offerors were required to complete an attached \"Equipment Submission Form\" and \"Business Process Form\" in Microsoft Excel. J.A. 1381-82;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g\n   </em>\n   ., J.A. 1388-421 (Equipment Submission Form spreadsheet template), 1422-25 (Business Process Form spreadsheet template). For the Equipment Submission Form, offerors were instructed to \"complete all cell entries\" and \"identify the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)[ ] model and salient characteristics of each proposed item,\" and were advised that \"[a]n incomplete or blank entry will indicate that the proposed item does NOT meet minimum requirements.\" J.A. 1382.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   To evaluate the offerors' bids, the Army's evaluation team consisted of a Source Selection Authority (\"SSA\"), a Source Selection Evaluation Board (\"SSEB\"), and a Procuring Contracting Officer (\"CO\"). J.A. 1303. The SSEB would \"review and evaluat[e] ... proposals against the [S]olicitation requirements and the approved evaluation criteria,\" J.A. 1307, and document their evaluation results in a Source Section Decision Document report, J.A. 5573. Based upon that report, the SSA would either \"[m]ake a determination to award without discussions or enter into discussions\" and make \"the final source selection decision ... before contracts [were] awarded or announced.\" J.A. 1304.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Army reserved the right \"to conduct discussions and to permit [o]fferors to revise proposals if determined necessary by the [CO].\" J.A. 1379;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   J.A. 1468 (stating, in an amendment to the Solicitation, \"the [Army] intends to award without conducting discussions\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   FAR 15.306(d) (defining discussions as exchanges \"undertaken with the intent of allowing the offeror to revise its proposal\"). The Solicitation further explained that \"[i]f discussions are opened, all proposals, to include small business proposals previously removed for unacceptability[,] ... will be included. After discussions are closed and final proposal revision[s] are received, the [Army] will separate proposals, re-list[,] and evaluate\" in accordance with the procedures for the competition categories, i.e., full and open competition category, and reserved small business category. J.A. 1384.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II. Source Selection and Award\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Army received fifty-eight proposals, with fifty-two from small businesses. J.A. 5574. Three proposals were rejected as non-responsive, and of the fifty-five proposals that were evaluated, nine were deemed acceptable for the Technical Approach and Past Performance evaluation factors,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   J.A. 5574;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   J.A. 5575-77 (detailing each party's rating for each evaluation factor), with all nine final prices found to be fair and reasonable,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   J.A. 5579-80. The SSEB said it did \"not have a meaningful reason to open discussions\" with offerors because doing so \"would significantly delay award.\" J.A. 5534. In February 2017, the Army awarded nine contracts: five contracts under the small business category, including to Blue Tech and Red River, and four under the full and open competition category, including to Dell. J.A. 5573, 5580;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   J.A. 5579 (identifying which awardees relate to each category).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   III. Post-Award Protests and the Army's Corrective Action\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following the award decision, HPI, CDW, and nineteen other unsuccessful offerors\n   filed protests at the U.S. Government Accountability Office (\"GAO\").\n   <em>\n    See, e.g\n   </em>\n   ., J.A. 6296-305 (CDW's GAO protest), 6346-427 (HPI's GAO protest). An Army memorandum for record (\"MFR\"), inter alia, summarizes how the \"primary protest allegations\" protested the Army's evaluations as unreasonable because the proposal deficiencies the Army considered disqualifying were minor or \"clerical errors and misunderstandings\" resulting from Solicitation ambiguities that could have been resolved through clarifications as defined in FAR 15.306(a)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   J.A. 7019;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 6033, 6297. Several protests also argued that the Army should have engaged in discussions with offerors to resolve these spreadsheet-related misunderstandings, as required by Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement (\"DFARS\") 215.306(c),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and to resolve claimed misunderstandings relating to the completion of the Excel spreadsheets.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g\n   </em>\n   ., J.A. 6367-69;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   DFARS 215.306(c)(1) (\"For acquisitions with an estimated value of $100 million or more, contracting officers\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   conduct discussions.\" (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In response to the GAO protest, the Army conducted an internal review,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   J.A. 7018, and issued its Notice of Corrective Action, informing GAO that it had decided \"that it would be in the Army's best interest to take corrective action to resolve\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   the protests,\" J.A. 7009 (emphasis added). The Army stated that such corrective action would \"consist of the following: (1) opening discussions with all of the remaining offerors, including those who filed protests, (2) requesting final revised proposals, and (3) issuing a new award decision.\" J.A. 7009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Army also released its MFR documenting its rationale for proposing corrective action in light of the GAO protests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 7018-21 (MFR). First, the CO explained how the Army's counsel found that because the procurement was valued in excess of $100 million, the Army was likely required to conduct discussions with offerors pursuant to DFARS 215.306(c)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 7018-19 (explaining that the SSEB's reasoning of award delay did not constitute a reasonable basis for forgoing discussions);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   J.A. 5534 (providing the SSEB's reasoning). Second, counsel found that there was \"ambiguity in the requirements or the [Army's] instructions [on] how to fill out the [Equipment Submission Form and Business Process Form Microsoft Excel] spreadsheet[s],\" which \"could have easily and quickly been resolved\" before award and could have been addressed in discussions. J.A. 7020;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   J.A. 7020 (stating many of the \"Unacceptable\" ratings were \"merely compliance issues with filling out the form rather than a deficiency in the item proposed\"). The Army summarized two representative examples of the ambiguities: (1) the presence of a thick, black line \"hard-line\" in the Equipment Submission Form spreadsheet between the hard-drive and solid-state drive requirements; and (2) the conflicting instructions that \"an upgrade [to a base model]\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be an increase in capability\" and \"that selection of an item in a drop-down [menu] is acceptable when there are\n   items in the drop-down that are not upgrades to a base model.\" J.A. 7020;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 386 (depicting the hardline). Ultimately, Army's counsel recommended that \"[d]ue to the significant litigation risk, the ambiguities in the spreadsheet ..., and a matter of policy to do what is right, ... [the Army] take limited corrective action to resolve the issues with Offerors' Technical Proposals.\" J.A. 7021.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As a result of the Army's proposed corrective action, the GAO dismissed the unsuccessful offerors' protests as moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 7022-23. The Army subsequently notified offerors that \"[d]iscussions with all offerors in the competitive range are now open\" and invited offerors to present their \"best and final proposal,\" J.A. 7047 (letter to originally successful offeror), and the Army advised originally unsuccessful offerors to \"address the deficiencies in [their] proposal[s],\" J.A. 7076, and to revise their final prices \"to their best and final prices,\" J.A. 7077. In addition, \"to remedy [any] potential competitive [dis]advantage\" to offerors whose prices were disclosed by the original award notice, the Army sent all offerors a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet of the final proposed prices, with offerors not identified. J.A. 7378;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   J.A. 7379-80 (listing prices).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   IV. The Relevant Proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Two of the nine initial awardees, specifically Dell and Blue Tech, sued the Government in the Court of Federal Claims, seeking to enjoin the Army's corrective action,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   J.A. 290, and five other initial awardees, including Red River, joined as intervenors,\n   <em>\n    Dell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12304433\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/133/92/#p107\">\n    133 Fed.Cl. at 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The cases were consolidated.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

The defects in\n   <em>\n    Amazon Web\n   </em>\n   were associated with only the agency's evaluation process,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4135865\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/113/102/#p115\">\n    113 Fed.Cl. at 109, 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and not with the agency's original solicitation and proposals, as is the case here. Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    Amazon Web\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Federal Claims found no rational basis based upon the agency's lack of \"a narrowly tailored\" corrective action that sought to amend the Solicitation despite no alleged defects with the solicitation or proposals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4135865\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/113/102/#p115\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4135865\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/113/102/#p115\">\n    at 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, the Appellees cite no precedent, nor do we find any, to support the imposition of a pre- and post-award dichotomy in our reasonableness analysis for corrective action.

Here, the relevant timeline of events lends itself to a unique procedural posture. After the Army notified all offerors of the award, it sent debriefing letters in February 2017 to the unsuccessful offerors \"in accordance with FAR 15.506.\" J.A. 5949;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 5948-49 (Debriefing Letter to HPI). FAR 15.506 sets forth the required deadlines for \"[p]ost[-]award debriefing of offerors\" and provides that upon written request by any offeror \"within 3 days after the date on which that offeror has received notification of contract award,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FAR 15.506(a)(1), an agency must, within five days,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FAR 15.506(a)(2), debrief said offerors as to, inter alia, the prices of the \"\n   <em>\n    successful\n   </em>\n   offeror,\" FAR 15.506(d)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FAR 15.506(d) (outlining the \"minimum\" required post-award debriefing information). However, in this case, a month later and after protests were filed at the GAO, as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Background Section III, the Army conceded that procurement defects occurred, and it decided to proceed with its corrective action to open discussions following GAO approval,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   J.A. 7021 (MFR dated March 22, 2017). Then, on March 27, 2017, during the course of discussions and \"[a]s part of the ... corrective action, the [Army] ... decided to release all offerors' total proposed prices in an effort to remedy the potential competitive advantage held by the offerors in the competition whose prices were not disclosed.\" J.A. 7378;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   J.A. 7379-80 (listing total bid prices for all fifty-five offerors whose bids were deemed responsive).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We find no binding authority preventing, on the facts of this case, the release of the pricing information of all offerors. Moreover, we find that the Government provides a reasonable explanation for its actions. Under these circumstances, the Government concluded it would, upon rebidding, level the playing field for those successful offerors who did not propose the lowest price and now deserve a chance to revise their proposals to fairly compete during the rebidding process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. at 8:54-9:51 (Q: \"It seems that the Army ... decided in fairness that since [offerors] now have a target to shoot at-namely, they now know what the awardee listed for everything, so they know how to come in under it-[did] it seem[ ] only fair ... to list everyone else's [prices]?\" A: \"Yes, your Honor .... In this case, ... the initial awardees, they were not the lowest priced offerors. So, if the offerors who were not initially technically acceptable, they get a chance to revise their proposals, the initial awardees may likely be pushed out of the competition.\" Q: \"When they did release all of the numbers that each person gave in the proposal, did they strip [the] name[s] of the proposer?\" A: \"That's right your Honor.\"). We find this to be reasonable action in light of a defective procurement, which the parties concede was defective.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   n.10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. at 29:57-30:07 (conceding, by Dell's counsel, that \"[w]e won the procurement submitting a technically acceptable offer, ... [but] to a defective procurement\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The FAR explains that, when conducting discussions, \"[a]t a minimum, the [CO]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   must ... indicate to, or discuss with, each offeror still being considered for award, [inter alia,] deficiencies\" in the offeror's proposal \"to which the offeror has not yet had an opportunity to respond.\" FAR 15.306(d)(3). The Army only proposes to allow an offeror to \"address deficiencies in [their] proposal\" and \"make revisions to correct the deficiencies listed\" by the Army. J.A. 7097 (noting in letter opening discussions with offeror that \"[i]f you make changes to areas of your technical proposal that have already been found acceptable, you are at risk of being found technically unacceptable\"). Given these reasonable limitations, the corrective action has a rational basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Nevertheless, the Appellees maintain that clarifications are the only reasonable corrective action.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g\n   </em>\n   ., Dell's Br. 29, 31. However, requests for clarifications are \"limited exchanges,\" designed to \"clarify certain aspects of proposals\" or \"resolve minor or clerical errors\" in the offerors' proposals.

Thus, the Army rationally chose discussions, rather than clarifications, for all offerors as the appropriate corrective action to address these material errors, especially due to the Solicitation's requirement to include,\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   the Army decide to open discussions, \"all proposals, to include small business proposals previously removed for unacceptability.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 1384;\n   <em>\n    Alfa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"615062,1720023\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/175/1365/\">\n    175 F.3d at 1368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that an \"agency is strictly bound by [the] terms\" of the standards set out in the\n   <em>\n    solicitation\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Finally, Appellees argue that the Army's failure to consider other \"[m]ore [l]imited\" corrective actions is arbitrary and capricious.
