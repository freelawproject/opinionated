Specifically, Real Foods argues that Frito-Lay's expert report \"did not consider the meaning ... of [the proposed\n   marks]\n   <em>\n    as a whole\n   </em>\n   \" and only analyzed \"crackers, chips, and other snack foods[, which are] different from popped corn and rice cakes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197161\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/637/1344/#p1349\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).

Although Real Foods now attempts to undermine the relevance of this evidence by characterizing its proposed marks as limited to \"popped corn and rice cakes,\" Appellant's Br. 32, each of Real Foods' applications identifies the goods as \"crispbread slices,\" which are kinds of crackers, as discussed below,\n   <em>\n    see infra\n   </em>\n   Section III;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   J.A. 164 (citing evidence, by a USPTO examiner, that indicates corn cakes are a type of crispbread).

Real Foods' sales and advertising figures weigh against a finding of acquired distinctiveness. The record indicates that Real Foods has spent a relatively small amount on advertising as compared to other expenditures, J.A. 5469 (providing annual U.S. advertising figures relative to other expenditures);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   J.A. 5369 (acknowledging, by Real Foods' marketing manager, that Real Foods has a small advertising budget), and that its overall sales figures are not high, J.A. 5103 (discussing annual sales in the context of market needs);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   J.A. 1191 (showing a recent\n   <em>\n    decrease\n   </em>\n   in overall sales numbers). Additionally, research conducted by a third party on behalf of Real Foods demonstrates that consumers have low brand loyalty to and low preference for Real Foods' corn and rice cakes, as compared to its competitors'.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 5137 (depicting a graph comparing consumer brand awareness for several companies producing similar products).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Moreover, Frito-Lay's expert survey established that only around ten percent of respondents associated CORN THINS with a particular company,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   J.A. 4405 (stating \"a net of 10.3% of respondents stated that they associated CORN THINS with only one company\" and, when the pool of respondents was limited to \"only purchasers and prospective purchasers of crispbreads/crispbread slices,\" that number increased to only \"10.9% of the respondents\"), and that about half of those respondents identified a company\n   <em>\n    other than\n   </em>\n   Real Foods,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   J.A. 4412 (\"42 of the 89 subjects who indicated 'only one company' ... specified the name of a company other than Real Foods ....\").
