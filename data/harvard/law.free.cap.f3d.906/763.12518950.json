In making the purchases, she relied on the information contained on the face of the label that the product contained \"0g Trans Fat per serving.\" In August 2015, she discovered that, contrary to the claim on the label, KBCs \"contained artificial trans fat, and caused heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and death.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In October 2015, Hawkins brought a putative class action against Kroger seeking to represent a class of consumers who were misled by the label (\"the labeling claims\") and had used the dangerous product (\"the use claims\").

It interpreted the complaint as alleging that she did not read the \"0g Trans Fat per serving\" product label until August 2015, fifteen years after she began purchasing the product. However, the paragraph cited by the district court to support its conclusion reads, \"Plaintiff first discovered Defendant's\n   <em>\n    unlawful acts\n   </em>\n   described herein in August 2015, when\n   <em>\n    she learned that Kroger Bread Crumbs contained artificial trans fat\n   </em>\n   ....\" Compl. \u00b6 74 (emphases added). This paragraph does not allege that she first read the label in August 2015; it alleges she first discovered the label was misleading on that date. The district court did not address the three paragraphs where Hawkins concretely alleged that she relied on the label.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Because Hawkins adequately alleged that she relied on the label's misrepresentations and would not have purchased the product without those misrepresentations, she has adequately alleged standing for her labeling claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Second, there are rules governing \"nutrient content claims\" made elsewhere on the product. These are claims that \"expressly or implicitly characterize[ ] the level of a nutrient,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.13\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ; they are further subdivided between general and specific rules,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.13\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 101.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (general rules), 101.62 (specific rules regarding fat).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Critically, the rules that govern claims made within the Nutrition Facts Panel and the rules that govern nutrition content claims elsewhere on the label are different: \"Information that is required or permitted by \u00a7 101.9... and that appears as part of the nutrition label, is not a nutrient content claim .... If such information is declared elsewhere on the label ... it is a nutrient content claim and is subject to the requirements for [such] claims.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.13\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Without \u00a7 101.13(c), this would be a simple case.

Therefore, the claim \"0g Trans Fat per serving\" was not only permitted within the panel, but mandated. However, since, under \u00a7 101.13(c), a statement as to the amount of a nutrient mandated inside the Nutrition Facts Panel is not necessarily permitted by the FDCA elsewhere on the packaging, further analysis is required to determine if the FDCA allows the same \"0g Trans Fat per serving\" claim elsewhere on the label.
