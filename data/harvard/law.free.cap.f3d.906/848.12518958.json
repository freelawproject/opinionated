Sellers argues that he was targeted based on his race, and presents evidence that an overwhelming majority of the defendants targeted by law enforcement in similar investigations are African-Americans or Hispanics. To succeed on his selective enforcement claim, Sellers must show that the enforcement had a discriminatory effect\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. He is unlikely to meet this demanding standard without information that only the government has. Sellers can obtain this information through discovery if he makes a threshold showing. We must decide what that showing is. We hold that in these stash house reverse-sting cases, claims of selective enforcement are governed by a less rigorous standard than that applied to claims of selective prosecution under\n   <em>\n    United States v.

These operations tend to follow a common format:\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   An undercover agent poses as a disgruntled drug courier who is looking for help robbing the house where his employer is stashing (and guarding) a large quantity of drugs. The agent describes the stash house to individuals who have been targeted for the operation. Usually, the targets of stash house reverse-sting operations are identified using confidential informants. Informants are supposed to identify targets that have committed stash house robberies before or are capable of doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The agent conducts a series of meetings with the targets and presents them with the opportunity to rob the stash house, and they devise a plan to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no stash house to rob, and there are no drugs-this is a 'reverse-sting,' after all. But at the last meet-up, just before they are set to leave and carry out the plan, the targets are arrested for conspiracy to commit the robbery and associated crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The details of the specific stash house reverse-sting operation here, for the most part, are irrelevant to Sellers's selective enforcement claim, and so we state them only in brief. In March 2012, a confidential informant staying at a hotel in a predominantly black and Hispanic area of Los Angeles targeted one of Sellers's co-defendants for a stash house reverse-sting operation, ostensibly because the informant believed that the co-defendant was involved in selling drugs. The co-defendant, who is black, was put in touch with Agent Carr, and the stash house reverse-sting was underway. On July 9, 2012, Sellers attended a planning meeting for the robbery with the co-defendant, Agent Carr, and others. Eventually, the stash house robbery was set for July 16, and, after one final meeting confirming the plan, the robbery crew (all of whom are black) was arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Sellers and his co-defendants were indicted for conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine, conspiracy to commit robbery, and possession of a firearm in furtherance of these crimes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sellers moved to dismiss the indictment for outrageous government misconduct\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and sought discovery on a claim of selective enforcement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sellers presented data collected by an attorney in the Central District of California showing that of 51 defendants indicted in stash house reverse-sting operations between 2007 and 2013, at least 39 were black or Hispanic.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, Agent Carr testified that more than 55 of the approximately 60 individuals who have been indicted in his stash house reverse-sting operations are people of color. Relying on the standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   for obtaining discovery on selective prosecution claims, the district court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Sellers was convicted by a jury and sentenced to 96 months' imprisonment.

Material Differences Between Selective Prosecution and Selective Enforcement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Selective prosecution is not selective enforcement-especially not in the\n   stash house reverse-sting context.

Second, the nature of reverse-sting operations means that no evidence of similarly situated individuals who were not targeted exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    1.

Contrary to\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   's requirements for selective prosecution claims, a defendant need not proffer evidence that similarly-situated individuals of a different race were not investigated or arrested to receive discovery on his selective enforcement claim in a stash house reverse-sting operation case. While a defendant must have\n   <em>\n    something\n   </em>\n   more than mere speculation to be entitled to discovery, what that\n   <em>\n    something\n   </em>\n   looks like will vary from case to case. The district court should use its discretion-as it does for all discovery matters-to allow limited or broad discovery based on the reliability and strength of the defendant's showing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Having set forth the applicable standard, we turn to Sellers's threshold showing in this case. Sellers argues that the evidence he presented regarding the demographics of those indicted based on stash house reverse-sting operations entitles him to discovery on his selective enforcement claim. Because the district court applied an incorrect legal standard, we follow our normal practice of remanding to the district court to determine in the first instance whether Sellers has met the standard we outline today.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kirkpatrick v. Chappell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266875\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/1047/#p1058\">\n    872 F.3d 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1058 (9th Cir. 2017) (\"When a district court applies the wrong legal standard ..., we ordinarily remand the case so that it may apply the correct one in the first instance.\"). It may be that Sellers does not meet even a lower standard. Or it may be that he meets the standard but is entitled to no more discovery than he already received in connection with his entrapment defense. Or Sellers may be entitled to ask the government to be more forthcoming about its practices with regard to stash house reverse-sting operations. We leave that to the district court to decide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The dissent, arguing that Sellers isn't entitled to discovery under any standard, purports to apply \"some lesser level of proof\" for a claim of selective enforcement, Dissent at 28, but then applies exactly the standard articulated in\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   for a claim of selective prosecution.

A normal neighborhood, as the agent in this case explained, is a middle-class neighborhood without security bars on the doors and windows-in other words, safe and relatively affluent. Stash houses are often placed in such neighborhoods to avoid drawing the suspicion of law enforcement, and the risk of a stash house robbery endangers any \"innocent family\" living nearby.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Keeping neighborhoods safe from violent crime is laudable, but the benefits and burdens of stash house stings fall along racial lines.

This consequence naturally flows from operations conducted almost exclusively in minority neighborhoods. Here, for example, the agent acknowledged that he conducted stings in an area of Los Angeles that he considered to be \"predominantly African American and Hispanic\" rather than whiter and wealthier neighborhoods. As a result, in the agent's cases that led to prosecutions, fewer than five of the roughly sixty defendants were white. \"[A]ctions having foreseeable and anticipated disparate impact are relevant evidence to prove the ultimate fact, forbidden purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Columbus Bd. of Ed. v.

(2) Raw statistics, without comparative numbers, sufficed to demonstrate a \"colorable basis.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Against that backdrop, I read the Supreme Court's decision to follow the same two-part structure.

The Court summarized its evidentiary holding as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   In this case we consider what evidence constitutes \"some evidence tending to show the existence\" of the discriminatory effect element. The Court of Appeals held that a defendant may establish a colorable basis for discriminatory effect without evidence that the Government has failed to prosecute others who are similarly situated to the defendant. We think it was mistaken in this view. The vast majority of the Courts of Appeals require the defendant to produce some evidence that similarly situated defendants of other races could have been prosecuted, but were not, and this requirement is consistent with our equal protection case law. As the three-judge panel explained, \" '[s]elective prosecution' implies that a selection has taken place.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   The Court of Appeals reached its decision in part because it started \"with the presumption that people of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   races commit\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   types of crimes-not with the premise that any type of crime is the exclusive province of any particular racial or ethnic group.\" It cited no authority for this proposition, which seems contradicted by the most recent statistics of the United States Sentencing Commission. ...

One rationale for that rigorous standard is the presumption that prosecutors perform their duties properly.

The first sets a standard for how persuasive a litigant's showing must be to justify discovery. The second rejects, categorically, the relevance of raw statistics. Ratcheting the standard up or down has no bearing on the separate, second holding, which rests not on the nature of\n   <em>\n    prosecutors\n   </em>\n   , as the majority opinion avers, pp. 10, 15-16, but on the nature of\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   that the Court deemed irrelevant. And it is entirely clear from the Court's discussion that the second, evidentiary point (including the requirement to produce comparative information) applies to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   equal protection claims.\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745202\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/456/\">\n    517 U.S. at 465-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745202\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/456/\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Finally, the majority writes that, even if my dissenting opinion is correct in concluding\n   that Defendant presented no evidence of discriminatory effect, \"evidence of discriminatory intent may be enough to warrant discovery.\" Maj. op. at 856.
