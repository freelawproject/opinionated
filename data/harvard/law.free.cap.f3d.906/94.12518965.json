The Navy removed the cases to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, which concluded that the claims fell within the ambit of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\" or \"the Act\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%209601\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 9675, and were challenges under that Act to ongoing cleanup efforts at the facilities. Based on that, the Court further decided that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the cases and dismissed them. The Giovannis and Palmers now appeal those orders of dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We will affirm in part. In our view, the claim for a health assessment or health effects study is barred, as the District Court said, because it challenges ongoing cleanup efforts. But we will vacate and remand in part because we conclude that the medical monitoring claim is not a challenge under CERCLA and that it is not barred by sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND FACTS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Navy owns a number of properties in Pennsylvania, including the Willow Grove Naval Air and Air Reserve Station in Horsham Township and the Naval Air Development Center in Warminster Township (collectively, \"the Naval Facilities\"). Because of the Navy's activities, both facilities are contaminated with hazardous substances. Among the contaminants are perfluorinated compounds (\"PFCs\"), including perfluorooctanoic acid (\"PFOA\") and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (\"PFOS\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Studies have identified the toxic effects that PFCs have on people, including increased risk of kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, ulcerative colitis, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and high cholesterol. And the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") has specifically warned that drinking water containing PFOA and PFOS above certain thresholds poses health risks. It issued a non-binding provisional health advisory recommending a maximum combined PFOA/PFOS concentration in public drinking water of 70 parts per trillion (0.07 \u00b5g/L).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Groundwater sampling at both the Naval Facilities revealed that the PFOA and the PFOS levels exceeded the health advisory levels. Those facilities, being in need of further investigation to determine the nature and extent of the public health and environmental risks associated with chemical contamination, have been added to the National Priorities List (\"NPL\"), which is also sometimes called the Superfund List.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Navy has begun environmental cleanup efforts, and the parties do not dispute that those efforts are ongoing in both places.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Kristen Giovanni, along with her husband Charles Giovanni, her son Anthony Giovanni, and two other minor children V.G. and D.G., lives across the street from the Willow Grove facility. The water from their private well had a combined PFOA/PFOS level of 2.88 \u00b5g/L, which exceeds the concentration exposure threshold recommended by the EPA. The Navy provided the Giovannis with bottled water for several months before it connected them to the Warrington Township public water supply. But even that public water supply is contaminated with PFCs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Dorothy Palmer, along with her son George Palmer, has lived less than one mile from the Warminster facility since 1981. For years, they used a private well on their property, until they learned about the PFOA and PFOS contamination in the groundwater. The water from their private well had a combined PFOA/PFOS level of 0.62 \u00b5g/L, which exceeds the combined exposure threshold recommended by the EPA. The Navy provided the Palmers with bottled water until it connected them to the Warminster Municipal Authority's public water supply. Subsequent testing of that supply has revealed PFC contamination there too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Giovannis filed a complaint against the Navy in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas, and the Palmers did the same in the Bucks County Court of Common Pleas. Both complaints alleged harm from the contaminated public and private water sources for residents around the Naval Facilities due to the Navy's allegedly improper disposal of hazardous substances. Each complaint included a single state law claim under HSCA seeking, among other things, the costs of medical monitoring and an order compelling the Navy to conduct a health assessment or health effects study that would include blood testing for themselves, and \"others exposed to the contaminants and hazardous substances released from the Warminster and Willow Grove [f]acilities[.]\" (Palmer Appendix (\"P.A.\") at 16.) They also alleged that the Navy waived its sovereign immunity pursuant to \u00a7 120(a)(1) of CERCLA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209620\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), and \u00a7 6001(a) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206961\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Navy removed both cases to the District Court under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). The Giovannis and Palmers then filed motions to remand their cases to state court. The Navy responded by moving to dismiss the cases without remand, which the Giovannis and Palmers opposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The District Court held a hearing on the competing motions in the Giovannis' case. The parties agreed that removal was proper under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which prompted the Court to deny the motion for remand. Ultimately, the Court dismissed the Giovannis' complaint, and it issued a thorough and detailed memorandum opinion to support its decision. It concluded that \u00a7 113(h) of CERCLA\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   deprived it of jurisdiction\n   to hear a claim that would interfere with an ongoing cleanup under CERCLA, and that the Giovannis' claims that the Navy should pay for medical monitoring and should provide a health study amounted to a challenge to the ongoing response actions at the Naval Facilities. The Court construed \u00a7 113(h) of CERCLA as depriving both it and the state courts of jurisdiction, and thus it dismissed the Giovannis' case under the doctrine of derivative jurisdiction, without remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The District Court then disposed of the Palmers' complaint in a footnote order granting the Navy's motion to dismiss, \"consistent with the Court's Opinion in\n   <em>\n    Giovanni\n   </em>\n   [.]\" (P.A. at 45.) In that order, the District Court rejected an additional argument raised by the Palmers, namely that the cleanup activities were initiated under \u00a7 120 of CERCLA\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and were therefore not affected by \u00a7 113(h)'s jurisdictional bar. It concluded that the authority to clean up the Naval Facilities derived from \u00a7 104 of the Act,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   not \u00a7 120.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Giovannis and Palmers filed these timely appeals. Amicus briefs have been filed in support of the Giovannis and Palmers by the following groups: (1) the Delaware Riverkeeper Network and Maya van Rossum, also known as the Delaware Riverkeeper; (2) the Toxics Action Center; and (3) Brendan Boyle, Lori Cervera, Renee Frugoli, Hope Grosse, Yvonne Love, Minde Ruch, Joanne Stanton, and Jacquelyn Rose Wiest, all of whom currently live or formerly lived near the Naval Facilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We will affirm in part and vacate in part the District Court's dismissal of the Giovannis'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   and Palmers' complaints and will affirm its decision not to remand to state court. Although the requests for a government-led health assessment or health effects study are barred under \u00a7 113(h) as challenges to ongoing response actions, the requests for the costs associated with private party medical monitoring are not barred by that CERCLA provision because that relief does not interfere with or alter the ongoing cleanup efforts. Moreover, the relief sought by the Giovannis' and Palmers' on their medical monitoring claims is best characterized as injunctive relief, and the federal government has waived sovereign immunity to suits by private parties seeking such relief. We will therefore vacate the District Court's dismissal of the Giovannis' and Palmers' requests for costs associated with private party medical monitoring and remand for further proceedings on those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Our review of a district court's grant of a motion to dismiss is plenary.\n   <em>\n    Bell v.

Lack of Jurisdiction Over \"Challenges\" Under \u00a7 113(h)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Navy argues that federal courts are without jurisdiction to rule on the Giovannis' and Palmers' state law claims because they are barred under \u00a7 113(h) as \"challenges\" to ongoing cleanup efforts at the Naval Facilities. The Giovannis and Palmers, of course, disagree because, as they see it, their requested relief will not interfere with those ongoing efforts. We therefore first address whether state law claims seeking compensation to fund private party medical monitoring and state law claims seeking a government-led health assessment or health effects study are \"challenges to removal or remedial action\" under \u00a7 113(h).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our conclusion is\n   that the latter are challenges but the former are not.

We take a holistic approach that encompasses several considerations. One is whether the relief can be classified as a \"removal\" or \"remedial\" step. Another and closely related consideration is the specific form of relief requested and whether it would compel the defendant to take some action or refrain from taking some action, or instead seeks to have the defendant pay for a third party to provide services. A further consideration is whether, on the whole, there is reason to think that a given request for relief will conflict with, impact, or otherwise interfere with the ongoing cleanup efforts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   We address each of those three considerations seriatim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Thus, if the requested relief can be classified as a removal or remedial action, it is possible that it will conflict with, impact, or otherwise interfere with an ongoing CERCLA cleanup for purposes of \u00a7 113(h). The question, then, is whether the Giovannis' and Palmers' requests for relief-private party medical monitoring and a government-led health study-fit the statutory definitions of removal or remedial action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a.

The other actions listed in the definition of \"removal\" refer to activities directly related to the physical removal, containment, assessment, or evaluation of hazardous waste, not broadly to all potential actions taken because of a toxic release.

Because the ATSDR has authority to conduct health assessments on behalf of the government at contaminated facilities, and those activities are response actions under CERCLA, the Giovannis' and Palmers' demand that another agency of the government conduct such a study would, if granted, interfere with a response action under CERCLA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Therefore, we agree with the District Court's determination that the requested relief mandating that the Navy perform a health assessment or health effects study is a response action under CERCLA, which suggests that it is a challenge under \u00a7 113(h).\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Form of Relief Requested\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   When assessing whether a claim challenges an ongoing cleanup effort, courts have also distinguished among forms of relief as they affect the defending party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Generally, requests for injunctive\n   relief that relate in any way to pending response actions are viewed as challenges under \u00a7 113(h). If a plaintiff demands that a defendant engage in activities that could have been a part of the cleanup plan, then it is a challenge to the selected response actions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McClellan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7409247\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/47/325/#p328\">\n    47 F.3d at 329-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that injunctive relief injecting new requirements into a CERCLA cleanup effort would clearly constitute a challenge because it would interfere with those ongoing activities). In contrast, requests that require little more of the defendant than the expenditure of money are generally not considered to be \"challenges\" under \u00a7 113(h).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Beck v.

The effect that the sought-for relief has on the cleanup is what must be determinative, not the label a party or court uses to describe the claim for relief. For example, a request that the defendant pay damages could constitute a challenge under \u00a7 113(h) if it directly conflicts with the implementation of the cleanup plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pakootas v.

And, conversely, a request for injunctive relief that has no effect on an ongoing cleanup is unlikely to constitute a challenge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ARCO Envtl.

We must consider the form of relief that the plaintiffs request and its impact on the defendant to determine whether the requested relief challenges an ongoing cleanup.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a. Private Party Medical Monitoring\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Focusing on the specific relief requested here, payment for the costs of a private party medical monitoring program does not appear to be a challenge under \u00a7 113(h). The prayer for relief at the end of each complaint expressly states that the Giovannis and Palmers want the Navy to provide \"the costs of medical monitoring[.]\" (G.J.A. at 27; P.A. at 16.) In their briefing, the Giovannis and Palmers insist that the relief \"would simply impose the costs of setting up a medical monitoring trust fund on the [Navy.]\" (Giovannis' Opening Br. at 10; Palmers' Reply Br. at 9-10.) Thus, according to both the Giovannis' and Palmers' characterization of the relief that they seek with respect to medical monitoring, the Navy need do nothing but fund a trust. That counsels in favor of concluding that the relief associated with the Giovannis' and Palmers' medical monitoring claim is not a challenge under \u00a7 113(h). This is especially so because, as noted earlier, the private party medical monitoring program the Giovannis' and Palmers' want the Navy to fund is not a removal or remedial action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b. Health Assessment or Health Effects Study\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The government-led health study requested by the Giovannis and Palmers, when viewed through the form-of-relief lens, appears in contrast to be a challenge under \u00a7 113(h) to ongoing response efforts at the Naval Facilities. That relief amounts to a demand that the Navy take on additional efforts related to cleaning up the contamination at those Superfund sites. Although the facts in this case differ from those in\n   <em>\n    Hanford\n   </em>\n   , which involved an injunction compelling the ATSDR to implement a health surveillance program, the relief requested here is analogous because the government is being asked to conduct a response action that the ATSDR may still be contemplating. And like the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    McClellan\n   </em>\n   , who wanted the court to impose additional RCRA reporting and permitting requirements upon an ongoing cleanup, the requested injunctive relief here would interfere with the ongoing cleanup efforts at the Naval Facilities because it would modify or replace the existing remedial plan. The request for a government-led health assessment or health effects study is therefore effectively a request for injunctive relief, which counsels in favor of concluding that it is barred as a challenge under \u00a7 113(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Impact on Ongoing Cleanup Efforts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Another consideration is whether, on the whole, there is some additional reason to think that a given request for relief will conflict with, impact, or otherwise interfere with an ongoing cleanup effort.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boarhead\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10546352\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/923/1011/#p1023\">\n    923 F.2d at 1023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (indicating that \u00a7 113(h) bars lawsuits that will \"interfere with\" ongoing remediation activities);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cannon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4127344\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/538/1328/#p1335\">\n    538 F.3d at 1335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \u00a7 113(h) precludes lawsuits that will \"interfere[ ] with the implementation of a [selected] CERCLA remedy\" (citation omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a.

The Court said that those \"are decisions that Congress determined 'should be dealt with after the site has been cleaned up.' \" (G.J.A. at 113 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Boarhead\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10546352\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/923/1011/#p1023\">\n    923 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1019 ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   That reliance on\n   <em>\n    Boarhead\n   </em>\n   is understandable but, in this instance, misplaced. The plaintiff in that case was \"challenging the EPA's ability to conduct an [environmental] study pursuant to \u00a7 104 of CERCLA before the EPA perform[ed] an appropriate review[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Boarhead\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10546352\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/923/1011/#p1023\">\n    923 F.2d at 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff was thus directly interfering with the EPA's ability to conduct a cleanup because it was seeking injunctive relief that would certainly have altered the existing remedial plans. The facts here are quite different. The Giovannis and Palmers want the Navy to fund a trust to cover the costs of private party medical monitoring rather than to take some additional action. And it is not clear that there would be any litigation about who is responsible for the contamination or the costs of the cleanup. The Navy freely admits that it \"generated hazardous waste\" and \"released PFOA and PFOS\" contaminants at the Naval Facilities. (Answering Br. at 11, 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Finally, the District Court specifically distinguished the conclusions in\n   <em>\n    Durfey\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Yslava\n   </em>\n   that private party medical monitoring claims are not challenges under \u00a7 113(h) because, in its view, those cases failed to explain why state law medical monitoring claims are not disputes about who is responsible and hence, under \u00a7 113(h), should be dealt with after the cleanup is complete. But we should not expect a discussion of \"responsibility\" for \"necessary costs of response\" and \"response actions\" in a case in which there has already been a determination that the requested remedy is not a \"response\" or \"response cost.\" Furthermore,\n   <em>\n    Durfey\n   </em>\n   involved a government-owned property that was contaminated with radioactivity during the development of the atomic bomb in the 1940s, so there was likely no dispute that the government was responsible for the contamination. Thus, the District Court's conclusion that the Giovannis' and Palmers' requests for the costs of private party medical monitoring were challenges for purposes of \u00a7 113(h) is, in our estimation, without adequate support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b. Health Assessment or Health Effects Study\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The story is different for a government-led health study. There is reason to believe that the Giovannis' and Palmers' requests that the Navy conduct a health assessment or health effects study will conflict with, impact, or otherwise interfere with the ongoing cleanup efforts at the Naval Facilities.

The Palmers' Argument Under \u00a7 120 of CERCLA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Notwithstanding any argument under \u00a7 113(h), the Palmers argue that the cleanup activities at the federal Naval Facilities were initiated under \u00a7 120 rather than \u00a7 104, and thus that \u00a7 113(h) is inapplicable to bar their state-law claim. The Navy counters that \u00a7 120 merely describes additional procedures unique to federal land, and does not confer any authority outside of that already granted in \u00a7 104. We agree with the Navy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Section 113(h), by its plain text, bars \"challenges to removal or remedial action selected under section [104] of [CERCLA.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209613\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h).

That authority is granted in the broadest terms. There are a number of references to a \"facility\" or \"facilities,\" but there is no indication that Congress meant to distinguish between federal and non-federal facilities, or between Superfund and non-Superfund sites. Furthermore, \u00a7 101(9) provides a definition of the term \"facility\" and also fails to distinguish between the federal and non-federal, or the Superfund and non-Superfund, nature of a\n   site.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the text of \u00a7 104 authorizes the President to take response actions at any facility with respect to any hazardous release, including a federal facility listed on the NPL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Section 120, which was added to CERCLA in 1986,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pub.

NOR ARE HEALTH ASSESSMENTS RESPONSE ACTIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Nor does government involvement turn health assessments into removal or remedial actions. CERCLA explicitly distinguishes health assessments from response actions. The statute allows recovery of\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   (A) all costs of\n   <em>\n    removal or remedial action\n   </em>\n   incurred by the United States Government or a State or an Indian tribe not inconsistent with the national contingency plan;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   (B) any other necessary\n   <em>\n    costs of response\n   </em>\n   incurred by any other person\n   consistent with the national contingency plan;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   (C) damages for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources, including the reasonable costs of assessing such injury, destruction, or loss resulting from such a release;\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   (D) the costs of\n   <em>\n    any health assessment or health effects study\n   </em>\n   carried out under section 9604(i) of this title.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209607\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4) (emphases added). Since the statute enumerates response actions separately from health assessments, the two are distinct. Any other reading renders \u00a7 9607(a)(4)(D) superfluous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   And subparagraph (D) was added later than (A) and (B). Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-499, \u00a7 107,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20Stat.%201613\">\n    100 Stat. 1613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In fact, Congress added subparagraph (D) at the same time that it created the ATSDR and provided for medical monitoring and health assessments.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20Stat.%201613\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 107, 110. If health assessments were removal or remedial actions, then they would already have been covered by \u00a7 9607(a)(4)(A) and (B). But health assessments were not, so Congress added \u00a7 9607(a)(4)(D). I would give full effect to that addition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   True, there is a colorable argument that the definition of a health assessment falls within the definition of a removal action. Health assessments examine \"the potential risk to human health posed by individual sites and facilities.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209604\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(6)(F). That sounds a lot like \"assess[ing], and evaluat[ing] the release\" of, hazardous substances.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209604\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9601(23) (defining removal actions). Still, health assessments are unlike the other temporary measures listed in the definition of removal actions, like providing security fencing or monitoring the release of hazardous substances. They are not done at the cleanup site itself. And the enumeration of health assessments as distinct from removal actions in \u00a7 9607(a)(4) resolves any doubt. So I would hold that health assessments are neither removal nor remedial actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Nor would a health assessment interfere with any response action. On this record, I do not see how a health assessment would obstruct or hinder any ongoing cleanup. Sure, it might require the EPA to take more action if the assessment revealed a significant risk.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209604\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9604(i)(11). And those extra actions might include \"provi[ding] alternative water supplies, temporary evacuation and housing,\" all of which are listed removal actions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209604\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9604(23). But a health assessment is upstream from a response action. We lack jurisdiction over challenges to response actions only if they have been \"selected.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209604\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9613(h). But while an assessment may require new response actions, it is not an attack on the response itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   In short, \u00a7 9613(h) turns on whether the\n   <em>\n    action\n   </em>\n   would interfere with a removal or remedial action, not whether the\n   <em>\n    actor\n   </em>\n   is the government. Neither medical monitoring nor health assessments would interfere with an ongoing cleanup. So I would hold that neither kind of requested relief turns a suit into a challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   I agree with the majority that the court-supervised medical monitoring sought here is not a challenge and is not barred by sovereign immunity, so I concur in part and in the judgment. Because the majority finds that government-led health assessments are challenges barred by \u00a7 9613(h), it does not address whether sovereign immunity would bar those claims. So I too decline to reach that question.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    The parties do not dispute any material facts bearing on the issue of subject matter jurisdiction, which makes the Navy's attack on the complaints under Rule 12(b)(1) a facial challenge rather than a factual one.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hartig Drug Co.

Section 113(h) did not bar filing those claims initially in state court. Nor did \u00a7 113(b), because the claims arise under state law, not CERCLA. We will, however, affirm the District Court's decision to dismiss the demands for a health effects study because those demands constitute challenges to the Navy's ongoing cleanup, and thus neither we nor the state courts have jurisdiction to consider those claims at this time.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"26\">\n   <p id=\"p-184\">\n    The Navy did not, however, waive its sovereign immunity under \u00a7 120(a)(1) of CERCLA. That provision states that \"[e]ach department, agency, and instrumentality of the United States ... shall be subject to, and comply with, [CERCLA] in the same manner and to the same extent, both procedurally and substantively, as any nongovernmental entity[.]\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209620\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9620\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(1). Another subsection, however, says that \"[s]tate laws concerning removal and remedial action, including State laws regarding enforcement, shall apply to removal and remedial action at facilities owned or operated by a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States or facilities that are the subject of a deferral under subsection (h)(3)(C) of this section\n    <em>\n     when such facilities are not included on the National Priorities List\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209620\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 9620(a)(4) (emphasis added).
