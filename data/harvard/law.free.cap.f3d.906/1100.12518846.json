Daff, the trustee for the bankruptcy estate of Richard J. Swintek (\"the debtor\"), appeals from the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel's (\"BAP\") decision reversing the bankruptcy court's grant of summary judgment in the trustee's favor. Appellee Karen M. Good is a judgment creditor who, before the debtor filed for bankruptcy, obtained an \"ORAP\" lien encumbering the debtor's personal property under California law. Due to the bankruptcy code's automatic stay on actions to recover on claims against a debtor, Good was unable to execute on her lien, and she failed to renew it under state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This appeal presents the question of whether an ORAP lien falls within the scope of the code's tolling provision, which applies to \"a period for commencing or continuing a civil action ... on a claim against the debtor\" that arose before the\n   bankruptcy petition.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20108\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). We hold that the period in which a creditor may execute on a lien constitutes the continuation of the original action that resulted in the judgment and is thus tolled during the automatic stay. We therefore affirm the BAP's decision and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This case originates from two money judgments awarded in 2001 in favor of non-parties and against the debtor. Good acquired these judgments by assignment in 2009 and renewed them in 2010. In June 2010, a California superior court issued an Order for Appearance and Examination (\"ORAP\"), which required the debtor to appear for a judgment-debtor examination. Good served the debtor with the order the same day and thus created a one-year \"ORAP lien\" encumbering the debtor's personal property under California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 708.110(d).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S. Cal. Bank v. Zimmerman\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Hilde\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"273632,224475\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/120/950/\">\n    120 F.3d 950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 956 (9th Cir. 1997) (\"[A]n ORAP lien is created simply by service on the debtor of an order to appear for a debtor's examination ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In August 2010, the debtor filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, and Daff became the bankruptcy estate's trustee. Good eventually filed proofs of claim in the bankruptcy case in the amounts of her judgments. In March 2013, Good commenced an adversarial proceeding seeking a declaration that her ORAP lien had a priority superior to that of the trustee. Both parties eventually moved for summary judgment. The trustee argued that Good's ORAP lien expired in June 2011 because it is undisputed that she failed to renew the lien under state law at the end of its one-year term. Good countered that, because the debtor filed for bankruptcy after the ORAP lien was created, the lien was tolled under \u00a7 108(c) of the bankruptcy code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The bankruptcy court ruled in the trustee's favor, holding that the tolling provision is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   applicable to ORAP liens and, consequently, that Good's lien expired in 2011. The BAP reversed on appeal, concluding that this question is controlled by our decision in\n   <em>\n    Spirtos v. Moreno\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Spirtos\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11196949,11246598\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/221/1079/\">\n    221 F.3d 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2000), where we held that \u00a7 108(c) tolls the period for renewing a judgment.\n   <em>\n    Good v. Daff\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Swintek\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363721\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/543/303/#p309\">\n    543 B.R. 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 309-11 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trustee filed a timely appeal to this court. At oral argument, however, it appeared that the parties disputed whether Good had properly served the debtor with the ORAP and thus whether a lien had\n   <em>\n    ever\n   </em>\n   encumbered his personal property. This factual dispute raised a threshold question of justiciability because, if the ORAP lien never existed, our decision on \u00a7 108(c)'s applicability would be advisory. We therefore remanded this case to the bankruptcy court, which confirmed that service was proper.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we now turn to merits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The question before us centers on the interplay between two sections of\n   the bankruptcy code: the automatic stay under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and the tolling provision under \u00a7 108(c). Under \u00a7 362(a), the filing of a bankruptcy petition automatically triggers a stay \"of actions by all entities to collect or recover on claims\" against the debtor.\n   <em>\n    Burton v. Infinity Capital Mgmt\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275972,12270237\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/740/\">\n    862 F.3d 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 746 (9th Cir. 2017). The stay \"is designed to provide breathing space to the debtor, prevent harassment of the debtor, assure that all claims against the debtor will be brought in the sole forum of the bankruptcy court, and protect creditors as a class from the possibility that one or more creditors will obtain payment to the detriment of others.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The stay's scope is \"quite broad\" and \"applies to almost any type of formal or informal action against the debtor or property of the estate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 746-47 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The statute enumerates several types of actions within the stay's scope that are relevant to this case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (1) the\n   <em>\n    commencement or continuation\n   </em>\n   ... of a judicial, administrative, or other action or proceeding against the debtor that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the case under this title, or to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (2) the\n   <em>\n    enforcement\n   </em>\n   , against the debtor or against property of the estate,\n   <em>\n    of a judgment\n   </em>\n   obtained before the commencement of the case under this title;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (4) any act to create, perfect, or\n   <em>\n    enforce any lien\n   </em>\n   against property of the estate;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The stay on such actions remains in place throughout the bankruptcy's pendency.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 362(c). Given the fact that proceedings can span months or (as demonstrated in this case) years, claims that creditors might hold against a debtor are liable to expire before the discharge is granted or denied. The code therefore implements a tolling provision under \u00a7 108(c), which provides in relevant part: \"[I]f applicable nonbankruptcy law ... fixes a period for\n   <em>\n    commencing or continuing a civil action\n   </em>\n   in a court other than a bankruptcy court on a claim against the debtor, ... and such period has not expired before the date of the filing of the petition, then such period does not expire until ... 30 days after notice of the termination or expiration of the stay under section 362....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20108\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Here, the applicable nonbankruptcy law is the California ORAP statute. This statute allows a judgment creditor to apply to a California court \"for an order requiring the judgment debtor to appear before the court ... to furnish information to aid in enforcement of the money judgment [i.e., an ORAP].\" CAL. CIV. PROC. CODE \u00a7 708.110(a). A creditor's service of the order upon the debtor \"creates a lien on the personal property of the judgment debtor for a period of one year from the date of the order unless extended or sooner terminated by the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 708.110(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As noted above, the ORAP lien at issue was set to expire during mid-2011, which was after the debtor filed his bankruptcy petition and thus during the automatic stay. Whether the lien has expired depends on whether \u00a7 108(c) applies to it and thus tolled its one-year duration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically,\n   we must determine whether the period in which a creditor may execute on an ORAP lien constitutes \"commencing or continuing a civil action\" under the bankruptcy code's tolling provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20108\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The trustee contends that the code distinguishes between the concepts of\n   <em>\n    enforcing\n   </em>\n   a judgment-e.g., by executing on a lien-and\n   <em>\n    continuing\n   </em>\n   an action. In interpreting the phrase \"commencing or continuing a civil action\" under \u00a7 108(c)'s tolling provision, the trustee relies on the text of \u00a7 362(a)'s\n   <em>\n    stay\n   </em>\n   provision. As seen in the excerpt above, \u00a7 362(a)(1) first states that the stay applies to the \"commencement or continuation ... of a[n] ... action or proceeding against the debtor,\" thus using language nearly identical to \u00a7 108(c).\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20108\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Section 362(a), however,\n   <em>\n    separately\n   </em>\n   addresses staying \"the enforcement ... of a judgment\" against the debtor in its subsequent subsection.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 362(a)(2). Thus, in the trustee's view, treating the enforcement of a judgment as the continuation of a civil action would render the subsections of the stay provision redundant. And because the tolling provision is the counterpart to the automatic stay, the trustee contends that the phrase \"commencing or continuing a civil action\" in the former should be read identically to the \"commencement or continuation ... of a[n] ... action or proceeding\" in the latter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mertens v. Hewitt Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11663\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/248/#p260\">\n    508 U.S. 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 260,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11663\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/248/#p260\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11663\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/248/#p260\">\n    124 L.Ed.2d 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993) (\"[L]anguage used in one portion of a statute ... should be deemed to have the same meaning as the same language used elsewhere in the statute ....\"). The trustee therefore concludes that the tolling provision does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   apply to the\n   <em>\n    enforcement\n   </em>\n   of a judgment through means such as the ORAP lien at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This argument is premised on the assumption that each subsection under \u00a7 362(a) enumerates a distinct, mutually-exclusive form of creditor activity that falls within the stay's scope. There is clear overlap, however, throughout the stay provision's text. Subsection (2), for instance, encompasses \"the\n   <em>\n    enforcement\n   </em>\n   , against the debtor or against property of the estate, of a judgment,\" while subsections (4) and (5) also collectively address \"any act to create, perfect, or\n   <em>\n    enforce\n   </em>\n   any lien against property of the estate\" or \"of the debtor.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2, 4-5) (emphasis added). Subsection (6) similarly encompasses \"any act to collect, assess, or recover a claim against the debtor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Indeed, this \"language is from time to time duplicative\" in order to ensure that \"virtually all acts to collect [pre-bankruptcy] claims and all actions that would affect property of the estate are stayed.\" 3 COLLIER ON BANKRUPTCY \u00b6 362.03 (Alan N. Resnick &amp; Henry J. Sommer, eds., 16th ed. 2017). Accordingly, the fact that \u00a7 362(a) refers to both \"the enforcement ... of a judgment\" and \"commencing or continuing a civil action\" does not demonstrate that these creditor activities are mutually exclusive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Moreover, the trustee's textual argument does not account for our decisions in\n   <em>\n    Spirtos\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miner Corp. v. Hunters Run Ltd. P'ship\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Hunters Run Ltd. P'ship\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10538386,6501099\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/875/1425/\">\n    875 F.2d 1425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 1989). In\n   <em>\n    Spirtos\n   </em>\n   , a creditor obtained a California judgment several years before the debtor filed for bankruptcy but failed to renew the judgment under state law.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11196949,11246598\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/221/1079/\">\n    221 F.3d at 1080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the judgment's ten-year statute of duration would have expired while the automatic stay was in effect, the question on appeal was whether \u00a7 108(c)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   tolled this period.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . We held that it did.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (\"[S]ection 108(c) appears to cover our situation. The California statute of duration is a nonbankruptcy law that applies to the [creditor's] judgment.\"). The trustee attempts to distinguish this holding by highlighting the fact that\n   <em>\n    Spirtos\n   </em>\n   addressed the renewal of a judgment itself rather than the renewal of a lien. He asserts that, without a valid, unexpired judgment, a creditor would have no claim against the debtor or his estate, and therefore, a judgment's renewal is distinguishable from its enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   While this is a fair point,\n   <em>\n    Spirtos\n   </em>\n   relied in part on our earlier decision in\n   <em>\n    Hunters Run\n   </em>\n   , where we held that \u00a7 108(c) tolled \"the period during which [a] creditor could enforce its [mechanic's] lien.\"\n   <em>\n    Spirtos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11196949,11246598\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/221/1079/\">\n    221 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1081 (citing\n   <em>\n    Hunters Run\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10538386,6501099\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/875/1425/\">\n    875 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1428 ). One of the parties in\n   <em>\n    Spirtos\n   </em>\n   argued that, under\n   <em>\n    Hunters Run\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 108(c) applies only if \u00a7 362(a) bars a creditor from\n   <em>\n    renewing\n   </em>\n   a judgment or lien while the automatic stay is in place.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . We rejected this narrow interpretation of our precedent, clarifying that\n   <em>\n    Hunters Run\n   </em>\n   \"stands for the proposition that section 108(c) extends the limitations period so long as the creditor is barred by the automatic stay from\n   <em>\n    enforcing its judgment\n   </em>\n   against the property of the estate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (emphasis added). Therefore, in\n   <em>\n    Spirtos\n   </em>\n   , it was \"the creditor's\n   <em>\n    inability to enforce the judgment\n   </em>\n   for a portion of the ten-year period that [kept] the period of duration open under section 108(c).\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Here, the imposition of the automatic stay similarly barred Good from executing on her ORAP lien and thus enforcing her judgment. Indeed, the ORAP lien is the modern iteration in California's long history of providing judgment creditors with a \"supplemental proceeding[ ] for the purpose of discovering assets of a judgment debtor and applying them\n   <em>\n    to satisfaction of the judgment\n   </em>\n   .\" 8 B.E. WITKIN, CALIFORNIA PROCEDURE \u00a7 277 (5th ed. 2018) (emphasis added) (stating that the ORAP statute \"continues the former authorization of examination proceedings\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4643512\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-2d/51/29/\">\n    51 Cal.App.2d 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=124%20P.2d%20117\">\n    124 P.2d 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 119 (1942) (discussing the history of supplemental proceedings in California).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The trustee nonetheless contends that \u00a7 108(c) is inapplicable. He asserts that the mechanic's lien at issue in\n   <em>\n    Hunters Run\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from an ORAP lien because the former was a statutory lien that did not result from a judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunters Run\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10538386,6501099\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/875/1425/\">\n    875 F.2d at 1425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, according to the trustee, if the mechanic's lien had expired, its holder-like the judgment creditor in\n   <em>\n    Spirtos\n   </em>\n   -would not have had a claim against the debtor, with whom the lienholder lacked contractual privity. Here, by contrast, the expiration of Good's ORAP lien would still leave her with a valid judgment. The only effect on her claim against the estate would be her loss of\n   <em>\n    priority\n   </em>\n   as a secured creditor in the distribution of the estate's assets because she would become an unsecured judgment creditor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   But the distinction that the trustee attempts to draw between claim preservation and claim priority finds no basis in our analysis in\n   <em>\n    Hunters Run\n   </em>\n   .

Nat'l Bank of N.Y.C.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6500123,10529571\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/866/561/\">\n     866 F.2d 561\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2d Cir. 1989), which involves a judgment lien. The fact that\n    <em>\n     Spirtos\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Hunters Run\n    </em>\n    cite to\n    <em>\n     Morton\n    </em>\n    , is of no consequence. Neither\n    <em>\n     Spirtos\n    </em>\n    nor\n    <em>\n     Hunters Run\n    </em>\n    dealt with liens akin to an ORAP lien.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
