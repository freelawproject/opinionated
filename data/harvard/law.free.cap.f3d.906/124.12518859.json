Palacios appeals each of the district court's rulings.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-10\">\n      Palacios served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1992 to 1995. He received an other-than-honorable discharge stemming from his pattern of misconduct. In about 2002 and 2009, he sought an upgrade of his discharge on the basis that his misconduct resulted from his mental and physical disabilities. The Naval Discharge Review Board denied both of his requests. Palacios then asked the Board for Correction of Naval Records to correct his records. The Correction Board denied his request in 2010.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-11\">\n      In response, Palacios filed an action for judicial review of the Correction Board's decision in the Court of Federal Claims. The Claims Court dismissed his suit as untimely under the statute of limitations applicable to his wrongful-discharge claim.\n      <em>\n       Palacios v.

After the Board denied this request in 2015, Palacios filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. He claimed that the Board's denial of reconsideration was arbitrary and capricious, unsupported by substantial evidence, and contrary to law under the Administrative Procedure Act,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n       5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (2). His prayer for relief asked the district court to enter judgment correcting his disability rating and discharge, awarding costs and attorneys' fees, and \"[g]ranting Plaintiff appropriate back pay and benefits that would natural[ly] flow from the upgrade in discharge status.\" In the alternative, he asked the district court to remand to the Correction Board for consideration on the merits.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-13\">\n      The government moved to dismiss on the ground that Palacios's complaint fell outside the applicable statute of limitations and that it asserted a claim under the Tucker Act over which the Court of Federal Claims had exclusive jurisdiction. In his opposition to the government's motion to dismiss, Palacios moved for leave to amend his complaint by dropping his request for money damages or, in the alternative, to transfer the case to the Court of Federal Claims.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-14\">\n      When a party in the district court moves to transfer the case to the Court of Federal Claims,\n      <em>\n       see\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201631\">\n       28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , a statutory procedure is triggered: \"no further proceedings shall be taken in the district court until 60 days after the court has ruled upon the motion,\"\n      <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n       28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (d)(4)(B).
