A struggle ensued. Afterwards, each man claimed that the other had forced him into a fight for his life. Moreno was convicted at trial of multiple federal crimes. We reverse his convictions for attempted robbery of Linde's gun and vehicle because there was plain error in the jury instructions on those counts, but we otherwise affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Linde was responsible for patrolling a vast swath of mountainous desert stretching across Arizona and New Mexico and\n   running down to the Mexican border, which contained areas of National Forest. Apart from the Forest Service, the United States Border Patrol was the only law enforcement agency operating in that remote area. While carrying out his duties, Linde often encountered people who had crossed the border unlawfully, some of whom were smuggling drugs. Many of those people fell victim to the heat and harsh terrain. Stranded without food and water, they sometimes sought help from federal officers on patrol. Linde carried water and other supplies in his truck to prepare for such encounters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   One day during a patrol, Linde received a report of suspicious people walking along a road near an area of National Forest. Linde called Border Patrol and was asked to respond. As he had many times before, Linde agreed to assist and set out in his truck, which was clearly marked as a law enforcement vehicle. Before long, he encountered two men, one of whom had scrapes and scratches on his face. The other, who did not appear injured, was Moreno.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The two men walked up to the truck. Linde offered them water, but they declined. Linde then directed Moreno and his companion to come to the front of the truck and put their hands on the hood. The injured man complied, but Moreno did not. With verbal commands failing, Linde drew his gun. A struggle between Linde and Moreno began moments later, the details of which are in dispute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Linde testified in Moreno's subsequent jury trial that he ordered Moreno to turn away and put his hands on his head. This time, Moreno complied. Linde approached with his gun drawn. When he was a few feet away, Linde holstered his weapon and pulled out handcuffs. After cuffing Moreno's right hand, Linde began to cuff Moreno's left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At trial, Linde admitted not remembering exactly what happened next, but he recalled being yanked forward, then going blank. The next thing he knew, he and Moreno were fighting. Moreno went for the gun. Linde threw his hands down to his holster, one covering the handle of the gun, the other fending off Moreno.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Moreno responded by throwing Linde to the ground. Entangled, the two men rolled towards an embankment on the side of the road. Moreno started pummeling Linde in the face. Linde blacked out briefly before feeling his gun being pulled out of its holster. Two shots rang out. Having lost control of his weapon, Linde flailed his arms, searching for the gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Linde testified that he located the weapon right before Moreno could take aim at his chest. Linde pushed Moreno's hand away and then rolled onto his side, just as another shot discharged near his head. Linde grabbed Moreno's wrist, trying to keep the gun pointed away. Moreno nearly broke free, but Linde grabbed him by the neck, wrapped his leg around Moreno's throat, and squeezed. Moreno fired several shots skyward before dropping the gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Linde grabbed it. He aimed at Moreno and pulled the trigger. Nothing happened. Linde rolled away, backing up to put distance between them. Moreno-on his knees, hands in the air-cried \"no, no, no, no.\" Thinking the clip was empty, Linde reloaded. Moreno bolted for the truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As Moreno ran, Linde realized that the gun was jammed. Linde quickly cleared the jam but, knowing that his truck contained no weapons and that its security system would prevent Moreno from driving\n   away, did not fire. Instead, as he told the jury, Linde went to the truck, aimed the gun at Moreno's chest, and threatened to kill him if he moved. Linde then grabbed the radio and reported, \"Shots fired.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Moreno gave law enforcement a very different account of the incident. In a post-arrest interview that was recorded and later played for the jury, Moreno admitted that he initially refused to comply with Linde's commands but claimed that he sat down as the officer approached with handcuffs. By Moreno's telling, Linde never holstered the gun but instead kept his finger on the trigger, with the barrel pointed at Moreno. Fearing for his life and wanting to return to Mexico rather than go to prison, Moreno tried to grab the gun. A shot went off. Moreno tackled Linde with all the force he could muster. Two more shots rang out as the two men struggled on the ground, each trying to wrest the gun from the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Moreno claimed that, by this point, he could have beaten Linde unconscious. Instead, Moreno slammed Linde's hand onto the ground, forcing him to release the gun. Moreno seized it, fired the remaining rounds into the air, and tossed the gun aside. He ran for the truck, thinking he would drive to the border and leave it there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Moreno recounted that, when he got behind the wheel, he suddenly realized that he had been acting stupidly and that he should not drive away. For that reason, Moreno explained, he got out of the truck and gave himself up voluntarily.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Moreno was charged with assault on a federal officer, attempted murder of a federal officer, use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, possession of a firearm by an illegal alien, attempted robbery of Linde's gun, attempted robbery of Linde's truck, and illegal reentry. At trial, the jury hung on the attempted murder charge but convicted on the others. The district court sentenced Moreno to just over 43 years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On appeal, Moreno challenges all of his convictions except the one for illegal re-entry. We reverse both of Moreno's convictions for attempted robbery but affirm the rest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Moreno argues that the jury instructions given at trial did not accurately define the elements of attempted robbery under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202112\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court instructed that, for the jury to convict Moreno of attempted robbery under that statute, the Government had to prove that he \"did take or attempt to take from the person or presence of another any kind or description of personal property belonging to the United States,\" and that he \"did so by force and violence, or by intimidation.\" Although Moreno requested an instruction requiring the Government to prove that he acted with the \"intent to steal\" and that his use of \"force or intimidation\" was \"directly related\" to the attempted taking, he acknowledges that he did not object when the district court instructed the jury differently at trial. We may therefore review only for plain error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

R. Crim. P. 30(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On appeal, Moreno maintains that the district court plainly erred in two ways in instructing the jury on the elements of attempted robbery under \u00a7 2112 : (i) by failing to instruct that Moreno must have\n   possessed the specific intent to steal; and (ii) by failing to instruct that Moreno must have formed such intent by the time he used force, not just by the time he tried to take the property in question.

The district court therefore should have instructed the jury that, to convict Moreno of attempted robbery, it needed to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that he had formed the specific intent to steal the gun and truck by the time he tried to take them, though not necessarily by the time he used force against Linde. And, given the well-settled elements of common law robbery as well as\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   's clear indication that \u00a7 2112 incorporates the common law, failing to instruct the jury on specific intent was an obvious omission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   That obvious instructional error affected Moreno's substantial rights, and it seriously undermined the fairness and integrity of the proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Molina-Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595701\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1338/#p1343\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We therefore reverse both of Moreno's convictions for attempted robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   To begin, there is a reasonable probability that failing to instruct the jury that Moreno must have had the specific intent to steal the gun-that is, the specific intent to permanently deprive Linde of the weapon-affected the jury's verdict. Again, Moreno claimed that he grabbed the gun to avoid being shot. Even if the jury did not believe that Moreno reasonably feared for his life before the struggle, the jury might well have believed Moreno when he said that he \"struggled with the officer for all the bullets to be fired\" so that he \"could go to Mexico,\" and that he tossed the gun aside once he had emptied the clip.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   On those facts, Moreno would have lacked the\n   specific intent to steal. Accordingly, Moreno has shown that the evidence was not \"overwhelming\" as to the omitted element, and thus has convinced us that the plain instructional error affected his substantial rights.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Recall Linde's testimony. He told the jury that, in the heat of the struggle, he tried to shoot Moreno but the gun did not fire. Linde then rolled away from Moreno, who was left kneeling on the ground, pleading for his life. Linde reloaded, and Moreno ran for the truck. On those facts, the jury could have found that Moreno intended to flee for fear of being shot, rather than with intent to steal the truck. And given how close to Mexico the struggle occurred, Moreno's statement that he planned to abandon the truck at the port of entry left room to conclude that he expected all along that the truck would be recovered. Failing to instruct on specific intent thus affected Moreno's substantial rights on this count too.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Finally, the error seriously affected the fairness and integrity of the proceedings.

First, Moreno urges us to reverse all of his remaining convictions on the ground that the jury instructions given at trial failed to present resistance to excessive force as a defense, and that the instructions thus failed to cover his theory of the case. Second, Moreno challenges his convictions for assault on a federal officer under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20111\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and for use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence (the assault) under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), contending that the instructions improperly defined \"official duties.\" Neither argument is persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Moreno's theory of the case was that Linde, by pointing his gun directly at Moreno, used excessive force-and that Moreno thus acted in reasonable self-defense from the start. In line with that theory, Moreno requested an instruction observing that \"[a] person has a right to resist an officer who is using excessive force\" to supplement our court's model instruction on general self-defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   district court declined to add that language to the model instruction.

That instruction left Moreno ample room to argue that Linde's use of force was excessive and therefore \"unlawful\"-and that Linde's use of (allegedly) excessive force justified Moreno's attempt to grab the gun. Indeed, Moreno's closing argument made those very points. Thus, even if express language on excessive force might have helped Moreno, and even if such language would have done no harm, its absence did not \"impair [Moreno's] right to have the jury decide whether the government ha[d] proven\" that he had not acted in reasonable self-defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Marguet-Pillado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740368\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/648/1001/#p1006\">\n    648 F.3d at 1009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Contrary to Moreno's contentions,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The problematic instruction in the\n   <em>\n    Span\n   </em>\n   cases was our court's model instruction\n   geared specifically towards the charge of assault on a federal officer.

In the same order, the district court set a clear deadline for the parties to request disclosures mandated by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16 -requiring that such requests be made within two weeks and that the parties respond within seven days of receiving one. As relevant here, Rule 16 requires a defendant to reciprocate government disclosure of expert witnesses by disclosing, \"at the government's request .... a written summary\" of any expert \"testimony that the defendant intends to use\" at trial. Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b)(1)(C)(i).

Then two more months went by, until on April 16-two weeks after the trial date was pushed from April 7 to June 23-Moreno informed the Government at a status conference that an expert named Weaver Barkman \"would be potentially assisting the defense.\" Moreno provided no further information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On June 1-six weeks after the status conference and three weeks before trial-Moreno filed a formal notice that he intended to call Barkman as an expert witness.

The district court denied the request the next day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   On June 18-four months after Moreno's expert disclosures were due and a mere five days before trial-the Government finally received Barkman's expert report. The report indicated that Barkman would testify that the available physical evidence suggested that Linde never holstered his gun, the gun could have slipped out of the holster accidentally, several shots were accidentally fired, and no shot was fired near Linde's head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Government moved to exclude Barkman's testimony. It argued that Moreno's disclosure was \"incredibly untimely\" and, in the alternative, that Barkman's testimony would be inadmissible for evidentiary reasons. The district court granted the Government's motion \"based on [a] lack of timeliness and failure to follow the Court's orders,\" explaining that the \"whole idea\" of setting a deadline was for the parties to \"disclose expert opinions early enough ... so the other side c[ould] have an opportunity to evaluate those opinions and hire his or her own expert prior to trial to meet those opinions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Relying on his constitutional right to present witnesses in his own defense, Moreno argues that the district court abused its discretion in imposing the \"sanction\" of excluding Barkman's expert testimony.

Any instructional error was harmless in light of the record evidence. The evidence introduced at trial, in conjunction with Moreno's post-arrest statements, demonstrates that he possessed the specific intent to permanently deprive the officer of both the gun and the vehicle, and the failure to instruct the jury regarding that intent did not affect the outcome of the district court proceedings. With respect to the officer's gun, Moreno admitted that at the time he attempted to disarm the officer, he intended to gain possession of the gun and take the gun so that the officer could not use it against him. Although Moreno claimed that he went after the gun to avoid being shot, Moreno further\n   admitted that he intended to take the gun from the officer, and throw it out somewhere in the desert so that the officer could not use the gun against him, effectively depriving the officer of the gun. Specifically, Moreno admitted that in going after the officer's gun, he \"wanted to take the gun from [the officer],\" and once he gained possession of the gun, he intended to \"throw it out into the desert\" so that he would not be shot by the officer. The logical implication of Moreno's admission is that in order to avoid being shot, Moreno intended to permanently deprive the officer, and the government, of the gun by taking it and throwing it out in the desert in such a way that the officer would not able to recover it. Moreno's admissions evidence more than an intent to momentarily take the gun from the officer. In fact, Moreno's claimed motive to avoid being shot, when viewed in conjunction with his admitted intent to take the gun and throw it in the desert, establish that he possessed the requisite intent to permanently deprive the officer, and the government, of the gun. The failure to instruct the jury on that element therefore did not have an impact on the ultimate conviction because Moreno freely admitted that he possessed the requisite intent. As such, Moreno failed to establish plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   With respect to the officer's vehicle, Moreno's admissions, when coupled with his actions, once again establish the requisite intent to sustain the attempted robbery conviction. In the post-arrest interview, Moreno admitted that his overall intent in getting in the officer's vehicle was to use the vehicle in his escape. Specifically, at the time he got inside the officer's vehicle, and just before he put the vehicle in gear, Moreno admitted he intended to \"tak[e] off\" in the vehicle in order to \"get to the border.\" Further, following the sheriff's paraphrase of his statement, Moreno agreed that when he initially got in the vehicle, \"his original intentions\" were to \"take off\" and \"just keep going.\" Moreno clarified, he \"was going to go all the way to the border,\" and that he \"was going to take the car and go in it all the way to the border.\" Although ultimately, once he arrived at the border, Moreno intended to \"jump and flee to [Mexico]\" and necessarily \"leave the truck at the port of entry,\" Moreno's admissions establish that at the time he attempted to drive off in the officer's vehicle, he had formed the requisite intent to permanently deprive the officer, and the government, of it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Further, the fact that the overall incident took place near the border does not negate Moreno's admitted intent to deprive the officer and the government of the vehicle. Moreno stated that when he got into the driver's seat of the officer's vehicle, he intended to flee, and that he was \"just [going to] keep going.\" Although Moreno stated that if he had been able to drive off in the vehicle, he would have left the vehicle at the port of entry, that does not negate his original admitted intent to take off in the vehicle, to just \"keep going,\" and to deprive the officer of the use of the vehicle in such a way that the officer would not be able to recover the vehicle or use it to apprehend Moreno. Even though the overall incident took place near the border, the record does not indicate that Moreno intended to relinquish the vehicle at the border, or that he intended for the government to regain possession of the vehicle. Aside from the proximity to the border, there is no indication that Moreno intended for his taking of the vehicle to be only temporary, or for the government to regain possession of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Because the evidence was sufficient to establish the requisite intent, any instructional error was harmless, and certainly did not constitute plain error as to the\n   robbery counts. I join the majority in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   For these reasons, I respectfully dissent, in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In the criminal context, courts have upheld the \"drastic remedy\" of excluding a witness only in cases involving \"willful and blatant\" discovery violations.\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

Our holding that the sanction was impermissible because no willful and blatant discovery violations had occurred was a response to the government's alternative argument that, even if the defendant's attorney did not commit a clear-cut violation of any discovery rule, the witness was properly excluded because defense counsel deliberately failed to divulge the existence of the expert witness to get an advantage at trial.\n    <em>\n     Peters\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531941\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/937/1422/#p1426\">\n     937 F.2d at 1426\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
