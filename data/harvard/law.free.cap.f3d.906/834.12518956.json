The full court was advised of the petition for rehearing en banc. A judge requested a vote on whether to rehear the matter en banc. The matter failed to receive a majority of the votes of the nonrecused active judges in favor of en banc consideration. Fed. R. App. P. 35. The petition for panel rehearing and the petition for rehearing en banc are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case should have been reheard en banc to correct the serious legal errors committed by the panel in evaluating the prejudice that resulted from the glaring ineffective assistance of counsel provided at the penalty phase of a capital trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given his death sentence, Michael Apelt was entitled to appellate review that meaningfully engaged with the significant mitigation evidence developed in state court post-conviction proceedings and that adjudicated each of his claims for relief. As a result of our failure to go en banc, we have left in place an opinion that not only misconstrues well-established Supreme Court precedent about the humanizing effect of mitigation evidence, but also employs dehumanizing language to condemn Apelt in a manner that does not belong in a court of law. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The district court granted habeas relief on one issue, ineffective assistance of counsel (\"IAC\") at sentencing.\n   <em>\n    Apelt v.

Apelt was represented by Michael Villarreal at his trial for the first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder of Cindy Monkman, his wife of a few months. Villarreal also represented Apelt in his first unsuccessful post-conviction relief (\"PCR\") petition. In his second PCR petition, in which he was represented by new counsel, Apelt argued that Villarreal's failure to investigate and present mitigating evidence during sentencing denied Apelt effective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment. In response to the state's appeal, and in support of the district court's judgment, Apelt argued that the Arizona superior court's conclusion that he did not suffer from Villarreal's alleged deficient performance at sentencing was objectively unreasonable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1). In the alternative, he raised a second issue: that the Arizona superior court's decision-reached without an evidentiary hearing despite significant evidence of a childhood filled with pervasive physical and sexual abuse that left Apelt \"mentally disturbed\" and suicidal-was objectively unreasonable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The panel held, correctly, that Villarreal was grossly ineffective for failing to meaningfully investigate any mitigation evidence\n   that could spare his client's life.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Apelt v.

As the district court aptly summarized:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Villareal\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   did not collect records from social service agencies, welfare agencies, doctors, hospitals, or employers. Villareal did not interview potential mitigation witnesses, including Apelt's family members, or consult with any mental health experts. Villareal did not obtain Apelt's readily-available medical health records from the Pinal County jail which described Apelt receiving various medications as well as Apelt's placement on suicide watch. And Villareal did not present a single witness at the sentencing hearing. This was deficient performance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 820. The record shows that Villarreal knew about Apelt's \"difficult childhood\" in Germany and other indicia of psychiatric issues, but did not take the steps necessary to investigate his client's background for sentencing.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 829-31. Villarreal also acknowledged that his failure to investigate mitigation evidence was not a strategic choice.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 830. Thus, the panel rightly agreed with the district court that Villarreal's performance \" 'fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,' even in 1989.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 831.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Given the extent of Villarreal's deficient performance in his representation of Apelt, the panel seriously erred in concluding that Apelt did not suffer prejudice as a result of his counsel's IAC at sentencing.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 831-34. The panel's discussion in the third step of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   analysis\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   gravely misapprehends the role of mitigation evidence in capital cases. The panel's approach cannot be squared with the Supreme Court's longstanding emphasis on the humanizing effect of such evidence-no matter the underlying the offense-for individuals like Apelt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The panel's first error was to conflate legal culpability with moral culpability, thereby minimizing the role of mitigation evidence. To the extent the panel refers to mitigation in its analysis, it is to conclude that the record evidence does not provide sufficient \"explanation\" for Apelt's conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 834. The panel insists: \"none of the proffered mitigating evidence\n   <em>\n    excuses\n   </em>\n   Apelt's callousness, nor does it reduce Apelt's\n   <em>\n    responsibility\n   </em>\n   for planning and carrying out the murder.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (emphasis added). Mitigation evidence, however, is not consigned to such a limited role.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the guilt phase of a capital murder trial, a central question is whether the defendant had the capacity to understand what he was doing when he acted. At the penalty phase, the defendant's mitigation evidence asks\n   <em>\n    in addition\n   </em>\n   whether there is something humanizing about the defendant and his background such that the judge or a member of the jury would be inspired to spare the defendant's life in an act of mercy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kansas v.

Apelt and his brother arrived in the United States from Germany and almost immediately began lying to women, in an attempt to marry a woman for her money. A few months after Apelt met Cindy, they married and applied for life insurance policies at Apelt's insistence. The day after the policies were approved, Apelt and his brother took Cindy to the desert and killed her, leaving stab wounds on her chest and back, bruises on her face and body, and nearly severing her head. After Cindy's death, Apelt acted as though nothing had happened: he went to a restaurant where he claimed not to know of her whereabouts, cried in front of police officers and at Cindy's funeral, and flew to Los Angeles where he paid a homeless man to record a fake threatening voicemail on Cindy's answering machine. After rehashing this evidence of premeditation, the panel concluded-without any reference to the specific mitigation evidence developed in Apelt's second state post-conviction proceeding-that \"[n]othing in the record indicates that any explanation for why Apelt became a monster would have changed the sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 834.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   But Supreme Court precedent is clear: \"the reviewing court must consider all the evidence-the good and the bad-when evaluating prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wong v.

He was extremely undernourished as a child, during which time he suffered daily abuse at the hands of his father, Rudi Sr., a former Nazi and alcoholic. Apelt's father beat his wife and seven children \"with anything he could get his hands on,\" and frequently beat Apelt to the point of unconsciousness. He and a group of men dressed in dark uniforms would tie up Apelt and his brother Rudi in the basement and torture them, beating them on their genitals. Once, when Apelt's friends tattooed a rose on his arm, Rudi Sr. burned it off with a red-hot iron. When Apelt started screaming, his father punched him in the mouth. Apelt still has a scar from the burn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In addition to physical abuse, Rudi Sr. drugged his children with sleeping pills, tranquilizers and alcohol. He chained his children up in the basement, leaving them for multiple days, sometimes without food or water. He also force-fed Apelt's mother sleeping pills, causing permanent damage to her throat, and raped Apelt's sisters when they were young teens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   While there was one reference to a suicide attempt in the second PCR record, the\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   record reveals that Apelt had attempted suicide multiple times growing up. The first time was when Apelt was seven years old, right after he was raped. He mixed pills and alcohol because he feared his father would beat him to death out of shame. Similarly, Apelt cut his right wrist after being raped again at age thirteen. He was hospitalized multiple times and recommended for treatment at a special institution for the seriously mentally disturbed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Apelt suffered from delayed development as well. He was sent to a \"Sonderschule\" or special education school for intellectually disabled children, and his own brother described him as having \"zero IQ\" growing up.
