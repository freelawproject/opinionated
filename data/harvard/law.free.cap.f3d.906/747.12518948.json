(collectively, \"Defendants\") enrolled consumers in a membership rewards program without their consent and then mishandled their billing information. The settlement makes available $3.5 million to pay settlement administration costs and refund class members' enrollment fees, with any remaining funds designated for three\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   beneficiaries. The settlement also provides that each class member will receive a $20 credit that may be used to purchase additional products from Defendants. It further anticipates that class counsel will receive $8.7 million in attorney's fees. We vacate the fee award because the district court failed to treat the credits as coupons under the Class Action Fairness Act (\"CAFA\") when calculating that award. We otherwise affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Provide Commerce, Inc. (\"Provide\") operates online businesses that sell flowers, chocolates, fruit baskets, and other similar items. According to the Complaint, Plaintiff Josue Romero and seven other class representatives (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") purchased items from a Provide business and were then presented with a pop-up advertisement for $15 off another item from the same website.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Clicking the pop-up directed Plaintiffs to a different website and instructed them to enter their contact information and click \"Accept.\" This process (irrespective of whether Plaintiffs entered their contact information or clicked \"Accept\") enrolled Plaintiffs in Provide's membership rewards program. Provide then transmitted Plaintiffs' payment information to a separate company, Regent Group, Inc. (\"Regent\"), which proceeded to charge Plaintiffs a $1.95 activation fee and a recurring $14.95 monthly membership fee. Plaintiffs did not consent to joining the rewards program or, by extension, to having their data transferred to Regent. Plaintiffs also never received \"the promised\n   coupons, gift codes, or any other savings benefits.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2009, Plaintiffs filed a putative class action against Defendants in the Southern District of California, alleging violations of various state laws arising from Defendants' operation of their membership rewards program. After more than two years of litigation, including extensive discovery and mediation, the parties agreed to settle. The proposed settlement provided class members with two forms of relief: monetary reimbursement of membership fees upon submission of a claim and a $20 credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The settlement established a $12.5 million fund from which Defendants would pay up to $8.7 million in attorney's fees; $80,000 in enhancement awards to the named plaintiffs; and $200,000 in litigation costs. The approximately $3.5 million remaining would be available to fund the settlement's administration costs and to reimburse class members for their membership fees \"on a pro rata basis up to the full amount owed.\" To receive such a refund, class members had to submit a claim affirming that they had neither intended to enroll in the program nor used any program benefits other than the initial discount code. After the refunds were issued, any remaining funds were to be distributed as a\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   award to San Diego State University, the University of California at San Diego, and the University of San Diego School of Law \"for a chair, professorship, fellowship, lectureship, seminar series or similar funding, gift, or donation program ... regarding internet privacy or internet data security.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The settlement also directed Defendants to email every class member a $20 credit that could be used to purchase items on Defendants' websites. Unlike with the refund, class members were not required to submit a claim to receive the credit. The credits would be fully transferable, but they would include a series of restrictions, including that they would expire one year after their distribution date and could not be used in the lead-up to Christmas, Valentine's Day, or Mother's Day. The credits also could not be used for same-day orders, nor could they be combined with other promotions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In June 2012, the district court preliminarily approved the settlement. The parties informed the court that the class contained approximately 1.3 million consumers who had been enrolled in the rewards program at some point since August 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Class members were then notified of the settlement and given a 135-day period to request a refund, during which only about 3,000 class members did so. Their submitted claims requested a total of $225,000 in cash refunds, leaving approximately $3 million of the settlement's cash fund to be distributed to the\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   beneficiaries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Separately, class counsel moved for $8.7 million in fees and $200,000 in costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In January 2013, the district court held a final settlement approval hearing at which class member Brian Perryman (\"Objector\") objected to the settlement. He argued that the attorney's fee award did not comply with CAFA's requirements for settlements awarding coupons and that the\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   award was improper. The court rejected these objections and issued a final\n   order approving both the settlement and class counsel's accompanying fee request. The district court's order placed the full settlement value at $38 million, including $12.5 million for the cash fund and $25.5 million for the $20 credits to be distributed to the approximately 1.3 million class members. Objector appealed, and we vacated and remanded for further proceedings in light of our decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Online DVD-Rental Antitrust Litigation\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Online DVD\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011310\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/934/\">\n    779 F.3d 934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2015), which addressed CAFA's coupon settlement provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On remand, the district court determined that, under\n   <em>\n    In re Online DVD\n   </em>\n   , the credits should not be construed as coupons, and that it was therefore unnecessary to apply CAFA's requirements for coupon settlements. In the court's view, it was particularly significant that class members had, by virtue of their inclusion in the class, shown \"an interest in getting $15.00 off their next purchase\" from Defendants. Considering this factor in conjunction with the holding of\n   <em>\n    In re Online DVD\n   </em>\n   , the court concluded the \"settlement was not a coupon settlement subject to the strictures of section 1712.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Again using $38 million as the total value of the settlement, the court then approved the fee award based on both percentage-of-recovery and lodestar calculations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the percentage-of-recovery method, the court concluded that an $8.7 million attorney's fee award was reasonable because it represented 23% of the settlement value-below the 25% benchmark typically used in our circuit. The court then cross-checked the reasonableness of the award using the lodestar method. Based on declarations reciting the hours spent by class counsel on this case and their hourly rates, class counsel's fees came to approximately $4.3 million. The court decided that class counsel's rates and hours were reasonable and, further, that a multiplier of two-necessary for the lodestar figure to match the $8.7 million awarded under the settlement-was appropriate. As a result, the court reinstated its prior approval of the settlement and the fee award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Objector has appealed again to challenge the attorney's fee and\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   awards. With respect to the fee award, he argues that the district court erred by failing to comply with CAFA's requirements for coupon settlements and, relatedly, that the settlement provides class counsel with a disproportionate share of the recovery. With respect to the\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   award, he contends that\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   relief is not appropriate here and that, even if it were, the district court should have rejected the particular\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   beneficiaries chosen in the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We address Objector's arguments in turn. We hold that his challenge to the attorney's fee award succeeds because the district court failed to treat the $20 credits as coupons under CAFA, but we reject his\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   CAFA imposes restrictions on attorney's fee awards for class action settlements\n   that provide class members relief in the form of coupons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201712\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Congress targeted such settlements for heightened scrutiny out of a concern that the full value of coupons was being used to support large awards of attorney's fees regardless of whether class members had any interest in using the coupons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 109-14, at 15-20 (2005),\n   <em>\n    reprinted in\n   </em>\n   2005 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3, 15-20 (listing examples of settlements \"in which most-if not all-of the monetary benefits went to the class counsel, rather than the class members those attorneys were supposed to be representing\"). More specifically, Congress was concerned that when coupons that class members would not use were factored into the value of a settlement, they inflated the nominal size of a settlement fund without a concomitant increase in the actual value of relief for the class.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201712\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201712\">\n    at 29-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And when a court relied on the size of such a settlement fund to calculate attorney's fees, this inflation dramatically increased the size of the fee award-allowing class counsel to reap the lion's share of the benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201712\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   To avoid this result, CAFA requires district courts to consider the value of only those coupons \"that were actually redeemed\" when calculating the relief awarded to a class.\n   <em>\n    In re Online DVD\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011310\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/934/\">\n    779 F.3d 934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 950 (9th Cir. 2015) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201712\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Doing so ensures that class counsel benefit only from coupons that provide actual relief to the class, lessening the incentive to seek an award of coupons that class members have little interest in using-either because they might not want to conduct more business with defendants, or because the coupons are too small to make it worth their while.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Sw. Airlines Voucher Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341065\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/701/#p706\">\n    799 F.3d 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 706 (7th Cir. 2015) (\"The potential for abuse is greatest when the coupons have value only if a class member is willing to do business again with the defendant who has injured her in some way, when the coupons have modest value compared to the new purchase for which they must be used, and when the coupons expire soon, are not transferable, and/or cannot be aggregated.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   CAFA, however, provides no definition of \"coupon,\" so courts have been left to define that term on their own, informed by \u00a7 1712 's animating purpose of preventing settlements that award excessive fees while leaving class members with \"nothing more than promotional coupons to purchase more products from the defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Online DVD\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011310\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/934/\">\n    779 F.3d at 950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting S. Rep. No. 109-14, at 15).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    In re Online DVD\n   </em>\n   , we outlined three factors to guide this inquiry: (1) whether class members have \"to hand over more of their own money before they can take advantage of\" a credit, (2) whether the credit is valid only \"for select products or services,\" and (3) how much flexibility the credit provides, including whether it expires or is freely transferrable.\n   <em>\n    In re Online DVD\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011310\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/934/\">\n    779 F.3d at 951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying these factors, we held that a $12 gift card to Walmart, awarded as part of a settlement resolving antitrust claims relating to its DVD rentals and sales, did not qualify as a coupon.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011310\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/934/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011310\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/934/\">\n    at 951-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We first explained that a \"class member need not spend any of his or her\n   own money\" to use the gift card given Walmart's extensive inventory of low-cost products.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011310\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/934/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011310\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/934/\">\n    at 951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Relatedly, the gift card provided \"not merely the ability to purchase an entire product as opposed to simply reducing the purchase price, but also the ability to purchase one of many different types of products,\" including numerous products unrelated to DVDs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011310\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/934/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011310\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/934/\">\n    at 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The gift cards also did not expire and were freely transferable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011310\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/934/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011310\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/934/\">\n    at 951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, class members could receive $12 in cash instead of the $12 gift card, if they made a request by mail.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011310\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/934/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011310\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/934/\">\n    at 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In light of all these factors giving class members significantly more flexibility than typical coupons, we held that the gift cards were not coupons within the meaning of CAFA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011310\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/934/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011310\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/934/\">\n    at 951-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Here, the district court relied on an additional factor not present in\n   <em>\n    In re Online DVD\n   </em>\n   . It held that the credits should not be construed as coupons in part because it concluded that this settlement was \"stronger than\" the settlement in\n   <em>\n    In re Online DVD\n   </em>\n   in terms of how closely the relief matched class members' alleged injury. In this case, class members failed to receive a promised credit or received a credit but on terms they had not accepted, and the settlement provided a replacement credit without the unwanted enrollment in its rewards program. But the district court's inclusion of this factor conflated the coupon analysis with whether the settlement was fair and reasonable. Confronting a similar argument in\n   <em>\n    In re Southwest Airlines Voucher Litigation\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit held that drink vouchers awarded to settle claims that Southwest improperly stopped accepting certain in-flight drink vouchers were coupons under CAFA.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341065\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/701/#p706\">\n    799 F.3d at 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even though class members would receive \"essentially complete relief\" by obtaining the new drink vouchers to replace their invalidated ones,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341065\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/701/#p706\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341065\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/701/#p706\">\n    at 711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the court explained that this equivalence bore on the fairness of the settlement-not on whether the vouchers were coupons under CAFA,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341065\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/701/#p706\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341065\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/701/#p706\">\n    at 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Thus, even assuming the district court was correct that \"this settlement was specifically tailored to the harm suffered by the class members and the interest they had in receiving\" a discount off a future purchase from Defendants' websites, it does not follow that the full face value of all the $20 credits should be used when evaluating the propriety of the fee award.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regardless of the substance of the underlying claim or injury, CAFA prevents settling parties from valuing coupons at face value without accounting for their redemption rate. Accordingly, the district court erred by incorporating an improper factor into its analysis of whether the credit was a coupon under CAFA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Enyart\n   </em>\n   , 630 F.3d at 1159 (\"If the [district] court failed to [identify the correct legal rule], we must conclude it abused its discretion.\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We hold that, applying the correct legal standard, the only logical conclusion is that they are.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   To begin, the credits are categorically\n   different from the Walmart gift cards. Defendants are decidedly not \"giant ... retailer[s]\" in the mold of Walmart or other similar stores,\n   <em>\n    In re Online DVD\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011310\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/934/\">\n    779 F.3d at 951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and class members can only use the credits to purchase items from a limited universe of products: flowers, chocolates, and other similar gifts.

But because the $38 million figure did not account for the redemption rate of the credits, it is unclear whether the fee award is in fact a reasonable percentage of the settlement fund. Absent the redemption information, we cannot approve the district court's percentage-of-recovery evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The settling parties contend that the award can nevertheless be upheld based on the district court's lodestar calculation. Under \u00a7 1712(b)(1), which relates to \"[o]ther attorney's fee awards\" in settlements involving coupons, if \"a portion of the recovery of the coupons is not used to determine the attorney's fee to be paid to class counsel, any attorney's fee award\n   shall be based upon the amount of time class counsel reasonably expended working on the action.\" Section 1712(b)(2) further provides that \"[n]othing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit application of a lodestar with a multiplier method of determining attorney's fees.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   CAFA thus allows courts to use the lodestar approach to determine any portion of attorney's fees not attributable to coupons in mixed settlements that award both coupons and non-coupon relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    In re HP Inkjet Printer Litigation\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re HP\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3570614\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/1173/\">\n    716 F.3d 1173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2013), we explained that CAFA does not, however, permit a district court to approximate \"the ultimate value of [a] settlement, and then award[ ] fees in exchange for obtaining coupon relief without considering the redemption value of the coupons.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3570614\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/1173/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3570614\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/1173/\">\n    at 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In particular, in a mixed settlement, a district court may use the lodestar approach provided that it does so without reference to the dollar value of the settlement fund-or, of course, it may reference the dollar value of the settlement fund if it accounts for the redemption rate of the coupons in calculating that dollar value. We held that the district court in\n   <em>\n    In re HP\n   </em>\n   had erred when it set the lodestar fee award in reference to \"the 'ultimate value' of th[e] settlement\"-which, as calculated there, included the face value of the coupons not adjusted by their redemption rate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3570614\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/1173/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Here, the district court similarly went astray when it reverse-engineered the lodestar multiplier using a value of the settlement that included the full face value of all the $20 coupons. The court started with a lodestar fee of $4.3 million, calculated based solely on class counsel's billing rates and hours worked. But the court then worked backward from class counsel's proposed $8.7 million fee award, which the court had already deemed appropriate as a percentage of the total dollar value of the settlement fund. To do so, the court applied a multiplier of 2.1 to match the lodestar fee with the percentage-of-recovery fee. Thus, although the $4.3 million figure was derived independently of any specific consideration of the coupons, it lost this independence when the district court used a multiplier to match the lodestar fee to the percentage-of-recovery fee-which was, by definition, a percentage of the full value of the settlement, including the face value of the coupons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The value of the coupon relief\n   therefore impermissibly informed the district court's approval of the lodestar fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Accordingly, the attorney's fee award must be vacated. On remand, the award should be recalculated in a manner that treats the $20 credits as coupons under CAFA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because we hold that the fee award must be recalculated, we need not address Objector's separate argument that the settlement disproportionately benefits class counsel at the expense of the class.

The settlement agreement here provides for any unclaimed funds to be distributed to San Diego State University, the University of California at San Diego, and the University of San Diego School of Law to support scholarship in the area of internet privacy and data security. Objector argues that the approximately $3 million remaining in the settlement fund should have been distributed to the class instead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We conclude that it was reasonable for the district court to approve\n   the use of a\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   distribution. The availability of\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   as a mechanism to distribute unclaimed funds rests on the premise that class action settlements will sometimes have just that-unclaimed funds. A settlement is not fatally flawed solely because class members did not deplete the entirety of the settlement fund. If it were,\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   would not exist. Objector suggests that the parties should have spent more on supplemental notice and outreach to non-claimants. But that contention could be made about any class action with remaining funds, and Objector has not identified any flaws in the notice procedure used in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Nor was it an abuse of discretion for the district court to reject Objector's two proposed alternatives for distributing the remaining funds. Objector first suggests that the settlement should have distributed the remaining funds to the existing claimants. But the district court was under no obligation to adopt a distribution approach that might overcompensate claimants, all of whom will already be fully reimbursed for the money they lost through the rewards program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Objector alternatively suggests that the remaining funds should have been distributed pro rata to non-claimant class members, whom Defendants will have to identify to distribute the coupons. It might be technically feasible to distribute the funds in this manner. But given that the existing fund contains approximately $3 million, and that there are over a million non-claimants, each non-claimant's recovery would be \"\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   ,\"\n   <em>\n    Lane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5863519\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/811/#p819\">\n    696 F.3d at 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , particularly once the costs of distribution are deducted. Even if the district court substantially reduces the attorney's fee award, the amount each non-claimant might receive compared to the administrative costs of distribution prevents Objector from showing that the parties' resort to\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   was inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The recipients of\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   funding should be selected in light of \"the objectives of the underlying statute(s)\" and \"the interests of the silent class members.\"\n   <em>\n    Nachshin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5880264,3853817\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/663/1034/\">\n    663 F.3d at 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The parties' settlement agreement expressly does not depend on approval of the fee award, and it provides that any decrease in the award \"shall only serve to increase\" the funds distributed to class members, as well as to the\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   beneficiaries if necessary. Furthermore, because\n   the claims period is now closed, we know that there are ample funds available to fully satisfy all submitted claims for reimbursement. Changing the size of the fee award would not affect those reimbursements. Class members will similarly receive the $20 coupons regardless of the size of the fee award. From class members' perspective, the only thing that reducing the fee award would do is to increase the amount ultimately paid to the\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   recipients. We can therefore be confident that class members would not have made different decisions had they known that the fee award would be recalculated, and also that the district court would not have made a different approval decision as to whether the settlement was fair, reasonable, and adequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Moreover, other than the challenges to the\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   award that we rejected above, Objector cabined his arguments on appeal to attacks on the fee award. We are therefore not presented here with a general challenge to the fairness of the settlement under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e)(2). Absent an explanation of why the settlement as a whole does not pass muster, we will not assume that we must automatically reverse the settlement in conjunction with vacating the fee award.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we\n   <strong>\n    VACATE\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   the award of attorney's fees but otherwise\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   approval of the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    We draw the background facts from Plaintiffs' Complaint.
