Playpen operated on an anonymous network known as \"The Onion Router\" or \"Tor\". To use Tor, the user must download and install the network software on his computer. Tor then allows the user to visit any website without revealing the IP address,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   geographic location, or other identifying information of the user's computer by using a network of relay computers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Tor also allows users to access \"hidden services,\" which are websites that are accessible only through the Tor network and are not accessible publicly. A hidden-service website hosted on the Tor network does not reveal its location; a Tor user can access the hidden-service website without knowing the location of its server and without its knowing the user's location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Playpen operated as a hidden-service website and required users to log in with a username and password to access its discussion forums, private messaging services, and images of child pornography. After determining that Playpen was hosted on servers located in Lenoir, North Carolina, the FBI obtained and executed a valid search warrant in the Western District of North Carolina in January 2015, and seized the Playpen servers. The FBI removed the servers to its facility in Newington, Virginia. Because Tor conceals its users' locations and IP addresses, additional investigation was required to identify Playpen users. The FBI then operated the Playpen website from a government-controlled server in Newington in the Eastern District of Virginia, from which it obtained a valid court order authorizing it to intercept electronic communications sent and received by the site's administrators and users.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The FBI later obtained a warrant from a United States magistrate judge in the Eastern District of Virginia on February 20, 2015, authorizing searches for thirty days using what is known as a Network Investigative Technique (\"NIT\"). Specifically, such \"NIT warrant\" authorized the search of all \"activating\" computers-that is, those of any website visitor,\n   <em>\n    wherever located\n   </em>\n   , who logged into Playpen with a username and password.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The NIT technology is computer code consisting of a set of instructions. When a person logged into the Playpen site, the NIT caused instructions to be sent to his computer, which in turn caused the computer to respond to the government-controlled server with seven pieces of identifying information, including its IP address. The NIT mechanism allowed the FBI, while controlling the website from within the Eastern District of Virginia, to discover identifying information about activating computers, even though Playpen operated on the Tor network.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 1, 2015, a person logged into Playpen under the username \"askjeff.\" The NIT instructions were sent to askjeff's computer, which revealed its IP address through its response to the government-controlled server. The computer response also revealed that askjeff had been actively logged into Playpen for more than thirty-two hours since September 2014 and had accessed child pornography. The FBI traced the IP address to an internet service provider (\"ISP\"), Comcast Corporation, which was served with an administrative subpoena requesting information about the user assigned to the IP address. The IP address turned out to be associated with a computer at the San Mateo, California, home of Bryan Henderson's grandmother, with whom Henderson lived. A local federal magistrate judge in the Northern District of California issued a warrant to search the home, where the FBI then discovered thousands of images and hundreds of videos depicting child pornography\n   on Henderson's computer and hard drives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Henderson was indicted in the Northern District of California on charges of receipt and possession of child pornography, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), (a)(4)(B), and (b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Henderson moved to suppress all evidence, including the evidence seized at his grandmother's home in California, obtained pursuant to the \"NIT warrant\" issued by the Eastern District of Virginia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court denied Henderson's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Henderson then pled guilty to receipt of child pornography, but expressly reserved the right to appeal the district court's denial of his motion to suppress. Henderson was sentenced to sixty months in prison and a ten-year term of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Henderson timely appealed, challenging the denial of his motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Henderson argues that the motion to suppress should have been granted because the NIT warrant was issued in violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(b), which authorizes magistrate judges to issue warrants subject to certain requirements. To prevail on his argument, Henderson must show both that the NIT warrant\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   violate Rule 41(b) and that suppression is the appropriate remedy for such violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Henderson urges that no provision within Rule 41(b) authorizes a magistrate judge to issue the NIT warrant to search computers located outside of her district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In general, Rule 41(b) permits \"a magistrate judge with authority in the district ... to issue a warrant to search for and seize a person or property\n   <em>\n    located within the district\n   </em>\n   .\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(b)(1) (emphasis added). Judge Orrick concluded that the NIT warrant indeed violated Rule 41(b), because it was obtained in the Eastern District of Virginia, yet it authorized a search of computers located outside of that district.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The government does not dispute that the NIT warrant exceeded the general territorial scope identified in Rule 41(b)(1) by authorizing a search of an \"activating computer\" in California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   However, the government counters that the NIT warrant was nonetheless authorized under Rule 41(b)(4)'s specific provision for tracking devices, which permits \"a magistrate judge with authority in the district ... to issue a warrant to install within the district a tracking device ... to\n   track the movement of a person or property located within the district, outside the district, or both.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(b)(4). Rule 41 defines a \"tracking device\" as \"an electronic or mechanical device which permits the tracking of the movement of a person or object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(a)(2)(E) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203117\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The government contends that Henderson's computer made a \"virtual trip\" to the government server in the Eastern District of Virginia when he logged into the Playpen website. According to the government, his computer then \"brought\" the NIT instructions, along with the usual Playpen website content, back with it from the government server to his computer's physical location in California. The NIT instructions then caused identifying location information to be transmitted back to the government, just like a beeper or other tracking device would.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We are not persuaded by the government's assertions. The NIT instructions did not actually \"track the movement of a person or property,\" as required by the tracking-device provision. Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(b)(4). Rather, the NIT mechanism was simply a set of computer instructions that forced activating computers, regardless of their location, to send certain information to the government-controlled server in Virginia. Users' computers did not physically travel to Virginia, and the information they relayed did not reveal the physical location of any person or property, unlike a beeper attached to a vehicle. The \"seized information (mainly the IP address) assisted the FBI in identifying a user, [but] it provided no information as to the computer's or user's precise and contemporary physical location.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Werdene\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516068\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/204/#p212\">\n    883 F.3d 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 212 (3d Cir. 2018). Indeed, the only two federal courts of appeals to consider the question have rejected the government's very argument. As the Eighth Circuit has recognized, \"the plain language of Rule 41 and the statutory definition of 'tracking device' do not ... support so broad a reading as to encompass the mechanism of the NIT used in this case.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Horton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276073\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/1041/#p1048\">\n    863 F.3d 1041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1048 (8th Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    accord.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Werdene\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516068\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/204/#p212\">\n    883 F.3d at 211-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Interestingly, Rule 41(b) was amended on December 1, 2016-after the issuance of the NIT warrant here-to authorize magistrate judges to issue warrants to search computers located outside their district if \"the district where the media or information is located has been concealed through technological means.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(b)(6). As our sister circuits have recognized, such amendment plainly seems to \"authorize[ ] warrants such as the NIT warrant here.\"\n   <em>\n    Werdene\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516068\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/204/#p212\">\n    883 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   206 n.2 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Horton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276073\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/1041/#p1048\">\n    863 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1047 n.2 (noting that Rule \"41(b)(6) was added to provide an additional exception to the magistrate's jurisdictional limitation by allowing warrants for programs like the NIT\"). The fact that Rule 41 was amended to authorize specifically these sorts of warrants further supports the notion that Rule 41(b) did not previously do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In sum, the NIT mechanism is not a \"tracking device\" within the meaning of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(b)(4), and the government does not argue that any other provision in Rule 41(b) applies. We are satisfied that the NIT warrant violated Rule 41(b) by authorizing a search outside of the issuing magistrate judge's territorial authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   But does a warrant issued in violation of Rule 41(b) compel suppression of evidence? Not necessarily.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Only certain Rule 41 violations justify suppression. The suppression of evidence is \"a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment\n   rights generally through its deterrent effect, rather than a personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To determine whether suppression is justified, we must first decide whether the Rule 41(b) violation is a \"fundamental error[ ]\" or a \"mere technical error[ ].\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Fundamental errors are those that \"result in ... constitutional violations,\" and they generally\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   require suppression, \"unless the officers can show objective good faith reliance as required by\" the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule under the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526960,10526883\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/966/1277/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   By contrast, non-fundamental, merely technical errors require suppression only if the defendant can show either that (1) he was prejudiced by the error, or (2) there is evidence of \"deliberate disregard of the rule.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526960,10526883\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/966/1277/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We need not consider these additional factors if we determine that the Rule 41 violation was indeed fundamental.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Henderson contends that the violation here was fundamental. Specifically, he argues that the NIT warrant violated the Fourth Amendment because, by issuing the warrant in violation of Rule 41(b), the magistrate judge acted beyond her constitutional authority. The government disagrees, characterizing Rule 41(b) as merely a technical \"venue provision\" that does not implicate the scope of a magistrate judge's underlying authority or the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We agree with Henderson that Rule 41(b) is not merely a technical venue rule, but rather is essential to the magistrate judge's authority to act in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Federal magistrate judges \"are creatures of statute.\"\n   <em>\n    NLRB v.

In turn, Rule 41(b) has been asserted as the sole source of the magistrate judge's purported authority to issue the NIT warrant in this case. But, as we have explained, in issuing such warrant, the magistrate judge in fact\n   <em>\n    exceeded\n   </em>\n   the bounds of the authority conferred on magistrate judges under Rule 41(b). Thus, such rule plainly does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   in fact confer on the magistrate judge the authority to issue a warrant like the NIT warrant. Without any other source of law that purports to authorize the action of the magistrate judge here, the magistrate judge therefore exceeded the scope of her authority and her jurisdiction as defined under \u00a7 636.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Having concluded that the magistrate judge issued a warrant in excess of her jurisdictional authority to do so, we next must determine whether conducting a search pursuant to such a warrant violates the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Negrete-Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526960,10526883\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/966/1277/\">\n    966 F.2d at 1283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that fundamental Rule 41 violations are those that result in constitutional violations).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   U.S. Const. amend.

Application of the good faith exception does not depend on the existence of a warrant, but on the executing officers'\n   <em>\n    objectively reasonable belief\n   </em>\n   that there was a valid warrant. \"The exclusionary rule was crafted to curb police rather than judicial misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Herring\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679252\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/135/#p140\">\n    555 U.S. at 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679252\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/135/#p140\">\n    129 S.Ct. 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Therefore, application of the good faith exception is permitted where a warrant is void because of a magistrate judge's jurisdictional violation, so long as the executing officers had an objectively reasonable belief that the warrant was valid.

Further, Henderson argues that suppression of the evidence would deter similarly improper conduct in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Prior to the Rule 41(b)(6) addition, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure did not directly address a NIT-type of warrant.

In fact, although every circuit court that has addressed the question has found that the NIT warrant violated Rule 41, \"a number of district courts have ruled [it] to be facially valid.\"\n   <em>\n    Horton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276073\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/1041/#p1048\">\n    863 F.3d at 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Henderson's argument that the government acted in bad faith in seeking the warrant is not compelling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Furthermore, there is no evidence that the officers executing the NIT warrant acted in bad faith. \"To the extent that a mistake was made in issuing the warrant, it was made by the magistrate judge, not by the executing officers.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Henderson correctly notes that officers' reliance on a warrant is not objectively reasonable when the warrant is \"so facially deficient-i.e., in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seized-that the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid.\"\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/#p906\">\n    468 U.S. at 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/#p906\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    accord.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, the NIT warrant sufficiently described the \"place\" to be searched-any \"activating computer\"-and specified the seven pieces of identifying information-including the computer's IP address-that would be seized, and presented no other facial deficiency that rendered the officers' reliance unreasonable.
