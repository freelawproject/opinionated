Possibly the word \u201cintoxicating\u201d was' inadvertently omitted by the clerk in copying the indictment into the transcript; but, the record before us brings forward a fatally defective indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">It is observed that the court\u2019s charge advised the jury that appellant was charged by indictment with the offense of unlawfully possessing intoxicating liquor for the purpose of sale.

The verdict of the jury was clearly not responsive to the charge contained in the indictment and the issues submitted in the charge of the court. Persons v. State, 3 Tex. Ct.
