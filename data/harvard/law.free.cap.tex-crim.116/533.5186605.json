State, 92 Tex. Crim. Rep. 38, 241 S. W. 1020. Judge Lattimore, speaking for the Court, after review of the authorities on this subject and after quoting Art. 39, now 34, of the Penal Code (1925), as follows: \u201cNo act done in a state of insanity can be punished as an offense. No person who becomes insane after he committed an offense shall be tried for the same while in such condition. - No person who becomes insane after he is found guilty shall he punished for the offense while in such condition,\u201d uses the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">\u201cAttention is called to the second paragraph of said article. Our conclusion regarding this is that it contemplates a trial and determination, if desired by the accused, of the issue of present insanity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>separate from and prior to the trial for the commission of the offense with which he is charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">After quoting authorities he continues:</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\u201cWe do not believe the purpose evident from the language of the article quoted can be met by a trial of present insanity at the same time and before the same jury as a trial of the issue of guilty of the crime charged. To try the prisoner for present insanity and for the crime charged in one and the same proceeding would not seem to be in conformity with a statute which provides that he shall not be tried for the offense while he is insane. Not only is the proceeding of such dual trial not according to the statute, but it would be manifestly confusing to the jury and unfair to the accused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Again in a more recent case, Pickett v. State, 22 S. W. (2nd) 136, this Court had occasion to pass upon this proposition, and in reversing the case the Court used this language:</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">\u201cAppellant in this case was entitled to a separate trial upon the issue of whether he was so insane at the time of the trial as to render him mentally incompetent to make a rational defense, and its refusal was reversible error. This is a different matter altogether from defense of insanity alleged to exist at the time of the commission of the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">Therefore, it will be seen that it is a well settled proposition of law in this State that under Art. 34 of the Penal Code (1925) that the appellant was entitled to a trial, if desired by him, of the issue of present insanity, separate from and prior to the trial for the commission of the offense for which he was charged in the indictment presented against him, and the failure to so give him said trial is reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">Because of the above error, the judgment is reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and apprqved by the Cqurt.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
