The record does not otherwise show the result of the trial. The appeal to the County Court resulted in a verdict of conviction with penalty assessed at a fine of $35.00. The assessed penalty being below $100.00, this court has no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. See C. C. P., 1925, Art. 53; Branch\u2019s Ann. Tex. P. C., p. 220, sec. 409; Vernon\u2019s Ann. Tex.

We regret our lack of jurisdiction, but must follow the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
