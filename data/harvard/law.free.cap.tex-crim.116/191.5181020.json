Art. 818, C. C. P. (1925) requires that it be approved by both the sheriff and the trial judge. For authorities see Note 1, under said article in Vernon\u2019s Ann. Tex. C. C. P., Vol. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">The bills of exception seem defective in not setting out the search warrant and affidavit therefor, but we do not discuss them as the case is not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">If appellant desires to do so he will have fifteen days from this date to file proper bond and present a record thereof to this court in connection with motion to reinstate the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-13\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b220-14\">ON MOTION TO REINSTATE.</p>\n<author id=\"b220-15\">CHRISTIAN, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Ac5\">The appeal was dismissed at a former day of the term because of an insufficient appeal bond.

The case is now considered on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-19\">Operating under a search warrant, officers discovered a complete still,- a quantity of whisky and mash in a house occupied by appellant. The still was hot and in condition to manufacture whisky.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-20\">The testimony touching the result of the search was objected to by appellant on the ground that the affidavit for the search war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>rant was made by only one person and that the place searched was his private residence. The bills of exception fail to set out the affidavit in substance or in detail. It is stated, as a ground of objection, that the affidavit was made by one person and that the place searched was appellant\u2019s private residence. The statement of the ground of objection is not a certificate of the trial judge that the facts which formed the basis of the objection were true. It merely shows that such an objection was made. Branch\u2019s Annotated Penal Code, Section 209; Jenkins v. State, 24 S. W. (2d) 1092; Fisher v. State, 1 S. W. (2d) 301; Buchanan v. State, 298 S. W. 569; Coleman v. State, 10 S. W. (2d) 559. The bill of exception fails to show that the ruling of the trial court was incorrect, and we must indulge the legal presumption that the testimony was properly admitted. Buchanan v. State, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\u2022The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b221-8\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b221-9\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AWuf\">This is a companion case to that of Harlan v. State, No. 13,495, this day decided. The legal questions are identical. Upon the authority of that case, the motion for rehearing in the present instance is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">\n<em>Overuled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">Hawkins, J., absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
