Special charges were prepared and submitted to the trial court before his charge was read to the jury covering both issues, but were refused by the Court, and appellant also excepted to the failure of the Court to so charge in his exceptions to said charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The evidence shows that at the time of the homicide that both appellant and deceased were boys of about seventeen years of age and that appellant cut the deceased with an ordinary pocket knife, and that prior to said killing there had been no trouble or difficulty between them and in fact they were only slightly acquainted. The testimony of the appellant and that of the witness, Trinidad, set out above, in our opinion, together with the other facts and circumstances in evidence, raised the issue of lack of intent to kill and as under our present statute an intent to kill is an essential ingredient of the crime of murder, therefore when said issue is raised by the evidence, an instruction on aggravated assault is called for, and a failure to instruct on that issue in this case is in our opinion reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">In the case of Bookman v. State, 16 S. W. (2nd) 125, on motion for rehearing, Judge Hawkins in passing upon the question of the appellant\u2019s objection in that case to the charge of the Court because it omitted any instruction on the law of aggravated assault, held the following to be the rule:</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">\u201cThe question that has given us most concern was appellant\u2019s objection to the charge because it omitted any instruction on the law of aggravated assault. It has been especially troublesome in view of the express repeal by the Legislature of articles-1261, 1262, 1263, and 1264 of the Penal Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">Then he quotes said articles and in further passing upon the issue, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">\u201cIf the state\u2019s evidence is to be believed, there is no doubt but that the injuries on deceased were inflicted in a most cruel manner and under circumstances which showed an evil and cruel disposition. It is difficult to bring ourselves to believe that the Legislature contemplated the full effect of the repeal of said articles, but only had in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>mind their relation to the crime of \u2018manslaughter\u2019 which was eliminated by the same act of the legislature. Appellant denied the acts of violence, and at the same time asserted that he never at any time intended to kill his wife. There is no question but that the violence was committed by the use of means not in their nature ordinarily calculated to produce death. By the repeal of the articles in question the trial court was precluded from giving specific instructions thereunder, and likewise this court can no longer give them application. We 'must, therefore, the best we can, in the absence of the repealed articles, construe our present definition of murder, which is as follows: \u2018Whoever shall voluntarily kill any person within this State shall be guilty of murder. Murder shall be distinguished from every other species of homicide by the absence of circumstances which reduce the offence to negligent homicide or which excuse or justify the killing. Article 1256, P. C.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">\u201cIntent to kill being absent, although death results, what offense, if any, would accused be guilty of? If the evidence raise the issue of lack of intent to kill, should the court instruct on aggravated assault? These questions were rather exhaustively considered in the recent case of Miller v. State, (Tex. Cr. App.), 13 S. W. (2d), 865, and the conclusion reached that under our present statute an intent to kill was an essential ingredient of the crime of murder, and that, when the issue was raised that such intent was wanting, an instruction on aggravated assault was called for. It follows that the failure of the court to instruct upon that issue in the present case was an omission which demands a reversal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">On the issue as shown by appellant\u2019s bills of exception Nos. 1 and 2 as to the alleged improper argument of the Assistant District Attorney, while delivering the closing argument to the jury in this case, as shown by the qualification to both of said bills of exception, the Assistant District Attorney in his closing argument used the following argument:</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">\u201cMr. Coopwood tells you that in his opinion that there is only one verdict that you can return in this case and that a verdict of not guilty, I want to say to you that in my opinion the fact that the defendant has filed a plea asking for a suspended sentence is an admission on his part that he is guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The qualifications to both bills show that the defendant at the time in open court objected to said argument because the same was improper and calculated to prejudice the rights of the defendant, and that the Court at the time admonished counsel to desist from any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>such argument and instructed the jury orally that the argument was improper and that in their deliberations they must not consider the same for any purpose. This argument has been held by this Court to be manifestly improper and reversible error where the Court has not promptly corrected same. Parker v. State, 232 S. W. 497; Tamaya v. State, 230 S. W. 146; Kemp v. State, 256 S. W. 264. The fact that said argument was persisted in and repeated the second time, as shown by said two bills of exception, after the trial court had admonished counsel to desist from such argument and after the court had orally instructed the jury that said argument was improper and that they must not consider the same for any purpose, raises a very serious doubt as to whether or not such argument being so obviously harmful and improper could be counteracted by instruction from the Court, and that this case should not be reversed upon this ground alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">For the error mentioned, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
