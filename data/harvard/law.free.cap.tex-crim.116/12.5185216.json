The facts show, from the State\u2019s standpoint, that appellant was standing by a road with a shot gun in his hand when Mr. Hare passed by with his wife and child in a car. After they had passed appellant discharged his gun and both Mrs. Hare and the child were struck by the shot. Appellant claimed he was shooting at a bird. The charge of the court submitted the issues of law in a manner so satisfactory to appellant that he took no exception thereto. We think the facts sufficient to justify the verdict and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">No error appearing, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">\n<em>A firmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
