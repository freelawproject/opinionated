Greenway appeals the district court\u2019s partial reversal of the bankruptcy court\u2019s order granting Greenway\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs Joanne Brito Boyce, Eric Boyce, John Som-merfield, Terry Rock, Kay Rock, and the Estate of Debbie Rock cross-appeal the district court\u2019s partial affirmance of the bankruptcy court\u2019s order granting Greenway\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We reverse in part, affirm in part, and render judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-28\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-29\">A motorboat, operated by John Greenway, crashed into Plaintiffs\u2019 vessel, causing a fatality and various injuries. The accident occurred on a lake at night. Greenway had been drinking. Plaintiffs sued in state court, and a jury, finding that Greenway was sixty percent responsible for the accident, awarded the Plaintiffs damages proportional to Green-way\u2019s fault.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Unable to pay the judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>Greenway sought protection under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Plaintiffs commenced this adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court to block the discharge of Greenway\u2019s debt. The Bankruptcy Code does not allow the discharge of debts arising from, among other things, willful and malicious injuries,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or from death or personal injuries caused by the operation of a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d if that operation was unlawful due to the debtor\u2019s intoxication.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Plaintiffs argued that these two provisions barred the discharge of Greenway\u2019s debt. The bankruptcy court disagreed. Because the jury in Greenway\u2019s state trial had rejected liability for gross negligence, the bankruptcy court found the Plaintiffs collaterally estopped from litigating whether Greenway\u2019s actions were willful or malicious under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(6). The bankruptcy court further found that the plain meaning of the term \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(9), did not include motorboats, and held \u00a7 523(a)(9) inapplicable to Greenway\u2019s case. The bankruptcy court thus granted Greenway\u2019s motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding that the Plaintiffs were collaterally estopped from litigating whether Greenway\u2019s actions had been willful and malicious, but reversed the bankruptcy court\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d reading the term to include motorboats. The district court then remanded the case to the bankruptcy court for trial on whether Greenway was intoxicated, within the meaning of \u00a7 523(a)(9) of the Bankruptcy Code, when the accident occurred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Both Plaintiffs and Greenway filed timely notices of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">The Bankruptcy Code allows a debtor to discharge all debts incurred prior to filing for bankruptcy, subject to certain exceptions. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(b); <em>Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Case (In re Case), </em>937 F.2d 1014, 1024 (5th Cir.1991). Greenway appeals the district court\u2019s reading of the exception contained in \u00a7 523(a)(9) of the Bankruptcy Code involving the intoxicated operation of a \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code <em>de novo. Bruner v. United States (In re Bruner), </em>55 F.3d 195, 197 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-10\">As with any statutory question, we begin with the language of the statute. <em>Kellogg v. United States (In re West Texas Marketing Corp.), </em>54 F.3d 1194, 1200 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 523, 133 L.Ed.2d 430 (1995). In determining a statute\u2019s plain meaning, we assume that, absent any contrary definition, \u201cCongress intends the words in its enactments to carry their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.\u201d <em>Pioneer Investment Services v. Brunswick Associates, </em>507 U.S. 380, -, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 1495, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). As the Supreme Court has stated: \u201cThere is, of course, no more persuasive evidence of the purpose of a statute than the words by which the legislature undertook to give expression to its wishes.\u201d <em>Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc., </em>458 U.S. 564, 571, 102 S.Ct. 3245, 3250, 73 L.Ed.2d 973 (1982) (internal quotation marks omitted). If the language is clear, then \u201cthe inquiry should end.\u201d <em>United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, </em>489 U.S. 235, 241, 109 S.Ct. 1026, 1030, 103 L.Ed.2d 290 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-14\">The terms \u201cmotorboat\u201d or \u201cwater craft\u201d do not appear in \u00a7 523(a)(9) of the Bankruptcy Code. Nor does the Bankruptcy Code expressly define the term \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d Therefore, we must determine if the plain or common meaning of the term \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d as used in \u00a7 523(a)(9), includes mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>torboats.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Only if the term is ambiguous will we proceed beyond the language as written. <em>Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., </em>489 U.S. at 241, 109 S.Ct. at 1030. The dictionary defines \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as \u201can automotive vehicle not operated on rails; esp: one with rubber tires for use on highways.\u201d WebsteR\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate DictionaRY 775 (1986); <em>see also </em>Random House College Dictionaby 871 (revised ed. 1980) (defining \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as \u201cany transportation vehicle designed for use on highways, as an automobile, bus, or truck\u201d). Additionally, Congress has used \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d to refer exclusively to automobiles in other statutes. For example, Chapter 301 of the Transportation Code defines \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as \u201cany vehicle driven or drawn by mechanical power manufactured primarily for use on the public streets, roads and highways, but does not include a vehicle operated only on a rail line.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30102(a)(6).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">The above definitions comport with our understanding that the plain and common meaning of the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d does not include motorboats. Had Congress intended to include motorboats within \u00a7 523(a)(9), they would have either defined the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d to include motorboats or added motorboats to the exception. It is not the job of the courts to legislate, and the Supreme Court has counseled that where the statutory language is plain, \u201cthe sole function of the court is to enforce it according to its terms.\u201d <em>Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., </em>489 U.S. at 241, 109 S.Ct. at 1030 (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court erred in reading the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d in \u00a7 523(a)(9) of the Bankruptcy Code to include motorboats.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Willison v. Race (In re Race), </em>159 B.R. 857, 860-61 (Bankr.W.D.Mo.1993) (resisting the urge \u201cto give effect to a perceived goal of Congress\u201d and holding that the plain language of \u00a7 523(a)(9) does not include motorboats). Accordingly, we hold that \u00a7 523(a)(9) does not encompass motorboats, and therefore does not bar the discharge of Greenway\u2019s debt.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-9\">Plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in upholding the bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling that Plaintiffs were collaterally estopped from litigating whether Greenway\u2019s actions were willful and malicious under \u00a7 523(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code, a finding which would disallow the discharge of Green-way\u2019s debt. The preclusive effect of a state court judgment is a question of law that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>review <em>de novo. Garner v. Lehrer (In re Garner), </em>56 F.3d 677, 679 (5th Cir.1995). A state court judgment\u2019s preclusive effect on a subsequent federal action is determined by the full faith and credit statute, which provides that state proceedings \u201cshall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States ... as they have by law or usage in the courts of such State ... from which they are taken.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738; <em>Marrese v. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, </em>470 U.S. 373, 380, 105 S.Ct. 1327, 1331-32, 84 L.Ed.2d 274 (1985). Under this statute, we must look to the rules of preclusion of the state in which the judgment was rendered in order to determine the judgment\u2019s preclusive effects. <em>Marrese, </em>470 U.S. at 380, 105 S.Ct. at 1332. Because Greenway\u2019s state judgment was entered by a Texas court, we apply Texas preclusion rules. <em>Garner, </em>56 F.3d at 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-4\">Under Texas law, \u201ccollateral estoppel bars relitigation of any ultimate issue of fact actually litigated and essential to the judgment in a prior suit.\u201d <em>Bonniwell v. Beech Aircraft Corp., </em>663 S.W.2d 816, 818 (Tex.1984); <em>see also Barr v. Resolution Trust Corp., </em>837 S.W.2d 627, 628 (Tex.1992) (stating that collateral estoppel \u201cprevents re-litigation of particular issues already resolved in a prior suit\u201d). To determine whether this standard has been met, \u201ca party must establish that (1) the facts sought to be litigated in the second action were fully and fairly litigated in the prior action, (2) those facts were essential to the judgment in the first case, and (3) the parties were cast as adversaries in the first action.\u201d <em>Bonniwell, </em>663 S.W.2d at 818; <em>see also Arnica Mutual Insurance Co. v. Moak, </em>55 F.3d 1093, 1097 (5th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Bonniwell, </em>663 S.W.2d at 818). The Plaintiffs were adverse to Greenway in the state trial, and do not dispute that gross negligence was adequately litigated. Nor do the Plaintiffs dispute that the facts sought to be litigated in the bankruptcy court were essential to the judgment in the state trial. Therefore, we must determine whether the jury\u2019s refusal to find gross negligence in the state trial necessarily determined that Greenway\u2019s conduct was not \u201cwillful and malicious\u201d under \u00a7 523(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code. In the state court proceeding, gross negligence was defined to the jury as \u201csuch an entire wont of care as to establish that the act or omission in question was the result of actual conscious indifference to the rights, welfare and safety of the persons affected thereby.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Conscious indifference is the salient element of gross negligence under Texas law. <em>See Transportation Insurance Co. v. Moriel, </em>879 S.W.2d 10 (Tex.1994) (tracing development of Texas law on gross negligence). We have consistently defined \u201cwillful and malicious\u201d under \u00a7 523(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code to mean \u201cintentional\u201d and lacking \u201cjust cause or excuse.\u201d <em>See Garner, </em>56 F.3d at 681 (listing cases). Comparing Texas\u2019 standard for gross negligence with the language of \u00a7 523(a)(6), we agree with the district court that the jury\u2019s refusal to find that Greenway acted with \u201cactual conscious indifference\u201d necessarily precludes a subsequent finding that Greenway\u2019s actions were both \u201cintentional\u201d and without \u201cjust cause or excuse.\u201d Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s holding that the Plaintiffs are collaterally estopped from litigating whether Greenway\u2019s actions were willful and malicious under \u00a7 523(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-8\">\n<em>TV</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-9\">We REVERSE the district court\u2019s order insofar as it includes motorboats within the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d under \u00a7 523(a)(9) of the Bankruptcy Code, and we hold that \u00a7 523(a)(9) does not bar the discharge of Greenway\u2019s debt. We AFFIRM <em>the </em>district court\u2019s order insofar as it holds that Green-way\u2019s acquittal for gross negligence in his state jury trial collaterally estops the Plaintiffs from seeking to litigate whether Green-way\u2019s actions were \u201cwillful and malicious\u201d under \u00a7 523(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code. Because neither of the exceptions at issue here disallows the discharge of Greenway\u2019s debt in bankruptcy, we RENDER judgment in favor of Greenway.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1246-18\">.

Whether \u00a7 523(a)(9) bars the discharge of debts arising from the intoxicated operation of a motorboat is an issue of first impression in this circuit. The only two other reported cases addressing the issue reached opposite results. <em>Compare Radivoj v.

In addition, we note that Congress consistently refers to motor vehicles and water craft separately in its enactments. <em>See, e.g., </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(g)(1) (defining \"passenger carrier\u201d to mean \u201cpassenger motor vehicle, aircraft, boat, ship, or other similar means of transportation\"); 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133(c) (discussing the use of \"motor vehicles, motorized equipment, and motorboats\"); 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 4304a(a)(2) (setting insurance requirements for \"motor vehicles, vessels, and aircraft\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1248-10\">. We reject the plaintiffs contention that we should parse the term \"motor vehicle\u201d into its component parts, thereby defining the term as any \"vehicle\u201d or \"conveyance\u201d that is powered by a mechanized motor. Such a technical definition of the term \"motor vehicle\u201d would result in including within the statute motorized wheelchairs, golf carts, riding lawn mowers, and perhaps even certain children's toys. Reading the term in this way would be overbroad, and would not comport with the Supreme Court\u2019s view that in interpreting the Bankruptcy Code, we must try to discern the \"natural reading\u201d of the language in question. <em>Ron Pair Enterprises, </em>489 U.S. at 241, 109 S.Ct. at 1030.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1248-11\">.
