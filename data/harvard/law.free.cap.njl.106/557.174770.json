The application was heard by the mayor and aldermen of Jersey City and was denied because it would increase the fire hazard and because in point of fact the zoning ordinance of Jersey City zones the land in question as a residential district in which no stores are permitted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b619-8\">\u201cThereafter, on September 20th, 1927, the relator obtained this rule to show cause why a <em>mandamus </em>should not issue commanding and enjoining the mayor and aldermen of Jersey City and the superintendent of buildings to grant the permit in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b619-9\">\u201cWe think that the permit cannot be granted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b619-10\">\u201cThe essential factual situation of this ease brings it within our decision in <em>Koplin </em>v. <em>Village of South </em>Orange, 6 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>489. The result is that the rule to show cause in the present case will be discharged and the writ of <em>mandamus </em>denied accordingly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b619-11\">\u201cHaving reached the conclusion stated, we deem it important to all parties in interest to announce it promptly, and do so in this somewhat informal manner in order to enable relator to avail himself of the earliest possible opportunity for review, if a review is desired. And if a review is desired, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>the relator is hereby given permission to enter a rule allowing and directing the molding of the pleadings so as to permit of such review.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b620-5\">For the appellant, <em>Mark A.
