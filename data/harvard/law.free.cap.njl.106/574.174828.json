In 1916 the company filed a certificate in Hew York state changing its name to Edward V. Hartford, Incorporated, but omitted to register the change of name in Hew Jersey.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b637-6\">\u201cThe prosecutor contends that under circumstances that Edward V. Hartford, Incorporated, is a corporation not created or recognized in Hew Jersey nor authorized to do business here, and that consequently it comes within the fourth section of the Attachment act, and is subject to attachment as a non-resident corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b637-7\">\u201cThe Attachment act originally applied only to non-resident individuals; it was later extended to include corporations. This extension has been construed to the same effect as the original act, <em>i. e., </em>to include only non-resident corporations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b637-8\">\u201cWhen the corporation, as in the instant ease is admitted, has its plant and property in Hew Jersey, and has resident officers here upon whom process may be served, it is considered a resident <em>de facto </em>corporation and is therefore exempt from attachment. This conclusion leads to an affirmance of the judgment of the Circuit Court.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b637-9\">Eor the appellant, <em>Perkins &amp; Drewen.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b637-10\">Eor the respondent, <em>Arthur T.
