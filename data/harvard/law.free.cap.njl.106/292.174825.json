It was to recover the possession of one (1) 1927 Dodge roadster automobile, model Ho. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The case was tried by the court without a jury, resulting in a judgment as follows: \u201cPlaintiff nonsuited as to Eeginald Oliver Co., Inc., and judgment for possession for defendant, Manufacturers Finance Corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The plaintiff-appellant files two grounds as specification of determinations with which he is dissatisfied in point of law, viz.:</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">1. Error by the court in granting a nonsuit against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">2. Error by the court in rendering a verdict of possession in favor of the defendant the Manufacturers Finance Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">The suit grows out of a conditional sales contract dated June 30th, 1928 <em>(Exhibit </em>D-2), which was filed in the register\u2019s office of Passaic county July 19th, 1928, but not properly indexed.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">The conditional vendee was a man named John Clancy, Jr., endorsed Anne F. Wall. He was the judgment debtor through whom the plaintiff took title'under an execution at a judicial sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">The pertinent parts of the conditional sales contract are as-follows: \u201cI or we, the undersigned purchaser, do hereby acknowledge having this day received from you <em>[i. </em>e., \u2018Reginald Oliver Co. Inc., the seller and one of the defendants] the following motor vehicle,\u2019 &amp;c. Signed John Clancy, Jr. Endorsed by X Anne F. Wall as above. Signature of Purchaser witness A. Adams, E. L. Slavin.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-13\">\u201cThe undersigned hereby sells, assigns, transfers to Manufacturers\u2019 Finance Corporation at Hew York, H. Y. [one of the defendants] the within contract, and all right, title and interest in and to the property. Dated June 30th, 1928, signed Eeginald Oliver Co. Inc., filed in my office on July 19th, 1928, and now remaining on file in my office. Signed John E. Morris, Eegister.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>The register, after the filing of the conditional sales contract, indexed in the book kept, in the name of Anne E. Wall. The buyer\u2019s name, John Clancy, Jr., being omitted. This was wrong. This is the crux of the case. The problem for solution, therefore, is, can the defendant be deprived of its rights, through the act of the register in making a mistake of the name in the index? This in turn depends upon the wording of the statute. <em>Pamph. L. </em>1919, <em>p. </em>461. The title of which is: \u201cAn act concerning conditional sales and to make uniform the law relating thereto.\u201d The pertinent parts of the statute are as follows: Section five (5), \u201cprovisions in a conditional sale, reserving property in the seller, shall be void,\u201d &amp;c., \u201cbefore the contract or a copy thereof shall be filed as hereinafter provided, unless such contract or copy is so filed within ten days after the making of the conditional sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Section six (6) provides: \u201cThe conditional sale contract or copy shall be * * * filed in the office of the county clerk or register of deeds, * * *. It need not be acknowledged or attested to make it valid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Section ten (10) provides: \u201cThe filing officer shall mark upon the contract or copy filed with him the day and hour of filing and shall file the contract or copy in his office for public inspection. He. shall keep a separate book in which he shall enter the names of the seller and buyer, the date of the contract, the day and hour of filing, a brief description of goods, the price named in the contract and the date of cancellation thereof; * <em>* </em>* Such book shall be indexed under the names of both seller and buyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Section eleven (11) provides: .\u201cThe filing of conditional sales contracts provided for in sections five, six and seven shall be valid for a period of three years only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">In 39 <em>Cyc. </em>1739 the rule is stated under which many eases are cited \u2014 thus: \u201cIn the absence of any statutory provision making the index an essential part of the record, error in making the index, or a total failure to index, does not prevent the record from operating as constructive notice. Where, however, by statute, indexing is required and made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>a part of the record, a record not properly indexed does not operate as constructive notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">In 18 <em>Corp. Jur. </em>251 it is stated: \u201cThe index under some statutes is not an essential part of the record.\u201d The index constitutes no part of the record. <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Lyman, </em>24 <em>Vt. </em>338, 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">So, in 23 <em>R. C. L. </em>190, \u00a7 47, it is stated: \u201cIndexing the records is obviously a matter of prime importance, but it is not necessary to the validity of an instrument, and the omission of the recorder, to index exactly as provided by statute will not render it invalid.\u201d This subject is extensively discussed in the subsequent sections 48, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">This court held the failure to note on the margin of the original record of a certificate of tax sale in the book of mortgages by the clerk, a reference to the place where the certificate of sale and affidavits have been re-recorded as a deed, as provided by the statute, cannot be charged against the defendant; under <em>Pamph. L. </em>1918, <em>p. </em>896, \u00a7 48; <em>Fort Lee, &amp;c., Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Harrington Co., </em>102 <em>N. J. L. </em>541.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">It would serve no useful purpose to pursue this subject at any great length. The subject-matter rests wholly upon the various statutes of the several states, which are dissimilar in terms and phraseology.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">The decisions turn upon the statutes under which the controversy arose, as in the case under discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">Thes\u00e9 statutes may be divided into two classes, viz., those statutes the provisions of which make the index an essential part of the record and those which do not. We think the statute <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1919, <em>p. </em>461), the one drawn here into question falls within the latter class. It is the filing by the vendor of the contract and not the indexing by the register or clerk which is the vendor\u2019s protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">We therefore hold, affirming the trial court, that the mistake by the register of the name in the index does not deprive the defendant of its protection. One other point was raised, viz., the sufficiency of the demand made upon the defendant simultaneously at the time of serving the writ of replevin. The authorities are conflicting on this point. 23 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number><em>R. C. L. </em>890, \u00a7 45. The conclusion which we have reached in-the case renders it quite unnecesasry to discuss or decide this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The judgment of the Second Judicial District Court of Bergen county is therefore affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
