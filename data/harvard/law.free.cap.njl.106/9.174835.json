L., p. </em>556), as amended, provides in its second section a procedure for the judicial ascertainment of the rights of parties concerned, \u25a0owner, party entitled to possession, and lienor; and of the amount justly due the lienor if anything. The procedure is not an action at common law, though the act speaks of a \u201cwrit of replevin\u201d and contemplates a taking of the property on giving a bond or making a deposit in court to secure the claimant. But a cursory glance at the act will show that the whole proceeding is special and statutory.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">This being so, our ancient rule that such proceedings are reviewable only by <em>certiorari </em>becomes applicable; and as recently as 1927, in the case of <em>Knapp </em>v. Kremer, 103 <em>N. J. L. </em>227, this court so decided. An important reason for holding the parties to this prerogative writ is mentioned in the cited cases of <em>City Bank </em>v. O\u2019Mara, 88 <em>Id. </em>499, and <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Pannaci, </em>90 <em>Id. </em>392.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The appeal will be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
