The appellant makes two contentions: that the State failed to establish possession on August 3, 1959; and that the testimony of his two accomplices, one of whom was granted immunity, was not corroborated. Neither contention is substantial. The State was not confined in its proof to the date alleged in the indictment. <em>Yanch v. State, </em>201 Md. 296, 93 A. 2d 749; <em>Mazer v. State, </em>212 Md. 60, 67, 127 A. 2d 630; and cases therein cited. The appellant\u2019s own testimony at the trial, his admissions to the police officers and the additional evidence adduced by the State amply corroborated his alleged accomplices (for the purposes of this case, we assume, without deciding, that the witnesses Jay and Betty Kaiser were accomplices of the appellant), and were sufficient to support the verdict of the jury. Cf. <em>Peachie v. State, </em>203 Md. 239, 100 A. 2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, appellant to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
