He was represented by counsel at his original trial as well as the hearing herein below. His only contentions, which he terms \u201cconstitutional violations\u201d, merely challenge the sufficiency of the evidence at his original trial. We have repeatedly held that the sufficiency of the evidence adduced at the trial of a defendant cannot be reviewed in collateral proceedings. <em>Johnson v.
