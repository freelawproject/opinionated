On December 16, 1959, Charles Scott was tried for, and convicted of, statutory burglary, by a judge of the Criminal Court of Baltimore, sitting without a- jury. From a three years\u2019 sentence in the Maryland Penitentiary, he has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The Attorney General has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, which we shall dispose of first. The appellant was sentenced by the court on January 20, 1960. He then filed a motion to vacate the judgment and set aside the sentence. This motion was denied by the trial judge on February 9, 1960. On February 15th, following; the clerk received from the appellant a \u201cNotice of Appeal.\u201d It would serve no present purpose to set forth its contents in detail. As a result of its receipt, the clerk, on February 17th, wrote the appellant and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">\u201cI gather from the contents of your Notice of Appeal received on February 15th, that you wish the Court of Appeals to review your conviction and sentence of three years <em>imposed on January 20th. </em>If this is correct, you are within the thirty days allowed by law to do so and, in order to protect your rights, I am making the appropriate entry on the docket.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">The clerk, also, called to the appellant\u2019s attention that the denial of his motion to vacate the judgment appeared on the docket, and inquired whether he wanted to note an appeal from this denial. The appellant replied that he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">The State contends that the defendant\u2019s first notice of appeal (as well as his reply to the clerk) only applied to his motion to vacate the judgment, and there has, in fact, never been any appeal from the judgment of January 20th. In view of the quoted portion of the clerk\u2019s letter, whereby the defendant, who was confined in prison, was informed that\" the clerk was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>making an appropriate entry on the docket to have the Court of Appeals review his conviction and sentence of January 20th, we think the contention is unsustainable. The motion to dismiss will, therefore, be denied. Cf. <em>Cahill v. Baltimore </em>City, 93 Md. 233, 48 A. 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">At the conclusion of the presentation of the State\u2019s evidence at the trial below, the defendant, who was represented by counsel, rested his case. The trial court took a short recess, and, upon his return to the courtroom, rendered a verdict of \u201cguilty generally,\u201d and inquired of defendant\u2019s attorney if he wished to file a motion for a new trial. The attorney replied, \u201cWe request a motion for a new trial,\u201d and the court said, \u201cAll right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">At this point, the defendant asked if he could address the court. His lawyer stated that although he had advised his client (who had a record of previous convictions) not to do so, the defendant desired to take the stand and deny certain of the testimony presented by the State. The court stated that if the case were a jury trial, \u201cit would not be possible to do this,\u201d but if \u201che has no objection and wants to testify, I believe I could still reopen the case.\u201d <em>\u201cI cannot strike out the </em>verdict\u201cI can only hear what he has to say in mitigation of sentence * * (Emphasis supplied.) A colloquy between the court, Scott and his attorney followed, during which the court stated: \u201cFrankly, I would like to hear from you [the defendant], too, but it is a bit irregular at this time in view of the fact that you have been convicted and that your counsel has stated that he is going to file a motion for a new trial. The only issue before me under the circumstances would be the nature of the sentence to give you.\u201d Further colloquy ensued, and, just before Scott was sworn, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">(Scott), \u201cI feel after I testify you [the court] would have an opportunity to reconsider your finding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">(The court), \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it is within my power to do that now since you did not testify before.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>(Scott), \u201cI was not given the opportunity. I sure requested it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">(The court), \u201cRight or wrong, I will let you testify. I will take whatever you say under advisement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Scott was then sworn, and he testified, relative to his guilt or innocence, at some length. Court was, thereafter, adjourned for the day, accompanied by a statement that the case would be resumed on the following morning, December 17, 1959, at 10:00 A.M. During the night, the police officers had obtained another witness for the State, who was permitted to testify, without objection. The testimony of this witness did not relate to the question of prospective punishment of the accused, but bore directly on the question of his guilt. The defendant again took the stand, and, towards the end of his testimony told the court that he had two or three witnesses, who lived in Washington, D. C., and whom he would like the court to hear. The court stated that this \u201cis a most unusual case.\u201d \u201cIf you want additional time\u2014I want to be sure I make no mistake\u2014my mind is unchanged to this minute\u2014if you want additional time, I will give it to you.\u201d \u201cI will direct that this case be held <em>sub curia </em>for one week.\u201d \u201cThe clerk will reset the case at that time.\u201d \u201cIf you produce your witnesses, I will hear them even then.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">The defendant, who had become dissatisfied with his then attorney, requested and was granted permission to engage new counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">The case was not reset in a week\u2019s time, and it was not until January 20, 1960, that it was resumed. In the meantime, the defendant had been unable to obtain new counsel, although he had written \u201cseveral organizations to help [him] contact [his] family.\u201d The court informed the defendant that he intended to impose sentence. The defendant requested an opportunity to file a motion for a new trial, but he was in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>formed that his request came too late, as the verdict had been rendered on December 16, 1959.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The record makes it crystal clear that the learned trial judge \u201cleaned over backwards\u201d in his efforts to afford the appellant every opportunity for a full, fair and impartial trial. We think, however, that he fell into error when he stated, on December 16th, that he could not strike out his verdict,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There is no doubt that he had discretionary revisory power over his verdict until the expiration of the term of court at which it was rendered. <em>Seth v. Chamberlaine, </em>41 Md. 186, 194; <em>State v. Butler, 72 </em>Md. 98, 18 A. 1105; <em>Madison v. State, </em>205 Md. 425, 431, 109 A. 2d 96. Cf. <em>Jones v. State, </em>214 Md. 525, 529, 136 A. 2d 252. And we think it was irregular to resume the taking of testimony as to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, without striking out the verdict of \u201cguilty generally.\u201d The record clearly shows (and we have recited a part of it above) that the defendant desired to reserve his right to move for a new trial before the Supreme Bench. The simple and proper procedure for the court to have pursued was to have stricken out the verdict (provided it was done during the term), then to have received any further evidence relating to the guilt or innocence of the accused that he, in his discretion, deemed proper, and then to have entered a new verdict consistent with all of the evidence that had been adduced. This would have permitted the trial judge to have received in an orderly manner all of the evidence that he desired, and, at the same time, afforded the defendant an opportunity to file his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">We think the erroneous belief of the trial judge that he did not have the power to strike out his verdict, coupled with the other irregularities, in practical effect, denied to the appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>his right to prosecute his motion for a new trial, and this constituted prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Having reached this conclusion, it becomes unnecessary to consider the other questions raised by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\n<em>Motion to dismiss appeal denied. Judgment reversed, and case remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b398-11\">. We think it only fair to comment that the trial court pointed out to the defendant that his attorney was trying to represent him diligently and faithfully.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b399-7\">. Rule 502 of the Rules of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City provides that a motion for a new trial must be filed within three days after verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b399-8\">. There is authority to the effect that, technically, a \u201cverdict\u201d can only be rendered by a jury, as distinguished from a \u201cdecision\u201d by the court. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (3rd Ed.), pp. 1807, 1808. The distinction seems to have little practical significance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
