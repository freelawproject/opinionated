We find no merit in the contention. The appellant was identified at the trial by the manager of the store and a clerk, who were present at the time of the robbery, and both identified him previously at a police line-up. Wrist watches, taken from the store, were found in his residence and upon his person, as well as currency and a bag containing 691 pennies. Estelle Jackson, who lived with the accused, testified that he and another man came into the apartment with a number of wrist watches, which she identified. The trial judge was not required to believe the testimony of the defendant\u2019s witnesses, who attempted to account for his whereabouts on the night of the robbery, or the defendant\u2019s attempt to account for his possession of the stolen watches. Questions of credibility are for the trier of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
