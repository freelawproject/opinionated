Bishop, </em>242 Fed.Appx. 142 (5th Cir.2007), in its entirety, and substitute the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b603-21\">Norman Mapes appeals the dismissal of two consolidated civil rights actions brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in which he alleged that police officers, the police chief,- the City of Baton Rouge (\u201cCity\u201d), and employees of the parish attorney\u2019s and prosecuting attorney\u2019s offices violated his constitutional rights by falsely arresting him and maliciously prosecuting him on a charge of soliciting a prostitute.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-22\">In No. 3:03-CV-67, the District Court held that the applicable one-year Louisiana statute of limitations for personal injury actions barred Mapes\u2019s false arrest claim against the City and police officer defendants Jameson Bishop, Patrick Wenneman, and Ken Stelly. We review the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Mapes\u2019s claim is time-barred <em>de novo. Price v. City of San Antonio, Tex., </em>431 F.3d 890, 892 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-23\">The District Court held that the statute of limitations began to run when Mapes was arrested on April 13, 2001, and, as a result, expired before Mapes filed his complaint on January 27, 2003. Mapes\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the District Court erred in dismissing the false arrest claim against these defendants because his false arrest claim did not accrue until the prosecution terminated in his favor on January 25, 2002. Neither the District Court nor Mapes were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>The \u201cstatute of limitations upon a \u00a7 1983 claim seeking damages for a false arrest in violation of the Fourth Amendment, where the arrest is followed by criminal proceedings, begins to run at the time the claimant becomes detained pursuant to legal process.\u201d <em>Wallace v. Kato, </em>549 U.S. 884, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 1100, 166 L.Ed.2d 978 (2007). To the extent that <em>Wallace </em>conflicts with our decision in <em>Brandley v. Keeshan, </em>64 F.3d 196 (5th Cir.1995) (holding that a false arrest cause of action accrues when the criminal prosecution terminates in favor of the accused), <em>Wallace </em>abrogates <em>Brandley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Mapes filed his \u00a7 1983 complaint exactly one year after the criminal prosecution terminated in his favor. The date on which Mapes became detained pursuant to legal process does not appear in the record. It is difficult to see how Mapes\u2019s complaint could be timely because the date on which he was detained pursuant to legal process must have preceded the date on which proceedings terminated. Nevertheless, we vacate and remand to the District Court to determine the date on which Mapes was detained pursuant to legal process.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Mapes briefs no argument concerning the claims that were dismissed in No. 3:04-CV-443. He also fails to brief any claim in No. 3:03-CV-67 other than his false arrest claim. Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9). Accordingly, Mapes\u2019s remaining claims are effectively abandoned. <em>Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 224-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED AS TO FALSE-ARREST CLAIM IN NO. 3:03-CV-67; AFFIRMED AS TO ALL OTHER CLAIMS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
