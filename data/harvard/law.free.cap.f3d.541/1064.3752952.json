The government moves to dismiss because Johnson knowingly and voluntarily executed an appeal waiver as part of his plea agreement. For the reasons set forth below, we grant the government\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-24\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-25\">On May 21, 2004, Johnson was charged in an information with conspiracy to commit identification document fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(f). Shortly thereafter, on May 26, Johnson entered into a negotiated plea agreement, the terms of which included an appeal waiver:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-26\">LIMITED WAIVER OF APPEAL: To the maximum extent permitted by federal law, the defendant voluntarily and expressly waives the right to appeal sentence and the right to collaterally attack sentence in any post-conviction proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>ing on any ground, except that the defendant may file a direct appeal of (1) an upward departure from the otherwise applicable sentencing guideline range; and/or (2) the sentencing court\u2019s finding as to the application of \u00a7 2bl.l(B)(l) of the Sentencing Guidelines in the event the loss amount is determined to exceed $30,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">(Plea Agreement, Government\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, Ex. B at 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">The plea agreement further provided, above Johnson\u2019s signature:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1086-6\">I have also discussed with my attorney the rights I may have to appeal or challenge my sentence, and I understand that the appeal waiver contained in the Plea Agreement will prevent me, with the narrow exceptions stated, from appealing my sentence or challenging my sentence in any post-conviction proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1086-7\"><em>(Id. </em>at 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-8\">During the plea colloquy, Johnson advised the court that he understood that the plea agreement contained a waiver of his right to appeal except in the limited instances of an upward departure from the sentencing guidelines or in the event the restitution amount exceeded $30,000:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1086-9\">Court: What are the circumstances in which Mr. Johnson would be able to appeal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1086-10\">Johnson\u2019s Attorney: Yes, your Honor. We will have the ability to appeal any upward departure [or if] the loss amount is determined to exceed $30,000 ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqJ\">Court: Okay. But do you understand you would not have any right to appeal?\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1086-11\">Johnson: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1086-14\">Court: \u2014 Or to file a later lawsuit challenging your sentence on any other grounds?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1086-15\">Johnson: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1086-16\">(Tr. Plea Hearing, Government\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, Ex. C at 10-11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-17\">On September 10, 2004, Johnson was sentenced to twenty-six months in prison, three years of supervised release, a special assessment of one hundred dollars, and an amount of restitution to be determined. Over three years later, on December 20, 2007 the district court amended the judgment and ordered Johnson to pay restitution in the amount of $21,593.70. It is undisputed that neither of the exceptions to the appeal waiver are at issue. The sentence was within the guidelines range and the order of restitution did not exceed $30,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-18\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-19\">We review the validity of a sentence appeal waiver de novo. <em>United States v. Weaver, </em>275 F.3d 1320, 1333 n. 21 (11th Cir.2001). A sentence appeal waiver must be made knowingly and voluntarily. <em>Id. </em>The waiver is valid if the government shows either that: (1) the district court specifically questioned the defendant about the waiver; or (2) the record makes clear that the defendant otherwise understood the full significance of the waiver. <em>United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1351 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-20\">Johnson argues that, notwithstanding his sentence appeal waiver, he may appeal the amended judgment because the district court issued a restitution order that was untimely pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(d)(5).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Johnson cites to <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number><em>States v. Maung, </em>267 F.3d 1113 (11th Cir.2001), wherein we stated that \u00a7 3664(d)(5) prohibits a district court from \u201cimpos[ing] a sentence and then delay[ing] determination of the amount of losses more than 90 days from sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1121. Johnson argues that this untimeliness rendered the sentence illegal and that even a valid waiver should not preclude us from vacating it. In support, Johnson cites <em>United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886 (8th Cir.2003) (en banc), in which the Eighth Circuit held that imposition of an illegal sentence constituted \u201ca miscarriage of justice\u201d and may be appealed despite the existence of an otherwise valid waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 891-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-4\">The government argues that Johnson knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence as evidenced by the clear terms of the plea agreement as well as by the district court\u2019s specific questioning of Johnson at the plea hearing. The government argues that because restitution is part of a criminal defendant\u2019s waiver, see <em>United States v. Satterfield, </em>743 F.2d 827, 837 (11th Cir.1984) (\u201cThere can be little doubt that Congress intended the restitution penalties of the VWPA [Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] to be incorporated into the traditional sentencing structure.\u201d), a waiver of the right to appeal a sentence necessarily includes a waiver of the right to appeal the restitution imposed. The government asserts that, although the Eighth Circuit recognized a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d exception, the court cautioned that the exception was \u201ca narrow one and w[ould] not be allowed to swallow the general rule that waivers of appellate rights are valid.\u201d <em>Andis, </em>333 F.3d at 891. The government states that Johnson does not object to the substance of the amended sentence (the amount of restitution did not exceed the $30,000 threshold), but merely that the court acted untimely; thus, the sentence itself did not violate Johnson\u2019s right to due process or result in a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-9\">In <em>United States v. Kapelushnik, </em>306 F.3d 1090 (11th Cir.2002), we held that where \u201cthe district court fails to [issue an order of restitution] within the 90-day limitations period, the judgment of conviction becomes final and contains no enforceable restitution provision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1093-94. In <em>Maung, </em>however, we indicated that in limited circumstances a district judge may impose restitution after the 90-day period, such as \u201cin cases where the defendant\u2019s own bad faith\u201d causes the delay. <em>Maung, </em>267 F.3d at 1122 (\u201cAllowing the defendant\u2019s own bad faith delay to foreclose the entry of a restitution order could conceivably put restitution in some cases in the defendant\u2019s own discretion.\u201d). Thus, although the question was not before us, we recognized the possibility that the 90-day period could be equitably tolled. <em>Id. </em>Our reasoning in <em>Maung </em>comports with the well established rule that equitable tolling principles \u201care read into every federal statute of limitation\u201d absent congressional intent to the contrary. <em>Cook v. Deltona Corp., </em>753 F.2d 1552, 1562 (11th Cir.1985); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number><em>see also Ellis v. Gen. Motors Acceptance Corp., </em>160 F.3d 703, 707 (11th Cir.1998) (same); <em>Hill v. Texaco, Inc., </em>825 F.2d 333, 334 (11th Cir.1987) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\">Because the statute of limitations may be equitably tolled, it is not jurisdictional. <em>See Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (explaining that federal statutory limitations period under scrutiny was \u201c \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional\u2019 [and therefore] not subject to equitable tolling\u201d); <em>Coke v. Gen. Adjustment Bureau, Inc., </em>640 F.2d 584, 588-89 (5th Cir.1981) (distinguishing between jurisdictional prerequisites and statutes of limitations that can be equitably tolled).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The crux of Johnson\u2019s appeal, therefore, is whether the factual circumstances of this case permitted the district court to equitably toll the 90-day limitations period. We do not reach that question, however, because we find that Johnson waived his statutory right<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to appeal his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">Johnson does not dispute that his waiver was knowing and voluntary; that he explicitly waived an appeal as to restitution so long as the amount did not exceed $30,000; or that the amount of restitution is, in fact, under $30,000. That Johnson may have a meritorious argument on whether the court erred in effectively equitably tolling the limitations period does not overcome his waiver in this instance. As we have said previously, \u201c[w]aiver would be nearly meaningless if it included only those appeals that border on the frivolous.\u201d <em>United States v. Howie, </em>166 F.3d 1166, 1169 (11th Cir.1999). The waiver includes more than just difficult or debatable legal issues; it includes \u201cwaiver of the right-to appeal blatant error.\u201d <em>Id.; United States v. Grinard-Henry, </em>399 F.3d 1294, 1296 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-12\">We recognize, however, that an effective waiver is not an absolute bar to appellate review. In <em>Bushert, </em>we commented that \u201ca defendant who has executed an effective waiver does not subject himself to being sentenced entirely at the whim of the district court.\u201d <em>Bushert, </em>997 F.2d at 1350 (internal quotation marks omitted). We indicated that \u201ca defendant could not be said to have waived his right to appellate review of a sentence imposed in excess of the maximum penalty provided by statute or based on a constitutionally impermissible factor such as race.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1350 n. 18 (internal quotation marks omitted). We also stated that \u201c[i]t is both axiomatic and jurisdictional that a court of the United States may not impose a penalty for a crime beyond that which is authorized by statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Six years after <em>Bushert, </em>we stated that \u201c[i]n extreme circumstances\u2014 for instance, if the district court had sentenced [the defendant] to a public flogging\u2014due process may require that an appeal be heard despite a previous waiver.\u201d <em>Howie, </em>166 F.3d at 1169 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-13\">Assuming that the district court erred in delaying the issuance of the restitution order, the 36 months that accrued beyond the 90-day threshold does not, by itself, give rise to an \u201cextreme circumstance\u201d requiring it to be heard despite a previous knowing and voluntary waiver. Johnson cannot be said to have been subjected to the unfettered whim of the district court, or punished on the basis of a constitutionally impermissible factor such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>as race. Furthermore, we do not believe the <em>Bushert </em>court, in referencing \u201cthe maximum penalty provided by statute\u201d or the imposition of \u201ca penalty for a crime beyond that which is authorized by statute,\u201d had in mind an untimely restitution order; rather, we read that commentary as aiming at the imposition of a sentence exceeding the statutory range authorized for the offense of conviction. The restitution statute at issue here, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663, has no prescribed statutory maximum. <em>See Dohrmann v. United States, </em>442 F.3d 1279, 1281 (11th Cir.2006). Johnson can hardly be viewed as receiving punishment in excess of a statutory maximum \u2014 or, indeed, even in excess of his own expectations \u2014 given that he agreed not to appeal an order of restitution that did not exceed $30,000. \u201cA plea agreement is, in essence, a contract between the Government and a criminal defendant.\u201d <em>Howie, </em>166 F.3d at 1168. To allow an appeal in this instance would effectively write into the contract an exception that the parties did not agree to. This we cannot do. The Sixth Circuit has recently come to the same conclusion. <em>See United States v. Gibney, </em>519 F.3d 301, 305-06 (6th Cir.2008) (dismissing appeal due to waiver despite defendant\u2019s argument that district court\u2019s restitution order exceeded the ninety-day time frame in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(d)(5)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-7\">Before concluding, we recognize that there is a need for finality in imposing restitution and that a thirty-six month delay is not a trivial amount of time. Our decision today does not provide district courts with free reign to disregard the 90-day period where a defendant has executed an appeal waiver. Under different circumstances, we can foresee how a delay may require our review despite a valid waiver. Here, however, where Johnson voluntarily and knowingly waived an appeal of restitution that did not exceed an amount of $30,000, where the court imposed an amount less than $30,000, and where the length of delay beyond the period of limitations is 36 months, Johnson\u2019s waiver precludes our review. Accordingly, we grant the government\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-8\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1086-12\">. Section 3664(d)(5) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1086-13\">If the victim's losses are not ascertainable by the date that is 10 days prior to sentencing, the attorney for the Government or the probation officer shall so inform the court, and the court shall set a date for the final determination of the victim\u2019s losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentencing. If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>victim subsequently discovers further losses, the victim shall have 60 days after discovery of those losses in which to petition the court for an amended restitution order.

To the extent that the Eighth Circuit's application of the \u2018'miscarriage of justice\u201d exception, recognized in <em>Andis, </em>333 F.3d at 891-92, would result in a different outcome, we respectfully disagree. We are not sure, however, that the Eighth Circuit would apply the \"miscarriage of justice\u201d exception in this case. The Eighth Circuit has previously held that a defendant's appeal waiver was not overcome by defendant's arguments attacking restitution on grounds of due process, insufficient evidence showing loss, and the victim's failure to seek restitution. <em>United States v. Greger, 98 </em>F.3d 1080, 1081-82 (8th Cir. 1996). We further note that the Eighth Circuit has recently clarified the language in <em>Andis </em>referring to \"a defendant ha[ving] the right to appeal an illegal sentence, even though there exists an otherwise valid waiver.\u201d <em>Andis, </em>333 F.3d at 891-92. In <em>United States v.

Indeed, the court stated that \"[t]he concept of an 'illegal sentence\u2019 may not apply neatly to restitution orders, as they are not in the nature of a criminal penalty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 851 (internal quotation marks omitted). The court explained that the focus of <em>Andis </em>was on \"a statutory range\u201d and that restitution orders \u201care not subject to any prescribed statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
