Trial before the Hon. Richard I. Munroe.

State, 34 Texas Crim. Rep., 489; Martin v. State, 32 id, 441; Polanka v. State, 33 id, 634; Robertson v. State, 33 id, 366.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b138-20\"><em>C. E.

(Giles v. State, 66 Tex. Crim. Rep., 638; 148 S. W. Rep., 317.) Besides the testimony, admissions and statements of the appellant himself are so unreasonable, contradictory and confusing as to clearly justify the court to believe none of the claimed absent wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>nesses, none of whom had ever been subpoenaed, or would, testify as claimed by him, and if they had, that their testimony would not probably be true and would not have changed the result of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The court did not err in not giving appellant\u2019s requested charge on circumstantial evidence. The admissions and testimony of the appellant himself unquestionably show that he took the mules at the time and place they were stolen and he was within two or three hours thereafter caught in the actual possession thereof some twelve or fourteen miles from where he had taken them. It is only when the ease is proven by circumstantial evidence alone that a charge on circumstantial evidence is necessary. Sec. 813, sub. 2, p. 531, White\u2019s C. C. P.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The court gave a full and fair charge in the case, submitting every issue in any way raised by the testimony, all of which was found against appellant, with the amplest evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
