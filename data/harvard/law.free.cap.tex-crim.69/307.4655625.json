Counsel presented a special charge instructing the jury' that as no proof had been offered showing that local option was in force in that county, to return, a verdict of not guilty, and if there was no more evidence adduced on the trial than is shown by this record, this charge should have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-16\">Because there is no evidence showing that local option is in force in Newton County, the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-17\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
