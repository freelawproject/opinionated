The evidence is amply sufficient to sustain the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-16\">The testimony of Patsy Foster, the injured party, showed and she testified positively, that it was the appellant who shot into the house and shot her and that she saw him at the time and immediately there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>after when he ran away from the house. No charge on circumstantial evidence was, therefore, necessary. It is only when the evidence to sustain a conviction is wholly circumstantial that such a charge is \u2022required.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Appellant\u2019s bill that a question by the prosecuting officer to Patsy Poster wherein she was asked what appellant\u2019s idea was in wanting her to live with him, and \u20181 did he want her to sleep with him ? \u2019 \u2019 was leading, clearly does not show that a leading question, even if this was, was not permissible. (Carter v. State, 59 Texas Crim. Rep., 73.) Neither was such proof in this case irrelevant or incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Antecedent menaces, quarrels, assaults and batteries, and grudges may always be shown to prove motive. (Sullivan v. State, 31 Texas Crim. Rep., 488.) In this case the court, therefore, did not commit any error in permitting the State to prove the previous assaults and assaults and batteries committed by appellant upon said Patsy Poster in order to show motive, and no charge was necessary limiting the effect of such evidence, because motive is a part of the proof to establish the main offense. But if it was necessary to limit such proof, the court did so in this case properly by charging in a separate paragraph, this: \u201cThe defendant is on trial on the charge contained in the indictment only. You are charged that if any evidence has been introduced as to any other offense, you cannot convict him in any event of such offense, if any.\u201d Millican v. State, 63 Texas Crim. Rep., 440, and authorities there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Patsy Poster, as stated above, testified positively that appellant shot into the house and shot her at the time the offense is charged; that she saw him, identified him and saw him run away immediately after he shot. In order to impeach her, appellant asked her if she did not state to various persons, naming them, the next day and later, in effect, that she did not know who shot her but she thought it was appellant. She denied making such statements. Appellant then put witnesses on who testified she did make such statements.- The State was then properly permitted to corroborate her by proving by the constable that early the next morning after the shooting the night before, he investigated the matter and that Patsy Poster then and there told him that it was appellant who shot into the house and shot her that night. Sec. 874, Branch\u2019s Crim. Law, where a large number of the cases are collated. No charge was asked as to the effect of this supporting testimony. Any charge on that subject would have been on the weight of the evidence and specially called attention to the testimony of the complaining witness and this testimony in support of it. No reversible error was committed under the circumstances in not charging thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">The appellant has called our attention to the fact, in what he calls his supplemental assignments of error filed long after the adjournment of the court, that the sentence of the appellant, instead of being for burglary, with which he was charged and convicted, and the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>ment of conviction and verdict so showed, that he was sentenced for assault with intent to murder. This, of course, was an error, but as the indictment, charge, verdict and judgment thereon clearly show that he was convicted for burglary instead of assault with intent to kill, under the statute the final sentence will be set aside and this court will, and does now here direct and require that the sentence shall be so made and changed as to show that he was and is sentenced for burglary, instead of an assault with intent to murder. With this correction, there being no reversible error presented, the judgment is affirmed. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
