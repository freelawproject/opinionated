State, 43 Texas, 372; Witten v. State, 4 Texas Crim. App., 70; Hutto v. State, 7 Texas Crim. App., 44; Hennessey v. State, 23 Texas Crim. App., 340; Lewis v. State, 55 Texas Crim. Rep., 167.) Appellant could not have been misled to his prejudice, and as the word can be read as well \u201cten\u201d as any other way, and when taken in connection with the entire sentence shows plainly how it should be so read.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-13\">The only other ground in the motion for new trial complains of the insufficiency of the testimony to sustain the conviction. The jury, twelve good and lawful men of Washington County, who tried appellant, deemed it sufficient; the trial judge who considered the evidence on motion for new trial thought it ample, and we are asked simply because of a conflict in the testimony of the prosecuting witness, and the fact, as contended by appellant, that it comes from a questionable source, to wholly disregard it. The contention is mainly, that this 'witness for the State is unworthy of belief; that the circumstances show her testimony to be fabricated at the instance of another. Doubtless all these contentions were argued and presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>to the jury by the able counsel representing appellant. If it should be admitted that from reading the record a reasonable doubt was raised in our mind, we are not authorized to substitute our judgment for that of the jury. It is not a question of what would have been our verdict had we been members of the jury who tried appellant, but the question for us to decide, if the jury believed the testimony offered in behalf of the State, does it sustain the verdict, and, if so, then the verdict must stand. There is no such conflict in the testimony of the prosecuting witness as to render it wholly inconsistent with human wisdom and experience. In her direct testimony she tells of how the offense occurred in a way that is consistent with the way such offenses are committed on children, and while the record discloses that a splendid defense was made, and the jury would perhaps have been justified in returning a verdict of not guilty, yet they \u25a0did not do so, and under such circumstances we feel impelled to respect their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
