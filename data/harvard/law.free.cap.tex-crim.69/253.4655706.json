We gather these facts from the petition of the relator, presented to Honorable R. B. Seay, Judge of the District Court of Dallas County, praying for a writ of habeas corpus. Judge Seay refused to issue the writ of habeas corpus, and from this refusal appellant gave notice of appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-18\">The first question to be decided is, has this court any jurisdiction on appeal, where the District Court refuses to issue the writ? This may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>furnish ground to apply to this court for an original writ of habeas corpus, but no such application has been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\">This question was fully discussed and decided in Ex Parte Ainsworth, 27 Texas, 732, and it was there held that a person could not appeal from an order refusing to issue the writ of habeas corpus, but the applicant\u2019s remedy was to apply to another court for an original writ. For a full discussion of this question we refer to that opinion. See also Ex Parte Blankenship, 5 Tex. Crim. App., 218; 57 S. W. Rep., 646; Ex parte Foster, 5 Texas Crim. App., 625; Ex parte Strong, 34 Texas Crim. Rep., 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
