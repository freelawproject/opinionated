Appellant\u2019s counsel have filed an able and extensive brief, but cite us to no authorities as sustaining their contention, and we have found none. In the first place, we want to call attention to the fact that the medical practice Act does not seek to regulate how anyone shall treat diseases or disorders, \u2014it simply provides that before anyone shall treat or offer to treat diseases or disorders for the human family, he shall demonstrate that he is well grounded in certain studies named in the Act. This is to compel a person to show he has a knowledge of the human frame, the organs of the body, and an ability to diagnose diseases, etc. If he shall pass this examination, then the treatment of disease is left to his judgment and in no way does the Act seek to control how any man shall treat disease. The misconception of the terms of the medical practice Act has been the basis of much argument. No one has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>an inalienable right to follow the occupation of practicing medicine or treating disease for pay, any more than one has the inalienable right to follow the occupation of practicing law for pay, or to practice dentistry, or any other occupation that requires and demands a certain amount of what might be termed technical knowledge of the subject with which he represents he is competent to practice. Every question raised by appellant in his brief has been so thoroughly discussed by this court in cases heretofore decided, we deem it but useless to reiterate the law as therein' announced, as the argument of appellant\u2019s counsel has not caused us to change our views as therein expressed. For a complete discussion of every question raised by appellant see the following cases: Newman v. The State, 58 Texas Crim. Rep., 223; Dankworth v. The State, 61 Texas Crim. Rep., 157; Germany v. The State, 62 Texas Crim. Rep., 276; Ex Parte Collins, 57 Texas Crim. Rep., 2; Collins v. The State of Texas, 223 U. S., 288, 56 Law Ed., 439; Singh v. State, 66 Texas Crim. Rep., 156, 146 S. W. R., 391; Collins v. The State, 152 S. W. R., 1047, and cases cited in these decisions.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b617-8\">[Rehearing denied April 16, 1913.\u2014Reporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">In this case it was shown that appellant had treated and offered-to treat paralysis, rheumatism, asthma, tonsilitis, kidney trouble, cancer, female trouble, stomach trouble, nervousness, abscess, neuralgia, and various other diseases, even to removing cataracts, etc., making specific charges for the treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
