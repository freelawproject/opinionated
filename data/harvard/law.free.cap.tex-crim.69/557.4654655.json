The officers were notified of this burglary and by daylight the next morning they had traced a wagon from the place where the car was burglarized to the store of appellant. The goods stolen consisted largely of shoes wrapped with a peculiar kind of paper. These officers testified that they found some of this paper where the car had been burglarized and after tracing the wagon to appellant\u2019s store they found some of the identical kind of paper in the back yard of appellant where he ran his small store. A short while after this burglary Sol Parker, John Parker, Joe Lewis, Walter Moore, Arthur Pitman (negroes), Nick Tremonte, Y. Danna, and appellant Joe Gusemano were charged or rather suspicioned of having, committed this burglary. The first five named, negroes, were arrested. In a short while after the burglary the officers sent for appellant to come to the police station. He came there and was then told by the officers and also by a relative through the advice of the officers that if he had these goods he should give them up and that they would do all that they could for him if he would do the right thing. Appellant then made a statement that he had bought these goods from these negroes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>and that he had sent the goods out to the country, as he did not want them discovered in his possession. He then proceeded to get the goods, about two wagon loads, and delivered them to the officers. The negro Sol Parker, an accomplice, testified in behalf of the State that this appellant, together .with the parties above named, assisted in the burglarizing of the car.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b580-4\"><em>E.

There was evidence of the fact that the car was broken and goods taken from it. The State introduced a negro named Parker, who made himself an accomplice,\u2014that is a principal, in the transaction of breaking the car and taking the goods. Under his testimony the State would have a case, but being an accomplice and used as a witness, it was necessary that he be corroborated as required by the statute. As a means of corroboration of the negro, the State used an officer as a witness who testified in substance that appellant returned some of the property to him. Either at the time when appellant was first questioned about the goods, or when he delivered them, or perhaps on both occasions, he stated that he had purchased the goods from five negroes. The witness Parker had testified that five negroes, including himself and the defendant, who is not a negro, had committed the burglary, appellant furnishing the wagon. Appellant also proved an alibi on the night of the burglary. Without going into a detailed statement of the' facts, this, we think, is sufficient to bring in review the questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">1. Parker, on cross-examination, testified that he had made substantially the same statement before the justice of the peace or magistrate about two weeks after the burglary that he made on the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>before the jury. The details are unnecessary. Objection was urged to this testimony and various grounds presented. This testimony was not admissible. We suppose the court admitted it upon one of two, or perhaps both, grounds,\u2014first, that it was corroborative of the accomplice\u2019s testimony given before the jury, and, second, that he had been impeached, or sought to be impeached. Neither ground justified the admission of this testimony. Parker stated that he had made practically the same statement with reference to the transaction before the magistrate about two weeks after the alleged burglary. He was not sought to be impeached. It was developed from him while he was testifying, that the State would dismiss or had dismissed one of the eases against him. The court\u2019s ruling seems to be predicated upon the theory that that was impeaching the witness. We do not so understand the law. If it was sought to corroborate the accomplice by a repetition of his statement made at some other time, that can not be done. An accomplice can not corroborate himself. It is immaterial how many statements he may make. Without going into a discussiop further of this matter, we refer to Pridemore v. State, 53 Texas Crim. Rep., 620; Saye v. State, 54 Texas Crim. Rep., 430; Reese v. State, 43 Texas Crim. Rep., 539; and Morton v. State, 43 Texas Crim. Rep., 533, 71 S. W. Rep., 281. We deem it unnecessary to pursue this line of thought further. To show a dismissal of the ease against Parker was not impeaching his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">2. Complaint is made of the court in charging upon the subject of reasonable explanation and possession of property because the State had proved the explanation and was bound by it, unless it was shown to be untrue, and the explanation being proved by the State, was a different question from the explanation put in evidence by the defendant, and because the reasonableness of the explanation was not a question for the jury, having been proved by the State, and because the court also required the jury to find that the explanation was \u201cconsistent with his innocence.\u201d The court tried this case upon the theory, that appellant\u2019s explanation of his possession of the property, towit; that he bought it, was consistent with his innocence. This question came up in Cagle v. State, 52 Texas Crim. Rep., 307, and was held adversely to the court\u2019s ruling. Applied to the facts of this case, the charge on explanation of possession of stolen property did not present\" the question as it should be presented, and, in fact, it may be stated that the charge as given, was detrimental to appellant. The charge with reference to reasonable explanation of the possession of property is based upon the theory that he came by the property innocently. That may not have been the case under this record. Appellant is charged with burglary and not with theft. The State put in evidence the fact of his possession, accompanied by his statement to the effect that he purchased the property. If appellant purchased the property, he would not be guilty of burglary. The property might not have been innocently in his possession. He may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>bought the property knowing it to have been stolen and yet be entirely innocent of burglary. Of course, if he bought the property,\u2014whether he bought it innocently or knowing it to have been stolen,\u2014this might be used as a circumstance for what it was worth, but if he bought it knowing it to have been stolen, he would not have been innocent in his possession. It would still have been a guilty possession if he knew it was stolen when he made the purchase. To meet this appellant requested some special charges; not only so, but criticised the court\u2019s charge in the motion for new trial. These special requested instructions were refused. The effect of these charges was to place this matter more correctly before the jury,\u2014that is, if the defendant bought the property, even if he knew it was stolen, yet, before they could convict him of burglary, they must find that he was present or doing something in connection with the burglary which made him a principal. His acquittal of the burglary would not depend upon his innocence as to the possession of the stolen property, but would depend upon the fact that he participated in breaking the car as a principal. He may have known the property was stolen and yet not be guilty of burglary. He could be guilty as a receiver of the property if when he received it, he knew it to be stolen, whether it came from the broken car or not. The charge was not such as ought to have been given and it was erroneous under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\">There are some other interesting questions presented for revision, but we are of the opinion the trial court will understand from what has been said' the other questions will follow the line of thought here indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b582-6\">PRENDERGAST, Judge, and HARPER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AWr\">We concur in the reversal of the case, but not in the first proposition herein discussed. Mr. Branch in his Criminal Law, sec. 875, correctly we think lays down the rule to be that if it is sought to be shown that the witness testified from corrupt motives, then he can be sustained by showing that before the motive existed, he had made the same statement. In this case, it being sought to be shown that the witness had testified under an agreement that he would not be prosecuted for the offense, this would be an effort to show a corrupt motive, and rendered admissible supporting testimony.
