Zdravkovich, Esquire (Respondent). In this petition, Bar Counsel asserted four complaints alleging violations of Rules 1.1 (competence), 1.3 (diligence in representation), 1.4 (communication with clients), 1.5 (fees), 1.15 (safekeeping property), 1.16 (declining or terminating representation), 3.1 (meritorious claims and contentions), 8.1 (disciplinary matters), and 8.4 (misconduct) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC), and Md.Code (1992, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article (misuse of trust money). This Court referred the matter to Judge Pamela R. North of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County to conduct an evidentiary hearing and make findings of fact and conclusions of law in accordance with Maryland Rules 16-709(b)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 16-711(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">Of the four complaints lodged against Respondent, two were voluntarily dismissed by Petitioner at the hearing before Judge North on 19 October 1999 due to insufficient evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the evidentiary hearing addressing the remaining two unrelated claims, Judge North found, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5(a), 3.1, 8.4(a), and 8.4(d) during his attorney-client relationship with complainant Val Weaver.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Respondent, who has appeared <em>pro se </em>throughout these proceedings, filed with us extensive exceptions to the findings of fact and conclusions of law made by Judge North. Petitioner, who does not take any exceptions to the findings of fact and conclusions of law, recommends that we suspend indefinitely Respondent from the practice of law for his misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">From the evidentiary record below, Judge North made the following findings of fact pertaining to Respondent\u2019s conduct regarding Val Weaver:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">A. <em>General Background</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">1. Respondent was admitted to practice law in the State of Maryland on 3 November 1981. He is also a member of the bar for the District of Columbia and the former Yugoslavia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>2. The conduct in question arose out of Respondent\u2019s representation of Val Weaver and James Impero during litigation filed by North American Technologies Group, Inc. (NATG). At that time, Respondent and Weaver had known one another on a professional and personal level for over 20 years.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Weaver and Impero had enjoyed a professional and personal relationship for 12 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-4\">3. During his affiliation with NATG, Weaver was responsible for business developments and was a corporate liaison with government agencies and military services. Although referred to by NATG as Vice President of Marketing, Weaver maintains he was an independent consultant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-5\">4. Impero is a bio-chemist who was employed by NATG as a director and an officer of the company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">5. During the dispute, NATG attached Impero\u2019s belongings and locked him out of his office. On 23 January 1995, Impero executed a letter of resignation and a letter of understanding with NATG without the benefit of counsel. Impero did not obtain counsel until 10 February 1995, when a Texas law firm informed NATG\u2019s law firm of Impero\u2019s representation. Weaver, however, testified that Impero formalized an attorney-client relationship with Respondent sometime in or after January 1995.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">6. By 13 March 1995, it became unclear whether the Texas firm still represented Impero. According to Weaver, Respondent agreed to serve as general counsel for Impero as of 23 March 1995, with the scope of the representation limited to assisting Impero with his resignation from NATG and the recovery of his personal property. He further testified that Respondent\u2019s representation of Impero expanded when Impero became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>involved in an arbitration proceeding, filed in Chicago, Illinois, between NATG and Biotrace International, Inc.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-4\">7. In April 1995, NATG initiated litigation against Weaver and Impero in the Two-Hundredth-Eightieth Judicial District of Harris County, Texas.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The suit asserted numerous causes of action, including breach of contract, fraud, breach of fiduciary relationship, tortious interference with prospective business relations, negligent misrepresentation, slander, libel, tortious interference with existing business relations, deceptive trade practices, and fraudulent transfers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\">8. The only evidence on the record establishing Respondent\u2019s representation of either Impero or Weaver are two letters and an unsigned and undated copy of a retainer agreement. The first letter, dated 14 April 1995, is from Respondent and refers to Impero as \u201cmy client.\u201d The second letter, dated 1 May 1995,' is from Respondent to Weaver and Impero, in which Respondent states \u201c[t]his office will represent James Impero and Val Weaver in any proceeding in the States of Maryland[,] Texas, and Illinois at a single rate of $150 per hour.... \u201d <em>See infra </em>Fee Discussion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">9. Weaver testified that, as of April 1995, his role was that of a [sic ] \u201clightening rod\u201d between Respondent and Impero and that, as a result, he received copies of all documents concerning Impero\u2019s legal problems and communicated with both parties on a weekly basis.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>10. There is no evidence on the record of a retainer agreement between Respondent and Weaver. While Weaver initially stated that he never personally hired Respondent in the Texas matter, he later testified that Impero hired Respondent to represent Impero and Weaver, with Impero agreeing to pay all of Respondent\u2019s fees. <em>See infra </em>Fee Discussion. Weaver indicated that he initially relied on Respondent\u2019s statements that he represented both Weaver and Impero, but later hired Respondent individually when he became a party to the NATG dispute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-4\">11. Respondent hired local counsel in Texas to assist him with the Texas action; Weaver testified he was not certain if the local attorney represented him or Impero or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">B. <em>Charles County, Maryland Action</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">1. On 22 July 1995, Respondent filed a complaint and jury demand on Weaver\u2019s behalf in the Circuit Court for Charles County, Maryland. Respondent alleged that service of process for the Texas civil action on Weaver, through his wife, was improper because the Sheriffs affidavit was based on false and misleading information. He also alleged that contractual obligations owed by NATG to the Weavers were never fully discharged, and that NATG owed the Weavers monies, stock options, and stock valued in excess of $2,000,000. Finally, the compliant alleged NATG made defamatory statements against Val Weaver in a New York Stock Exchange press release, published in Maryland, that stated that Weaver had breached the duties he owed NATG.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">2. On 24 October 1995, Maryland counsel for NATG filed a Motion to Dismiss in the Charles County action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>3. In a letter to Respondent from Weaver dated 27 October 1995, Weaver, indicating that a dismissal of the Charles County action was a prerequisite to the success of any mediation proceedings taking place in the Texas action, requested that Respondent dismiss the action without prejudice. Respondent did not reply to or act upon Weaver\u2019s request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\">4. In a letter dated 7 November 1995, Weaver told Respondent that \u201c[t]he state of affairs and apparent conflict now between us forces me to dismiss your legal representation from all activities and matters regarding me [specifically, the federal District Court action [and the Charles County action] and any issues involving Impero and NATG].\u201d At the time he wrote this letter, Weaver did not know that Respondent had not filed the Motion to Dismiss in the Charles County action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-5\">5. On 24 November 1995, Respondent filed a Motion to Withdraw Appearance in the Charles County action. The Charles County Circuit Court initially granted this motion on 13 December 1995. The motion granting the withdrawal was later stricken on 5 January 1996, when the Circuit Court learned that Weaver did not consent to Respondent\u2019s withdrawal because Weaver did not know that Respondent had not filed the Motion to Dismiss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">6. On 16 April 1996, NATG filed a second Motion to Dismiss in the Charles County action. Respondent did not answer this motion either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">7. On 28 May 1996, the Circuit Court wrote a letter to Respondent informing him that it had not received an \u2022answer to NATG\u2019s motions and that, \u201c[g]iven the previous history concerning your representation of Mr. Weaver, [the Court is] forwarding a copy of the Memorandum and Motion to Dismiss directly to him, along with his copy of this letter .... to give [Weaver] every opportunity to respond to the Motion to Dismiss.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>8. On 11 June 1996, Weaver informed the Circuit Court that he had not spoken with Respondent since October 1995 and that Respondent refused to communicate with Weaver since that date. Weaver then filed, <em>pro se, </em>a Motion for Voluntary Dismissal. This motion was granted on 18 June 1996.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-4\">C. <em>District of Maryland, Harris County, Texas, and Chicago, Illinois Actions</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">1. On 19 June 1995, Respondent, on behalf of Impero and his company, filed suit against NATG, Biotrace International, three law firms, two attorneys, and the American Arbitration Association in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The complaint alleged a breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, fraud, wrongful interference with a contract, replevin, and mandamus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">2. On 20 June 1995, Respondent received a letter from the United States District Court for the District of Maryland that warned him that the complaint he had filed was deficient in many respects. The letter indicated that it was not clear whether the Court had subject matter or personal jurisdiction over the action or any of the defendants, respectively, and that the Court questioned whether venue was proper. The Court advised that Respondent would have to correct the deficiencies before the Court would address the merits of the claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">3. The record reflects that Respondent neither corrected these deficiencies nor complied with the Court\u2019s order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">4. On 26 June 1996, Respondent wrote to Impero and Weaver to discuss the fee for his legal services and expenses, as well as the fees for those attorneys whom he had hired to assist him with Weaver\u2019s and Impero\u2019s representation. <em>See infra </em>Fee Discussion. He also wrote to update them on the status of their respective cases. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>With respect to the federal District Court case, Respondent stated he would stagger the filing of three separate complaints on Mr. Weaver\u2019s, Mrs. Weaver\u2019s, and Mr. Impero\u2019s behalf. After filing each complaint, he would move to amend it before he filed the next. His intention in filing the suit in this manner was that the \u201c[fjiling schedules will probably throw off all party defendants with a degree of risk that the Court may not be too fond of our tactics.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-4\">With respect to the Chicago arbitration, Respondent indicated that he hoped the arbitration would be \u201cgreatly affected\u201d by the federal action in Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">As to the Texas action, Respondent assured them that he would be doing most of the drafting of the initial pleadings, including a motion to move in out-of-state counsel, an entry of appearance, a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, an affidavit of residency of Impero, and a motion to strike one of the law firms from representing NATG. Respondent also indicated in his letter that he and the Texas counsel would meet with Impero in Texas on 28 June 1996.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">Lastly, Respondent stated that he had received an inquiry regarding a possible settlement between NATG, Weaver, and Impero. He indicated, however, that \u201crealistically speaking a settlement with [NATG] is not in the cards.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">5. On 31 July 1995, Respondent filed a Petition for Removal and Consolidation of the Texas action into the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. Informing Weaver of the petition, Respondent indicated that he felt the Texas action should be removed to Maryland because Impero and Weaver were residents of Maryland, and because he thought NATG was not licensed to do business in Texas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">6. On 1 August 1995, Respondent filed on Impero\u2019s behalf a Joinder of Party Co-Defendant in the District Court for Harris County, Texas. The joinder was filed pend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>ing the removal of the Weaver case from Texas to the federal District Court in Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-4\">7. On 8 August 1995, Judge Deborah Chasanow of the U.S. District Court in Maryland issued a written opinion in which she concluded that Respondent \u201cappear[ed] to be confused as to the applicability of the removal statute [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446]<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to the various proceedings involved.\u201d Judge Chasanow informed Respondent that, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, only a defendant can file a removal petition, and that even if Respondent were in a position to make such a filing, the Texas state action could not be removed to a federal district court in Maryland, but rather only to one in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Texas, if at all. Judge Chasanow not only found that removal of the Weaver case was improper, but that adding Maryland defendants to the Impero case \u201cwould destroy whatever diversity jurisdiction currently exists in that case, if any, and would require the dismissal or the transfer of that case to a Maryland circuit court.\u201d Judge Chasanow concluded the opinion by entering an Order of Remand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-4\">8. At the time the Motion for Removal was filed by Respondent, a previously scheduled hearing on a temporary injunction pending in the Texas action was scheduled for 11 August 1995. NATG claimed that Respondent did not send notice of the filing of the Petition for Removal to counsel of record in the Texas action until 9 August 1995. Moreover, NATG claimed that Respondent sent the notice by express mail, which arrived on 10 August 1995, requiring a postponement of the 11 August 1995 hearing and resulting in an incurment of expenses by NATG for costs of witness appearance and travel that could not be canceled in time. As a result, NATG filed a Motion for Rule 11 Sanctions in the U.S. District Court in Maryland against Respondent, Weaver, and Impero. Although Weaver testified that Respondent failed to advise him or Impero that these sanctions had been filed against them, a letter dated 21 August 1995 from Respondent to NATG\u2019s counsel in Maryland discussing the sanctions indicates that the letter was copied to both Weaver and Impero.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">9. On 5 October 1995, Respondent wrote a letter to Impero informing him of the status of his cases, but omitted any mention of the Motion for Sanctions which had been filed against them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">10. On 11 October 1995, Impero called Weaver to inquire whether he was aware of the Motion for Sanctions filed against them. Shortly afterward, Weaver received a facsimile from. Respondent informing him of the motion. Weaver testified that he repeatedly tried to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>reach Respondent to discuss the motion, but that Respondent failed to return his calls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-4\">11. On 13 October 1995, Weaver reviewed his court file at the U.S. District Court in Maryland and learned that a response to the Motion for Sanctions was due by 16 October 1995. After discussing his situation with the Clerk of Court, Weaver filed a letter with the Court on 17 October 1995, informing Judge Chasanow of his lack of knowledge regarding the motion and his inability to contact Respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\">Weaver testified that he tried contacting Respondent during the week of 13 October, but to no avail. He also testified that he asked Respondent\u2019s secretary if he could review his files. The secretary initially answered affirmatively, but later informed Weaver that Respondent denied Weaver\u2019s request to see the files.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">Also on 13 October 1995, a request was made by Weaver to NATG on Impero\u2019s and Weaver\u2019s behalf to dismiss the Motion for Sanctions. This request was granted, but only as to the two men and not as to Respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">12. On 26 October 1995, Impero told Respondent he wanted to end the litigation, and instructed him to file a Motion to Dismiss the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court in Maryland without prejudice and to return all of his papers to the Weavers.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Weaver testified that while Respondent failed to return his papers, he did demand $150,000 as payment for his representation of Impero and/or Weaver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-8\">13. On 21 November 1995, the U.S. District Court granted NATG\u2019s Motion for Sanctions against Respondent, reiterating Respondent\u2019s lack of legal foundation for the removal of the Texas and Charles County actions to U.S. District Court in Maryland, as well as his failure to explain his actions upon the Court\u2019s request. Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Chasanow concluded that Respondent\u2019s \u201cactions indicate that he did not even conduct the bare minimum legal research required by Rule 11 ____[and that his] oversight is unconscionable.\u201d Furthermore, Judge Chasanow determined that Respondent\u2019s \u201ccarelessness has resulted in inexcusable delay in state court proceedings, has consumed unnecessary time and resources in federal court, and has forced Defendants to spend unwarranted amounts on litigation.... \u201d Respondent was ordered to pay $2500 within 30 days of the date of the Order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">14. On 29 November 1995, the federal District Court action was dismissed pursuant to the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal filed by Respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">15. Respondent appealed Judge Ch\u00e1sanow\u2019s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The Fourth Circuit affirmed the Order for Sanctions on 27 April 1997.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">D. <em>Accounting, Fees, and Expenses</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-9\">1. Weaver\u2019s wife, Marilyn, testified that she assisted Respondent on one occasion when one of his secretaries left. She testified that \u201cwhen she first arrived at Respondent\u2019s office, the office looked like someone had thrown a party for a four year old.\u201d She stated that \u201cthere were files on the floor and documents were missing.\u201d After two days, she was able to sort the NATG files and put them into binders in chronological order. She indicated that there was no evidence that Respondent kept time sheets for the work he did on the NATG case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-10\">2. Marilyn testified that, once Respondent hired a new secretary, she and the new secretary initiated an accounting system for Respondent, but that she was uncertain whether Respondent ever maintained the system. Marilyn also indicated that Respondent fired the new secretary when she refused to send Impero a bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>for $7000. Additionally, Marilyn testified that Respondent told her to \u201ctell [Impero] he owes us $7000 and $500 in expenses.\u201d Marilyn relayed the message to Impero, who requested an accounting of the amount.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-4\">3. Despite repeated requests for accounting, Respondent did not provide Weaver or Impero with any formal accounting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">4. A bill dated 25 April 1995 to Impero from Respondent totaled $11,550, less $10,000 already received, for services rendered between 8 March 1995 and 25 April 1995.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">5. In a letter dated 1 May 1995, Respondent addressed the scope of his legal representation of Impero and Weaver and his fees for services rendered. He noted his hourly fee of $150, explaining that, \u201c[i]n essence, each client is charged $75.00 per hour for all representations, even though in some instances the matters may refer only to. one client, and at other instances the matters will refer to the other client.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">6. Weaver testified that Impero paid Respondent $50,000 on their behalf over the course of the representation. Impero indicated in a note to Respondent that he had paid Respondent $5000, and that he was sending Respondent a $20,000 check, dated 2 May 1995. He also stated that he would send Respondent $10,000 more by July 1995.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">7. In a letter dated 26 June 1995, Respondent informed Impero and Weaver that, as to the Chicago arbitration, Respondent had hired an attorney to assist him for $1000 as a retainer and at the rate of $100 per hour. Respondent also said he had hired an attorney to assist with the Texas action at the rate of $175 per hour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\">Additionally, Respondent indicated that he had spent approximately 168 hours on legal representation, excluding social hours, to date. He said he also had incurred $3000 in various business expenses, but acknowledged that Impero had already advanced him $32,000 to cover services rendered in the Texas action for him and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Weavers. Respondent did not provide any accounting of his hours or receipts to validate his expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-4\">8. In response to Impero\u2019s concern over Respondent\u2019s fee, Respondent, in a letter dated 5 July 1995, acknowledged \u201cthat there may have been a colossal misunderstanding on the issue of expenses.\u201d He went on to describe client expense accounts in general, noting that such a \u201cfund has not been established by this office as the extent of the expenses has not been known at the time of our agreement.\u201d He explained that \u201c[t]he reason for [his] restraint on that issue is that expenses in general do not depend on the client\u2019s attorney only, but is also contingent on the activities of other attorneys as well.\u201d He hoped that the year\u2019s end expenses would not exceed $15,000, but reminded Impero that \u201cthe retainers for the indispensable local counsel in Chicago and Houston are set at $6000,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the sum considered indeed a tremendous bargain in the legal profession.\u201d Telling him that an accounting would follow, Respondent asked Impero to pay the retainer fee to the attorney in Texas in the interim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-5\">9. On 10 July 1995, Impero answered Respondent\u2019s letter by explaining his financial situation and by setting forth the fees which he had paid to Respondent and the other attorneys to date. He noted that he had financed \u201cthis endeavor 100%\u201d and that he could only \u201ccommit to a maximum of an additional $40,000 on top of the $11,000 paid to [his] first attorneys, $10,000 paid to [Respondent] when [he] agreed to [Respondent\u2019s] representing [the Imperos], followed by an additional $20,000, with an additional $10,000 to be paid at a later date.\u201d Additionally, Impero stated that Biotrace, the other company in the Chicago arbitration, had paid Respondent $2500 for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>services rendered and another $2500 would be forthcoming. Impero also questioned Respondent\u2019s deposition fee ($1080) and travel expense reimbursement requests ($776), as Impero had already paid Respondent $2000 for deposition fees and filing fees in the Maryland action, and $2700 in travel expenses between Chicago and Houston.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-4\">10. In an unsigned letter dated 15 August 1995 to the local counsel in Texas, Respondent stated that their arrangement called \u201cfor a set fee in the amount of $80.00 per hour and a contingent fee of an additional $45.00 per hour, the aggregate hourly fee being $125.00 .... [with] any expenses incurred in connection therewith shall be reimbursed to your office, <em>ie., </em>telephone, secretarial and paralegal services and the like.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-5\">11. In a letter to Impero dated 5 October 1995, Respondent stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">In consideration of the Retainer Agreement Provisions, I would like to request the following (a) Commitment to immediately discharge your obligation committed to in June of 1995 and pay to this office $7500.00, $7000.00 being the balance due from the committed payment of $10,000.00 and an additional balance of $500.00 advanced to defray part of the expenses; and (b) Further stipulations that you will fund all assignments with not less than $5000.00 per month to be advanced for fees and expenses on a timely basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">12.

Acknowledging that Respondent possessed sufficient legal competence to represent Weaver in the matters undertaken, the hearing judge nonetheless determined that Respondent failed to exercise \u201crequisite thoroughness and preparation required of an attorney because he failed to research the removal issue.\u201d Respondent excepts to this finding, arguing that the U.S. District Court in Maryland should not have granted any sanctions against him because the grounds for filing the removal petition were not baseless and that Judge North should not have based her conclusion that Respondent violated MRPC 1.1 on a \u201cwholesale acceptance of the Rule 11 [sanction] matter.\u201d We overrule Respondent\u2019s exceptions as to his violation of MRPC 1.1 for the reasons set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">In <em>Mooney, </em>we noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-9\">The requirement of adequate preparation has long been recognized as part of a lawyer\u2019s responsibility to provide competent representation, and it is not without significance that, in the current Code of Professional Responsibility embodied in the MLRPC, the duty to provide competent representation is given \u201cthe place of honor as the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>ingredient in the lawyer-client relationship.\u201d Former DR 6-101(A)(2) precluded a lawyer from handling a matter \u201cwithout preparation adequate in the circumstances,\u201d and the failure to make a proper investigation of the facts of a case prior to trial has led to discipline.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">359 Md. at 75, 753 A.2d at 27 (quoting 1 Geoffrey C.

Felker, </em>770 P.2d 402 (Colo.1989)). Moreover, the Comment to MRPC 1.1 explains that \u201c[cjompetent handling of a particular matter includes inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem, and use of methods and procedures.... It also includes adequate preparation. . .. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Judge North found in this case by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent filed the Petition for Removal without researching properly the applicable laws or rules. The fact that the U.S. District Court also found that Respondent\u2019s preparation was lacking woefully, and thus deserving of sanction, is sustentative of the hearing judge\u2019s independent finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">We conclude that Respondent\u2019s filing of the removal petition was more than \u201cwithout preparation adequate in the circumstances\u201d; by not assuming the relatively simple, yet essential, task of consulting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Respondent clearly dishonored his obligation to provide Weaver with competent representation. We, therefore, overrule Respondent\u2019s exception and agree with Judge North\u2019s conclusion that, while Respondent possessed the ability to conduct such research, he inexplicably failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">C. <em>Violation of MRPC 1.3</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct <em>1.3 </em>\u2014 Diligence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-9\">A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Judge North concluded that Respondent violated MRPC 1.3 based on her findings that Respondent failed repeatedly to return Weaver\u2019s phone calls, respond to his letters, allow him to review his file, or provide basic accounting for assertedly earned fees. Arguing that he \u201cdem\u00f3nstratela] an overabundance of diligence and concern in representing the interests of Mr. Impero and Mr. Weaver,\u201d Respondent advances three exceptions to these findings. First, he argues that he correctly refused to permit Weaver to review the files because \u201cRespondent\u2019s representation chiefly was of Mr. Impero.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Second, Respondent argues that \u201cany lapse of communication did not cause any adverse effect on the conduct of the litigation.\u201d Third, Respondent contests that Weaver requested an accounting and argues that, even if he did, any accounting that Respondent would be required to provide would be owed to Impero (who did not testify before Judge North) because Impero \u201cwas to provide the main financial support for the litigation and representation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Judge North was presented with voluminous documents from Respondent\u2019s office, most of which were either in complete disarray or \u201corganized\u201d in a chaotic sort of filing system. Nonetheless, she was able to determine that, while a signed fee agreement between Respondent and Weaver may not have existed, Weaver was one of Respondent\u2019s clients. In a letter to Impero and Weaver, dated 1 May 1995, Respondent \u201cconfirm[s] the consensus reached among yourselves [Weaver and Impero] and this counsel on the wide range\u201d of legal representation and legal fees. Respondent states that he will represent Impero and Weaver in \u201cany proceeding in the States of Maryland[,] Texas, and Illinois at a single rate of $150.00 per hour. In essence, <em>each client </em>is charged with $75.00 per hour for all representations, even though in some instances the matters may refer only to one client....\u201d (Emphasis added). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Additionally, Weaver terminated Respondent\u2019s representation of him in a letter dated 7 November 1995; such a dismissal supports the notion that an attorney-client relationship previously existed between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Given the evidentiary support for these findings of fact, we overrule Respondent\u2019s first and third exceptions. With respect to the first exception, whether Impero was Respondent\u2019s principal client in the NATG dispute does not negate the fact that Weaver also was Respondent\u2019s client in that dispute. As to the third exception, Weaver, as a client of Respondent\u2019s, maintained the right to review his file and receive an accounting of Respondent\u2019s billing, even if Impero, and not Weaver, was paying for Weaver\u2019s accrued fees. The 1 May 1995 letter clearly indicates that Respondent charged Weaver $75 per hour for representation. Whether the \u201cconsensus\u201d reached between Impero and Weaver included an agreement for Impe-ro to pay Weaver\u2019s fees is irrelevant. Respondent did not purport to represent Weaver as a <em>pro bono </em>client; rather, Respondent charged Weaver for services and, as a result, Weaver should have been given access to the files and Respondent owed a duty of accounting for time and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">We also overrule Respondent\u2019s second exception, as we find no merit in Respondent\u2019s assertion of \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d and \u201call is well that ends well.\u201d Respondent implies that, because Weaver\u2019s cases were dismissed ultimately, the fact that Respondent failed to communicate with his client is immaterial. We disagree. Specifically, we remind Respondent that, by failing to dismiss the Charles County action in accordance with Weaver\u2019s instructions, he risked derailing Weaver\u2019s settlement efforts. Respondent should note that, in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Pinkney, </em>we held that an attorney violated MRPC 1.3 when she led her client to believe she had filed a lawsuit on the client\u2019s behalf when, in fact, she had not done so. 311 Md. 137, 141, 532 A.2d 1367, 1369 (1987). We determined that the attorney violated the rule \u201cby neglecting a matter entrusted to her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the present case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Respondent clearly neglected a matter \u2014 Weaver\u2019s instructions to dismiss the Charles County action \u2014 entrusted to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Additionally, we stated in <em>Mooney, </em>\u201cthis Court has consistently regarded neglect and inattentiveness to a client\u2019s interests to be [an ethical violation] warranting the imposition of some disciplinary sanction.\u201d 359 Md. at 76, 753 A.2d at 27 (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Montgomery, </em>296 Md. 113, 120, 460 A.2d 597, 600 (1983)). We conclude that Judge North correctly found, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent\u2019s inattentiveness to Weaver\u2019s interests rose to a level of neglect unacceptable in the legal profession. Therefore, Respondent violated MRPC 1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">D. <em>Violation of MRPC 1.4</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct <em>1.4 </em>\u2014 Communi<em>cation.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">(a) A lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-8\">(b) A lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">Judge North found that, although Respondent initially maintained the appropriate level of communication with his client, Respondent\u2019s diligence in keeping Weaver current on the status of his cases diminished greatly during the later course of the representation. Judge North found that Respondent failed to keep Weaver adequately apprised of the time spent and expenses accrued during the case. Judge North also found that Respondent refused to allow Weaver access to the files, and that he failed to act upon Weaver\u2019s specific requests, such as his 27 October 1995 request that Respondent dismiss the Charles County action. Respondent also failed to inform Weaver in a timely manner of the Motion for Sanctions filed against Weaver, Impero, and Respondent in the U.S. District Court for Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Moreover, Judge North found that Respondent failed to explain to Weaver his strategy in litigating the disputes. While Respondent initially provided Weaver with insight as to why, for example, he wanted to file the complaints in the U.S. District Court for Maryland in a staggered fashion, Respondent failed, as noted above, to inform Weaver of the pending Motion for Sanctions, failed to respond on Weaver\u2019s behalf regarding the sanctions, and failed to return Weaver\u2019s later phone calls with respect to the sanctions. Judge North pointed out that Weaver was forced to send several letters directly to Judge Chasanow because he was unable to reach his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">We conclude that Judge North was presented with clear and convincing evidence upon which to determine that Respondent violated MRPC 1.4. The Comment to MRPC 1.4 provides that \u201ceven when a client delegates authority to the lawyer, the client should be kept advised of the status of the matter,\u201d for \u201c[k]eeping the client informed is a basic responsibility of an attorney.\u201d <em>Mooney, </em>359 Md. at 89, 753 A.2d at 34. Because of the tremendous importance placed upon attorney-client communication, we have stated that \u201cthe lack of communication -with one\u2019s client, for whatever reason, is a matter of continuing concern to the public.\u201d <em>Mooney, </em>359 Md. at 76, 753 A.2d at 27 (quoting <em>Montgomery, </em>296 Md. at 120, 460 A.2d at 600). Respondent\u2019s lack of communication with Weaver, most offensively in regard to his ignoring Weaver\u2019s request to dismiss the Charles County action, is inexcusable and in clear violation of MRPC 1.4. We therefore overrule Respondent\u2019s exceptions as to this violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">E. <em>Violation of MRPC 1.5(a)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct <em>1.5 </em>\u2014 Fees.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\">(a) A lawyer\u2019s fees shall be reasonable. The factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of a fee include the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-8\">(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>(2) the likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-4\">(3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-5\">(4) the amount involved and the results obtained;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">(5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">(6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">(7) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-9\">(8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">Given the condition of Respondent\u2019s records, Judge North understandably found herself unable to fathom any bookkeeping system Respondent might have, employed. Although she determined Respondent\u2019s fee was set at a reasonable $150 per hour, given Respondent\u2019s expertise and experience, she questioned the claimed $150,000 total fee because it was impossible to determine from the billing \u201csystem\u201d whether Respondent actually earned that amount. The hearing judge realized that Respondent would have had to work 40 hours per week for six and a quarter months on Weaver\u2019s case alone for Weaver (or Impero) to have owed Respondent $150,000. Judge North found, however, no evidence of Respondent even working 20 hours a week on the Weaver and Impero cases during the course of 1995.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Moreover, there was no evidence that Respondent worked solely on the Impero/Weaver/NATG matter, which he asserts became \u201cin essence Respondent\u2019s exclusive professional practice [during 1995].\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>On the contrary, Judge North found in Respondent\u2019s records evidence that Respondent represented other clients on other matters during the time period in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">We agree with Judge North\u2019s conclusion that Respondent violated subsections of MRPC 1.5(a) and that such a conclusion was supported by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">F. <em>Violation of MRPC 3.1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct <em>3.1 </em>\u2014 Meritorious <em>claims and contentions.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-7\">A lawyer shall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or controvert an issue thereon, unless there is a basis for doing so that is not frivolous, which includes a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law.

She did conclude, however, that Respondent\u2019s act of filing a motion to remove the Texas action, without any legal basis, was prejudicial to the administration of justice. She also found that Respondent interfered with the administration of justice when he failed to mail the Motion for Removal to opposing counsel until two days before a scheduled hearing in Texas, forcing NATG to incur unnecessary expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Respondent excepts to these findings, arguing that he tried to consolidate and remove the Weaver and Impero actions into the U.S. District Court in Maryland in order to \u201clitigate with more practicality.\u201d Respondent also contends that he was not aware of the hearing in Texas for the temporary injunction, and that because he had procured local counsel in the Texas action, he \u201chad no reason to know of any scheduled hearings, assuming there were any....\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Given the clear and convincing evidence upon which Judge North made her conclusions of law, we overrule Respondent\u2019s exceptions. First, having affirmed Judge North\u2019s conclusions that Respondent violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5(a), and 3.1, we conclude that Judge North had clear and convincing evidence upon which to determine that Respondent violated MRPC 8.4(a). Second,- we find it particularly troublesome that Respondent believes that, even though he served as lead counsel in the NATG dispute for Weaver and Impero, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>nevertheless was absolved of the responsibility of keeping abreast of any recent filings by the opposing party and resultant court hearing dates because he had hired local counsel to, in his words, \u201cassist\u201d him with the case. In a 26 June 1995 letter, Respondent reassured Weaver and Impero that he, and not the Texas counsel, would be doing the bulk of the work on their case. As we noted in <em>Mooney, </em>\u201c[fjailure to represent a client in an adequate manner violates MRPC 8.4(d).\u201d 359 Md. at 83, 753 A.2d at 31. By not fulfilling the duties he owed to his client, Respondent failed to represent Weaver adequately. We also address briefly Respondent\u2019s strenuous exceptions here to Judge Chasanow\u2019s denial of his Petition for Removal and Consolidation \u201cwithout a hearing, and <em>prior to any opposition to it submitted by opposing counsel.\u201d </em>(Respondent\u2019s emphasis). Respondent seems to imply that Judge Chasanow\u2019s actions were inappropriate. We find this implication \u2014 that a court cannot, <em>sua sponte, </em>deny a motion to remove a case for lack of jurisdiction \u2014 to be completely unfounded, without any support, and having no place, as a collateral attack, in this disciplinary proceeding. We therefore reject entirely Respondent\u2019s argument on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">In determining the proper sanction for Respondent\u2019s misconduct, we note that it is well settled that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">\u201c[t]he purpose of disciplinary proceedings against an attorney is to protect the public rather than to punish the erring attorney.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v.

Respondent counters that disciplinary action is not warranted when, \u201cif anything, this is a case of over-zealous representation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">In <em>Brown, </em>353 Md. at 281, 725 A.2d at 1073, we agreed with the hearing judge\u2019s findings that Brown violated MRPC 1.3, 1.4, 3.3, 5.5, 7.1, and 8.4. Despite mitigating factors,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> such as the attorney having \u201creduced his case load since the complaints were filed, sought a mentor on case management procedures [ ], changed his office mailing procedures, and sought counseling for his \u2018tendencies\u2019 to procrastinate,\u201d we ordered an indefinite suspension, with the right to reapply for admission in one year. <em>Brown, </em>353 Md. at 296, 725 A.2d at 1081.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">In <em>Mooney, </em>the hearing judge found that Mooney provided incompetent representation when he failed, among other things, to appear in court for a client\u2019s trial and to maintain communications with his clients. 359 Md. at 64, 67, 69-70, 753 A.2d at 21, 23, 25. Upholding the conclusions that Mooney violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 5.1, 5.3, and 8.4, we suspended Mooney indefinitely from the practice of law. 359 Md. at 97, 753 A.2d at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Cohen, </em>an attorney who was the subject of two complaints, one involving a custody dispute and the other a bankruptcy proceeding, was found to have violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 8.1(a), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d). <em>Cohen, </em>361 Md. 161, 167, 760 A.2d 706, 709, 713-14, 2000 Md. Lexis 670, at *9-10, *24-25 (2000). On that record, we determined that Respondent possessed \u201cvery little or no appreciation of the seriousness of his misconduct\u201d and that his \u201cpattern of behavior demonstrates Respondent\u2019s inability to conform his conduct within the bounds of the Maryland Lawyer\u2019s Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d <em>Cohen, </em>361 Md. at 178, 760 A.2d at 715, 2000 Md.

Noting that we had previously imposed a 90 day suspension for the attorney\u2019s prior violations of MRPC 4.4 and 8.4(d), we ordered an indefinite suspension, with the right to reapply for admission in six months. <em>Cohen, </em>361 Md. at 179, 760 A.2d at 716, 2000 Md.

Consistent with <em>Mooney, Cohen, </em>and <em>Brown, </em>we order an indefinite suspension for Respondent, for we find that to be the appropriate sanction in light of Respondent\u2019s conduct here and of the prior reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT; INCLUDING THE COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-715(c), FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION OF MARYLAND AGAINST DUSHAN S.
