On March 8, 1999, these exceptions were heard by a judge in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. At that hearing, the court held its decision <em>sub curia </em>so that it could listen to the recording of the master\u2019s adjudicatory hearing. On April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>16, 1999, after listening to the recording, the court overruled petitioner\u2019s exceptions. A timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals was noted on May 3, 1999. In an unreported decision filed April 17, 2000, the Court of Special Appeals upheld the trial court\u2019s delinquency finding. We granted petitioner\u2019s Writ of Certiorari to answer one question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">Is the evidence sufficient to establish \u201cwearing and carrying\u201d of a dangerous or deadly weapon in violation of Md. AnmCode, Art. 27, \u00a7 36, where the prosecution proves nothing more than [that] the police found a shotgun under [a] mattress in Respondent\u2019s room at a time when Respondent was not even home?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">We hold that, under the circumstances of this case, the evidence was insufficient to establish \u201cwearing and carrying\u201d of a dangerous or deadly weapon in violation of Article 27, section 36. Accordingly, we shall reverse the decision of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">On December 28, 1998, petitioner\u2019s mother, Ms. H., found a shotgun under the mattress in petitioner\u2019s bedroom and called the police. Officer Thomas Sernek received the call and responded to petitioner\u2019s home at 4102 Eierman Avenue in Baltimore City. Upon his arrival, Officer Sernek was met by petitioner\u2019s mother who explained that she had found the gun when she was cleaning petitioner\u2019s room. She led the officer to petitioner\u2019s bedroom where, under petitioner\u2019s mattress, Officer Sernek discovered a pistol-gripped shotgun. He seized the weapon and unloaded three shotgun shells from it. Petitioner was not home at the time the shotgun was found by his mother nor was he home at the time it was seized by Officer Sernek.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">After seizing the weapon, Officer Sernek transported petitioner\u2019s mother to another location, returned to petitioner\u2019s home with another officer, and knocked on the front door.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>this time, petitioner was home and when he answered the door, he was arrested by the two officers and transported to the Northern District Police Station for processing. Officer Sernek testified at the adjudication hearing that petitioner, after being properly advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, voluntarily stated that he had purchased the shotgun from a \u201cjunkie\u201d on a street corner for $20.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">At the January 15, 2000 adjudicatory hearing in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, the juvenile master found that petitioner</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">had purchased the gun and that he had hidden the gun under the mattress. [The master] made the inference that [petitioner] concealed the gun from the time he bought it until the time he hid it under the mattress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Based on this finding of fact, the juvenile master found petitioner not involved on the first three counts and found petitioner involved on the fourth count against him \u2014 carrying a concealed weapon in violation of Article 27, section 36. On February 9,1999, a disposition hearing was held at which time it was recommended that petitioner be placed on probation to the Maryland Department of Juvenile Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">Petitioner filed a Notice of Exceptions on February 11, 1999. These exceptions were heard on March 8, 1999 by a judge in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. At that hearing, the court held its decision <em>sub curia </em>so that it could listen to the recording of the adjudicatory hearing. The court, at the hearing, overruled petitioner\u2019s exceptions finding that the loaded shotgun was a dangerous weapon and adopted the master\u2019s finding that petitioner was involved with illegally wearing or carrying it. The court agreed with the master\u2019s inference that petitioner \u201chad to wear or carry the shotgun from the street corner to his home.\u201d Additionally, the court found that the weapon\u2019s presence under petitioner\u2019s mattress \u201cmay satisfy the \u2018in such proximity to him\u2019 requirement as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>make it available for his immediate use and therefore satisfies the standard.\u201d The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-5\">Based on my own independent review, I do believe that it\u2019s a proper inference that [petitioner] would have to wear or carry the shot gun from the street corner to his home, and if the shot gun was received [concealed?] or located underneath his mattress, I believe it satisfies the \u201cin close proximity to him requirement\u201d of the statute. Really, the next quick argument raised by [petitioner], is that the person carrying the weapon must have the general intent to carry the instrument for [its] use as a weapon either offensively or in defense. This is a question of fact to be determined by the fact finder based on all the circumstances.... In this case, the controverted [sic ?] testimony is we have a 14 year-old hiding a loaded and operable shot gun, with a pistol grip, under his mattress, after admittedly buying it on a street corner. I do believe, based on that, that the [c]ourt can infer the intent necessary under the statu[t]e. Next, [petitioner] [posits] in his Memorandum of law, that a conviction cannot lay where a weapon is found in [petitioner\u2019s] home. There is a discussion about the statute having potentially far reaching implications of public policy. I do think, that it should be clear, as a result of this [c]ourt\u2019s decision, that a 14 year-old has no legal right to possess and buy a firearm. He is not an adult homeowner in legal possession of a shotgun and therefore, it is not needed to protect his home and his family. Indeed, the purpose of a pistol grip on a shot gun is to make the weapon concealable, which is not a concern when a weapon is discovered concealed in a home.... Accordingly, for the aforegoing reasons, and based upon this [c]ourt\u2019s own independent review of the record, I do find that [petitioner] carried a dangerous and deadly weapon concealed upon, or about his person, or in such proximity to him as would make it available for his immediate use, and he did have the general intent to carry the instrument for [its] use as a weapon, either offensively or defensively. Accordingly, based on this [c]ourt\u2019s own independent review of the record, I find that the State had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>satisfied [its] burden beyond a reasonable doubt and accordingly, I will deny [petitioner\u2019s] exception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The only evidence presented at the adjudicatory hearing was petitioner\u2019s statement to the officer that he bought the weapon on a street corner and the fact that his mother, and the officer, found it under his mattress in his bedroom in his home. There was absolutely no other evidence regarding the status of the shotgun from the time it was purchased to the time that it was discovered by petitioner\u2019s mother. The record does not reflect when Colby H. purchased the weapon, the specific location of its purchase, when the purchase was made, the modality of conveyance of the weapon from the street corner to the place it was found, or the identity of who conveyed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals rejected as unsupported by fact the juvenile master\u2019s inference that petitioner \u201chad worn or carried the shot gun concealed \u2018on or about his person\u2019 in order to transport the gun from the street corner where he acquired it to his bedroom.\u201d That court acknowledged that the State had directly proved that petitioner had purchased a dangerous weapon on an unnamed street corner from a \u201cjunkie\u201d and that this dangerous weapon was found in petitioner\u2019s bedroom under his mattress. However, that court also recognized and held that there was absolutely no evidence presented that petitioner ever concealed the weapon when he transported it from the corner to his residence. The Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-7\">The record does not disclose either the time of day or the place where [petitioner] purchased the weapon. The shot gun could have been purchased ten feet from [petitioner\u2019s] front door or ten miles away from his home. The sale could have been made at 8:00 a.m. when no one else was around, or at high noon when hundreds of people might have seen [petitioner] if he had dared to carry the weapon openly. The trier of fact had no knowledge as to whether [petitioner] walked home with the shot gun or whether he had someone drive him home. With so little information, it simply cannot be inferred legitimately that [petitioner] con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>cealed the weapon when he transported it from the place of purchase to his home.<footnotemark>[6]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">We agree. The Court of Special Appeals did hold, however, that there was sufficient proof to infer legitimately that the weapon, while under the mattress, was concealed and in such proximity to petitioner as would make it available to him for immediate use. Therefore, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court and held \u201cthat there was sufficient evidence from which a reasonable fact-finder could conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that [petitioner] violated Section 36(a).\u201d We disagree with this holding. The evidence was insufficient to establish that petitioner illegally wore and carried a dangerous or deadly weapon concealed upon his person in violation of Article 27, section 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Part One</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Article 27, Section 36</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">The threshold issue before this Court is to determine the scope of Maryland\u2019s concealed weapon statute and whether it applies to legal weapons<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> stored in a Maryland resident\u2019s home. Maryland Annotated Code (1957,1996 Repl.Vol.), Article 27, section 36 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-9\">\u00a7 36. Carrying or wearing concealed weapon; carrying openly with intent to injure; carrying by person under eighteen at night in certain counties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-10\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 (1) <em>Every person who shall wear or carry </em>any dirk knife, bowie knife, switchblade knife, star knife, sandclub, metal knuckles, razor, nunchaku, or <em>any </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number><em>other dangerous or deadly weapon of any kind, whatsoever </em>(penknives without switchblade and handguns, excepted) <em>concealed upon or about his person, </em>and every person who shall wear or carry any such weapon, chemical mace, pepper mace, or tear gas device openly with the intent or purpose of injuring any person in any unlawful manner, <em>shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, </em>and upon conviction, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or be imprisoned in jail, or sentenced to the Maryland Department of Correction for not more than three years. [Some emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">When attempting to discern the intention of the Legislature in enacting a particular statute, we have recently said in <em>Edgewater Liquors, Inc. v. Liston, </em>349 Md. 803, 709 A.2d 1301 (1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">\u201cIn construing the meaning of a word in a statute, the cardinal rule is to ascertain and carry out the real legislative intention.\u201d Legislative intent generally is derived from the words of the statute at issue. \u201cWe are not constrained, however, by ... \u2018the literal or usual meaning\u2019 of the terms at issue.\u201d \u201cFurthermore, we do not read statutory language \u2018in isolation or out of context [but construe it] in light of the legislature\u2019s general purpose and in the context of the statute as a whole.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 807-08, 709 A.2d at 1303 (internal citations omitted) (alteration in original). We commented in an earlier case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-8\">When we pursue the context of statutory language, we are not limited to the words of the statute as they are printed in the Annotated Code. We may and often must consider other \u201cexternal manifestations\u201d or \u201cpersuasive evidence,\u201d including a bill\u2019s title and function paragraphs, amendments that occurred as it passed through the legislature, its relationship to earlier and subsequent legislation, and other material that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal, which becomes the context within which we read the particular language before us in a given case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>... Thus, in <em>State v. One 1983 Chevrolet Van, </em>309 Md. 327, 524 A.2d 51 (1987), ... [although we did not describe any of the statutes involved in that case as ambiguous or uncertain, we did search for legislative purpose or meaning \u2014 what Judge Orth, writing for the Court, described as \u201cthe legislative scheme.\u201d ... <em>See also Ogrinz v. Jomes, </em>309 Md. 381, 524 A.2d 77 (1987), in which we considered legislative history (a committee report) to assist in construing legislation that we did not identify as ambiguous or of uncertain meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 514-15, 525 A.2d 628, 632-33 (1987); <em>see Laznovsky v. Laznovsky, </em>357 Md. 586, 606-07, 745 A.2d 1054, 1065 (2000); <em>State v. Bell, </em>351 Md. 709, 717-19, 720 A.2d 311, 315-16 (1998); <em>see also Williams v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>359 Md. 101, 115-17, 753 A.2d 41, 49 (2000); <em>Riemer v. Columbia Medical Plan, </em>358 Md. 222, 235-36, 747 A.2d 677, 684-85 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The language of the statute at issue creates one offense\u2014 the carrying of a dangerous weapon under either of two circumstances: (1) concealed; or (2) openly with the intent to injure. <em>Eldridge v. State, </em>329 Md. 307, 313, 619 A.2d 531, 534 (1993). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we are concerned with the first way the offense can be committed \u2014 by carrying a concealed dangerous weapon. For our analysis it will be helpful to reduce the statute to the language of the statute pertinent to the case at bar: \u201cEvery person who shall wear or carry ... any ... dangerous or deadly weapon of any kind, whatsoever ... concealed upon or about his person, ... shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Looking to the plain language of the statute we recognize that there are three distinct elements necessary to constitute a violation. First, the weapon in question must be one of the weapons listed or considered to be a dangerous or deadly weapon. In <em>Anderson v. State, </em>328 Md. 426, 438, 614 A.2d 963, 968 (1992), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>In order to violate \u00a7 36(a) by the concealed wearing or carrying of an instrument which has not legislatively been declared to be a dangerous or deadly weapon <em>per se, </em>the trier of fact must first determine whether the instrument constitutes a \u201cdangerous or deadly weapon.\u201d The concealed carrying prohibition of \u00a7 36(a) is not violated simply because the instrument can be used to inflict serious or deadly harm. The person carrying the object must have at least the general intent to carry the instrument for its use as a weapon, either of offense or defense. It is a question of fact, to be decided based on all of the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">There is no question in the case at bar that the loaded, operable shotgun in question falls under the category as a dangerous and deadly weapon.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Second, the person must be wearing or carrying a weapon. \u201cCarry,\u201d taken in its plain meaning, is defined as \u201cto move while supporting; convey; transport\u201d or \u201cto wear, hold, or have around one.\u201d <em>The Random House Dictionary of the English Language </em>227 (1983). Similarly, \u201cwear\u201d is defined as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>\u201cto carry or have on the body or about the person as a covering, equipment, ornament, or the like.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1616. Recently, the Supreme Court of the United States utilized <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\u2019s </em>definition of \u201cCarry arms or weapons\u201d as \u201c[t]o wear, bear or carry them upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose of use, or for the purpose of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in case of a conflict with another person.\u201d <em>Muscarello v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 125, 130, 118 S.Ct. 1911, 1915, 141 L.Ed.2d 111 (1998), quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>214 (6th ed.1990). However, the Supreme Court in <em>Muscarello </em>also recognized another \u201cform of an important, but secondary, meaning of \u2018carry,\u2019 a meaning that suggests support rather than movement or transportation, as when, for example, a column \u2018carries\u2019 the weight of an arch. In this sense a gangster might \u2018cany\u2019 a gun (in colloquial language, he might \u2018pack a gun\u2019) even though he does not move from his chair.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 131, 118 S.Ct. at 1915-16, 141 L.Ed.2d 111 (citation omitted). The statute plainly states that it is a violation for a person to <em>\u201cwear or carry </em>\u201d a concealed deadly weapon. The weapon must be concealed erad it must be either worn or carried. If it is neither worn nor carried, it is not illegal to conceal it. We hold that the Legislature merely intended that the weapon needed to be on the body or about the person and concealed. It is not necessary that the weapon actually be transported from place to place.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Third, the weapon must be concealed upon or about the person. In <em>Corbin v. State, </em>237 Md. 486, 206 A.2d 809 (1965), we explained the scope of \u201cupon or about\u201d when we said that \u201c[i]n order to support [a] conviction of the carrying or wearing a dangerous or deadly weapon, it [is] necessary that the State establish the fact that the accused was carrying the weapon <em>or that it was in such proximity to him as would make it available for his immediate use.\u201d Id. </em>at 491, 206 A.2d at 812 (emphasis added) (citing <em>Veney v. State, </em>227 Md. 608, 177 A.2d 883 (1962)). In <em>Corbin, </em>we held that Corbin was not in such proximity to two guns, which were concealed in his car while he was standing beside the car and therefore was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>not in violation of Article 27, section 36. It is clear from <em>Corbin </em>that we have limited the term \u201cwear\u201d to include areas that are in very close proximity to an alleged offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">In <em>Corbin, </em>we recognized that a deadly weapon needed to be in such close proximity to the person so as to be available for his immediate use in order to constitute a violation of Article 27, section 36. Such an interpretation makes sense in the context where the weapon concealed is in close proximity to the defendant, and it is \u201cshow that the defendant had at least the \u2018general intent\u2019 to carry the instrument for use as a weapon.\u201d <em>State v. Brinkley, </em>102 Md.App. 774, 779, 651 A.2d 465, 467 (1995); <em>see also Anderson, </em>328 Md. at 443, 614 A.2d at 971 (\u201cFactors to be considered include (1) the nature of the instrument, <em>i.e., </em>its size, shape, condition and possible alteration; (2) the circumstances under which it is carried, <em>ie., </em>the time, place and situation in which defendant is found with it; (3) defendant\u2019s actions <em>vis-a-vis </em>the item; and (4) the place of concealment.\u201d (quoting <em>State v. Blea, </em>100 N.M. 237, 238-39, 668 P.2d 1114, 1115-16 (Ct.App.1983))).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The State has merely proven that there was a weapon under petitioner\u2019s mattress and that the weapon was purchased by petitioner. We do not have any other facts before us concerning the circumstances surrounding the placement of the weapon beneath the mattress and the State has failed to demonstrate that petitioner had the general intent of doing anything other than placing the weapon in its hiding place in the bedroom of his home, presumably a place of safety to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Court of Special Appeals agreed with the ruling of the trial judge and concluded that \u201calthough [petitioner] did not carry the gun while concealed, he concealed it in such close proximity to himself [under the mattress] that it was available for his immediate use.\u201d Under this interpretation of Article 27, section 36, the fact that petitioner was in close proximity with the shotgun at the time he concealed it under his mattress, although he was nowhere near at the time it was found, is sufficient to sustain a conviction. The State has proven, in the courts below, only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>two instances where the weapon might have been in close proximity to petitioner and available for his immediate use\u2014 when he bought it and when he placed it under his mattress. That is not enough to sustain a conviction for possessing a concealed weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 interpretation of Article 27, section 36 distorts the ruling of <em>Corbin </em>as it makes it a violation of Article 27, section 36 simply to conceal a deadly weapon.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The weapon was not discovered on petitioner while he was on the street or in a public place. In fact, as we discussed, <em>supra, </em>petitioner was not even home at the time the shotgun was found by his mother nor was he home at the time it was seized by Officer Sernek. The weapon was discovered and seized inside petitioner\u2019s place of residence when he was not present. He was not \u201ccarrying\u201d or \u201cwearing\u201d it while it was concealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Part Two</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Weapons on Private Property</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">The true issue in this case is whether a conviction of wearing and carrying a dangerous or deadly weapon in violation of Article 27, section 36, can be sustained where the weapon in question, otherwise legal to possess, is found in a place not in open view in the residence of the alleged offender but in close proximity to him. We hold that it cannot. <em>State v. Brinkley, </em>102 Md.App. 774, 651 A.2d 465 (1995), relied on by the State, is distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">In <em>Brinkley, </em>the Court of Special Appeals first addressed the issue, which is presented today, \u201cwhether the crime of carrying a concealed weapon may be accomplished when the accused is on private property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 775, 651 A.2d at 465. Brinkley was a guest at a private residence in Montgomery County when the Maryland-National Capital Park Police executed a search warrant at the premises. He was clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>\u201cwearing\u201d a weapon. There was no evidence that the owner of the premises knew that Brinkley had a weapon on his person or anywhere on the property. During a pat-down search of Brinkley, the police officers discovered a knife inside his left boot and he was charged with carrying a concealed weapon in violation of Article 27, section 36. The trial court dismissed the charge ruling that Article 27, section 36 does not prohibit the carrying of a concealed weapon when the alleged offender is in a private residence. The Court of Special Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-5\">In our view, application of section 36 to private property is not inconsistent with [the purposes of Maryland\u2019s criminal concealed weapons statutes]. Applying section 36 to private property would protect those \u201cunsuspecting members of the public\u201d who find themselves on private property when a dangerous or deadly weapon, previously concealed, is wielded at them. There is no reason to believe that members of the public do not require protection from concealed weapons simply because they are situated on private property. We believe section 36 was enacted to protect members of the public generally, whether they be located on private property or on a public street.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 778-79, 651 A.2d at 467 (footnote omitted). In that case, there was no indication that Brinkley was the owner of the private property, or that the owner of the property had, in any way, given permission for Brinkley to carry the weapon there at issue concealed on Brinkley\u2019s person or even upon the property. An owner of, or a resident in, or a guest invited by the owner or resident, when the owner or resident has knowledge of the weapon does not violate the provision of the statute at issue when he is on such private property and is in possession of a concealed weapon, otherwise legal to possess.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">The State argues in its brief that Article 27, section 36 applies equally to both public and private property. It bases its rationale on the premise that a private property exception exists concerning handguns in the relatively recent Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Cum.Supp.), Article 27, section 36B. The State contends that if the Legislature had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>wanted a private property exception within section 36 it would have expressly put one in that statute. We disagree with the State\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">Article 27, section 36 has remained substantially the same since 1886. <em>See </em>1886 Md. Laws Ch. 375. In 1886, the corresponding statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-5\">Every person not being a conservator of the peace entitled or required to carry such weapon as a part of his official equipment, who shall wear or carry any pistol, dirk-knife, bowie-knife, slung-shot, billy, sand-club, metal knuckles, razor or any other dangerous or deadly weapon of any kind whatsoever, (penknives excepted) concealed upon or about his person, and every person who shall carry or wear any such weapon openly with the intent or purpose of injuring any person, shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than five hundred dollars or be imprisoned not more than six months in jail or the House of Correction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">It is evident from the wording of the statute as originally enacted in 1886 that very little has been done to change the basic premise behind the statute in over 100 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">In 1972, however, the Legislature enacted Article 27, section 36B, concerning the wearing, carrying, or transporting of a handgun. The statute\u2019s purpose is outlined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-8\">(a) <em>Declaration of policy. </em>\u2014 The General Assembly of Maryland hereby finds and declares that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-9\">(1) There has, in recent years, been an alarming increase in the number of violent crimes perpetrated in Maryland, and a high percentage of those crimes involve the use of handguns;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-10\">(2) The result has been a substantial increase in the number of persons killed or injured which is traceable, in large part, <em>to the carrying of handguns on the streets and public ways </em>by persons inclined to use them in criminal activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-11\">(3) The laws currently in force have not been effective in curbing the more frequent use of handguns in perpetrating crime; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>(4) Further regulations on the wearing, carrying, and transporting of handguns are necessary to preserve the peace and tranquility of the State and to protect the rights and liberties of its citizens.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Cum.Supp.), Article 27, section 36B (emphasis added).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Article 27, section 36B was designed to accomplish what the then current laws had been unable to accomplish \u2014 -to crack down on the increased amount of violent crimes committed, primarily in public venues, with the use of handguns. Recognizing this growing problem, the statute included language similar to then already enacted Article 27, section 36. Section 36B also provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANJF\">(b) Any person who shall wear, carry, or transport any handgun, whether concealed or open, upon or about his person, and any person who shall wear, carry or knowingly transport any handgun, whether concealed or open, in any vehicle traveling upon the public roads, highways, waterways, or airways or upon roads or parking lots generally used by the public in this State shall be guilty of a misdemeanor; and it shall be a rebuttable presumption that the person is knowingly transporting the handgun....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Article 27, section 36B prohibits the wearing, carrying or transporting of handguns, whether concealed or open. Although it was passed to address a more serious problem and although it demands a stricter standard than section 36, subsection (c)(4) of 36B nonetheless provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-7\">Nothing in this section shall prevent a person from wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun within the conf\u00ednes of real estate owned or leased by him or upon which he resides or within the confines of a business establishment owned or leased by him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Section 36B was an attempt by the Legislature to reduce the use of handguns primarily in the commission of street crimes of violence. <em>See Dillon v. State, </em>277 Md. 571, 584, 357 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>360, 368 (1976); <em>Wright v. State, </em>24 Md.App. 309, 317, 330 A.2d 482, 487, <em>cert. denied, </em>274 Md. 733 (1975). However, apparently, the Legislature did not want its toughened stance on handguns on the street and in public areas to inadvertently be applied to affect an individual\u2019s right to possess a legal handgun in the home. We interpret the Legislature\u2019s addition of this \u201cprivate property exception\u201d not as support for the State\u2019s position that the absence of such an exception in section 36 should be interpreted to mean that the Legislature intended no distinction for shotguns between private and public property under section 36. Rather, we interpret the \u201cprivate property exception\u201d to mean that the Legislature recognized that, generally, a person has a right to possess a legal firearm in the home.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> With the enacting of 36B(c)(4), the Legislature, it appears to us, simply wanted to safeguard this general right, to possess weapons in one\u2019s home, even as to handguns. The Legislature wanted what was implied in the more lenient section 36 to be specifically expressed in the stricter section 36B. Under the State\u2019s position, it would be legal for a person to have a handgun concealed on his person while standing in the kitchen of his home, but illegal for him to have the kitchen knives in a closed drawer nearby. We cannot accept that the Legislature intended such an incongruous interpretation of these related statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Our rationale is supported by our past recognition of the intertwined relationship between section 36 and section 36B. We noted in <em>Eldridge, </em>329 Md. at 313, 619 A.2d at 534-35 (1993), that an evaluation of section 36B is instrumental in our understanding of section 36:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-6\">Section 36B concerns handguns. Handguns were expressly excepted from the provisions of \u00a7 36 and \u00a7 36B was enacted to fill the void....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>We think that \u00a7 36B, concerned with handguns, is, to all intents and purposes, the counterpart of \u00a7 36, concerned with deadly weapons generally, except handguns. The proscribed conduct in both \u00a7 36(a) and \u00a7 36B(b) is the same\u2014 the carrying of the designated weapon. In view of the similarity of the statutes and our holding in <em>Webb </em>[ <em>v. State, </em>311 Md. 610, 536 A.2d 1161 (1988) ], we conclude that the unit of prosecution in \u00a7 36(a), as we have found it to be in \u00a7 36B(b), is one offense \u2014 the carrying of a deadly weapon, regardless' of whether it is carried concealed or openly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"apz-dedup-0\">Section 36B is a counterpart to section 36, and serves almost as an extension of the same legislative policy. Both attempt to crack down on the problem of the use of deadly weapons in the commission of violent crimes. Section 36B sets a stricter standard on the use of handguns, yet expressly provides for a limited private property 'exception. It would be contrary to the legislative scheme of both statutes for us to now apply a stricter standard concerning rifles and shotguns in private residences under the less evolved and less strict section 36.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>We also look to our prior analysis of the purpose of Maryland\u2019s concealed weapon\u2019s statutes. As we said in <em>Anderson:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYJC\">Criminal statutes dealing with concealed weapons serve two related purposes. First, they seek to protect the public by deterring persons from concealing on or about their persons weapons of which the public would be unaware, thereby preventing injury or death to unsuspecting members of the public. Second, these statutes protect the wearers or carriers of weapons from themselves, by attempting to deter persons from having at hand weapons that could be used in the heat of passion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><em>Anderson, </em>328 Md. at 432, 614 A.2d at 965 (citations omitted). The act of placing a shotgun under a mattress within one\u2019s home is not the type of unrestrained exercise of rights that this statute is attempting to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Section 36 is attempting to prevent incidents on public streets and in publicly accessible areas. As the Court of Appeals of Oregon stated, in a factually similar case involving a person convicted of carrying a concealed weapon (switchblade knife) in his home:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-6\">[T]he [Sjtate\u2019s interpretation would restrict the manner in which one could carry a legal weapon from room to room within one\u2019s home and would inhibit an act that is so intrinsic to ownership and self-defense that it would unreasonably interfere with the exercise of one\u2019s constitutional right to <em>possess </em>the [deadly weapon].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-7\"><em>State v. Stevens, </em>113 Or.App. 429, 432, 833 P.2d 318, 319 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">We recognize that Article 27, section 36 was intended by the Legislature to apply, generally, to persons traveling or congregating on public streets or areas generally accessible to the public. It was not designed to apply to people on their private property or people who reside in, or are an invited guest on that property when the owner has knowledge of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>weapon. To apply this statute to people concealing weapons on such private property who have a legitimate reason for being on that property could lead to absurd results.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">In statutory construction, absurd results are to be avoided. In <em>D &amp; Y, Inc. v. Winston, </em>320 Md. 534, 538, 578 A.2d 1177, 1179 (1990), we stated that \u201cconstruction of a statute which is unreasonable, illogical, unjust, or inconsistent with common sense should be avoided.\u201d <em>See also, e.g., Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 418, 722 A.2d 887, 895 (1999) (\u201c[W]e should construe the statute in a manner that results in an interpretation \u2018reasonable and consonant with logic and common sense.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Lems v. State, </em>348 Md. 648, 654, 705 A.2d 1128, 1131 (1998))); <em>Edgewater Liquors, </em>349 Md. at 808, 709 A.2d at 1303 (\u201c[W]e approach statutory construction from a common sense perspective.\u201d); <em>Lewis, </em>348 Md. at 662, 705 A.2d at 1135 (\u201cWe shall not interpret a statute to produce unusual or extraordinary results, absent the clear legislative intent to enact such a provision.\u201d); <em>Blandon v. State, </em>304 Md. 316, 319, 498 A.2d 1195, 1196 (1985) (\u201c[Rjules of statutory construction require us to avoid construing a 'statute in a way which would lead to absurd results.\u201d); <em>Comptroller v. Fair-child Indus., Inc., </em>303 Md. 280, 284, 493 A.2d 341, 343 (1985) (\u201cA statute should not be construed by forced or subtle interpretations.... \u201d). Under the State\u2019s theory, a resident or owner of premises would have to keep his knives, his handguns, his rifles, his shotguns, and every other type of weapon, or potential weapon, in the open; <em>ie., </em>standing in the corner, on the coffee table, on the counter, on top of the bed, in the center of the floor. To conceal a weapon by hiding it in order to reduce the likelihood that a child will discover it, and use it, would be a crime. That is absurd.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Moreover, the State\u2019s position that a weapon may not be concealed on private property, if it resulted in weapons being left unconcealed, <em>as it might, </em>would lead to violations of other statutes. Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Article 27, section 36K, titled \u201cAccess to firearms by minors\u201d provides in relevant part in subsection (b): \u201can individual may not store <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>or leave a loaded firearm in any location where the individual knew or should have known that an unsupervised minor would gain access to the firearm.\u201d Any person violating the provisions of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine of not more that $1000. If we were to adopt the State\u2019s position that shotguns may not be concealed, i.e., that they must be in open view, every hunter in Maryland with small children would be forced to violate one statute or the other: Keep the shotgun on the counter in violation of section 36K, or hide it from the child, i.e., conceal it in violation of section 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">We hold that, generally, a person in legal possession of a dangerous and deadly weapon may conceal or store it as long as they are on property, which they own, or are a legal resident of, or are an invited guest who has informed the owner or resident of the presence of the weapon. To hold otherwise would turn this statute on its ear. How could a person place knives into a kitchen drawer without concealing them and violating this statute upon closing the drawer? How could a responsible hunter place shotguns in a gun cabinet without concealing them and violating this statute? How could an owner, and invited guests, transport encased shotguns across the \u201cback 40\u201d to the duck hunting blinds along the edge of the marsh or the deer-stand along the edge of the woods? How could a homeowner keep weapons for his protection without having them readily and illegally accessible to children? Clearly it was not the intent of the Legislature to make it a misdemeanor to put away silverware or to store a legal firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Petitioner was concealing a weapon within his home. We hold that section 36 does not prohibit the concealing of otherwise legal weapons in one\u2019s residence, or on one\u2019s property, or on the private property of others, if the owner of that property is made aware of the presence of the otherwise legal weapon. This holding applies to owners, residents, renters, and, as we have indicated, under certain circumstances and conditions, even invited guests.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">We hold that, generally, a person in possession of a legal dangerous and deadly weapon may conceal or store it so long as they are on property, which they own, are a legal resident of, or are present on as an invited guest if the owner has knowledge of the possession of the weapon. The evidence presented in the case <em>sub judice </em>is insufficient to establish \u201cwearing and carrying\u201d of a dangerous or deadly weapon in violation of Article 27, section 36, where the evidence presented proves merely that the police found a shotgun under a mattress in petitioner\u2019s room where he resided. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Special Appeals and remand the case to that court with instructions to vacate the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY; COSTS TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENT .</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Judges RAKER, HARRELL and RODOWSKY, JJ., concur in Part One of the Opinion and in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-8\">.

There was, however, discussion (during oral arguments) as to whether Article 27, section 36 is the controlling statute. No evidence was presented during trial from which we could determine the actual length of the pistol gripped shotgun seized from petitioner\u2019s bedroom. The only information provided about the weapon came in respect to the alleged violation of a municipal ordinance prohibiting the carrying of a shotgun with a barrel of over fourteen inches. Baltimore City Code, Art. 19, section 97. Petitioner was charged with violating that statute as well, but the court found the facts \"not sustained.\u201d The length of the shotgun is determinative of the applicable statute. <em>See, generally, Parrison v. State, </em>335 Md. 554, 644 A.2d 537 (1994). Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.VoL, 2000 Cum.Supp.), section 36F(b) defines a \"handgun\u201d as \"any pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed on the person, <em>including a short-barreled shotgun </em>...\u201d and section 36F(e) defines \"short-barreled shotgun\u201d as \"a shotgun having one or more barrels less than eighteen inches in length and any weapon made from a shotgun (whether by alteration, modification, or otherwise) if such weapon, as modified, has an overall length of less than twenty-six inches.\u201d If the pistol gripped shotgun met this definition, the applicable statute might have been Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.VoL, 2000 Cum.Supp.) section 36B. There was no evidence presented that the shotgun was under 26 inches or that its barrels were under 18 inches.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b757-9\">.

We also note that Baltimore City Code (2000), Article 19, section 59-1, the current version of Article 19, section 97 of the Baltimore City Code, under which petitioner was charged with carrying a shotgun with a barrel over fourteen inches also includes an exception for possession within the home.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b762-5\">. In 1894, in an effort to prevent the use of this statute to promote injustice, the Legislature amended the original language of the statute to exclude those persons carrying a concealed weapon \"as a reasonable precaution against apprehended danger.\u201d In the preamble to this amendment, the Legislature stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-6\">It is represented to this General Assembly that the existing law in reference to the offense of carrying concealed weapons does not make proper discrimination in favor of those who travel in dangerous localities, or from other imminent necessity, <em>or prudent precaution in the presence of threatened injury to their lives or persons, may reasonably arm themselves for self-protection; </em>and the law has been made an instrument of injustice to those not deserving of punishment....
