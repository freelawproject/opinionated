Appellant, Insurance Company of North America et al. (INA),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a Complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County against William Ray Miller, II, appellee, and North American Risk Management, Inc. (NARM),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> alleging several causes of action, including conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, and negligence arising out of Miller\u2019s knowledge of, and participation in, a premium diversion scheme. Appellant filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment for the breach of fiduciary duty claim against Mr. Miller, which was denied by the Circuit Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">When the case went to trial on November 30, 1999, appellant proceeded against appellee on the claims for breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. After the evidentiary phase of the bench trial was concluded, the trial judge entered judgment in favor of NARM on all claims, and entered judgment in favor of appellee on the claims for conversion and \u201csuit on account.\u201d Then the Circuit Court, prior to closing arguments, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>requested that the parties prepare trial memoranda on the relevant law concerning the fiduciary duty that an agent owes to a principal. Closing arguments took place on December 10, 1999, after which the Circuit Court entered judgment in favor of appellee on all remaining counts. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. On our own initiative, we granted review prior to argument in the Court of Special Appeals. Appellant presents two questions to this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-4\">1. Did the trial court err by ruling that Miller did not breach any fiduciary duties and was not negligent by obtaining premium financing for an insurance premium of an INA insured, and using the funds to pay another premium financing company, instead of paying the funds directly to INA for the premium due?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">2. Did the trial court err by ruling that Miller was not an agent of INA for the purpose of collecting premiums and forwarding premiums to INA, and, as a result, did not breach any fiduciary duties by failing to do so?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">We answer both questions in the affirmative. Under the circumstances here present, appellee was an agent of INA for the purpose of collecting and forwarding premiums, which imposed upon him a fiduciary duty to INA, which he breached by failing to forward to INA the relevant premiums and/or by not notifying INA, or timely sharing with INA his knowledge, that the premiums at issue were being improperly diverted. Additionally, appellee breached his fiduciary duty to INA when he actively participated in obtaining premium financing for an insurance premium of an INA insured, and used the funds to return to another premium financing company monies due it on a completely unrelated transaction, instead of causing the funds to be remitted directly to INA for the premium due it. We also hold that appellee\u2019s actions in the double financing scheme, at a minimum, could constitute negligence. Accordingly, we reverse the ruling of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County and shall remand the case to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Appellee has been a licensed insurance agent in the State of Maryland since 1992. Appellee worked at J.L. Hickman &amp; Company, Inc.,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a Texas-based insurance brokerage, from approximately 1993 to early 1997, when the Hickman Agency went out of business. The Hickman Agency\u2019s primary line of business was writing coverage for the funeral industry. At some point prior to August 1995, appellee became the Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President of the Hickman Agency, and held himself out as such. He was paid a salary as an employee of the Hickman Agency and earned commissions on insurance sales generated by himself and the Hickman Agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Effective August 1, 1995, the Hickman Agency entered into a CIGNA Agency Company Agreement with INA. This agreement was signed by appellee as Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President of the Hickman Agency. The agreement created a principal-agent relationship between INA and the Hickman Agency, respectively, from August 1, 1995 until the Hickman Agency ceased operations in early 1997. The agreement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">1 Our Relationship</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">a <em>Authority. </em>You will act as our agent for those lines of business and those territories in which you and we<footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark> are both licensed and where we specifically authorize you to do business....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">2 Your Authority and Duties</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>b <em>Collection of Premiums.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\"><em>' </em>3 All premiums, including return premiums, which you receive are our property. You will hold such premiums as a trustee for us. This trust relationship and our ownership of the premiums will not be affected by our books showing a creditor-debtor relationship, the amount of balances at stated periods or your retention of commissions. Unless we agree otherwise in writing, you must maintain premium monies in a separate bank account and not mingle such monies with your own funds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">On at least two separate occasions, Mr. Miller acknowledged that his personal relationship with INA was that of agent and principal. At trial, Mr. Miller, through counsel, stipulated that he was an appointed agent for INA from October 1995 through the Spring of 1997. Additionally, in a third-party action filed by appellee in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County against Utica Mutual Insurance Company, case number 03-C-97-007281, he again recognized the principal-agent relationship between INA and himself and that the provisions of the agreement applied to him individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">INA has brought this complaint against appellee for his actions and involvement in a complex double financing scheme. According to Ms. Mannino\u2019s<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> testimony, the Hickman Agency had three bank accounts: Account Number 346 was a money market account; Account Number 80900 was referred to as a commission account; and Account Number 722 was a trust account to which premium trust monies were to be deposited so as to be available to pay premiums to insurance carriers. These accounts were not managed properly \u2014 as discussed, <em>infra, </em>the premium dollars, intentionally, were not held \u201cin trust\u201d at the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>The Hickman Agency and appellee<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> were required under Maryland insurance regulations and its agreement with the CIGNA Companies to hold premium dollars paid by an insured or a premium financing company in trust for INA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On redirect examination, Mr. Miller acknowledged that it was a general practice that an insurance company would expect proceeds of a premium financing agreement to be paid directly to it, without being retained by the insurance agency. The Hickman Agency\u2019s cash flow management plan involved agents, including appellee, obtaining an insurance policy for a customer and setting up an installment payment plan for the premium due with the insurance company. The agent would not always inform the insured of the installment plan. At the same time, the agent, in this case appellee, would obtain financing of the same premium amount for the insured through a premium financing company.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">Generally, the premium financing company would pay the full amount of the premium to the Hickman Agency, with the expectation that the full amount would be paid directly to the insurance company. However, under the scheme utilized by the Hickman Agency and known to appellee, the full amount received from the premium financing company was not immediately paid over to insurance companies, including INA. Instead, the Hickman Agency would deposit the premium payment into its own bank account, and only pay the insurance company the amount of the \u201cinstallment\u201d that the insurance company believed, as a result of information furnished by the agency, was due. The insured\u2019s premiums would generally be used to repay the premium financing company over a period of time. Apparently, neither the insureds, nor the premium financing companies, nor the insurer were aware of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>scheme.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The money that improperly remained with the Hickman Agency was moved with appellee\u2019s knowledge and sometimes with his active participation out of the trust account and was apparently used to pay other expenses within the Hickman Agency. This was true for premiums paid to the Hickman Agency on INA accounts as well as accounts of other insurance companies. In other words, the premiums were held \u201cout-of-trust.\u201d By depositing the full amount of the insured\u2019s premium advanced by the premium financing company (or the insured) into its own bank account, the Hickman Agency had the benefit of having the money (or part of it) for its own use from the time the money was received until the money was needed to pay installments to the insurance company.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Appellee was aware of, and actively participated in, and was in charge of, several accounts that had this \u201cdouble financing\u201d scheme in place. The evidence presented on the record demonstrates that he was responsible for signing checks and sending premium payments to INA for \u201cinstallments\u201d that INA believed were due on numerous accounts. Mr. Miller admitted, during direct examination, that \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be necessary for the insured to stretch out payments over time with an installment plan if they had an insurance premium financing plan in place.... \u201d Ms. Suzanne DiSanti, a financial coordinator for the CIGNA Companies, testified that no \u201crule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>or regulation or policy of the CIGNA Companies allow the use of premium funds for anything other than paying CIGNA\u2019s premiums as they are due[.]\u201d She further testified that had CIGNA known of the double financing scheme, it would not have permitted it \u201c[bjecause a policy would never be put on installments if it was known to be premium financed.\u201d She continued, \u201cif we find out that a policy is premium financed and have not been told by the agent or broker, we immediately notify the underwriting department so that they can contact the agent or broker and tell them that all monies have to be paid up front and that the policy is then put back on annual pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">One example of appellee\u2019s participation in the double financing scheme is his actions in January and February of 1997, with respect to an INA insured, Gunther\u2019s Leasing Transport, Inc. (Gunther\u2019s Leasing).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Gunther\u2019s Leasing account included general liability, auto and workers\u2019 compensation coverage and \u201cproduced something in excess of a million dollars in premium.\u201d Gunther\u2019s Leasing account had premium financing in place with INAC, a premium financing company. Sometime in 1996, INAC contacted the Hickman Agency and requested $400,000.00 in premium funds to be returned because of a problem with the Gunther\u2019s Leasing account. Because the Hickman Agency was not segregating premium financing funds, and was using premiums paid into the agency for purposes other than paying premiums, the $400,000.00 that had been paid to the Hickman Agency by INAC, in respect to the Gunther\u2019s Leasing premiums, was not in the Hickman Agency Trust Account. Appellee testified that he became aware of the fact that the funds were out-of-trust in late December 1996 or January 1997. Appellee also testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>the double financing scheme was inappropriate. However, instead of explaining to INAC that the funds were out-of-trust, appellee, himself, obtained premium financing on a completely unrelated Gunther account expressly for the improper purpose of paying back INAC funds relating to the Gunther\u2019s Leasing account.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">To effectuate the scheme, appellee arranged for premium financing of a separate INA policy for workers\u2019 compensation for Gunther\u2019s Leasing, which had a premium of approximately $671,000.00. According to Ms. Mannino\u2019s testimony, premium financing was obtained, at appellee\u2019s direction, from another premium financing company, AI Credit, for approximately $494,000.00 of this premium, not for the stated purpose of remitting the sum to INA on the workers\u2019 compensation policy, but for the purpose of returning to INAC $400,000.00 advanced by INAC on a completely unrelated policy. Ms. Mannino also testified that, pursuant to appellee\u2019s authorization, she signed this premium financing agreement using appellee\u2019s signature stamp. No employee of the Hickman Agency told Gunther\u2019s Leasing, INA, or INAC about the double premium financing arrangement. Specifically, the arrangement was concealed from Gunther\u2019s Leasing, INA, INAC, and AI Credit. Gunther\u2019s Leasing was instructed to pay the premium to the Hickman Agency in installments of approximately $58,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Realizing the potential problems of such activities, Ms. Mannino prepared a Memorandum to John Hickman, dated February 17,1997, in which she outlined the scheme:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">WE ALSO NEED TO REMEMBER THAT RAY [APPELLEE] HAS FINANCED THIS PREMIUM TO PAY THE BALANCE DUE BACK TO INAC. THE MONTHLY INSTALLMENTS ARE DUE IN THE AMOUNT OF $56,612.18 BY 2/15/97. IF WE DO NOT PAY THIS CINDY <footnotemark>[12]</footnotemark> WILL BE GETTING A NOTICE FROM AI CREDIT FOR THE PAYMENT DUE AND WE DO NOT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. I KNOW WE HAD A BALANCE OF 94,000.00 REMAINING FROM THIS AMOUNT FINANCED AFTER WE RETURNED THE 400,000.00 TO INAC. I SAY WE SENT AI CREDIT THE $94,000.00 BACK AND GET THE INSTALLMENTS ADJUSTED AND THEN WE WILL NEED TO REMEMBER THAT WE NEED TO MAKE THESE MONTHLY PAYMENTS ON THE 15TH OF EACH MONTH UNTIL OCTOBER. WE ALSO NEED TO REMEMBER TO MAKE THE PAYMENTS ON TIME SO THAT WE AVOID A CANCELLATION NOTICE BEING SENT TO EITHER GUNTHER\u2019S OR CIGNA [ (INA) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Once the agreement was signed, AI Credit, paid $494,000.00 to the Hickman Agency, which deposited the money into its trust account in January 1997. Immediately thereafter, the money was transferred to another account, from which a check for $400,000.00 was written to INAC. The proceeds of the financing arrangement for the Gunther\u2019s Leasing worker\u2019s compensation policy were not held in trust and were not used to pay the premium of the workers\u2019 compensation policy to the insurer, INA. Instead they were used to pay INAC, the premium financing company on the separate policy. The premium was diverted from INA and, as a result, INA was not paid the proceeds of the financed workers\u2019 compensation policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">INA was not paid the premium for numerous insureds with policies bound through the Hickman Agency. After the Hickman Agency collapsed in 1997, Ms. Mannino sent letters to INA on behalf of several insureds to explain that the insureds had paid the premium for their policies, and that INA should not cancel their policies even though it had not received the premium payments.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> At trial, appellant introduced two examples of installment payments by the Hickman Agency to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>INA for installments INA believed were due, based on the improper representations to INA that the policy premiums would be paid in installments. Appellee signed the checks payable to INA for these improper installment payments. The Hickman Agency collapsed shortly thereafter and its employees tendered their resignations in March 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Appellee admitted that by at least as early as the latter part of 1996, he was aware that the Agency was \u201cout-of-trust\u201d and of the double financing scheme. He did not advise the Maryland Insurance Administration or INA that the Hickman Agency was out-of-trust and he participated in the scheme until at least the end of March 1997. Prior to Ms. DiSanti\u2019s testimony, the parties agreed that the amount of money owed to INA by the Hickman Agency was $597,850.00. Ms. DiSan-ti\u2019s report which contained this information was entered into evidence as plaintiffs exhibit 23. The trial court did not consider the issue of damages in its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">In an action tried without a jury, an appellate court \u201cwill review the case on both the law and the evidence. It will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the \u25a0witnesses.\u201d Md. Rule 8-131(c). However, \u201c[t]he clearly erroneous standard for appellate review in [Maryland Rule 8-131] section (c) ... does not apply to a trial court\u2019s determinations of legal questions or conclusions of law based on findings of fact.\u201d <em>Heat &amp; Power Corp. v. Air Products &amp; Chem. Inc., </em>320 Md. 584, 591, 578 A.2d 1202, 1205 (1990). The determination of the existence of a principal-agent relationship is, generally, a question of fact. The evidence presented in this case, however, demonstrates that Mr. Miller (1) stipulated to the fact that he was an appointed agent of INA, and (2) asserted in court memoranda in a related court proceeding that he was an \u201cappointed agent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Although the trial court acknowledged this stipulation, it improperly limited the scope of his agency under the relevant Maryland law surrounding such principal-agent relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">A. Principal-Agent Relationship</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\u201cAgency is the fiduciary relation which results from the manifestation of consent by one person [the principal] to another [the agent] that the other shall act on his behalf and subject to his control and consent by the other so to act.\u201d <em>Green v. H &amp; R Block, Inc., </em>355 Md. 488, 503, 735 A.2d 1039, 1047 (1999) quoting Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 1 (1958); <em>see Brady v. Ralph Parsons Co., </em>308 Md. 486, 509, 520 A.2d 717, 729-30 (1987); <em>Patten v. Board of Liquor License Comm\u2019rs, </em>107 Md.App. 224, 238, 667 A.2d 940, 947 (1995). Although such a relationship is not necessarily contractual in nature, it is always consensual, <em>Lohmuller Bldg. Co. v. Gamble, </em>160 Md. 534, 539, 154 A. 41, 43 (1931), and its creation is to be determined by the relations of the parties as they exist under their agreements or acts. <em>American Casualty Co. v. Ricas, </em>179 Md. 627, 631, 22 A.2d 484, 487 (1941). The ultimate question is of intent. <em>See Howard Cleaners v. Perman, </em>227 Md. 291, 295, 176 A.2d 235, 237 (1961); <em>American Casualty Co., </em>179 Md. at 631, 22 A.2d at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The record of the case <em>sub judice </em>provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">Q. Can you tell us whether Mr. Miller was an appointed agent by the CIGNA Companies?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-9\">MR. CONTE:<footnotemark>[14]</footnotemark> Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-10\">THE COURT: Is that issue in dispute?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-11\">MR.

CHASON: We\u2019ll take as established.<footnotemark>[15]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">Through counsel, both during the trial of the case at bar, and in the related third-party action, appellee made a judicial admission that he was an agent arising from the Agreement between the Hickman Agency and CIGNA. Under Maryland law, there is a <em>prima facie </em>presumption that an attorney has the authority to bind his client by his actions related to litigation. As we have said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-14\">[T]here is a <em>prima facie </em>presumption that an attorney has authority to bind his client by his actions relating to the . conduct of litigation. <em>Posko v. Climatic Control Corp., </em>198 Md. 578, 584[, 84 A.2d 906]; <em>Wanzer v. State, </em>202 Md. 601, 608[, 97 A.2d 914]; <em>Thomas v. Hopkins, </em>209 Md. 321, 327[, 121 A.2d 192]; <em>Smith v. Warden, </em>213 Md. 643[, 131 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>392]. Cf. 2 <em>Restatement (Second), Agency, </em>\u00a7 284, comment e (1958). This is particularly true of stipulations or admissions made in the course of a trial. The appellee contends, however, that while a client may be bound by an admission by counsel in a pending case, he is not bound in subsequent litigation, and especially where a different issue is presented. We see no reason for the distinction. It is generally recognized that admissions made by an attorney may be available, for proper evidential purposes, in other litigation. See 4 Wigmore, <em>Evidence, </em>\u00a7 1063 (3d ed., 1940), <em>McCormick, Evidence, </em>\u00a7 244, p. 520 (1954), and <em>McGarity v. New York Life Ins. Co., </em>359 Pa. 308, 59 A.2d 47, 50.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-5\"><em>Secor v. Brown, </em>221 Md. 119, 123-24, 156 A.2d 225, 227 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Mr. Miller\u2019s acknowledgment, through counsel, both during the trial proceedings in the case <em>sub judice, </em>and in a third-party action filed by him against Utica Mutual Insurance Company, as to the significance of the Agreement to him individually, is germane to the issue at bar. As we have said, \u201c \u2018[a] man shall not be allowed to blow hot and cold, to claim at one time and deny at another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Van Royen v. Lacey, </em>266 Md. 649, 652, 296 A.2d 426, 428 (1972) quoting <em>Cave v. Mills, </em>7 H. &amp; W. 927. Mr. Miller was an appointed agent of the CIGNA Companies, including INA.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">B. Fiduciary Relationship</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">The issue before us, therefore, is not whether Mr. Miller was an agent of INA but what was the scope of his agency relationship. The trial court inappropriately limited the scope of Mr. Miller\u2019s agency relationship to that of an \u201cinsurance agent\u201d who sold insurance and ruled that his role as an insurance agent did not obligate him to ensure that premiums were forwarded to INA. Under this theory, Mr. Miller only had a duty to sell insurance and contractually bind INA, but then did not have the corresponding duty to see to the remittance of premiums to INA for insurance coverage bound.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>The scope of Mr. Miller\u2019s agency is not limited by a description of \u201cinsurance agent.\u201d As we discussed, <em>supra, </em>he stipulated to the fact that he was an appointed agent of INA. This relationship is not somehow limited because he is an insurance agent, rather, it is a broader relationship than that which the trial court found.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Maryland Code (1995, 1997 Repl.Vol), section l-101(c) of the Insurance Article provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">(c) <em>Agent. </em>\u2014 (1) \u201cAgent\u201d means a person that, for compensation, solicits, procures, negotiates, or makes insurance contracts, including contracts for nonprofit health service plans, dental plan organizations, and health maintenance organizations, or the renewal or continuance of these insurance contracts for persons issuing the insurance contracts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A37\">(2) \u201cAgent\u201d does not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">(i) an individual who performs clerical, stenographic, or similar office duties while employed by an agent or insurer, including a clerical employee, other than a clerical employee of an insurer, who takes insurance information or receives premiums in the agent\u2019s office, if the employee\u2019s compensation does not vary with the number of applications or amount of premiums;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">(ii) a regular salaried officer or employee of an insurer who gives help to or for a qualified agent, if the officer or employee is not paid a commission or other compensation that depends directly on the amount of business obtained; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">(iii) if not paid a commission, a person that obtains and forwards information for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-10\">1. group insurance coverage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-11\">2. enrolling individuals under group insurance coverage; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>3. issuing certificates under group insurance coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-4\">(g) <em>Appointment. </em>\u2014 \u201cAppointment\u201d means an agreement between an agent and insurer under which the agent, for compensation, may solicit, procure, negotiate, or make policies issued by the insurer.<footnotemark>[17]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Appellee meets all of the criteria to be an appointed agent outlined above. Additionally, he does not meet any of the criteria set up in subsection l-101(c)(2) that would exempt him from status as an agent of INA. Specifically, section 1-101 clarifies that, under Maryland\u2019s Insurance Code, an appointed agent generally has all the responsibilities and duties typically bestowed upon any agent. That imposes upon him the duty to inform his principal of any improprieties of which he has knowledge and forbids his active participation in any such improper actions. The trial court erred in attempting to limit this relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The trial court\u2019s reasoning also fails to acknowledge Mr. Miller\u2019s obligations under standard Maryland insurance regulations. It is clear under the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR), that keeping funds \u201cin trust\u201d is one of the duties of insurance agents. The Code of Maryland Regulations (CO-MAR) 31.03.03.01 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">A.

His responsibilities were not merely limited to the selling of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-14\">The trial court relied on our analysis in <em>Kann v.

Instead of acting with loyalty and fidelity towards INA, Mr. Miller breached his fiduciary duty in numerous ways. First, he knew that premiums were not being remitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>to INA, but failed to inform INA, and did not cause the remittance of premium payments to the insurer. Second, he participated in a double financing scheme where the Hickman Agency withheld premiums from INA based on the representation to INA that the premiums were to be paid in installments, when the Agency was already in possession of the entire premium amount either from insureds or from premium financing companies on behalf of insureds. He signed company checks to INA for installments due when in fact he had obtained the entire premiums from premium financing companies (or from insureds) and kept this plan concealed from INA \u2014 actions, which clearly demonstrate his awareness and participation in this scheme. Third, when INAC requested premium funds back from the Hickman Agency, and there was no money to pay the premiums because the money was out-of-trust, Mr. Miller directed the premium financing of another account (Gunther\u2019s Leasing worker\u2019s compensation policy) expressly for the purpose of repaying the premium due INAC on an unrelated policy. Fourth, consistently throughout this relationship, Mr. Miller, who had knowledge of what was occurring, failed to disclose his, and Hickman\u2019s, conflicting actions to INA. As we have said, \u201c[i]t is an elementary principle that fundamental duties of an agent are loyalty to the interest of his principal and the need to avoid any conflict between that interest and his own self-interest.\u201d <em>C-E-I-R, Inc. v. Computer Dynamics Corp., </em>229 Md. 357, 366, 183 A.2d 374, 379 (1962) (quoting <em>Maryland Credit v. Hagerty, </em>216 Md. 83, 90, 139 A.2d 230, 233 (1958)). Mr. Miller placed himself in a position where INA\u2019s interests and his interests conflicted. As we discussed, <em>supra, </em>one of the primary obligations of an agent to a principal is to disclose any information the principal may reasonably want to know. It is safe to say that Mr. Miller\u2019s actions were not made with INA\u2019s best interests in mind and that INA would reasonably want to have known of his actions while he was acting as its agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">We therefore hold that the trial court erred when it ruled that appellee was not an agent of INA for the purpose of collecting and forwarding premiums, and as a result did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>breach any fiduciary duties by failing to do so. To the contrary, Miller had knowledge of what was happening and actively participated in a significant portion of the improper actions. In failing to share his knowledge with INA, and by participating in the scheme, he breached his fiduciary duty to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">C. The Negligence Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Appellant also presents the issue of whether Mr. Miller could be found negligent for his actions surrounding the double financing scheme. While we hold that Mr. Miller knowingly and intentionally breached his fiduciary duty to INA, we shall also address the issue of negligence, which was presented in the appellant\u2019s brief. The trial court ruled that Mr. Miller, as an officer of the Hickman Agency, could not be held responsible or personally liable in tort for the actions of the Hickman Agency. The trial court\u2019s ruling was primarily based on <em>Ferguson Trenching Co. v. Kiehne, </em>329 Md. 169, 618 A.2d 735 (1993), where we held that generally, \u201c[o]fficers and directors of a corporation generally are insulated from personal liability for the debts of the corporation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175, 618 A.2d at 738. In <em>Ferguson Trenching, </em>we were construing Maryland\u2019s construction trust statute, Maryland Code (1974, 1988 Repl.Vol., 1992 Cum.Supp.), sections 9-201 through 9-204 of the Real Property Article. Because that holding was limited to the interpretation of a specific and unrelated statute, <em>Ferguson Trenching </em>is, generally, inapplicable to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">We hold that, under certain circumstances, an officer of a corporation may be held personally liable for torts of the corporation in which the officer was personally involved. As we have said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-8\">\u201cThe general rule is that the corporate officers or agents are personally liable for those torts which they personally commit, or which they inspire or participate in, even though performed in the name of an artificial body. Of course, participation in the tort is essential to liability. If the officer takes no part in the commission of the tort commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>ted by the corporation, he is not personally liable therefor unless he specifically directed the particular act to be done, or participated or cooperated therein. It would seem, therefore, that an officer or director is not liable for torts of which he has no knowledge, or to which he has not consented. Thus, e.g., to make an officer of a corporation liable for the negligence of the corporation there must have been upon his part such a breach of duty as contributed to, or helped to bring about, the injury; he must have been a participant in the wrongful act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"><em>Metromedia Co. v.

Co. v. Flippo, </em>348 Md. 680, 700, 705 A.2d 1144, 1153-54 (1998) quoting <em>Rosenblatt v. Exxon, </em>335 Md. 58, 76, 642 A.2d 180, 188 (1994). We have already established that appellee was under a duty, as an agent and a fiduciary, to act in INA\u2019s interest. He had a special relationship that, itself, imposed such a duty. By his failure to keep his principal informed and by his active participation in the double financing scheme, appellee breached the duty. Appel-lee, himself, actually and actively participated and directed at least a significant part of the events constituting the breaches in issue. He was, individually, a tortfeasor. INA suffered actual injury by not receiving premiums that should have been forwarded from the Hickman Agency trust account. This loss proximately resulted from appellee\u2019s breach of duty. We therefore hold that the trial court erred when it ruled that appellee was not negligent by obtaining premium financing for an insurance premium of an INA insured, and using the funds to pay another premium financing company, instead of paying the funds directly to INA for the premium due.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">We hold that appellee was an agent of INA for the purpose of collecting and forwarding premiums, which imposed upon him a fiduciary duty to INA, which he personally and actively breached by failing to collect and forward such premiums to INA and by failing to convey to INA his knowledge that the premiums at issue were being diverted from INA to the use of the Hickman Agency. Additionally, appellee personally and actively breached his fiduciary duty to INA when he obtained premium financing for an insurance premium of an INA insured, and used the funds to pay another premium financing company, instead of paying the funds directly to INA for the premium due. We also hold that appellee\u2019s actions in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>double financing scheme could constitute negligence. Accordingly, we reverse the ruling of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County and remand the case to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion (the assessment and rendering of judgment as to damages).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY REVERSED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS PAID FOR BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-8\">.

NARM is an insurance agency and brokerage firm duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Maryland with its principle place of business in Annapolis, Maryland. Appellee set up NARM in early 1997, when, as we discuss, <em>infra, </em>the previous agency with whom appellee was associated, Hickman Agency, ceased operations. Appellee is currently the President and Chief Executive Officer of NARM.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b405-10\">. This was an ex contractu action based upon breaches of the agency agreement. It was alleged that the breaches of fiduciary duty constituted breaches of the agency contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b407-10\">. John L. Hickman, an insurance agent with a Maryland license, was the owner, President, and Chief Executive Officer of J.L. Hickman &amp; Company, Inc. J.L. Hickman &amp; Company, Inc. was known by several other names, including IFA Insurance Services and American Funeral Insurance Group (AFIG). For ease of reference, we will refer to the entity as the \u201cHickman Agency\u201d throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[5]\">\n<p id=\"b407-11\">5. The Agreement provides that \"you\u201d refers to the Hickman Agency and \"we\u201d refers to the relevant CIGNA Companies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b408-7\">. Ms. Donna Mannino, an employee of the Hickman Agency, was hired by Mr. Miller in 1994 as a customer service and account representative and eventually became the office manager and Assistant Vice-President.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b409-5\">. In the case at bar, Miller, unlike insurance agents that have limited knowledge of the practices of a brokerage, had knowledge of, and actively participated in, the breaches of fiduciary duties that occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b409-6\">. See COMAR 31.03.03.01, discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b410-6\">. The insured might pay the entire premium to Hickman or Hickman might cause the entire premium to be financed. In either event, Hickman would only remit to the insurance company installments of the premium, diverting the main portion of the premium to its own use. Apparently, eventually, it began utilizing financed premium sums of one policy to pay installments to premium financing companies in respect to previous premium financed policies. In other words, it appears to have been a modified insurance \"Ponzi scheme.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b410-7\">. For example, if a premium financing company financed $1000.00 of a policy for an insured, and paid $1000.00 to the Hickman Agency for the premium, $1000.00 would be deposited into a Hickman Agency\u2019s bank account. At the same time, the insurance company, which was led to believe that the insured was paying a premium on an installment plan, requested payment from the Agency only for the first installment of $100.00. The Hickman Agency would pay the requested $100.00, leaving $900.00 remaining in the Agency\u2019s bank account for its own use. After the second installment was remitted, Hickman would have the use of $800.00, etc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b411-5\">. Appellee contends that although the Gunther\u2019s Leasing account was originally his, that Mr. Hickman assumed responsibility for that account in early to mid December of 1996. He also alleges that in early January 1997, his signature stamp which he used for signing and counter-signing documents on behalf of the Agency disappeared. He also alleges that he never attempted to conceal the double financing plan from insureds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[12]\">\n<p id=\"b412-7\">12. \"Cindy\u201d refers to Ms. Cindy Gunther, who handled the accounting for Gunther\u2019s Leasing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b413-6\">.

J.L. Hickman &amp; Company, </em>civil action number MJG-97-3194, a case pending in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, before Judge Marvin J. Garbis, an implied agency relationship was found to have existed between Mr. Miller and another insurance company with which Mr. Miller did not even have an agency appointment at the time of the transactions alleged in that case, which also arose out of policies issued to Gunther\u2019s Leasing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b417-9\">. As we have indicated, Mr. Miller did not lack knowledge of the events that were occurring, and was an active participant in the events <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>constituting breaches of fiduciary duty. He was a stipulated agent of INA itself, not a mere employee of Hickman. The trial court, in any event, erroneously limited the scope of \"insurance agents,\u201d who have knowledge of improprieties, as we note, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[17]\">\n<p id=\"b419-9\">17.

As we have indicated, our holding in this case is based in substantial part on the fact that the agent had actual knowledge that his principal's interests were being improperly, adversely affected and failed to notify the principal, and is based, as well, on the fact that the agent actively participated in the scheme to divert premium funds from the principal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
