Maryland State police officers arrested Eugene Edward Winder, Appellant, on 24 February 1998, on account of the Mainors\u2019 deaths. He was charged with three counts of first-degree murder, two counts of first-degree burglary,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a single count of arson. Upon Appellant\u2019s request for removal, his case was transferred from the Circuit Court for Wicomico County to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. Appellant\u2019s trial proceeded on 17 May 1999, as a bench trial, on a not guilty plea with an agreed statement of facts. The trial judge ultimately found Appellant guilty of all charges. Appellant requested to be sentenced by a jury as to the murder convictions. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 1999 Cum.Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 413(a) &amp; (b). The jury sentenced him to death on each of the murder counts. The trial judge sentenced Appellant to twenty years imprisonment for the first-degree burglary conviction, and a consecutive term of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>thirty years for the arson conviction. This case is before this Court on automatic appeal pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Article 27, \u00a7 414<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Maryland Rule 8-306(c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">In this appeal, Appellant presents the following six issues for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">I. Did the lower court err in denying Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">II. Did the lower court err in refusing to grant a mistrial after engaging in an <em>ex parte </em>communication with the jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\">III. Did the lower court err in refusing to redact that portion of the presentence investigation report stating that Appellant \u201cdoes not have any psychological or emotional problems?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-10\">IV. Is the evidence sufficient to convict Appellant of first-degree burglary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-11\">V. Did the lower court err in restricting, at sentencing, the defense presentation of relevant evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-12\">VI. Did the lower court err in refusing to propound Appellant\u2019s requested voir dire question?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-13\">Because we shall reverse the judgments based on our analysis of Issue I, we need address additionally only Appellant\u2019s issue IV. Notwithstanding that, we choose to comment briefly on issue II as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Around 4:15 a.m. on 19 February 1998, Mr. and Mrs. Emery Revelle were driving through Wicomico County en route to Florida. As they drove past 501 North Division Street (the Mainors\u2019 home) in Fruitland, the Revelles noticed heavy smoke rising from the house. The Revelles reported the fire to the authorities. The fire department arrived at 4:31 a.m. After the fire was extinguished, firefighters discovered the bodies of Geraldine Mainor (age 70), Christine Lee Mainor (age 20), and John Mainor (age 71) in the family room of the house.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Later that morning, at approximately 7:00 a.m., Allan Mai-nor, the son of Geraldine and John Mainor, observed Appellant at the fire scene. He noticed that Appellant had a bandage on his hand and a cut on his nose. Appellant spoke briefly with Sergeant Matthew Brown of the Fruitland police department. He identified himself as the boyfriend and fianc\u00e9 of Christine Mainor.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The following day, Sergeant Brown telephoned Appellant and requested that he come to the police station. Appellant voluntarily complied and met there with the police at 6:00 p.m. While at the station, Winder agreed to have a cut on his hand photographed and gave the police clippings from his fingernails. With Appellant\u2019s consent, the police also searched his vehicle, finding blood spots on its interior. The police kept the vehicle for testing. Additionally, Appellant voluntarily turned over the clothing that he wore the morning of the fire. After a three-hour interview with Lieutenant George Truit, Appellant left the police station at 11:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>After Appellant left the police station, the Fruitland police chief called in the Maryland State Police to assume control of the investigation. After executing search warrants for Appellant\u2019s home, on the evening of 23 February 1998, Sergeant Kim Collins (Collins) and Corporal Robert McQueeney (McQueeney) of the Maryland State Police requested that Appellant accompany them to their Salisbury Barrack. Appellant consented to the officers\u2019 request.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Appellant arrived at the state police barracks at approximately 10:00 p.m. on 23 February 1998. The interrogation that followed spanned a twelve-hour period. At least four members of the State Police participated in the questioning. Near the end of the interrogation, at approximately 6:00 a.m. on 24 February 1998, Appellant confessed to murdering the Mainors and setting fire to their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">In the initial stage of the interrogation, Appellant was placed in a conference room with Collins, McQueeney, Sergeant Leone Fisher (Fisher), and Sergeant William Benton (Benton). The officers told Appellant that he was not under arrest and that he was free to go at any time. The officers offered Appellant a drink and advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant signed a form waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights and agreed to have the interrogation audio tape recorded.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The interrogation began at approximately 10:35 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Sergeants Fisher and Benton handled the questioning in the beginning. Appellant initially answered basic background questions regarding his job, education level, and his relationship with Christine. In response to a question inquiring when he last saw Christine alive, Appellant stated that he met with her at 6:30 p.m. on 19 February 1998. The officers also asked Appellant to explain the nature of his relationship with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>grandparents. Commenting on Appellant\u2019s answers, Sergeant Benton interjected:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">[w]e need you to be honest with us man so we can understand what\u2019s going on inside of you. Right now, your sitting there shaking to death, we see it. I\u2019m going to tell you something. There is a lot bothering you and we know you want to talk. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here to talk to you tonight, okay. The only way we can help you and get things off your chest is for you to talk to us and open up to us ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Throughout the early stages of the interrogation, Sergeant Benton repeatedly asked Appellant to tell him about the murders, but Appellant stated that he knew nothing about the crimes and denied any involvement. After the Officers shared with Appellant their personal theories why he committed the murders, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">Benton: ... let me ask you a question. What did you think would happen if you told us the truth about that night? Let me ask you that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">Winder: I\u2019d go to jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">Benton: Eugene, can I say something to you. You just admitted to us that you killed them. Do you know why? I asked you. I said Eugene, what do you think what happened if you told us the truth. You said I\u2019d go to jail. So, you just told us you killed them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-10\">Winder: No, I didn\u2019t kill them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Benton: Eugene, you just admitted it. We\u2019ll play the tape. I said' Eugene what do you think what happened if you told us the truth. You said I would go to jail. I said okay. So, you think you would go to jail if you told us the truth. You said yeah, that\u2019s exactly what you said. Why don\u2019t you tell us what happened? Christy and her grandparents are [sic] deserve to know the truth about what happened. Nobody is going to think you are an animal. What we want to know is why this happened. It is a crime of passion, but we need to know from you, did she come at you with a weapon while you were in that house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">Winder: I wasn\u2019t there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Sergeant Benton, professing to believe that he had secured a confession, continued to bring up that he thought Appellant had admitted to committing the murders. After Sergeant Fisher left the room, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">Benton: She\u2019s gone, let\u2019s talk man to man. Let\u2019s be honest. You admitted to me a little while ago. You told me that if you told me the truth you would go to jail. People have committed a crime and they haven\u2019t gone to jail especially for the rest of their life. Let\u2019s just sit here and think. If there comes a time when you have to stand trial for this case, how do you think the people in the community are going to react if you continue to fight it, to fight it, to fight it, to say you never did it, and the state presents evidence to the contrary. How do you think that\u2019s going to look?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeuA\">Winder: Not good.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">sfc</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">Benton: Eugene, you\u2019ve admitted to us that you did it, right here on this tape. I said Eugene what would happened if you told us the truth, and you said I\u2019d go to jail. I said so if you told us the truth of what happened that night you would go to jail and you said yes I would. Eugene, your there. Think of how much better your going to feel once you get if off. You need to be honest with us. Think of the community. The community is [in] an uproar. They think they\u2019ve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>got a person out there whose killed these people and set their house on fire. They have no idea who it is. You think we\u2019re the only ones right now that are looking for you. Why do you think we wanted so much to look for you tonight?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-4\">Winder: I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">After informing Appellant that the police found blood-stained clothing in his residence, Sergeant Benton informed Appellant that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">We\u2019re not interested in sending you to jail for the rest of your life, Eugene we told you that. We think the person who committed these needs help. I think you need help. The only way we can get you that help is for you to let us know what happened. We can let the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office know hey, Eugene\u2019s told us what happened, but I think Eugene needs some help. The only way we can do that is for you to explain to us why. There is a rage inside of you that you can\u2019t control. It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s a rage. There is no other way to explain it. We\u2019re sitting here talking to you, a mild-mannered person. I guarantee you Christie can push your button and piss you off in a heart beat, that\u2019s what happened that night. I need you to tell me what happened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Questioning continued in this vein:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">Benton: We can let the State\u2019s Attorneys Office know that you need help. We\u2019re not stupid people, your not a stupid person, that\u2019s why we\u2019re trying to talk to you this way. We just want to know why. I want to give everybody a chance to tell me why things happen and the reason for that is if it does get to trial later down the road which is something we\u2019re all going to have to look at. I\u2019m not going to lie to you there. At least then people they understand why. We\u2019re asking ... if nothings is ever said, no one ever knows because no one else was there. Nobody is going to understand what happened. It is your chance to tell us. Eugene, you want to talk to us. I see it all over your face. Why don\u2019t you tell us what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Winder: I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">At this point, approximately 11:30 p.m., the officers took a break of mere seconds to change the tape. When the questioning resumed, the officers inquired as to what Appellant believed should happen to the person who committed the crimes and what he thought motivated the person to kill the victims. As Appellant responded, Sergeant Benton commented that he saw Appellant\u2019s heart beating through his shirt and that it was a sign he was lying.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Detective Sergeant Frank Ford of the Maryland State Police entered the conference room shortly after the 11:30 p.m. break. He apologized for his late arrival and told Appellant that they would have to start from the beginning and review all the questions asked and answered up to this point in the interrogation. As Sergeant Ford began the review, he told Appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">I know the police in Fruitland talked to you last week and they didn\u2019t treat you very well. I\u2019m sorry, because right now son, you\u2019re a victim. When I call you son, I don\u2019t mean it degrading, but you kind of remind me of my son. I\u2019m forty, you\u2019re younger than me ... I\u2019m hurting man, and I chose to do this, to get involved in this because of me knowing the family like that and talking to them because they\u2019re hurting too. I\u2019m sorry about what happened with the Fruitland Police. I don\u2019t work that way. I\u2019ve been around ... I\u2019ll give you some background about myself. You don\u2019t know me from Adam. I\u2019ve been doing this for almost twenty years. I\u2019ve worked all over the state. I\u2019ve worked in Baltimore. I have been involved with a lot of young black men,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> pro and con and you know what. I can go to my grave man saying that I\u2019ve saved a lot of brothers. I worked in Baltimore City Homicide for almost a year and I saved some brothers man. I\u2019ve saved a lot of them. To me there ain\u2019t nobody bad. It ain\u2019t nobody good. Everybody\u2019s human you see what I\u2019m saying and we all do make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>mistakes man. If you make a little mistake, in your life, no body gives a shit. The big mistake in your life, they think oh my god. Now wait a minute, what\u2019s the difference between a big mistake and a little mistake? ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Sergeant Ford later took a break at 12:06 a.m. and gave Appellant a soda.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The questioning apparently resumed at 1:27 a.m.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Sergeant Fisher talked to Appellant more about his relationship with Christine and the future they planned together. Sergeant Fisher then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">Eugene, help me bring them home. I can make you a promise, okay? I can help you. I could help you, I could try to protect you. I can be your friend. I\u2019m not the enemy.<footnotemark>[10]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">She later added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-9\">Close your eyes again. Think about it, Eugene. Think about everything that\u2019s happened. Think about every little thing that\u2019s happened lately. It hurts, Eugene. It really hurts. And you\u2019re hurting just like that family was hurting today when they were sobbing and they were all holding on to each other. You know, I never saw Frank Ford cry before today. I thought it was just Corporal Benton,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> my partner, and me. We cry all the time with families, Eugene. I want to cry with you now. But you\u2019ve got to cry, Eugene. You\u2019ve come so close this night in crying.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">Sergeant Benton repeated numerous questions to Appellant regarding the clothing that the police had taken from Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>lant\u2019s residence and why Appellant was lying to the officers about his involvement in the murders. Appellant continued to deny that he was involved or that he was lying. Sergeant Benton and Appellant then had the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">Benton: When we initially talked about it, you said you didn\u2019t want to tell me because you\u2019d go to jail. Okay, let\u2019s get that out of the way. We talked about that and that\u2019s why I left, shortly after that. Okay? I asked you why you didn\u2019t want to tell me the truth about what happened. You said because I don\u2019t want to go to jail. I said, so you don\u2019t want to tell me the truth because you don\u2019t want to go to jail. You said right. I can mention to the State\u2019s Attorney, I can tell him. I\u2019ll call him right now and tell him, hey, Eugene will tell me everything that\u2019s going on but Eugene want some help too. Could Eugene just went into a rage. He don\u2019t know what he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">Winder: I didn\u2019t do it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Sergeant Benton and Fisher resumed theorizing with Appellant about the crimes. They asked about Mr. Mainor and whether Appellant thought he was the first of the victims to be killed and other hypothetically framed questions about potential motives for the crime. Sergeant Fisher then switched gears and began telling Appellant about Sergeant Ford\u2019s vast experience with the legal system. She explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atd\">(Inaudible) and you know how Frank is. Frank told me before how you helped them. And, you know, Eugene, we work with Frank. All right? But we don\u2019t have the years of experience. And we also don\u2019t have the knowledge that Frank has about how to work the court system and how to work everything out through judges. When Frank Ford goes into a courtroom, the judges listen to him. The judge in your case will listen to him. Your trial that you\u2019re doing right now. They\u2019ll listen. You\u2019ve got Frank Ford and he\u2019s doing all that stuff, and he\u2019s sitting here offering to help you and offering to talk to you. Frank\u2019s been there. And I hope that when I have the years on the job like he does \u2014 I mean, we\u2019re good. We work and we\u2019re good. But Frank Ford (inaudible). He\u2019s the man. And he\u2019s talking to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>family right now. Have you ever seen Frank cry? I saw him cry today. I saw him cry today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">A period of approximately two hours then passed during which the officers implored Appellant to stop lying to them and questioned him on matters not relevant to this appeal. At 2:41 a.m. the tape was changed. In one of the many long monologues by Sergeant Ford that followed during the renewed interrogation, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">Goddarn you got to love this girl. I\u2019m telling you, you got to love this girl. People are thinking now that you don\u2019t love her and the war just goes on like this. Their going to just bolster her up. He didn\u2019t love her. You do the right thing. You say you love her and then we\u2019ll help you. We will help you inside and we will help you if you would like us too. You got a better chance in life. You got a better chance at freedom. That\u2019s why they call it an accident. She ain\u2019t never going to leave, you know what I mean? ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcW\">Sergeant Ford further begged Appellant to identify the bodies, asserting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">Look, listen, listen, and listen to me, okay. I can\u2019t bring Christy back for a viewing under this man made law until I can positively absolutely say that it\u2019s Christy. The only way I can do that is to prove this by dental records. She has no dental records. The only other way I can do this by having the person who last saw her in that house say that was Christy. Do you follow me? Right now, don\u2019t have to deal with the rest of this stuff. You got to tell me man, okay, yes, I was there that\u2019s Christy. I can bring her back. I can bring her back then, do you follow me? I can get her back. The rest of this stuff, whatever else happens, we don\u2019t even have to go into. I\u2019m talking about Christy, alright, but late that night, I got to know that she was there. Do you follow me? I know she was there. Everybody knows she was there, but these legal papers, you\u2019ve been through the legal system with filing bankruptcy you\u2019ve got to have amount of proof and this and that and all this kind of stuff. Why do you think she ain\u2019t back man? You know</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>what I mean. I can\u2019t get her back. I just want to put her to rest. Her soul will not be at rest. Her heart is divided, she\u2019s up there and she\u2019s thinking ... she\u2019s on hand there\u2019s you and one hand there\u2019s the family and nobody isn\u2019t at peace. You walking on the wrong device being threatened, you don\u2019t know what your doing, what your saying, your confused. Your holding everything inside. We\u2019ve got to put her to rest. You have to. If you don\u2019t this is no good, this don\u2019t mean nothing. You can\u2019t say to your partner, who\u2019s that, that\u2019s my girlfriend Christy, we were very much in love. If he asks what happened, you can\u2019t say where she died and where she\u2019s buried, but she\u2019s always in my heart. You can\u2019t say that, cause she ain\u2019t going to be. I can\u2019t get her back, I can\u2019t even get her buried for. They going to end up burying a memory, a nothing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Sergeant Ford then changed his tack. He informed Appellant about alleged rumors of revenge that had been \u201cheard\u201d in the victims\u2019 neighborhood in Fruitland, Maryland.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Sergeant Ford explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">A rumor was also spread that we can\u2019t rest her. They can\u2019t even identify her. They already know who she is but they won\u2019t really release her until they got positive ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Sergeant Ford later continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">That don\u2019t mean nothing. Hell, even bad ones don\u2019t mean anything. You know, she\u2019s lost. But, we can\u2019t even get her body. People, believe it or not, are understandable. People have a soft spot in their heart. We are the image of our maker. It\u2019s like you go to a store. You\u2019re a kid and you steal a piece of candy. And the guy catches you. You say, I didn\u2019t take that candy. Okay, no problem. I deal with you. Or you get the piece of candy, the guy catches you and you say, sorry mister, I was hungry. Can I just pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>you back? And (inaudible) and he says, man, don\u2019t do it again. Get out of here. He turns his back and he goes to his wife or whoever and he says, you know what, at least the kid admitted to it and said he was sorry. I\u2019ve got respect for him. He made a mistake but he admitted to it. I\u2019ll give him respect for that. But when you lie, cheat, deny, debate, hey, that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s when things go the hard way ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Throughout this part of the interrogation, the officers abandoned all pretense of questioning. Instead, Sergeant Ford made long pleas about the need to return Christine to her home and told Appellant that he will feel better and be safer once he confesses to the crimes. He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">In this situation, that\u2019s your only way of help. You\u2019ve got no more help. That\u2019s it. This is your only way of help. This coming clean and getting this child back here. I call all young ladies child. You know how girls call girls child. I don\u2019t mean anything by it. That\u2019s her.

It is unclear what time the tape was shut off. In testimony given at one of the suppression hearings before the Circuit Court, Sergeant Ford filled in the relevant occurrences during this gap in taping. At approximately 6:00 a.m., Sergeant Ford told Appellant \u201cyou might as well go ahead and leave, Eugene, if you are not telling the truth.\u201d Appellant began to leave and Sergeant Ford stated \u201cwell, you can\u2019t go; we have a search warrant for you.\u201d Appellant answered \u201ceither way I\u2019m dead\u201d and \u201cif I told you, I will go to jail and I\u2019m dead. If I don\u2019t tell you, I\u2019m dead.\u201d Sergeant Fisher, in her testimony at the court hearing, stated that, at 6:00 a.m., she informed Appellant that they had a search warrant for Appellant\u2019s body and that she asked him \u201cwhat was it going to show?\u201d Fisher explained that Appellant answered, \u201cit is me.\u201d Following this exchange, Sergeant Ford testified that, at 6:20 a.m., Appellant told Sergeant Fisher that he wanted to identify the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">After the officers again advised Appellant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, he identified the victims from autopsy photographs, and then confessed to Sergeant Fisher that he murdered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>victims.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The confession lasted until approximately 8:00 a.m. when Appellant was given time to take a nap. He slept from 8:20 a.m. until 9:30 a.m. When Appellant awoke, he was given a soda and a \u201ctasty cake.\u201d The interrogation resumed and Appellant gave more details about the murders. At 10:27 a.m., the officers informed Appellant that he was under arrest and told him that he probably would be charged with murder, arson, and assault. At 10:30 a.m., Appellant wrote a letter of apology to the family of the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Charges of murder, arson, and burglary were filed in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County. On 9 October 1998, the case was transferred, on Appellant\u2019s removal suggestion, to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. Pretrial motions hearings were held in the Circuit Court on February 11, 12, 16, and 17, March 24, and April 6, 21, and 22, 1999. Of relevance to this appeal, many of the pretrial hearings focused on Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the statements made during his interrogation by the Maryland State Police and the letter of apology he wrote to the victims\u2019 family.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> At these hearings, the police officers that were present during Appellant\u2019s interrogation and ultimate confession, including Sergeants Benton, Fisher, and Ford, testified on behalf of the State. Appellant did not testify. A large portion of the officers\u2019 testimony, particularly on cross-examination, consisted of the officers reading from the interrogation transcript. They also testified that at many points during the interrogation, Appellant was shaking, crying, and his heart was observed beating through his shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">After the suppression hearing on 17 February 1999, the trial judge explained \u201cthere is no violation of <em>Miranda </em>rights there at all. That is very easy for me to decide. They said, time and time and time again, ad nauseam, right out of the play <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>book, these are the <em>Miranda </em>rights. The question is threatening protection and intimidation.\u201d The trial judge continued, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">But here is what bothers me.... \u2018We need to protect you. I promise. We are not interested in sending you to jail for the rest of you life. Promise. People ready to come out here to do bad to you. Threat? I will not be able to help you. Intimidate. We can let the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s know that Eugene needs help. The only way is to explain why.\u2019 Promise----You walk. You can leave Salisbury after all of this and start over somewhere else. Now these things worry me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Obviously troubled by the promissory and threatening aspects of the police statements during the interrogation, the trial judge stated that he was not prepared to rule further on the suppression motion and asked the parties to prepare memo-randa addressing his concerns. On 22 April 1999, after considering further arguments from the parties, the trial judge denied the suppression motion and ruled that Appellant\u2019s confession would be admissible at his trial. He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axo\">In this case, considering all of the pluses and all of the minuses, I am going to deny the motion to suppress because I find the State has sustained its burden, its burden to convince me by [a] preponderance of the evidence that what has been produced does not show that nexus or catalyst or thread or causation, ... running through. It is just not there.... It does not go over the line.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Appellant\u2019s trial began on 17 May 1999. The guilt phase proceeded on a not guilty plea with an agreed statement of facts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We shall recite only those portions of the agreed statement of facts that may be relevant to the appellate issues we address:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY: Your Honor, the facts in this case would show that February 18th of 1998 was the 70th birthday of Mrs. Geraldine Mainor. The evidence would further show that during the course of the day and the evening, that she had received several telephone calls. The State would produce testimony that one of those calls was from her daughter, Karen Mainor Harris.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-4\">Also on that evening, her son Allan Mainor, his wife Kim and their two daughters arrived at the Mainor residence approximately 7 o\u2019clock that evening to celebrate Ms. Mai-nor\u2019s birthday. Ms. Mainor was presented with a present. The individuals sat down and had cake and ice cream and reminisced about earlier times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">Allan and Kim Mainor left at approximately 8:15 to 8:80 on the evening of February 18th, 1998. To the best of their knowledge, Mr. and Mrs. Mainor were the only people who were still inside of the residence. Christie Mainor was not present at that time[.] ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">As Allan Mainor was leaving the residence, Mr. John Mainor did come with him to the door. Mr. Allan Mainor would testify that his father had always been a stickler, very particular about locking the doors, and that on this particular evening he has a specific recollection that John Mainor in fact locked the door to the residence of this particular house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">The next contact that anyone other than the murderer had with Mr. or Mrs. John Mainor was at approximately 9:30 or slightly afterwards when Connie Martin indicated she called her cousin Geraldine....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">Dwight Dennis is an individual who is also known by the name of Marlow who had started a relationship with Christie Lee Mainor. Mr. Dennis spoke to Christie Lee Mainor by phone late in the afternoon on February 18th of 1998 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>when he called Christie Lee Mainor after school. At a later time Christie then contacted Dwight Dennis through his pager and they made arrangements to get together that night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">Christie Lee Mainor drove to a little market or convenience store called Sandy\u2019s One-Stop in Salisbury where she picked up Mr. Dwight Dennis. Together they went to the Dennis household where they watched a movie together on tape and conversed and at approximately 10 o\u2019clock in the evening on the 18th, Christie Lee Mainor took Dwight Dennis to the sister\u2019s apartment in Salisbury, at a location called the Waterside apartments, and Christie dropped Mr. Dennis off at that location. Mr. Dennis did make a request that Christie Mainor page him when she got home, just to let him know that she was okay, but he never received any page.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">At approximately 4:15 in the morning on Thursday, February 19th of 1998, a couple, Mr. Emery James Revelle and his wife, Sue Revelle, passed the Mainor house, Mrs. Re-velle noticed that there was smoke billowing from outside the eaves of the house which was located to their left given the direction of travel. She told her husband and persuaded him to turn around and go back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">Mr. Revelle, upon his approach, saw that there was smoke emanating from the household and Mr. Revelle attempted to enter the household through the front door. Even though there was fire that was apparent at that time, he tried to open it. Unfortunately he found the front door to be locked</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">Mr. Revelle realized he could not enter the residence at that location due to the flames, went off to some of the bedroom windows on the north part of the house. This house faces South \u2014 North Division Street in Fruitland and he went to the \u2014 what would be the left to the front of the house, which was the north part of the house. He broke out some windows and he was yelling in hopes of waking somebody because he also noticed and Mrs. Revelle also noticed that there were cars still located in close proximity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>to the house. With no success he then broke in the sliding glass door. He was met with heavy smoke and was not able to enter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-4\">It is interesting to note that to this time neither he nor Mrs. Revelle heard any type of smoke alarm from inside the residence. Mrs. Revelle did call 911, or emergency communications, which received the call at approximately 4:22 in the morning. Mrs. Revelle had attempted to locate the side garage door, which was closed but apparently unlocked at the time, although she could not gain entry to the main portion of the house also due to fire and smoke.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">Your Honor, the Defendant, as I indicated, had a relationship with Christie Lee Mainor prior to February 18th, of 1998. He was well-known to all family members, including John and Geraldine Mainor, as well as Allan, Kim and Karen Mainor. He had been at this residence at 501 North Division Street on a number of occasions prior to February 18th. He was aware that entry is normally gained to the household by family members and others by a door leading from the outside into the garage and then from another door leading from the garage into the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">The Fruitland officers received some initial information from the Defendant that he last saw Christie at 6:20 when they had spoken in the garage; that he tried to call her two times after that, speaking once with Mrs. Mainor, being told that Christie was in the shower. The second time occurred when Kim and Allan Mainor were over at the residence for the birthday celebration. Kim Mainor spoke to the Defendant at that time and told the Defendant that Christie was in fact not home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">At that point [in the police interrogation at approximately 6:20 a.m. on 24 February 1998] Sergeant Ford and Sergeant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Fisher left the room. Corporal Robert McQueeney of the State police entered the room to sit with him and Corporal McQueeney advised the Defendant of his Miranda warnings on that occasion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\">Sergeant Fisher soon returned and asked the Defendant what the evidence would show, referring to the search warrant and their drawing of his blood. The Defendant replied, and I quote, \u201cit is me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">A comment was made to him about whether it was murder or it was a crime of passion and that the penalties could be different. The Defendant said \u201cone was passion and the other two were murder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">The Defendant soon began to describe what occurred, although he had difficulty remembering, according to a statement to the police, his specific acts on that evening. He acknowledged to the Maryland State troopers that he parked his Jeep at the parking lot of an apartment complex over one thousand feet away from the Mainor residence of 501 North Division Street in Fruitland, that he walked to the Mainor residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">At that point he observed Christie Lee Mainor walk into the side garage door. The Defendant admitted that he walked up behind her and she screamed. The Defendant then said that he and Christie, Christie Mainor, were in the garage and that Mr. John Mainor came out of the kitchen with a knife. The Defendant said Mr. Mainor told Christie to get inside the residence, that John Mainor pushed the Defendant and, according to the statement of the Defendant, a struggle then ensued over the knife at which time the Defendant indicated he was cut. The Defendant said that he got the knife away from Mr. Mainor and then cut Mr. Mainor on the neck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">The Defendant said Mr. Mainor then located a hammer and struck the Defendant on his leg. The Defendant said that he got the hammer away from Mr. Mainor and the Defendant then told the troopers that he told Mr. Mainor to get into the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>According to the Defendant\u2019s statement, Mr. Mainor went into the house and began knocking things off of the counter. I would note that Dr. Locke indicated that the injury to the skull of Mr. John Mainor would initially cause a loss of equilibrium and difficulty with balance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">Going on with the Defendant\u2019s statement, he indicated that all three victims were screaming and yelling and that while he was holding the knife he told them to all sit down and shut up. The Defendant stated to the troopers that at that point the Mainors were on the couch, meaning John and Geraldine Mainor were on the couch, but that he did not know where Christie was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">The Defendant stated that he recalls someone running through the house, struck him with a chair, and that it may have been Christie. The Defendant further indicated that at some point he blanked out, that he did not know exactly what occurred, but that he said after whatever occurred, they were all dead. He further indicated that he sat on the floor and that he knew they were dead because they were not screaming or moving.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">He indicated he went to the truck, which was parked approximately a thousand feet away, that he sat there for a period of time. Then he went home and, later on, on the morning of February 19th, that he went to the hospital where he received stitches for the cutting wound to his hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">The troopers were trying to elicit some more details from the Defendant about what had occurred. During this period of the interview the Defendant acknowledged that he was angry at Christie Lee Mainor and also at Geraldine Mainor. He indicated that he may have cut Geraldine Mainor with a knife. That he may have used the hammer to strike one of the victims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>if\u00ed # \u00edf\u00ed \u00edj\u00ed i*C</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">If I can have one moment, Your Honor. Your Honor, on the 25th of February of 1998, during an extended search of the area, including'the field, a field which is located across from the Mainor residence at 501 North Division Street in Fruitland, an ax was located by a Deputy State. Fire Marshall and was seized by Corporal Bruce Danna of the Maryland State Police. This ax was found in a field across from the Mainors\u2019 in a ditch, in fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">Also during a search of the area, car keys are found across the street from the Mainor residence as well in a storm drain. I would indicate that the key fob or key ring is unusual and Karen Mainor would identify that as in fact being the car keys belonging to Christie Lee Mainor. Also, the keys, the key ring also contained a key which fit the Mainor residence as well, to be used to gain entry to the residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">Batteries were also found in front of the house by firemen and also by fire marshals. These batteries were of a similar type which would have fit or could have fit into the smoke detectors which were located in the Mainor residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">I would note that there were three detectors located inside of the Mainor residence. After a search was done after the fire, none of those smoke detectors contained batteries whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">Your Honor, the ax that I have described that was \u2014 there was a full-blown search done of the residence as well as the garage. There was no ax that was located in the garage area. Allan Mainor would have testified that his father in fact had an ax that had been handed down from his grandfather and that, based on his experience, it had in fact been kept in the garage area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-10\">Furthermore, I would note that during the search Christie Lee Mainor\u2019s pocketbook and wallet were in fact found on the floor of the garage of the Mainor residence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>The judge found the defendant guilty of three counts of first-degree murder and one count of arson, but reserved ruling on the burglary count. On 24 May 1999, the trial court found Appellant guilty of one count of first-degree burglary. The trial judge ultimately imposed a thirty year sentence for the arson count and a twenty year sentence for the burglary count.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Appellant elected to be sentenced by a jury on the murder convictions. The jury heard evidence for five days between 19 May 1999 and 26 May 1999. On 26 May 1996, following the conclusion of evidence, a discussion with counsel regarding possible jury instructions, and a short recess, the trial judge informed the parties that he had had a discussion with the jury out of the presence of the parties and counsel during the recess. He advised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">THE COURT: I went back and talked to the jury. Here is what I told them. I told them we were going to give instructions and let the State make its opening and then we are going to go to lunch. Then we will come back and do the Defendant\u2019s argument and then any rebuttal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">I told them also at that particular point I was going to give them the right to make the decision as to whether or not they want to deliberate tonight or whether they want to go home and come back tomorrow, but that would be their decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">They then asked me some questions. Here are the total questions they asked. First of all, when are the alternates going to be released? I said, if the jury \u2014 as soon as the jury starts deliberating. The next question that they asked was about food and things and I told them that I can buy them dinner and sodas, things like that. Someone then asked me what we prefer? I said, well, if you are not too tired, I would like to see you deliberate a little tonight, but this is a decision that you can\u2019t make until 3:30 or 4 when we finish and you see how you feel about it. Once I tell you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>to make the decision, you may talk about the facts of the case to determine whether you will make that decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">The next question somebody asked is can the alternates stay in the courtroom afterwards? I said, yes. Somebody asked, can we talk to the attorneys? I said, yes, if you feel that you want to, you can. If you feel uncomfortable, then say no. Somebody said, well, what about if the press comes after us, wants us to talk? I said if you want to talk to them, fine. If you don\u2019t, it is whatever you feel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">And that is the long and the short of my conversation with the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Counsel for Appellant requested that any future discussions with the jury be done on the record and while all the parties were present in the court room. A few moments later counsel made a motion for a mistrial based on the trial court\u2019s off-the-record discussion with the jury. The judge denied the motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\">I\u2019m certainly not going to grant a mistrial. The rule is that I not talk to the jury about things pertaining to the facts of the case and I didn\u2019t. You certainly can feel free to ask them any questions that you want. I most respectfully don\u2019t feel the Court of Appeals is that foolish. Motion denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">The jury deliberated for approximately seven hours on 27 May 1999 and returned sentences of death for each count of first-degree murder. Meriting the sentence of death, the jury found that Appellant committed more than one offense of murder arising out of the same incident. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 1999 Cum.Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 413(d)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">\n<em>Appellant\u2019s Interrogation Statements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ADz\">Custodial interrogations of suspected defendants have long been a traditional component of police law enforcement efforts.

On the non-exhaustive list of factors we consider are the length of the interrogation, the manner in which it was conducted, the number of police officers present throughout the interrogation, and the age, education and experience of the suspect. <em>See Hoey, </em>311 Md. at 483, 536 A.2d at 627. Maryland law requires that \u201cno confession or other significantly incriminating remark allegedly made by an accused be used as evidence against him, unless it first be shown to be free of any coercive barnacles that may have attached by improper means to prevent the expression from being voluntary.\u201d <em>Hillard, </em>286 Md. at 150, 406 A.2d at 418. <em>Hillard </em>articulates the proper analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>where an accused alleges he was told that confessing would be to his advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\"><em>Hillard </em>involved a defendant\u2019s challenge to convictions arising from the armed robbery of the residents of a home in Oxon Hill in Prince George\u2019s County. A week after the incident, the defendant was arrested and questioned for several hours in a Prince George\u2019s County police station. Following the interrogation, the defendant made a written confession. At a pretrial hearing, the defendant argued that the confession should be suppressed because it was induced by promises made by the police during the interrogation. The substance of the police officer\u2019s remarks to the defendant was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxC\">that if you are telling me the truth about your involvement in the occurrence, I will go to bat for you to the extent that I will tell the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office and the Court, number one, that you have cooperated, number two, you have told me the truth, and number three, I believe you were not knowledgeable as far as the murder was concerned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-6\"><em>Hillard, </em>286 Md. at 153, 406 A.2d at 420. Hillard further testified at the suppression hearing that the detective induced him into making the inculpatory remarks by promising that he would be \u201ccut loose\u201d if the statement he made was corroborated by any of the others involved in the crime. <em>Id. </em>at 148, 406 A.2d at 417. The trial court denied the motion to suppress the confession and the defendant was subsequently convicted. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">We reversed the conviction. At the onset of our analysis, we acknowledged that the question of whether a statement has been made voluntarily usually rests on the facts and circumstances of each particular case. <em>See Hillard, </em>286 Md. at 151, 406 A.2d at 419. After examining over a century of Maryland precedent, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdR\">if an accused is told, or it is implied, that making an inculpatory statement will be to his advantage, in that he will be given help or some special consideration, and he makes remarks in reliance on that inducement, his declara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>tion will be considered to have been involuntarily made and therefore inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-5\"><em>Hillard, </em>286 Md. at 153, 406 A.2d at 420. Applying this analysis to the facts in <em>Hillard, </em>it was clear that the police offered the promise of intercession with the court and prosecutor in exchange for the defendant\u2019s confession. Because the State \u201cdid not meet or even attempt to fulfill its burden of demonstrating that the improper promises failed to induce Hillard\u2019s admissions, ... the statement in question here was involuntarily obtained, and therefore inadmissible at petitioner\u2019s trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153, 406 A.2d at 420; <em>see also Ball, </em>347 Md. at 174-75, 699 A.2d at 1178; <em>Reynolds, </em>327 Md. at 508, 610 A.2d at 789; <em>State v. Kidd, </em>281 Md. 32, 35-36, 375 A.2d. 1105, 1108 (1977)(\u201c[f]or a statement to be the free and voluntary act of an accused, it must be obtained without force applied, coercion used, hope held out or promise made on the part of the authorities\u201d); <em>Nicholson v. State, </em>38 Md. 140, 153, 1873 WL 4274 (1873)(\u201cif the confession of the appellant had been induced by any threat of harm, or promise of worldly advantage held out to him by [the police], or by his authority, or in his presence and with his sanction, it ought to be excluded\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Based on <em>Hillard, </em>we glean a two-part test to determine the voluntariness of a custodial confession in circumstances where a defendant alleges that the police induced his or her confession by making improper promises. We will deem a confession to be involuntary, and therefore inadmissible, if 1) a police officer or an agent of the police force promises or implies to a suspect that he or she will be given special consideration from a prosecuting authority or some other form of assistance in exchange for the suspect\u2019s confession, and 2) the suspect makes a confession in apparent reliance on the police officer\u2019s statement. As to the second prong, apparent reliance, we pointed out in <em>Reynolds v. State, </em>327 Md. 494, 509, 610 A.2d 782, 789 (1992), citing <em>Ralph v. State, </em>226 Md. 480,174 A.2d 163 (1961), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJA\">One common thread that runs through our cases is that the promise must have caused the suspect to confess. If a suspect did not rely on an interrogator\u2019s comments, obvious<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>ly, the statement is admissible regardless of whether the interrogator had articulated an improper inducement. By definition, there would have been no \u201cinducement\u201d at all, because the interrogator \u201cinduced\u201d nothing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Both prongs must be satisfied before a confession is deemed to be involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The State shoulders the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the suspect\u2019s confession or inculpatory statement was not made in reliance on a promise or inducement made by a police officer or agent of the police. <em>See Hof, </em>337 Md. at 605, 655 A.2d at 382; <em>Hillard, </em>286 Md. at 151, 406 A.2d at 418-19; <em>Kidd, </em>281 Md. at 37, 375 A.2d at 1109; <em>Nicholson, </em>38 Md. at 153, 1873 WL 4274 (\u201c[t]he law is also well settled that the <em>onus </em>is upon the prosecutor, to show affirmatively, that the confession proposed to be offered was not made in consequence of an improper inducement\u201d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The trial court\u2019s determination regarding whether a confession was made voluntarily is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>See Baynor v. State, </em>355 Md. 726, 729 n. 1, 736 A.2d 325, 326 n. 1 (1999); <em>Hof, </em>337 Md. at 605, 655 A.2d at 382; <em>Hillard, </em>286 Md. at 151, 406 A.2d at 419. As such, we undertake a <em>de novo </em>review of the trial judge\u2019s ultimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>determination on the issue of voluntariness. Our review of the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress is limited to the record of the suppression hearing. <em>See Cartnail v. State, </em>359 Md. 272, 282, 753 A.2d 519, 524 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">In the first part of the <em>Hillard </em>test, the test is an objective one. We determine whether the police or a State agent made a threat, promise, or inducement. <em>Stokes v. State, </em>289 Md. 155, 161, 423 A.2d 552, 555 (1980). In other words, a suspect\u2019s subjective belief that he or she will be advantaged in some way by confessing will not render the confession involuntary unless the belief was premised upon a statement or action made by an interrogating officer. <em>See id. </em>at 161-62, 423 A.2d at 555 (citing <em>Jones v. State, </em>229 Md. 165, 172, 182 A.2d 784, 788 (1962)). <em>See also Fuget v. State, </em>70 Md.App. 643, 652, 522 A.2d 1371, 1375 (1987)(\u201cwe are unwilling to conclude that [the interrogating officer\u2019s] smile, coddling words, or sympathetic sounds coerced the appellant into making an incriminatory statement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">We also require a promise or offer within the substance of the officer\u2019s eliciting statement. Although a defendant need not point to an express <em>quid pro quo, </em>\u201c[a] mere exhortation to tell the truth is not enough to make a statement involuntary.\u201d <em>Reynolds, </em>327 Md. at 507, 610 A.2d at 788. For example, in <em>Ball, </em>we held that an interrogating officer\u2019s statement that the suspect would be \u201cmuch better if [he] told the story\u201d was not sufficient to render a suspect\u2019s inculpatory statement involuntary. <em>See Ball, </em>347 Md. at 174, 176, 699 A.2d at 1178-79. To similar effect, in <em>Ralph v. State, </em>we concluded that an interrogating officer\u2019s statement that \u201cit would be better if he told the truth\u201d did not render a custodial confession involuntary. <em>See Ralph, </em>226 Md. 480, 486-87, 174 A.2d 163, 166-67 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The second prong of the <em>Hillard </em>test triggers a causation analysis to determine whether there was a nexus between the promise or inducement and the accused\u2019s confession. In <em>Reynolds, </em>we made clear that \u201c[i]f a suspect did not rely on an interrogator\u2019s comments, obviously, the statement is admissi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>ble regardless of whether the interrogator had articulated an improper inducement. By definition, there would have been no \u2018inducement\u2019 at all, because the interrogator \u2018induced\u2019 nothing.\u201d <em>Reynolds, </em>327 Md. at 509, 610 A.2d at 789. <em>See also Johnson v. State, </em>348 Md. 337, 350, 703 A.2d 1267, 1274 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">As to the second factor, the reliance, or nexus, between the inducement and the statement, to determine whether a suspect relied upon an offer of help from an interrogating authority in making a confession we examine the particular facts and circumstances surrounding the confession. One factor we consider is the amount of time elapsed between the inducement and confession. In <em>Ralph, </em>we held that a single, non-repeated statement, made eight hours before a suspect agreed to make a confession was too attenuated for us to conclude that the suspect had relied upon the statement in making his confession. <em>See Ralph, </em>226 Md. at 486, 174 A.2d at 166. <em>See also Reynolds, </em>327 Md. at 510, 610 A.2d at 789-90 (prosecutor\u2019s suggestion to seek counseling, occurring many days before the confession to a police officer, was not an inducement relied upon by the defendant). At the opposite end of the spectrum, in <em>Stokes, </em>we held that a defendant relied on a suggestion made by the police \u201cthat if he would produce the narcotics, his wife would not be arrested,\u201d because the defendant immediately thereafter revealed the location of the narcotics. <em>See Stokes, </em>289 Md. at 157, 159-60, 423 A.2d at 553-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">In addition to the temporal relation between the improper promises and a confession, we also have taken into account whether any factors, other than the interrogating officer\u2019s statements, may have caused the confession. In <em>Johnson v. State, </em>we held that sufficient attenuation circumstances existed between a police officer\u2019s improper inducing statements and a defendant\u2019s confession to render the confession voluntary. <em>See Johnson, </em>348 Md. at 349, 703 A.2d at 1274. After the defendant in <em>Johnson </em>was taken into custody, his interrogators indicated that if he confessed to the crimes at issue, he may get medical treatment instead of getting \u201clocked up for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>the rest of [his] life and the key thrown down the sewer.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>348 Md. at 348, 703 A.2d at 1273. Three days later, the defendant requested to speak with a specific police officer who was not present when the inducements were offered to the defendant, and advised that officer that he wanted to make a confession. Shortly thereafter, the defendant made incriminating statements and wrote a partial confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">On appeal, the defendant contended that his incriminating statements should have been suppressed because his statements were made in reliance on the improper inducements. We rejected that argument, holding that the confession was properly admitted at the defendant\u2019s trial. In reaching our conclusion, we took into account that the defendant initiated the meeting that led to his confession, made the confession three days after the inducements were offered to him, confessed to an officer who was not present when the improper inducements were offered, and confessed in a different building from where the inducements were made. Based on these intervening factors, we concluded that the defendant voluntarily confessed to his crimes. <em>See Johnson, </em>348 Md. at 352, 703 A.2d at 1275. <em>See also Burch, </em>346 Md. at 268, 696 A.2d at 450-51 (alleged prior beating by police officers occurring before the interrogation deemed not to have induced a later confession to a different police detective).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">With this analytical framework in mind, we turn to the facts before us to analyze whether Appellant\u2019s confession was voluntary under <em>Hillard. </em>Beginning with the first prong of the test, we hold, without question, the police officers involved in the interrogation of Appellant made several promises and offers of help to Appellant attempting to elicit his confession. For purposes of presentation here and because the numerous inducing statements made during the interrogation fell into two distinct categories of promises to Appellant, we shall review the statements grouped according to the inducement extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The first group of promises offered to Appellant focused on providing him special consideration in the prosecution of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>case. Apparently the officers sought to convince Appellant that they were motivated, not by a desire to make him confess so he could be convicted, but rather with the benevolent purpose to find out information about how and why he murdered the victims so they could assist him with obtaining psychological assistance and leniency from the prosecuting authorities. At the initial stage of the interrogation, Sergeant Benton laid the foundation for this category by informing Appellant that the officers were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APm\">not interested in sending you to jail for the rest of your life, ... We think the person who committed these needs help. I think you need help. The only way we can get you that help is for you to let us know what happened. We can let the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office know hey, Eugene\u2019s told us what happened, but I think Eugene needs some help. The only way we can do that is for you to explain to us why.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqn\">Shortly after this statement, Officer Benton reiterated, \u201c[w]e can let the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office know that you need help.\u201d Officer Benton then followed with a clear <em>quid pro quo </em>as he attempted to garner information about the crime. The officer stated, \u201cI can mention to the State\u2019s Attorney, I can tell him. I\u2019ll call him right now and tell him, hey Eugene will tell me everything that\u2019s going on but Eugene wants some help too.\u201d Sergeant Fisher followed, shortly thereafter, with \u201cI can make you a promise, okay? I can help you. I could help you, I could try to protect you. I can be your friend. I\u2019m not the enemy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The officers boasted that they had experience in helping people in Appellant\u2019s situation and that they had done so successfully in the past. Driving this point home, Sergeant Ford was introduced into the interrogation as a savior of young African American men involved with law enforcement authorities. When Sergeant Ford first met Appellant, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">I\u2019ve been doing this for almost twenty years. I\u2019ve worked all over the state. I\u2019ve worked in Baltimore. I have been involved with a lot of young black men, pro and con and you know what. I can go to my grave man saying that I\u2019ve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>saved a lot of brothers. I worked in Baltimore City Homicide for almost a year and I saved some brothers man. I\u2019ve saved a lot of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">If any doubt existed regarding how or in what arena Sergeant Ford was going to assist Appellant, Sergeant Fisher cleared it up by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">you know how Frank is .... we don\u2019t have the years of experience. And we also don\u2019t have the knowledge that Frank has about how to work the court system and how to work everything out through the judges. When Frank Ford goes into a courtroom, the judges listen to him. The judge in your case will listen to him. Your trial that you\u2019re doing right now. They\u2019ll listen. You\u2019ve got Frank Ford and he\u2019s doing all that stuff, and he\u2019s sitting here offering to help you and offering to talk to you. Frank\u2019s been there. And I hope that when I have the years on the job like he does \u2014 I mean, we\u2019re good. We work and we\u2019re good. But Frank Ford. He\u2019s the man.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Following this bold introduction, Sergeant Ford explained to Appellant how he was going to assist Appellant with his current problems. He closed with, \u201c[t]his is what I\u2019m supposed to do. I am not supposed to put people in jail. I\u2019m supposed to prevent things from happening. I\u2019m supposed to help people. This is my function, you follow me?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">The thrust of the interrogation tactics utilized by Sergeants Benton, Fisher, and Ford was that if Appellant confessed to the murders, the officers would help him. Specifically, they would contact the prosecuting authorities in order to provide him leniency during his subsequent prosecution. The officers purportedly would carry out their offers by advocating on Appellant\u2019s behalf to the state\u2019s attorney and the judge presiding over his anticipated trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">Intertwined with these conspicuous offers to provide Appellant with assistance in his predicament was the second category of inducements offered in exchange for a confession. The officers explained to Appellant that the residents of Salisbury (Appellant\u2019s hometown and the county seat of Wicomico Coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>ty in which Fruitland \u2014 the Mainors\u2019 town \u2014 also was located) were outraged by the murders and wanted to avenge the victims\u2019 deaths. At the suppression hearing, Sergeant Ford stated that the people of Salisbury loved John and Geraldine Mainor because they had been teachers in the area for many years. Based on this, the officers told Appellant that the Mends of the victims were coming after him for revenge. The officers explained to him that if he identified the bodies and showed remorse for murdering the victims, essentially they could protect him from any vigilantes. If he continued to deny committing the murders, however, the officers implied that they could not guarantee Appellant\u2019s safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Sergeant Benton set the early tone for this aspect of the officers\u2019 strategy by stating, \u201c[t]he community is in an uproar ... you think we\u2019re the only ones right now that are looking for you. Why do you think we wanted so much to look for you tonight?\u201d Then, after Sergeant Ford was introduced, he began to preach to Appellant, lacing his sermons with phrases that could lead Appellant to believe that by confessing and showing remorse he would inspire the officers to protect him and possibly gain a chance at avoiding prison. Among his many inducing remarks, Sergeant Ford made the following declarations toward the end of the interrogation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">People are thinking now that you don\u2019t love her [Christie] and the war just goes on like this. Their going to just bolster her up. He didn\u2019t love her. You do the right thing. You say you love her and then we\u2019ll help you. We will help you inside and we will help you if you would like us too. You got a better chance in life. You got a better chance at freedom. That\u2019s why they call it an accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Sergeant Ford later added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">In this situation, that\u2019s your only way of help. You\u2019ve got no more help. That\u2019s it. This is your only way of help. This coming clean and getting this child back here.... All of that\u2019s changed. You can leave Salisbury after all of this. Start your life someplace else. Which you might have to. I\u2019m not going to lie to you about that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Finally, before the final gap in the tape, he finally cautioned Appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">I\u2019ve got to save you, mentally, and I\u2019ve got to save you physically. And this family can help you physically. You see what I\u2019m saying? You follow what I\u2019m saying to you? Because I know that there are people in that family and not the immediate family who are ready to come out here and do some bad things to you. You follow me? And I can\u2019t be there all the time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Unquestionably, the second group of inducing remarks made it clear to Appellant that, in order to insure the officers\u2019 protection from the alleged angry mob of Salisbury residents, he needed to confess to murdering the Mainors.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">In prior cases, we have held that the following statements constituted improper inducements: \u201cproduce the narcotics, [and your] wife would not be arrested\u201d <em>Stokes, </em>289 Md. at 157, 423 A.2d at 553; \u201cif you are telling me the truth ... I will go to bat for you,\u201d <em>Hillard, </em>286 Md. at 153, 406 A.2d at 420; \u201cit would be better for [you] if [you] made a statement because if [you] did they would try to get him put on probation,\u201d <em>Streams v. State, </em>238 Md. 278, 281, 208 A.2d 614, 615 (1965); \u201cit will help you a lot,\u201d <em>Lubinski v. State, </em>180 Md. 1, 4-5, 22 A.2d 455, 457-58 (1941); and \u201cit would be better ... to tell the truth and have no more trouble about it,\u201d <em>Biscoe v. State, </em>67 Md. 6, 6, 8 A. 571, 571 (1887). The common thread in each of these cases is that a singular statement communicated to the suspect may be sufficient to qualify as an inappropriate offer of help held out to the suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">In the present case, the interrogating officers\u2019 statements and conduct go far beyond that in any of our prior cases where improper inducements were recognized. During the twelve hour interrogation, the officers repeated many times that they would help Appellant. They offered him an apparent means to garner leniency from the state prosecutors and the trial court and protection from an angry mob. The only thing Appellant had to do in return for these meaningful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>inducements was confess to a triple murder. The first prong of the <em>Hillard </em>test has been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Turning to the second part of the <em>Hillard </em>analysis, our inquiry focuses on whether the State has shouldered its burden to prove that Appellant did not rely on the inducements held out to him by the interrogating officers in making his confession. <em>See Hillard, </em>286 Md. at 153, 406 A.2d at 420. In its brief and again at oral argument, the State argued that the inducements made during the interrogation, in combination or each standing alone, were not the cause of Appellant\u2019s confession. To support its argument, the State suggests that Appellant\u2019s behavior and manner during the interrogation indicated that the statements communicated to him during the interrogation made no impression on him. The State characterizes Appellant as appearing \u201csmug,\u201d \u201ccold,\u201d and \u201chard\u201d as he sat calmly and listened to the officers. Specifically, the State points out that at one point during a long soliloquy by Sergeant Ford, Appellant \u201capparently unfazed by Ford\u2019s words, simply asked to go to the bathroom.\u201d This, the State proposes, illustrates Appellant\u2019s mind was not focused on or receptive to the interrogation tactics, and therefore, the officers\u2019 statements had little, if any, impact on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The State further contends that Appellant\u2019s answers to certain interrogation questions were indicative of someone that was not swayed by a potential grant of leniency or offers of protection. The State highlights for us that when Sergeant Benton asked Appellant if he was \u201cscared of going to jail,\u201d or \u201cof what people would think,\u201d Appellant replied that he was not scared of anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">We are not persuaded by the State\u2019s effort to convince us that the officers\u2019 statements were not the cause of Appellant\u2019s confession. In light of the suppression record in this case, we cannot comprehend how the State legitimately could characterize Appellant as a calm, collected individual during the interrogation. The record before the Circuit Court at the suppression hearings reveals that Appellant was intimidated by his surroundings and impressed by the matters communi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>cated to him by the officers. The officers themselves, in comments made during and after the interrogation, made it abundantly clear that Appellant was not \u201ccalm,\u201d \u201ccool,\u201d or \u201csmug.\u201d During the interrogation, Sergeant Benton claimed he could see Appellant\u2019s heart beating through his jacket. As Sergeant Fisher questioned Appellant, she noted, \u201c[yjou\u2019re shaking like a leaf. Can you feel that? You\u2019re shaking and you\u2019re cold. My God you\u2019re cold. [Sergeant Benton is] hot, I\u2019m hot. You\u2019re freezing.\u201d At the suppression hearing, Sergeant Benton testified that \u201cAppellant\u2019s \u201cjaw was quivering\u201d during the questioning and Sergeant Fisher later explained that Appellant \u201chad a nervous twitch in his neck\u201d and \u201chis heart was beating rather fast.\u201d She also added that she had to get a cold towel for Appellant\u2019s head and that she was \u201cafraid he was going to commit suicide.\u201d Taking into account the apparent physical manifestations of Appellant\u2019s fear, the fact that he was quiet during much of the interrogation and sometimes only gave terse answers to the officers\u2019 questions, is equally indicative that he was overwhelmed by the situation unfolding before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The timing of the confession vis \u00e1 vis the statements of the officers does not support the State\u2019s thesis of non-reliance. Appellant sat through twelve hours of interrogation during which he answered hundreds of questions and listened to long exhortations addressing many different reasons why he should confess to the crimes. Throughout the early to middle parts of the interrogation, he consistently denied any involvement in the murders. Each time Sergeant Benton suggested that Appellant had already confessed to the murders, Appellant clearly stated \u201cI wasn\u2019t there\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d Appellant maintained this position for hours. It was only after many more hours of statements that the officers \u201ccould help him\u201d and \u201ctry to protect him\u201d that Appellant changed his story.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The timing of the actual confession is critical. Because of the apparent malfunctioning of the tape recorder, we are unable to tell precisely when all the police inducements were complete, but sometime after 3:45 a.m. and before 6:00 a.m., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>just before Appellant confessed, Sergeant Ford uttered some of the more flagrant promises to Appellant, including statements regarding \u201cleaving Salisbury after all this\u201d and that Sergeant Ford had to \u201csave\u201d Appellant because people \u201care ready to come out here and do some bad things to [him].\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The closeness in time between these significant inducements and the actual confession leaves us unpersuaded that the State has met its burden to demonstrate Appellant did not rely upon them in deciding to make his confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">We are also persuaded by the fact that the State has failed to point out any other, intervening factors that may have caused Appellant to confess when he did, or which may have attenuated the effect of the improper inducements. Unlike <em>Johnson, </em>in the present case there is no attenuation in time or circumstance, no change of environment, and no interruptive change of the interrogation team. Appellant confessed to virtually the same team of officers, in the same environment in which his entire interrogation took place, following twelve hours of interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The final factor that weighs in our analysis is the egregiousness of the officers\u2019 conduct. The State argues that the interrogation was \u201ca classic example of effective police interviewing.\u201d The opposite is true. As evidenced by our holding, the tactics employed by the officers are counter-effective. In the present case, we are not upsetting Appellant\u2019s convictions because the interrogating officers merely stepped over the line of effective and permissible interrogation tactics. Rather, these officers disregarded interrogation guidelines in their quest to gain a confession. The State carries the burden to establish that Appellant\u2019s confession was made \u201cfree of any coercive barnacles.\u201d <em>See Hillard, </em>286 Md. at 150, 406 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>418. The State has failed to meet its burden, and therefore, we hold that the Circuit Court erred in denying Appellant\u2019s suppression motion as to the ultimate confession.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\n<em>The Trial Judge\u2019s Ex Parte Communications with the Jury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">As recounted earlier in this opinion, the trial judge admitted having <em>ex parte </em>communications with the jury during Appellant\u2019s trial. As a result of the judge\u2019s disclosure of those communications, Appellant made a motion for mistrial, which was denied. Appellant argues that Maryland Rules 4-326(c)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and 4-231 <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> required the trial judge to notify him and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>State\u2019s Attorney before speaking with the jury and that all communications with the jury must be on the record. Appellant asserts, under our common law, that he has a right to be present during all phases of his trial and the trial judge\u2019s action denied him this fundamental right and also violated the Maryland Rules. Appellant contends finally that the inappropriate actions of the trial judge did not constitute harmless error and, therefore, warrant reversal. Based on the record, it is evident that the judge acted improperly in this case and violated the Maryland Rules and our common law principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Because we reverse for the reasons stated in Part I of this opinion, we need not determine whether Appellant\u2019s proposed remedy is warranted also based on the trial judge\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>communications with the jury. We note only that the trial judge presiding over this case made a serious misjudgment. Moreover, we are inclined to believe it will not be repeated at any new trial of Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The rules governing communications between the judge and the jury are basic and relatively simple to adhere to in practice. If a judge receives a communication from the jury or wishes to communicate with the jury, he or she is required to notify the parties. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4-326(c). The communication with the jury shall be made in open court on the record or shall be made in writing and the writing shall become part of the record. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4-326(e). Putting aside certain exceptions not relevant here, the defendant has a recognized right to be present during communications between the judge and the jury during his trial. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4 \u2014 231(b); <em>Stewart v. State, </em>334 Md. 213, 224-25, 638 A.2d 754, 759 (1994); <em>Williams v. State, </em>292 Md. 201, 211, 438 A.2d 1301, 1306 (1981)(\u201ca criminal defendant\u2019s right to be present at every stage of his trial is a common law right [and] is to some extent protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\u201d). These rules are not abstract guides. They are mandatory and must be strictly followed. <em>See Taylor v. State, </em>352 Md. 338, 344, 722 A.2d 65, 68 (1998); <em>Stewart, </em>334 Md. at 222, 638 A.2d at 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>In the past, we have reversed convictions based on judicial failures to grasp the importance of these fundamental rules. In <em>Stewart, </em>the trial judge spoke with a distressed juror in the doorway of the jury room. <em>Stewart, </em>334 Md. at 230, 638 A.2d at 762. The communication involved a division of opinion among the jury. Without inquiring into the specifics of the division, the judge sent the jury back into the jury room to deliberate. The judge later informed counsel of the <em>ex parte </em>communication and counsel subsequently moved for a mistrial, which the judge later denied. The jury returned with a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">We reversed the convictions on appeal based on the <em>ex parte </em>communication. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">[a]ny communication pertaining to the action between the jury and the trial judge during the course of the jury\u2019s deliberations is a stage of the trial entitling the defendant to be present. The right is deemed \u201cabsolute,\u201d and a judgment of conviction ordinarily cannot be upheld if the record discloses a violation of the right. It is clear that the judge\u2019s failure to obtain [the defendant\u2019s] presence at his encounter with the juror ... was erroneous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-7\"><em>Stewart, </em>334 Md. at 224-25, 638 A.2d at 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">On the question of whether the trial judge\u2019s mistake constituted harmless error, we held that, regardless of the judge\u2019s innocent motives in speaking with the juror or how unimportant the communication may have been, \u201cthe mere opportunity for improper influence in [the defendant\u2019s] absence prejudiced him.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>334 Md. at 229, 638 A.2d at 761. <em>See also Taylor, </em>352 Md. at 354-55, 722 A.2d at 73 (trial judge\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>communication with juror regarding basic juror questions required reversal).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">The trial judge in the present case summarized his recollection of what he said during the communications with the jury during the recess. The substance of the exchanges, as he related them, appear facially to be innocuous. Even if the communications were innocent or insignificant, however, they still potentially prejudiced Appellant. This lapse* in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>discretion by the trial judge disturbed the integrity of the record and prevented us and Appellant from scrutinizing effectively the improper communications on appeal. The mandatory nature of the rules governing judge-to-jury communications becomes heightened particularly during a capital sentencing proceeding. Enough said.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">\n<em>Redaction of Pre-Sentence Investigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A34\">We do not reach or decide this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence for the Burglary Conviction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">Notwithstanding our holding that the Circuit Court erred in denying Appellant\u2019s suppression motion and permitting his confession to be admitted into evidence at trial, we also must consider Appellant\u2019s sufficiency of the evidence argument as to his burglary conviction. When a criminal defendant properly appeals the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his or her conviction on any count, Maryland appellate courts normally address the sufficiency issues even when that court decides to reverse the judgment of the trial court on another ground. The rationale for this is based on double jeopardy principles. If we were to hold that the evidence before the fact finder, including the improperly admitted evidence, was legally sufficient to support a burglary conviction, Appellant would be precluded from arguing successfully that the double jeopardy protection bars a retrial on that charge. This is so because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aym\">[w]hen a criminal defendant takes an appeal and succeeds in having his conviction reversed on a ground other than the sufficiency of the evidence, the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause does not preclude a retrial of the defendant on the same charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-10\"><em>State v. Kramer, </em>318 Md. 576, 593, 569 A.2d 674, 682 (1990) (quoting <em>Huffington v. State, </em>302 Md. 184, 189, 486 A.2d 200, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>203 (1983)). <em>See also Warfield v. State, </em>315 Md. 474, 502, 554 A.2d 1238, 1252 (1989). If, on the other hand, we hold that the evidence admitted at trial was insufficient to sustain the burglary conviction, then double jeopardy prohibits the retrial of Appellant for burglary because of original error committed by the trial court. <em>See Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 11, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 2147, 57 L.Ed.2d 1, 9 (1978) (\u201c[t]he Double Jeopardy Clause forbids a second trial for the purpose of affording the prosecution another opportunity to supply evidence which it failed to muster in the first proceeding\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">When reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence challenge, it is not the function of the appellate court to undertake a review of the record that would amount to a retrial of the case. <em>See State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 478, 649 A.2d 336, 337 (1994). Rather, the standard of review regarding the sufficiency of evidence to support a criminal conviction is \u201cwhether the record evidence could reasonably support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2788, 61 L.Ed.2d 560, 573 (1979); <em>Oken v. State, </em>327 Md. 628, 661, 612 A.2d 258, 274 (1992); <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 717, 415 A.2d 830, 842 (1980). In other words, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and will reverse the judgment only if we find that no rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime. <em>See State v. Sowell, </em>353 Md. 713, 726, 728 A.2d 712, 719 (1999); <em>Oken, </em>327 Md. at 661, 612 A.2d at 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Applying this standard to the agreed statement of facts in this case, we hold there was sufficient evidence contained there to convict Appellant of burglary in the first degree. The statutory definition of burglary in the first degree provides that \u201ca person may not break and enter the dwelling of another with the intent to commit a theft or crime of violence.\u201d Maryland Code, (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 1999 cum. supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 29;<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>See also Conyers v. State, </em>345 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number><em>525, 557, </em>693 A.2d 781, 796 (1997). Statutory crimes of violence include abduction, arson in the first degree, kidnap-ing, voluntary manslaughter, mayhem and maiming, murder, rape, robbery, carjacking, first and second degree sexual offense, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence, attempts thereto, and first and second degree assault. <em>See </em>Maryland Code, (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 1999 cum. supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 643B(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The breaking element of burglary \u201cmay be satisfied where it is shown that there has been an \u2018actual\u2019 breaking, or the breaking occurred \u2018constructively,\u2019 through an entry gained by artifice, by fraud, conspiracy, or by threats.\u201d <em>Oken, </em>327 Md. at 662, 612 A.2d at 274; <em>Brooks v. State, 277 </em>Md. 155, 159-160, 353 A.2d 217, 220 (1976); <em>Williams v. State, </em>205 Md. 470, 477, 109 A.2d 89, 93 (1954). We have also defined constructive breaking to include \u201c[e]very unlawful entry.\u201d <em>Brooks, 277 </em>Md. at 160, 353 A.2d at 220. The Court' of Special Appeals has noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">The breaking element is not limited to an outside door or window. If the outside door is open but the felonious design requires entrance into a part of the building which is closed, the making of an opening into that part of the house is a breaking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-7\"><em>Arnold v. State, 7 </em>Md.App. 1, 4, 252 A.2d 878, 879 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Appellant argues there was insufficient evidence to prove he \u201cbroke\u201d into the Mainors\u2019 home. He asserts that his conviction was based solely upon his confession to the police and Allan Mainor\u2019s testimony that John Mainor was security conscious and usually kept his doors locked. Appellant contends there was no \u201cbreak\u201d because his statements to the police do not admit, nor indicate, a breaking of the Mainors\u2019 house, and that John Mainor\u2019s security habits are irrelevant. In support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>of his argument, Appellant contends his statements to the police are \u201cmore susceptible of an inference that [Appellant] walked through a door left open by the Mainors than it is that [Appellant] broke into the house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">We find Appellant\u2019s arguments to be unpersuasive. From the record before the Circuit Court, a rational trier of fact could find the essential elements of first degree burglary beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Sowell, </em>353 Md. at 726, 728 A.2d at 719; <em>Oken, </em>327 Md. at 661, 612 A.2d at 274. According to the agreed statement of the facts, the following occurred as Appellant approached the Mainors\u2019 residence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">At that point he observed Christie Lee Mainor walk into the side garage door. The [Appellant] admitted that he walked up behind her and she screamed. The [Appellant] then said that he and Christie, Christie Mainor, were in the garage and that Mr. John Mainor came out of the kitchen with a knife. The [Appellant] said Mr. Mainor told Christie to get inside the residence, that John Mainor pushed the [Appellant] and, according to the statement of the [Appellant], a struggle then ensued over the knife at which time the [Appellant] indicated he was cut. The [Appellant] said that he got the knife away from Mr. Mainor and then cut Mr. Mainor on the neck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">The [Appellant] said Mr. Mainor then located the hammer and struck the [Appellant] on his leg. The [Appellant] said that he got the hammer away from Mr. Mainor and the [Appellant] then told the troopers that he told Mr. Mainor to get into the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">According to the [Appellant\u2019s] statement, Mr. Mainor went into the house and began knocking things off of the counter. I would note that Dr. Locke indicated that the injury to the skull of Mr. John Mainor would initially cause a loss of equilibrium and difficulty with balance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">Going on with the [Appellant\u2019s] statement, he indicated that all three victims were screaming and yelling and that while he was holding the knife he told them to all sit down and shut up. The [Appellant] stated to the troopers that at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>that point the Mainors were on the couch, meaning John and Geraldine Mainor were on the couch, but that he did not know where Christie was.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">A rational fact finder could conclude that Appellant violently struggled with John Mainor in order to gain access to the Mainors\u2019 residence. Appellant admitted that he took a knife away from John Mainor and cut him on the neck. He then took the hammer from John Mainor and, given John Mainor\u2019s loss of balance upon re-entering his residence, Appellant most likely hit him in the head with a hammer. It could be concluded also that Appellant ordered John Mainor \u201cto get into the house.\u201d This command occurred while Appellant was armed with a knife and, in all likelihood, a hammer, after he cut John Mainor with the knife, and, presumably, hit him in the head with the hammer. Our analysis is unaffected by the fact that the \u201cbreak\u201d did not occur at the outside garage door because the \u201cbreaking\u201d of an inner door to a dwelling is sufficient for burglary. <em>See Arnold, </em>7 Md.App. at 4, 252 A.2d at 879. The agreed facts indicate that Appellant gained access to the Mainors\u2019 residence by force, while armed with both a knife and hammer, thus constituting a \u201cconstructive break.\u201d <em>See Oken, </em>327 Md. at 662, 612 A.2d at 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">In <em>Hebron v. State, </em>we stated an \u201centry occurs when \u2018any part of ... [the trespasser\u2019s] person is within the house\u2019 \u201c and that the entry is \u201csufficient if any part of the actor\u2019s person intruded, even momentarily, into the structure.\u201d <em>See Hebron, </em>331 Md. 219, 236, 627 A.2d 1029, 1037 (1993). According to Appellant\u2019s statement to the police, he entered the Mainors\u2019 home through the kitchen door following his altercation with John Mainor. The \u201centry\u201d requirement for first degree burglary was fulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">We next consider whether there was sufficient evidence from which a rational fact finder could have concluded that Appellant had the requisite intent to commit a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as he was \u201cbreaking and entering\u201d the Mainors\u2019 residence. When analyzing the intent to commit a \u201ctheft or crime of violence,\u201d the actual intention at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>breaking is controlling. <em>See Reed v. State, </em>316 Md. 521, 526, 560 A.2d 1104, 1106 (1989); <em>Pearre v. State, </em>237 Md. 622, 624, 206 A.2d 249, 250 (1965). As we stated in <em>Reed, </em>\u201cit is not burglary if the intent is formed after the breaking and entering are completed.\u201d <em>Reed, </em>316 Md. at 526, 560 A.2d at 1106.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Because of the frequent practical difficulties in proving directly an accused\u2019s intention when he or she breaks into a dwelling, we have held that the intention at the time of the break may be inferred from the circumstances. <em>See Reed, </em>316 Md. at 527, 560 A.2d at 1107; <em>Ridley v. State, </em>228 Md. 281, 282, 179 A.2d 710, 711 (1962). More specifically, we have stated that \u201c[Qinding the requisite intent to [commit a violent crime] is . .. never a precise process for intent is subjective, and it must therefore be inferred from the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Reed, </em>316 at 527, 560 A.2d at 1106-07. A trier of fact therefore may examine the surrounding circumstances, including an accused\u2019s acts and declarations, in order to reach a rational conclusion regarding the intention of the accused. <em>See Ridley, </em>228 Md. at 282, 179 A.2d at 711; <em>Rahe v. State, </em>222 Md. 508, 510, 161 A.2d 696, 697 (1960); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 540, 545, 248 A.2d 663, 666-67 (1968). A \u201csurreptitious or forceful breaking\u201d strongly indicates criminal intent. <em>See Reed, </em>316 Md. at 527, 560 A.2d at 1107. We also have explained that the most conclusive evidence in determining whether an accused intended to commit a violent crime is the commission of the violent crime itself. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Appellant\u2019s statement to the police permitted a rational trier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant had the requisite intent to commit a violent crime when he \u201cbroke and entered\u201d the Mainors\u2019 home. <em>See Oken, </em>327 Md. at 661, 612 A.2d at 274. Appellant\u2019s violent struggle with John Mainor in the garage, and the forceful nature of his \u201cbreak\u201d, constitutes a first degree assault prior to entering the Mainor residence. This first degree assault, prior to entering the Mainors\u2019 home, strongly suggests Appellant intended to perpetrate a violent crime upon entering the Mainor residence. <em>See Reed, </em>316 Md. at 527, 560 A.2d at 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>\u25a0 Based on the agreed statement of facts, a rational fact finder could have inferred that Appellant committed an assault in the first degree and murder in the first degree, both obvious \u201cviolent crimes\u201d, while inside the Mainor residence. <em>See </em>Maryland Code, (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 1999 cum. supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 648B(a). Appellant recounted in his statements in the agreed statement of facts that, upon \u201cbreaking and entering\u201d the Mainors\u2019 residence,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">.... that all three victims were screaming and yelling and that while he was holding the knife he told them to all sit down and shut up. The [Appellant] stated to the troopers that at that point the Mainors were on the couch, meaning John and Geraldine Mainor were on the couch, but that he did not know where Christie was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">The [Appellant] stated that he recalls someone running through the house, struck him with a chair, and that it may have been Christie.

Accordingly, although Winder did not testify at the suppression hearing, the filing of his proper motion to suppress triggered the State\u2019s burden of proof as to the components of the voluntariness analysis, and preserved for appellate review the trial court\u2019s pretrial ruling on the motion.
