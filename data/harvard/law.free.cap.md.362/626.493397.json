Bushey (Miranda), a high school sophomore, and Susan C. Bushey (Susan), a high school senior. The accident occurred while Susan was driving a 1988 Cadillac Cimarron in which Miranda was riding as a passenger. The Cadillac was owned by the sisters\u2019 grandfather, Earl T. Weeks (Weeks). Susan crossed a double yellow line while attempting to pass a slower moving vehicle and struck an oncoming vehicle head-on. She died within one-half hour after the accident, and Miranda died from her injuries five days later. At the time of the accident, the Cadillac was insured under a Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company motor vehicle liability policy with limits of $20,000/$4Q,000. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>policy was issued to Weeks, and Susan was a named insured under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Also in effect at the time of the accident was a commercial lines policy that William B. Bushey (Bushey), the father of Susan and Miranda, had purchased from the respondent, Northern Assurance Company of America (Northern), for his gasoline station and automotive repair business. Northern\u2019s policy contains UM/UIM provisions. The limit for that coverage is $1,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Bushey and his wife, Linda K. Bushey, (jointly, the Parents) have asserted a wrongful death claim against the Estate of Susan. Bushey, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Miranda, also has asserted a survival claim against the Estate of Susan. The Parents, individually, and Bushey, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Miranda, are the petitioners in this Court (the Petitioners).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">A controversy exists between the Petitioners and Northern concerning coverage under the UM/UIM provisions of Northern\u2019s policy for the claims asserted by the Petitioners against Susan\u2019s estate. To resolve the controversy the Petitioners instituted in the Circuit Court for Charles County a declaratory judgment action which named Northern as a defendant. Northern denied coverage and, alternatively, asserted that Susan had no liability to the Parents on the wrongful death claim because of parent-child immunity. The circuit court entered judgment in favor of Northern.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">Petitioners appealed to the Court of Special Appeals which affirmed. <em>Bushey v. Northern Assurance Co., </em>130 Md.App. 169, 745 A.2d 444 (2000). That court gave two reasons in support of its holding that there was no coverage. First, it said that Bushey\u2019s sole proprietorship, the named insured under the commercial lines policy, was \u201ca business entity, not an individual,\u201d so that a critical definition in the policy concerning \u201cfamily members\u201d was said not to apply. <em>Id. </em>at 178, 745 A.2d at 449. Further, the court construed the UM/UIM endorse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>ment in the context of the entire policy as, in effect, unambiguously requiring that the motor vehicle occupied by Miranda at the time of the fatal accident be a \u201ccovered \u2018auto\u2019 \u201d that was scheduled in the \u201cGarage Declarations\u201d of the \u201cCommercial Auto Coverage Part\u201d of the Northern policy. The Court of Special Appeals also held that parent-child immunity applied. <em>Id. </em>at 178-81, 745 A.2d at 449-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">Petitioners sought certiorari review in this Court, which we granted. <em>Bushey v. Northern Assurance, </em>358 Md. 608, 751 A.2d 470 (2000). As explained below, we disagree on the interpretation of the policy with respect to the coverage issue, and we disagree as to the immunity issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">In <em>Sullins v.

There we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-8\">\u201cIn Maryland, insurance policies, like other contracts, are construed as a whole to determine the parties\u2019 intentions. <em>Cheney v.

Utica Mutual [Ins. Co.], </em>330 Md. 758, 779, 625 A.2d 1021[, 1031] (1993).

Northern\u2019s position, however, does not take into account the provisions of the policy, set forth below, on which the Petitioners rely. Part \u201cA. COVERAGE\u201d of the Endorsement provides in \u00b6 1 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">\u201cWe will pay all sums the \u2018insured\u2019 is legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or driver of an \u2018uninsured motor vehicle.\u2019 The damages must result from \u2018bodily injury' sustained by the \u2018insured\u2019 ... caused by an \u2018accident\u2019. ...\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Part B defines \u201cWHO IS AN INSURED\u201d under the Endorsement.

Any \u2018family member\u2019 while \u2018occupying\u2019 or when struck by <em>any vehicle owned by that family member\u2019 </em>that is not a covered \u2018auto\u2019 for Uninsured Motorists Coverage under this Coverage Form; or \u201cc. Any \u2018family member\u2019 while \u2018occupying\u2019 or when struck by any vehicle owned by you that is insured for Uninsured Motorists Coverage on a primary basis under any other Coverage Form or policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">Petitioners\u2019 reading looks primarily to Part B of the Endorsement. Petitioners say that the named insured (\u201cYou\u201d) is Bushey, an individual, and that Miranda was a \u201cfamily member.\u201d Accordingly, Miranda was an \u201cinsured\u201d under the insuring clause of the Endorsement, there is no exclusion that applies to her, and the UM/UIM coverage applies to the claim of her estate. Similarly, and assuming that Susan\u2019s estate would be liable to the Parents, the wrongful death claim of the Parents is because of the \u201cbodily injury\u201d sustained by Miranda and would be covered by Part B, \u00b6 4 of the Endorsement. Miranda\u2019s \u201cbodily injury\u201d is not excluded from the UM/UIM <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>coverage because, although she was occupying an auto that was not a covered auto, the exclusion for claims by a family member injured while occupying a non-covered vehicle is subject to the further limitation that the non-covered vehicle be owned by the injured family member. <em>See </em>Endorsement, Part C, \u00b6 3.b.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Northern\u2019s reading of the policy, under which the entire Endorsement is limited by its introduction to a \u201ccovered \u2018auto\u2019 \u201d renders Part B, \u00b6 3 redundant. If, regardless of relationship to the named insured, all claimants for UM/UIM benefits must have been occupants of a \u201c \u2018covered auto,\u2019 \u201d it becomes totally unnecessary to specify in Part B, \u00b6 3 that payment of those benefits for \u201canyone else,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>other than the named insured or a \u201cfamily\u201d member of the named insured, depended on \u201c \u2018occupying\u2019 a covered \u2018auto.\u2019 \u201d Similarly, it would have been unnecessary to exclude from \u201c[bjodily injury\u201d in Part C, \u00b6 3.b an injury sustained by a family member in \u201cany vehicle owed by that family member that is not a covered \u2018auto,\u2019 \u201d if occupying any non-covered auto, in and of itself, would exclude coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The references to covered autos in the general structure of the policy on which Northern relies at best create an ambiguity. No extrinsic evidence has been offered to resolve the ambiguity. Accordingly, if Bushey is the insured and if Miranda is a \u201cfamily member,\u201d there is coverage, because the ambiguity, if any, concerning occupying a \u201ccovered \u2018auto\u2019 \u201d is resolved against Northern.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">The \u201cyou\u201d of the policy is not a business entity separate from Bushey. The amendment to the policy identifies the insured as \u201cWilliam Bushey t/a Bushey\u2019s Automotive Repair.\u201d Northern does not dispute that Bushey\u2019s Automotive Repair is a sole proprietorship wholly owed by Bushey. Nevertheless, Northern argues that the policy was a commercial policy issued for a business and that it did not cover Bushey as an individual. Northern\u2019s argument, simply put, is wong.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>The sole proprietorship form of business provides \u201ccomplete identity of the business entity with the proprietor himself....\u201d 1 Z.

In <em>Jensen, </em>a twelve year old girl, Katie Jensen, suffered severe injuries while riding in an uninsured pickup truck, owned by the father of a friend, that was involved in a single-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>vehicle accident. <em>Id. </em>at 537. The commercial policy in issue in that case provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-4\">\u201cWe will pay all sums the <em>\u2018insured\u2019 </em>is legally entitled to recover as compensatory damages from the owner or driver of an \u2018uninsured\u2019 or \u2018underinsured motor vehicle\u2019 caused by an \u2018accident.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 539. The declarations page identified the \u201cNamed Insured\u201d as \u201cEAGLE EXCAVATING JENSEN ROGER DBA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539-40. The policy then described an \u201c \u2018insured\u2019 \u201d as: \u201c \u20181. You. 2. <em>If you are an individual, </em>any \u201cfamily member.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540. The Minnesota intermediate appellate court held that \u201cEagle Excavating, the named insured in this \u2018commercial\u2019 policy, is not an individual; it is a business. Hence-, the policy does not apply to Katie Jensen and summary judgment for United Fire was proper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>No authority was cited in support of this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The few reported cases that deal specifically with UM/UIM coverage in policies naming a sole proprietorship as the insured find, with the major exception of <em>Jensen, </em>that the language referring to family members in the uninsured motorist endorsement renders the policy ambiguous. For example, in <em>American Bankers Ins. Co. v. Stack, </em>208 N. J.Super. 75, 504 A.2d 1219 (Law Div.1984), the policy had been issued to Mobile Wash Systems, a business that was a sole proprietorship, but the individual owner was not named in the policy. The sole proprietor\u2019s son was injured while a passenger in a non-covered truck, owned by another person, and not used in the business of Mobile Wash Systems. The son sought to recover uninsured motorist benefits under the policy issued to Mobile Wash Systems. <em>Id. </em>at 1219. In holding that the policy provided UM/UIM coverage for the proprietor\u2019s son, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">\u201cThe issuance of an insurance policy to a trade-name business gives rise to disputes regarding coverage in the absence of clarifying language. It is clear that nowhere in the insurance policy issued by plaintiff to Mobile Wash Systems is it expressly stated that the policy is purely for commercial use. Item No. 6 of the policy states that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>purposes for which the automobiles are to be used are \u2018pleasure and business.\u2019 The definition of \u2018insured\u2019 in the UM endorsement reads as if the named insured is a natural person. There is also no express exclusion of family members of unincorporated business enterprises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1221. Therefore, the New Jersey court found that the policy was ambiguous and construed it against the insurer. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">In <em>Purcell v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>168 Ga.App. 863, 310 S.E.2d 530 (1983), a \u201c \u2018business auto policy' \u201d was issued to \u201c \u2018Purcell Radiator Serv.,\u2019 \u201d identified in the policy as an \u201c \u2018individual\u2019 business.\u201d <em>Purcell, </em>310 S.E.2d at 531. The wife of the business owner had been struck as a pedestrian by an underinsured vehicle. <em>Id. </em>She claimed under the UIM coverage as a \u201cfamily member\u201d of the named insured. Finding that the language regarding \u201c \u2018family members\u2019 \u201d did \u201cnot demonstrate that the intent of the policy was not to afford the [personal] coverage sought,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 532, the court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-6\">\u201cWhile it is true that the endorsement provides that it is effective \u2018if the named insured is an individual, there is no explanation as to why such an endorsement would be included in a \u2018business auto\u2019 policy issued to an \u2018individual\u2019 business. No explanation for the inclusion of this endorsement is readily apparent except the reasonable inference that the intent was to make what would otherwise be a \u2018business auto policy\u2019 issued to an \u2018individual\u2019 business in effect a \u2018personal\u2019 policy for at least some coverages afforded thereunder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">Somewhat analogous is <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., </em>74 Md.App. 539, 539 A.2d 239 (1988), involving a \u201cGarage Policy\u201d issued by Hartford to \u201c \u2018Sidney H. Cohen &amp; Consumer Rent-A-Car t/a Wholesale Heaven.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543, 539 A.2d at 241. Hartford contended that the policy unambiguously provided liability coverage solely for the garage business known as Wholesale Heaven. <em>Id. </em>Aetna argued that the policy unambiguously provided liability coverage to Cohen, as an individual, because the declarations contained an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>\u201cX\u201d next to the \u201cIndividual\u201d designation and principally because the endorsement for personal injury protection provided individual coverage for members of Cohen\u2019s family by using a personal insurance form. <em>Id. </em>at 545-46, 539 A.2d at 242-43. The Court of Special Appeals found that the reference to family members rendered the policy ambiguous so that the trial court properly allowed extrinsic evidence to be introduced by Hartford. <em>Id. </em>Thus, judgment on a jury verdict in favor of Hartford was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Northern refers us to certain cases involving corporations as the named insured where courts have held that the policy\u2019s inclusion of family members as additional insureds did not result in coverage. Initially we note that there is a considerable body of authority holding that including family members as additional insureds in a policy issued to a corporation as named insured <em>does </em>result in coverage for the family members, <em>see, e.g., Hawkeye-Security Ins. Co. v. Lambrecht &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>852 P.2d 1317, 1319 (Colo.Ct.App.1993); <em>Ceci v. National Indent. Co., </em>225 Conn. 165, 622 A.2d 545, 550 (1993); <em>Home Folks Mobile Homes, Inc. v. Meridian Mut. Ins. Co., </em>744 S.W.2d 749, 750 (Ky.Ct.App.1987); <em>Carrington v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>169 Wis.2d 211, 485 N.W.2d 267, 270 (1992), or for the officers, shareholders, and employees, <em>see, e.g., Hager v. American West Ins. Co., </em>732 F.Supp. 1072, 1075 (D.Mont.1989); <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380, 1384 (1988). We need not express any opinion on this split of authority because the policy before us was issued to a sole proprietor. Consequently, the decisions relied upon by Northern are not on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Illustrative of the cases relied upon by Northern is <em>Economy Preferred Ins. Co. v. Jersey County Constr., Inc., </em>246 Ill.App.3d 387, 186 Ill.Dec. 233, 615 N.E.2d 1290 (1993). There the language in a \u201cPreferred Business Auto Policy\u201d issued to \u201c \u2018Jersey County Construction, Inc.\u2019 \u201d in terms extended uninsured motorist benefits to \u201c \u2018family members.\u2019 \u201d 186 Ill.Dec. 233, 615 N.E.2d at 1292. On the following rationale the court held that the policy did not insure the family of the corporate president.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>\u201c[W]e reach the conclusion that the insurance policy was not ambiguous. In doing so, after considering this case and the others cited herein, we cannot help but question why the form policies have not included a warning that the \u2018family member\u2019 reference does not apply when the insured is a corporation or similar-type nonfamily entity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-4\">\u201cThe policy provides UM coverage benefits for those authorized drivers of the insured vehicles. Thus, if \u2018family members\u2019 were driving the vehicles, they would be covered. However, it still appears that \u2018family members\u2019 is a nullity when the insured is a corporation. Regardless, the policy lists the corporation as the insured of the \u2018Preferred Business Auto Policy.\u2019 To say the policy insured Nelson Miller, and thereby includes his family, would result in a rewriting of the policy. The named insured is not ambiguous; corporations cannot have family members. We hold that the policy is not ambiguous and that the trial court\u2019s decision was in error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-5\"><em>Id., </em>186 Ill.Dec. 233, 615 N.E.2d at 1293-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">In the case before us the Endorsement reasonably may be read as intended for use where the named insured is either a corporation or a sole proprietorship. The concern expressed by the Illinois court is addressed in the Endorsement by the introductory conditional clause in Part B, \u00b6 2, \u201cIf you are an individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\"><em>Huebner v. MSI Ins. Co., </em>506 N.W.2d 438 (Iowa 1993), also cited by Northern, gives support to Petitioners\u2019 argument. That decision held that a child was not entitled to underin-sured motorist coverage under a business auto policy issued to his father\u2019s corporate employer. <em>Id. </em>at 439. The decision, however, provided the following limitation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-8\">\u201cWe are not persuaded that the result should be otherwise by the reasons expressed in the <em>Decker [v. CNA Ins. Co., </em>66 Ohio App.3d 576, 585 N.E.2d 884 (1990) ] or <em>Carrington v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>169 Wis.2d 211, 485 N.W.2d 267 (1992) ] decisions. Those cases found, improperly we believe, that a latent ambiguity is generated from using \u2018family member\u2019 language in policies issued to corpo-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>rations. We believe that the only thing that this marketing practice suggests is that MSI\u2019s business auto policies were also written so as to be marketable to either individual proprietorships or to corporations. Assuming that individual proprietorships received certain coverages that corporations did not, that is so only because the contract specifies that it is so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 441. In other words, in the view of the Iowa court, the inapplicability of the coverage provision in policies issued to corporate insureds would not make the coverage inapplicable in policies issued to sole proprietor insureds.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">For these reasons we hold that the named insured (\u201cYou\u201d) was Bushey, an individual, and that the trade name was nothing more than the name under which he chose to do business as an individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Northern has raised an issue that was not decided by the courts below. That issue is whether Miranda was a \u201cfamily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>member.\u201d The definition of that term in Part F, \u00b6 1 of the Endorsement requires a family member to be \u201ca resident of your household.\u201d It appears that Susan and Miranda stayed at the home of their grandparents on school days during the school year. Northern has preserved its opportunity to contend that, under the Maryland law of residency, Miranda was not a resident of Bushey\u2019s household. Accordingly, our mandate will remand for a determination of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">In \u00a7 A.1 of the Endorsement, the insuring provision, Northern promises to pay \u201call sums the \u2018insured\u2019 is legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or driver of an \u2018uninsured motor vehicle.\u2019 \u201d In its answer to the declaratory judgment action Northern raised the issue of parent-child immunity. In effect, Northern asserted that the definition of an \u201cinsured\u201d in Part B, \u00b6 4 of the Endorsement (\u201cAnyone for damages he or she is entitled to recover because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 sustained by another \u2018insured\u2019 \u201d) did not apply to the Parents\u2019 wrongful death claim against Susan because of immunity. In response the Parents asked this Court to abrogate parent-child immunity where the claim is covered by automobile liability insurance and particularly where the defendant is deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Since adopting, as a matter of Maryland common law, the doctrine of parent-child immunity in <em>Schneider v. Schneider, </em>160 Md. 18, 152 A. 498 (1930), and applying it in <em>Yost v. Yost, </em>172 Md. 128, 190 A. 753 (1937), this Court consistently has refused wholly to abrogate the doctrine. <em>See Eagan v. Calhoun, </em>347 Md. 72, 81, 698 A.2d 1097, 1102 (1997); <em>Renko v. McLean, </em>346 Md. 464, 480-81, 697 A.2d 468, 476 (1997); <em>Warren v. Warren, </em>336 Md. 618, 626, 650 A.2d 252, 256-57 (1994); <em>Smith v. Gross, </em>319 Md. 138, 145, 571 A.2d 1219, 1222 (1990); <em>Frye v. Frye, </em>305 Md. 542, 543, 505 A.2d 826, 827 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">The doctrine is limited to claims where the child in the relationship was unemancipated at the time of the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>wrongful conduct. <em>Waltzinger v. Birsner, </em>212 Md. 107, 125-26, 128 A.2d 617, 626-27 (1957). To date, we have recognized three other limitations on the doctrine. It does not apply to the claim of a child against a parent who killed the other parent under circumstances constituting voluntary manslaughter or murder. <em>Eagan, </em>347 Md. at 84-85, 698 A.2d at 1103-04. <em>Eagan </em>is an extension of the exception to the doctrine applied in <em>Mahnke v. Moore, </em>197 Md. 61, 77 A.2d 923 (1951), where a child \u201csuffered cruel or unusually malicious conduct at the hands of a parent.\u201d <em>Renko, </em>346 Md. at 468 n. 4, 697 A.2d at 470 n. 4. Nor does the doctrine confer immunity on the business partner of the parent of an injured child. <em>Hatzinicolas v. Protopapas, </em>314 Md. 340, 357-59, 550 A.2d 947, 956 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">In addition to its application of the doctrine in the instant matter, the Court of Special Appeals has brought the parent-child immunity defense to bear in <em>Shell Oil Co. v. Ryckman, </em>43 Md.App. 1, 3, 403 A.2d 379, 380-81 (1979), <em>Montz v. Mendaloff, </em>40 Md.App. 220, 221, 388 A.2d 568, 569 (1978), <em>Sanford v. Sanford, </em>15 Md.App. 390, 395, 290 A.2d 812, 816 (1972), and <em>Latz v. Latz, </em>10 Md.App. 720, 730, 272 A.2d 435, 440-41, <em>cert. denied, </em>261 Md. 726 (1971). Federal courts, on issues governed by Maryland law, have held the defense to be dispositive. <em>See Sherby v. Weather Bros. Transfer Co., </em>421 F.2d 1243, 1246 (4th Cir.1970); <em>Villaret v. Villaret, </em>169 F.2d 677, 678 (D.C.Cir.1948); <em>Zaccari v. United States, </em>130 F.Supp. 50, 53 (D.Md.1955). In the case before us we decline, once again, to accept the invitation totally to abrogate this well established doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">A more substantial issue is presented by the Parents\u2019 argument based upon the relatively instantaneous death of Susan in the same accident which caused the death of Miranda five days later. Although this Court has given a number of reasons as a basis for parent-child immunity, \u201c[o]ur primary concern with regard to matters involving the parent-child relationship [is] the protection of family integrity and harmony and the protection of parental discretion in the discipline and care of the child.\u201d <em>Frye, </em>305 Md. at 551, 505 A.2d at 831. Parents submit that the public policy which the immunity is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>intended to support is non-existent under the circumstances of the instant matter where there is no family relationship to preserve because the alleged tortfeasor is dead. This argument, that death had terminated the parent-child relationship, was made in <em>Smith, </em>319 Md. 138, 571 A.2d 1219, but we were not required directly to address the argument under the facts in that case. <em>Mahnke, </em>197 Md. 61, 77 A.2d 923, and <em>Eagan, </em>347 Md. 72, 698 A.2d 1097, are the only other Maryland decisions involving parent-child immunity in which one of the members of the relevant family relationship was killedin the occurrence giving rise to the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\"><em>Smith </em>involved the death of a child whose parents were unmarried. The child, who lived with his mother, was killed in an accident while riding as a passenger in a car allegedly negligently operated by the father. This Court, over a dissent, affirmed a dismissal of the action based on parent-child immunity as it related to certain requirements of the wrongful death statute, currently codified as Maryland Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 3-902(a) and 3-901(e) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (CJ). CJ \u00a7 3-902(a) creates the cause of action by providing that \u201c[a]n action may be maintained against a person whose wrongful act causes the death of another.\u201d \u201cWrongful act\u201d is defined in CJ \u00a7 3-901(e) to mean \u201can act, neglect, or default including a felonious act which would have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages if death had not ensued.\u201d We pointed out in <em>Smith, </em>by citing decisions of this Court rendered as early as 1880, that the \u201cparty injured\u201d is the decedent. <em>Smith, </em>319 Md. at 143 n. 4, 571 A.2d at 1221 n. 4. We further cited decisions rendered from 1877 to 1969 holding that the defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of the risk on the part of the decedent bar the survivor\u2019s wrongful death act claim. <em>Id. </em>at 144-45, 571 A.2d at 1222. Consequently, in addressing the parent-child immunity defense, we looked to the relationship between the decedent and the tortfeasor to determine whether the decedent could \u201cmaintain an action and recover damages if death had not ensued.\u201d CJ \u00a7 3-901(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>The plaintiff-mother in <em>Smith, </em>looking at the parent-child relationship as if death had not ensued, argued that there was no relationship to protect because the child never lived with his father. We said, however, that \u201c[rjights and obligations, privileges and duties \u2014 the elements of parenthood \u2014 existed between the father and child despite that the child \u2018lived with his mother from the time of his birth until his death and never lived with his father.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147, 571 A.2d at 1228. Consequently, the father was immune from the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><em>Smith </em>never directly addressed the effect on the immunity doctrine of the termination of the relationship of parent and child by the child\u2019s death in the accident because the decision turned on the requirement of the wrongful death statute that the viability of the claim of the injured party be tested as if death had not ensued. This made the relevant period of the relationship between father and son the period before the accidental death and not after it. In the instant matter the injured person is Miranda and the alleged tortfeasor is Susan. If death had not ensued Miranda could sue Susan. There is no inter-sibling immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\"><em>Mahnke, </em>197 Md. 61, 77 A.2d 923, was not a wrongful death case, although the facts were that the plaintiffs mother had been murdered by her father who, one week later, committed suicide. Both killings took place in the immediate presence of the plaintiff. It is sufficient for present purposes to note that this Court characterized the father\u2019s acts as \u201catrocious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 63, 77 A.2d at 923. The theory of the plaintiff\u2019s case was that \u201cas a result of her father\u2019s acts and the conditions thereby created to which she was subjected, she has suffered shock, mental anguish and permanent nervous and physical injuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held that parent-child immunity did not apply under the facts presented in <em>Mahnke. </em>We reasoned that \u201cthere can be no basis for the contention that the daughter\u2019s suit against her father\u2019s estate would be contrary to public policy, for the simple reason that there is no home at all in which discipline and tranquility are to be preserved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68, 77 A.2d at 926. The facts of the case showed a \u201ccomplete abandonment of the parental relation\u201d and that \u201cthe rule giving him immunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>from suit by the child, on the ground that discipline should be maintained in the home, cannot logically be applied, for when he is guilty of such acts he forfeits his parental authority and privileges, including his immunity from suit.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\"><em>Mahnke </em>formed the foundation for our recent decision in <em>Eagan, </em>347 Md. 72, 698 A.2d 1097. <em>Eagan </em>involved a wrongful death action. The plaintiffs were the children of a mother who had been killed by her husband, the father of the children. The children argued that because their mother could have sued their father in negligence, free of any spousal immunity defense, their claim was not subject to parent-child immunity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We said that the children\u2019s claim \u201cis not derivative in the sense asserted,\u201d inasmuch as the children sought \u201cto recover damages for [their] own loss accruing from the decedent\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82, 698 A.2d at 1102. Thus, the effect of <em>Eagan </em>when coupled with <em>Gross </em>is that, in addition to the need of the plaintiff to satisfy the condition of the wrongful death statute, <em>i.e., </em>that the claim be one which the injured person could have brought had death not ensued, this Court will also look to the relationship between the beneficial plaintiff and the tortfeasor in a wrongful death action to determine whether there is parent-child immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Under the circumstances in <em>Eagan, </em>where the killing amounted at least to the crime of voluntary manslaughter, we held as a matter of law that there was no immunity on the following rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-6\">\u201cWhen the death is occasioned by murder or voluntary manslaughter, however, any remaining relationships are far more likely to be sufficiently shattered to be beyond further impairment by a lawsuit. The blow is not just the death itself, or even the hard fact that it was caused by the other parent, but rather that the killing was intentional and not the product of mere carelessness. Added to the psychological trauma of that are the likely collateral consequences of such criminal behavior. The evidence in this case demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>strates the point. When this suit was filed, there was no longer a family unit; Gladys was dead, John was in prison, and Laura and Kevin were in the legal and physical custody of another couple. John had no ability to exercise any parental discretion or control; because he was in prison, guardians had been appointed of the persons and the property of the children. The personal relationships between John and the children had soured to the point that there was little contact between them; John wrote to them from prison, but they did not respond. Certainly, there was no indication of any fraud or collusion between John and his children, and there was no evidence that resources that otherwise would have been devoted to the family unit would be depleted by the lawsuit. Indeed, John testified that his resources had been depleted in defending the criminal charge. In short, the underpinnings of the immunity doctrine no longer existed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 83-84, 698 A.2d at 1103.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The facts of the case before us present an even greater lack of underpinnings for the application of the parent-child immunity doctrine than did the facts in <em>Eagan. </em>The prerequisite of the wrongful death statute is satisfied here because the injured person, Miranda, could sue her sister. Further, neither family harmony nor parental discipline can be affected in any way by the litigation because both children are dead. The wrongful death claim arose in the Parents as beneficial plaintiffs the moment the parent-child relationship with Susan, the alleged tortfeasor, terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">In holding that parent-child immunity barred the claim of the Parents, the Court of Special Appeals relied heavily on a passage from this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Eagan, </em>saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-8\">\u201cThe <em>Eagan </em>court specifically declined to allow for an immunity exception to acts of negligence, such as automobile accidents, because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-9\">\u201c \u2018[Although such tragedies may well put a serious strain on some of the family relationships, they do not generally destroy a parent-child relationship. A parent who negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>gently causes the death of his or her spouse or of a child can still maintain a parent-child relationship; <em>the family, even in its grief, can survive. </em>\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\">\u201c347 Md. 72, 83, 698 A.2d 1097[, 1103] (1997) (emphasis added). We feel constrained to follow that reasoning....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Amh\"><em>Bushey, </em>130 Md.App. at 181, 745 A.2d at 450. <em>Eagan </em>was a case in which the children and their father were living. It was their mother who had been intentionally killed. In that case the children were suing the father who would have had an immunity defense had his conduct been negligent, and not intentional. Here, the Parents are not suing a living child, and the above-quoted rationale from <em>Eagan </em>is inapplicable..</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Another justification advanced as a basis for parent-child immunity is \u201cthe prevention of fraud and collusion.\u201d <em>Warren, </em>336 Md. at 625, 650 A.2d at 255. That risk is completely absent in the instant matter. From the liability standpoint the Petitioners have no family members who can testify as to the happening of the accident. Proof of Susan\u2019s liability, if any, will depend upon physical facts and independent witnesses. From the standpoint of damages, the risk, if any, of fraud and collusion that is faced by Northern would not seem to be any greater in this case than in any case in which an insured sues an insurer on first-party coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The third policy justification accepted as a basis for parent-child immunity is \u201cthe threat that litigation will deplete family resources.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 625, 650 A.2d at 255. Where, as here, there is third-party and first-party insurance coverage the reference is to \u201cthe consequences of an award that exceeds available coverage.\u201d <em>Renko, </em>346 Md. at 479, 697 A.2d at 476 (footnote omitted). This risk would seem almost certainly to be nonexistent in the instant matter. The overwhelming probability is that Susan, a seventeen year old high school student, died intestate. Thus any estate assets that would be applied to the claim of the Parents, as creditors, would be assets that would otherwise be paid by the estate to the Parents, as distributees, under Md.Code (1974, 1991 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-104(b) of the Estates and Trusts Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>For these reasons, we hold that parent-child immunity does not bar the Parents\u2019 claim against the Estate of Susan under the facts of this particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The final matter requiring our attention is a procedural error.

Instead of attempting to distinguish <em>Smith v. Gross, </em>the case should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">As discussed by Judge Wilner for the Court in <em>Eagan v.

The doctrine was invented by the Supreme Court of Mississippi in 1891, <em>Hewlett v. George, </em>68 Miss. 703, 9 So. 885 (1891), and was initially adopted by this Court in 1930, <em>Schneider v.

Calhoun, supra, </em>347 Md. at 75, 698 A.2d at 1099. <em>See, e.g., Renko v.

The only case in this Court representing an exception to this principle is <em>Smith v. Gross, supra, </em>319 Md. 138, 571 A.2d 1219. <em>Smith v. Gross </em>is wholly out-of-step with our other cases dealing with parent-child immunity from tort suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\"><em>Smith v. Gross, </em>like <em>Eagan v. Calhoun, supra, </em>347 Md. 72, 698 A.2d 1097, and the present case, was a wrongful death action. Also, as in the case at bar, there was a count under the survival statute. Moreover, the actions in both this case and the <em>Smith </em>case were based on the death of a minor child in an automobile accident, allegedly caused by the negligent driving of another family member. In <em>Smith, </em>the parents were not married, did not live together as a family unit, and the child lived with his mother. The child had never lived with his father. A few days after the child\u2019s second birthday, the father was driving an automobile with the child as a passenger, and the child died in an accident allegedly caused by the father\u2019s negligent driving. The child\u2019s mother, who was the personal representative of the child\u2019s estate, brought wrongful death and survival actions against the father. The trial court granted a motion to dismiss based on parent-child immunity, and this Court, in a 5-2 decision, affirmed on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The plaintiff-appellant\u2019s principal argument in <em>Smith </em>was that \u201cthe parent-child immunity doctrine is inapplicable to the case at bar because there is no parent-child relationship to protect.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff-appellant contended: \u201cThe key to the immunity doctrine is the protection of the parent-child relationship. Upon the death of the infant, this relationship is extinguished. There simply is no relationship to protect and no policy reason to invoke the doctrine.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Reliance was placed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number><em>Waltzinger v. Birsner, supra, </em>212 Md. 107, 128 A.2d 617, and <em>Mahnke v. Moore, supra, </em>197 Md. 61, 77 A.2d 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">This Court rejected the plaintiff-appellant\u2019s policy argument in <em>Smith </em>because, according to the Court, there was a parent-child relationship prior to the tortious conduct and the death. <em>Smith, </em>319 Md. at 148, 571 A.2d at 1223. The Court pointed out that, under the wrongful death statute, \u201cwrongful act\u201d is defined as \u201can act, neglect, or default ... which would have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages if death had not ensued.\u201d Maryland Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-901(e) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. The Court also pointed out that the survival statute refers to \u201ca personal action which the decedent might have commenced or prosecuted.... \u201d Code (1974, 1991 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.), \u00a7 7-401(y) of the Estates and Trusts Article. Relying on these statutory provisions, the <em>Smith </em>majority leaped to the conclusion that a \u201cprerequisite\u201d for bringing a wrongful death or survival action was the ability of the decedent to have brought an action if there had been no death. 319 Md. at 149, 571 A.2d at 1224. Since, in the view of the <em>Smith </em>majority, parent-child immunity would have precluded a tort action by the child against the father if there had been no death, the same judicially created immunity precluded wrongful death and survival actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The majority today reiterates the holding and \u201creasoning\u201d of <em>Smith. </em>The majority states that there is a <em>\u201crequirement </em>of the wrongful death statute that the viability of the claim of the injured party be tested as if death had not ensued.\u201d (Opinion 'at 647, emphasis added). Referring to <em>Smith, </em>the majority continues <em>(ibid.): </em>\u201cThis made the relevant period of the relationship between father and son the period before the accidental death and not after it.\u201d The majority then attempts to distinguish the present case from <em>Smith </em>on the ground that, \u201c[i]f death had not ensued[,] Miranda could sue Susan. There is no inter-sibling immunity.\u201d <em>(Ibid.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Preliminarily, there are problems with the majority\u2019s distinction of <em>Smith </em>and the majority\u2019s view that the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>period of the parent-child relationship is the period before death. Miranda was a minor and could not have, herself, brought a tort action against Susan. If the sisters had not died, the action against Susan, on behalf of Miranda, would have been brought by Miranda\u2019s parents who also are Susan\u2019s parents. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 2-202(b). Language in this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Schneider v. Schneider, supra, </em>160 Md. at 22-23, 152 A. at 499-500, the case adopting the doctrine of parent-child immunity, suggests that the parents, on behalf of Miranda, could not have sued their other minor child, Susan.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Furthermore, if the relevant period of the parent-child relationship is the period before the tortious death, then, arguably, both <em>Eagan v. Calhoun, supra, </em>347 Md. 72, 698 A.2d 1097, and <em>Mahnke v. Moore, supra, </em>197 Md. 61, 77 A.2d 923, are inconsistent with the instant opinion and with <em>Smith v. Gross. </em>In addition, this Court emphasized in <em>Eagan, </em>347 Md. at 82, 698 A.2d at 1102, that a wrongful death action \u201cis not derivative in the sense\u201d that the defenses, or non-defenses, in a wrongful death action are the same as those in a tort action if the decedent had lived. The Court in <em>Eagan </em>continued <em>(ibid.):</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">\u201cIt follows from the fact that the action is a personal one to the claimant that the claimant is ordinarily subject to any defense that is applicable to him or her, whether or not it would have been applicable to the decedent. Thus, the fact that [the deceased mother] would not have been barred by any doctrine of parent-child immunity from suing [the tort-feasor father] does not relieve [the children] of that impediment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The converse should also apply. The fact that a plaintiff in a tort suit may have been barred by parent-child immunity from suing the defendant does not mean that different plaintiffs in a wrongful death action, where there is no parent-child relationship, should be barred from suing.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">More importantly, however, the reasoning of the majority in <em>Smith v. Gross </em>and the majority today is fundamentally flawed. The critical language from the wrongful death act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>relied upon by the majority, <em>ie. </em>the reference to an act which would have been the basis for a suit if there had been no death, is not a \u201cprerequisite\u201d or a \u201crequirement\u201d for bringing a wrongful death action. The language is simply part of the definition of \u201cwrongful act,\u201d and is a shorthand way of describing the tortious conduct that will permit suit. At common law, there was no cognizable tort if death occurred. The references to an act which would have permitted a tort suit if there had not been death was employed in the wrongful death and survival statutes in lieu of listing basic elements of various torts and basic, established defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The language in the wrongful death and survival statutes, referring to an action if death had not ensued, was in the original wrongful death act enacted by the General Assembly in 1852 and was in the original survival statute enacted by the General Assembly in 1798. <em>See </em>Ch. 299, \u00a7 1, of the Acts of 1852; Ch. 101, Subch. 8, \u00a7 5, of the Acts of 1798. There was no such thing as a parent-child immunity doctrine in 1798 or 1852. As previously discussed, this Court adopted the doctrine in 1930; the General Assembly has never embraced the doctrine. Obviously, when the General Assembly enacted the survival and wrongful death statutes in 1798 and 1852, it did not contemplate parent-child immunity which was judicially created in 1930. The General Assembly very likely envisioned basic tort defenses then existing such as contributory negligence or assumption of the risk. The Legislature also may have contemplated basic general defenses to various torts which might in the future be adopted pursuant to the authority to change the common law. It is quite doubtful, however, that the Legislature intended that a judicially created defense, designed for certain circumstances because of public policy, would be applied to the entirely different circumstances addressed by the wrongful death and survival statutes, where the public policy would not be served.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The parent-child immunity doctrine was created solely for the situation involving a tort action between a live parent and a live minor child. A tort suit, otherwise authorized by the law, might disrupt the parent-child relationship in this situation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>When there is no action between a live parent and a live child, and no parent-minor child relationship to be disrupted by the suit, the immunity doctrine is obviously inapplicable. It was not created by this Court to be applied under such circumstances, as shown by the decisions in <em>Waltzinger v. Birsner, supra, </em>212 Md. 107, 128 A.2d 617, and <em>Mahnke v. Moore, supra, </em>197 Md. 61, 77 A.2d 923. The <em>Smith v. Gross </em>opinion, however, misused statutory language, enacted long before the adoption of the parent-child immunity doctrine, to apply that doctrine to a situation where there was no parent-child relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">To reiterate, the parent-child immunity doctrine has no statutory basis; it was judicially created solely for the situation where there is an ongoing parent-minor child relationship which an intervivos tort action might disrupt. Where there exists no ongoing parent-minor child relationship to be disrupted, there is utterly no reason to apply the doctrine. <em>Smith v.
