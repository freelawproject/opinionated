(Temple or Respondent), a religious corporation of the State of Illinois. Following a trial held on 17 December 1998, the injunction was made permanent by an order dated 6 January 1999. Petitioner appealed to the Court of Special Appeals asserting that the Circuit Court did not have the authority to resolve a religious dispute, that damages sufficient to merit an injunction were not shown, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>and that the Court failed to apply the appropriate definition of the term \u201ctrustee.\u201d The intermediate appellate court, in a reported opinion, affirmed the Circuit Court, holding that the dispute was resolved properly by the application of neutral, secular principles, that Respondent had suffered and would continue to suffer irreparable harm from Petitioner\u2019s misrepresentations unless such conduct were enjoined, and that the term \u201ctrustee\u201d was not a term of legal significance within the contemplation of the Temple\u2019s corporate documents or structure. <em>El Bey v. Moorish Science Temple of America, Inc., </em>130 Md.App. 543, 561, 747 A.2d 241, 251 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">We granted Petitioner\u2019s Petition for Writ of Certiorari,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which posed the following three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">2. Whether the Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that a religious organization has a judicially-protectible property interest in its name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">1. Whether the Circuit Court and Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that the Courts have subject matter jurisdiction to determine the governance of a religious organization by the application of secular corporate principles notwithstanding the fact that the parties have agreed that the religious dispute cannot be resolved by the application of secular corporate principles; but instead, by the internal religious documents of the religious organization?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">3. Whether the Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that a person can be enjoined from referring to one\u2019s self as the leader of a religious organization and his stated intention to continue to do so in the future, notwithstanding the fact that the undisputed facts show that the religious organization has not been harmed in any respect whatsoever as a result thereof?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>We conclude that a fundamental flaw in the underpinnings of the Circuit Court\u2019s issuance of the injunction is the absence in the record of evidence of irreparable harm or damage meriting the relief granted. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Special Appeals and remand the case to it with directions to vacate the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">A. <em>Background and Organization of the Moorish Science Temple of America, Inc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Noble Drew Ali founded the Moorish Holy Temple of Science in 1913 in Newark, New Jersey, as a vehicle to advance the tenets of the Islamic faith, as he viewed them to be, in the United States. He subsequently incorporated the Temple in 1926 under Illinois law as a civic corporation. In 1928, Noble Drew Ali changed the name of the corporation to the Moorish Science Temple of America, Inc., \u00e1nd changed the purpose of the organization from civic to religious. Diming his leadership of the Temple, Noble Drew Ali served as the Moderator (the head of the Temple) and also was referred to as the Prophet, a title of religious, but not legal, significance within the corporation. According to the Temple\u2019s articles of incorporation, as well as its constitution and bylaws adopted in 1928, the elected officers who served under the Moderator included the Branch Sheik, the Grand Sheik, and other chairpersons. The Temple\u2019s outposts grew rapidly under Noble Drew Ali\u2019s leadership, with temples established in many states.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Noble Drew Ali died in 1929. During the Temple\u2019s seventh annual national convention in September 1934, it adopted rules and regulations regarding the governance and succession of officers of the Temple. Under these rules, the Moderator position became an elected one known as the Supreme Grand Advisor and Moderator,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which continues to be the title used by successive national corporate leaders, including the current <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>one, Robert Love El (Love El), a resident of Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. Other elected officers are now known as Grand Governors or Governesses, Grand National and Assistant Grand National Secretary, Grand National and Assistant Grand National Treasurer, and Secretary and Treasurer of the related Moorish Manufacturing Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">B. <em>The Dispute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">On 10 September 1996, Petitioner provided to \u201call Governors, Grand Sheiks and Head Official [sic] of All Temples of America\u201d affiliated with Respondent a memorandum announcing that he was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">appointed] as Trustee of the Express Trust created by the Prophet Noble Drew Ali; through fulfillment of that appointment, I have been vested with all authority and power of The Moorish Science Temple of America.... Accordingly, my office as Chief Executive Officer of the [Temple] is effective immediately.... I will appoint by January 8, 1997, an Executive Council (Rulers) of which I will act as Chairman.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Petitioner also stated that \u201ca similar Memorandum will be prepared and circulated among all\u201d members of the Temple. He concluded his announcement by advising the Temple leadership to seek out the aid of an attorney regarding Petitioner\u2019s legal rights as the Temple\u2019s trustee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>On 22 January 1997, Respondent<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> petitioned the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County to issue <em>ex parte, </em>interlocutory, and permanent injunctive relief against Petitioner to prohibit him from referring to himself as an officer, director, agent or trustee of the Temple. Respondent, in its complaint, alleged that Petitioner fraudulently was collecting money in the Temple\u2019s name, disseminating false and misleading information about his status as a trustee of the corporation, and attempting to recruit Temple members; this conduct, it argued, would embarrass and tarnish Respondent\u2019s reputation and good name.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">On 24 January 1997, the Circuit Court ordered Petitioner, a resident of the District of Columbia, to show cause at a hearing to be held on 7 March 1997 why a temporary restraining order should not issue as requested. Petitioner did not attend the hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court ordered on 26 March 1997 that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Respondent be granted the interlocutory injunction restraining Petitioner from referring to himself as an officer, director, agent or trustee of the Temple. In response to this order, Petitioner, after it was served upon him, filed a motion on 25 April 1997 to dissolve the interlocutory injunction and requested a hearing. On 27 June 1997, he filed a counterclaim in which he sought to \u201ctake possession of all [Temple] trust property and assets.\u201d In an amended counterclaim filed on 4 August 1997, Petitioner also asked the court to grant an injunction restraining the Temple from relying on the 1934 bylaws and Love El from representing himself as the President of the Temple.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The parties tried the matter before the Circuit Court on 17 December 1998. In support of its request for permanent injunctive relief, Respondent stressed several points advanced previously in support of the temporary injunction. First, it argued that Petitioner had no authority over or within the organization in which he was neither a member nor an elected officer. Specifically, Love El testified that only the Supreme Grand Advisor and Moderator is authorized under its charter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>and bylaws to appoint a sheik, and that neither he nor any prior Supreme Grand Advisor had appointed Petitioner to that or any position within the Temple. Second, Love El testified the Temple does not recognize or utilize the title of trustee, observing that Noble Drew Ali \u201cappointed officials.... Instead of calling them \u2018trustees,\u2019 he called them sheiks and sheikess [sic].\u201d Third, Respondent concluded that Petitioner\u2019s conduct would hurt both the Temple\u2019s reputation and its purse strings. The Temple, through Love El and counsel, acknowledged, however, that its officers had not witnessed Petitioner soliciting members and that it was unable to provide any evidence that Petitioner had collected any monies under the guise of being a trustee of the Temple.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Defending his claim of control over the Temple, Petitioner countered that Noble Drew Ali created in him an express trust for the Temple and its holdings, and that this trust dated back to the 1928 incorporation of the Temple.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Petitioner explained that he became aware of his appointment in 1978, when a Moor gave him a deed of conveyance to the Temple, and that he accepted this appointment in 1981.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To support this contention, Petitioner asked the court to read into the record several documents that he claimed evidenced this express trust, including portions of the Temple\u2019s Holy Koran, which he claimed traced the title of various lands, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>the entire United States, from ancient peoples to the Moorish Americans of today. The \u201ctitle\u201d traced in the Koran, he argued, is the legal instrument which made him the rightful trustee of the Temple. Petitioner then argued that Love El\u2019s presidency and the offices held by other Temple members are invalid because they were elected by the Grand Body, but not appointed by the Prophet.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">In response to the Temple\u2019s claims that he was conducting himself in a fraudulent manner, Petitioner responded that he could not have committed fraud or usurped Love El\u2019s presidency since Love El was not the authorized leader of the Temple, i.e., not appointed by the Prophet or Petitioner. He also argued that he had not fraudulently recruited members or collected a \u201csubstantial\u201d sum of money. Rather, Petitioner claimed that, as the appointed trustee of the Temple, he had the right to \u201ctake possession of all trust property and assets into his immediate physical custody and possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">C. <em>Judgments of Circuit Court and Court of Special Appeals</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">After considering the evidence, such as it was, and the parties\u2019 arguments and counter-arguments, the Circuit Court granted the Temple equitable relief and ordered a permanent injunction against Petitioner on 6 January 1998.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although Petitioner had insisted repeatedly that he had been named the trustee of the Temple, the court found no evidence of any document providing for an express trust:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">First of all, the Court would like to define \u201cexpress trust,\u201d because there seems to be a misunderstanding as to exactly what an express trust is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">Since we are talking initially of a trustee, which [Respondent] says that it is a term that is foreign to the Moorish Science Temple of America, a trustee would have to be duly appointed or designated, and that the term includes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>person with whom or in whose name a contract is made for the benefit of another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">... but the bottom line is there is absolutely no indication that the founder of this movement ever intended a trust of anything.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The judge determined that not only was the word \u201ctrustee\u201d not used in any of the Temple\u2019s corporate documents received in evidence, but that \u201cwhoever drew [the Temple\u2019s articles of incorporation] up expressly eliminated [crossed-out] the word \u2018trustee\u2019 [in the form document] and replaced it [in handwriting] with [the word] \u2018sheik.\u2019 \u201d Having found no evidence of an express trust to support Petitioner\u2019s claims to a secular leadership position or the property of the Temple, the court ordered the permanent injunction restraining Petitioner from referring to himself as an officer, director, agent, or trustee of the Temple.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Petitioner filed a direct appeal with the Court of Special Appeals on 22 December 1998. He ultimately asserted three grounds for reversal: (1) the Circuit Court lacked the authority to resolve the religious dispute presented by the case, in light of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution; (2) the requisite likelihood of irreparable damage to Respondent to justify an injunction was not demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>strated; and (3) the court, in ordering the injunction, failed to apply properly the term \u201ctrustee,\u201d at least in the sense that term was understood by Petitioner. On 3 March 2000, the intermediate appellate court affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment, holding that the Circuit Court properly resolved the dispute by neutral, secular principles, that \u201ctrustee\u201d was not a term used by the Temple, and that the Temple had suffered and would continue to suffer irreparable harm from Petitioner\u2019s misrepresentations. <em>El Bey v. Moorish Science Temple of America, Inc., </em>130 Md.App. 543, 561, 747 A.2d 241, 251 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">We granted certiorari on 23 June 2000. <em>Bey v. Moorish Temple, </em>359 Md. 333, 753 A.2d 1031 (2000). Because we shall decide this case based on a point embedded in Petitioner\u2019s third question, we shall not answer his other queries.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">\n<em>The Circuit Court possessed the authority to consider injunctive relief in a legal dispute involving a religious organization.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Before we consider whether the lower courts properly concluded that Respondent satisfied the requirements for the issuance of permanent injunctive relief in this case, it is necessary first to address Petitioner\u2019s concern that the trial court did not possess subject matter jurisdiction to hear this case. The parties agree that \u201cMaryland courts, like courts generally in this country, have no authority to resolve religious disputes.\u201d <em>Mt. Olive African Methodist Episcopal Church of Fruitland, Inc. v. Board of Incorporators, </em>348 Md. 299, 309, 703 A.2d 194, 199 (1997) (citing <em>Polen v. Cox, </em>259 Md. 25, 31-32, 267 A.2d 201, 204-05 (1970)). Maryland courts have a legitimate interest, however, in resolving secular disputes, including those involving property interests or those requiring an interpretation of corporate charters or bylaws, through the application of neutral principles of law. <em>See, e.g., Mt. Olive, </em>348 Md. at 310, 703 A.2d at 199; <em>American Union of Baptists, Inc. v. Trustees of the Particular Primitive Baptist Church, </em>335 Md. 564, 644 A.2d 1063 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>The pith of Petitioner\u2019s argument in this regard is that it was improper for the trial court to settle this ecclesiastical dispute because it does not concern real or personal church property, but rather the rightful leadership of the Temple. In numerous pleadings and papers filed in the Circuit Court, however, Petitioner repeatedly asserted that all \u201ctrust\u201d property, assets, and records should be placed in his immediate physical possession.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To this, we remind Petitioner that \u201c \u2018[wjhen rights of property are involved ... the courts, of necessity, must proceed to consider and adjudicate those rights not only to solve the particular case and the rights of the litigants before them, but also to preserve definiteness and order in the holding of property by religious corporations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mt. Olive, </em>348 Md. at 310, 703 A.2d at 199. We therefore conclude it incongruous for Petitioner to argue that the dispute does not concern real or personal Temple property when he put the ownership or right to possession of such property in issue.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Petitioner also asserts that the Court of Special Appeals erred in resting its resolution of his subject matter jurisdictional challenge on the Temple\u2019s alleged proprietary \u201cinterest in protecting its good name as a stable religious organization with an orderly mode of government and succession of leaders.\u201d Because the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over this dispute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>stemmed from other proprietary interests, as we noted <em>supra, </em>we find it unnecessary to reach this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">When reviewing a judgment arising from a bench trial, we must \u201creview the case on both the law and the evidence,\u201d but we must \u201cnot set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous,\u201d for we must \u201cgive due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d Maryland Rule 8-131(c) (2000 Repl.Vol.). Additionally, we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, deciding not whether the trial judge\u2019s conclusions were correct, but whether they were supported by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Colandrea v. Wilde Lake Community Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>361 Md. 371, 394, 761 A.2d 899, 911 (2000) (citing <em>Geo. Bert. Cropper, Inc. v.

Nat\u2019l Bureau, </em>248 Md. 292, 305, 236 A.2d 282, 289 (1967)).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\"> An injunction is \u201c \u2018a writ framed according to the circumstances of the case commanding an act which the court regards as essential to justice, or restraining an act which it esteems contrary to equity and good conscience.\u2019 \u201d <em>Colandrea, </em>361 Md. at 394, 761 A.2d at 911 (quoting <em>Maryland Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Downey Communications, Inc., </em>110 Md.App. 493, 515, 678 A.2d 55, 66 (1996)). Thus, injunctive relief is \u201c \u2018a preventative and protective remedy, <em>aimed at future acts, </em>and is not intended to redress past wrongs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Carroll County Ethics Comm\u2019n v. Lennon, </em>119 Md.App. 49, 58, 703 A.2d 1338, 1342-43 (1998)). Alternatively, the Court of Special Appeals, in <em>Coster v. Dep\u2019t of Personnel, </em>36 Md.App. 523, 373 A.2d 1287 (1977), adopted the following overview of the general law of injunction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">A court of equity reserves its injunctive process for the protection of property or other rights against actual or threatened injuries of a substantial character which cannot</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>be adequately remedied in a court of law. That is to say, the jurisdiction or power to grant injunctive relief should be exercised only when intervention is essential to effectually protect property or other rights, of which equity will take cognizance, against irreparable injuries. The very function of an injunction is to furnish preventative relief against irreparable mischief or injury, and the remedy will not be awarded where it appears to the satisfaction of the court that the injury complained of is not of such character. Suitors may not resort to a court of equity to restrain acts, actual or threatened, merely because they are illegal or transcend constitutional powers, unless it is apparent that irremediable injury will result. The mere assertion that apprehended acts will inflict irreparable injury is not enough. The complaining party must allege and prove facts from which the court can reasonably infer that such would be the result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-5\"><em>Coster, </em>36 Md.App. at 525-26, 373 A.2d at 1289-90 (quoting 42 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Injunctions, </em>\u00a7 48).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">In <em>Colandrea, </em>we most recently explained the differences between an interlocutory injunction and a permanent injunction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">A permanent injunction is, as its names indicates, \u201can injunction final or permanent in its nature granted after a determination of the merits of the action.\u201d Md. Rule BB70d. But a permanent injunction is not \u201cpermanent\u201d in the sense that it must invariably last indefinitely. Rather, it \u201cis one granted by the judgment which finally disposes of the injunction suit.\u201d The difference between an interlocutory injunction and a permanent injunction turns on \u201cwhether there has been a determination on the merits of the claim. If that determination has been made, then the injunction may be final; if not, it is interlocutory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">361 Md. at 395, 761 A.2d at 911 (internal citations omitted).

Moreover, when asked whether Petitioner\u2019s conduct had caused any dissension within the Temple, Love El responded \u201c[n]one .... our organization is a national organization, with over 360 some temples around the country. This man is not even known by most of the people that\u2019s [sic] in our organization.\u201d Rather than demonstrating irreparable harm, such evidence supports the conclusion that Petitioner\u2019s conduct did not predict future irreparable harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">According to Love El\u2019s testimony, Respondent\u2019s greatest concern regarding Petitioner was that his conduct violated its religious code, and that the Temple requested injunctive relief because addressing Petitioner\u2019s conduct was \u201ccosting [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Temple] time and money.\u201d Love-El\u2019s assertions invoked ecclesiastical principles which the lower courts chose properly not to entertain, for \u201cthe courts, wisely we think, will not enter a \u2018theological thicket.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Mt. Olive, </em>348 Md. at 309, 703 A.2d at 199 (quoting <em>Maryland Virginia Eldership of Churches of God v. Church of God at Sharpsburg, </em>249 Md. 650, 660, 241 A.2d 691, 697 (1968)). We conclude, therefore, that there is no evidence in this record to substantiate the Circuit Court\u2019s implicit (and required) finding of irreparable harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Petitioner also asks us to determine whether the Circuit Court improperly considered the Temple\u2019s dogma in determining the merits of Petitioner\u2019s case. Given our conclusion that the Circuit Court erred in granting the permanent injunction against Petitioner because Respondent failed to prove Petitioner\u2019s conduct would cause it irreparable harm, we find it unnecessary to reach this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">To grant a permanent injunction, there must be evidence adduced that the party seeking the injunction will suffer irreparable harm without its issuance. In this case, Respondent failed to present evidence that it would suffer irreparable harm as a result of Petitioner\u2019s conduct. As legally ephemeral as Petitioner\u2019s claims to leadership or trusteeship of the Temple and its assets may be on this record, we can find no evidentiary support to justify the issuance of the injunction. We therefore hold that the Court of Special Appeals erred in affirming the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of permanent injunctive relief restraining Petitioner from referring to himself as an officer, director, agent, or trustee of the Moorish Science Temple of America, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

During the 17 December 1998 trial, discussed <em>infra, </em>the Circuit Court asked Petitioner whether he could document his appointment as the trustee of the Temple. The following testimony ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">THE COURT: And [the trust documents] were presented to you when?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-10\">[PETITIONER]: In 1978.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-11\">THE COURT: By whom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-12\">[PETITIONER]: By Moor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-13\">THE COURT: By who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-14\">[PETITIONER]: A Moor. A Moor named Lars Rossi (phonetic) gave me the actual deed of conveyance that culminated my appointment as the trustee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-15\">THE COURT: You were appointed trustee in 1978?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>[PETITIONER]: No, I received the documents [the Holy Koran, portions of which the Petitioner later had read into evidence], Your Honor, in 1978.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">THE COURT: When were you appointed trustee?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">[PETITIONER]: When the trust was \u2014 when I obtained knowledge of the trust; Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">THE COURT: When were you appointed and who appointed you? [PETITIONER]: In 1978 I received\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-9\">THE COURT: When were you appointed \u2014 well, first of all, who appointed you a trustee and when were you appointed? [PETITIONER]: My appointment, Your Honor \u2014 as I said, my appointment was a legal appointment in 1928 under Illinois law....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-10\">[PETITIONER]: I received my appointment directly from the prophet, Noble Dru Ali [sic], according to the requirements of Illinois in the appointment of a trustee to represent an expressed trust estate. THE COURT: So you received this appointment directly from the prophet\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-11\">[PETITIONER]: Noble Dru Ali [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-12\">THE COURT:- \u2014 who was dead long before you were born? Is that what you are saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-13\">[PETITIONER]: That's what I am saying, Your Honor----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-14\">In later testimony, Petitioner refined his testimony regarding his appointment, acknowledging that \"[n]o, [it\u2019s] not a legal appointment, and so forth, but it is a proper appointment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b388-15\">. Respondent asserted it was registered to do business in Maryland.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b388-16\">. In his 25 April 1997 Motion to Dissolve the interlocutory injunction, Petitioner contended that \"he did not receive a copy of the complaint. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>notice, or anything related to the complaint\u201d until 1 April 1997, when he received the Circuit Court's Order granting the interlocutory injunction. Maryland Rule 2-121 proscribes the manner in which <em>in person-am </em>Service of Process must be made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">(a) <em>Generally. </em>\u2014 Service of process may be made ... (3) by mailing to the person to be served a copy of the summons, complaint, and all other papers filed with it by certified mail.... Service outside of the State may also be made in the manner prescribed by the court or prescribed by the foreign jurisdiction if reasonably calculated to give actual notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Because Petitioner was a domiciliary of Washington, D.C., Md. Rule 2-121 permitted Respondent to serve Petitioner in accordance with the D.C. Ct.App. Rules. <em>See </em>D.C. Ct.App. Rule 25(c) (2000) (\u201cService may be personal or by mail.\u201d); D.C. Ct.App. Rule 25(d) (2000) (\u201cPapers presented for filing shall contain either an acknowledgment of service by the person served or ... proof of service in the form of a certificate of counsel....\").</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">According to the certificate of service attached to Respondent\u2019s Complaint and Motion for Ex Parte, Interlocutory, and Permanent Injunc-tive Relief, Respondent served Petitioner at two addresses via first class mail, postage prepaid. The certificate was not dated. Petitioner does not raise as an issue here improper service of process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b390-5\">. In response to one of the Circuit Court\u2019s requests for documentation of the trust which Petitioner asserted he was given, Petitioner replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">[PETITIONER]: Your Honor, what we're coming up with here is an express trust that was created by Noble Dm Ali [sic] in 1928 according to Illinois law. That\u2019s all I could come up. I'm here as a trustee. I come to present the evidence [the Temple\u2019s Holy Koran and the Temple\u2019s Articles of Incorporation] before the court to establish that a trust was created by Noble Dm Ali [sic] in 1928.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Upon the request of Petitioner, the court then read into evidence portions of the Temple\u2019s Articles of Incorporation and passages from the Temple's Holy Koran. According to Petitioner, these documents were evidence that \"The trustor is Noble Dm Ali [sic]. I am the trustee.\u201d <em>See also </em>note 3, <em>supra. </em>Because Petitioner was not born until much later, he obviously was not identified by name (or otherwise) in these 1928 documents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b390-8\">. <em>See </em>note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b391-10\">. The record reflects that the trial judge indicated on 17 December 1998 that he would mature the 26 March 1997 interlocutory injunction into a permanent injunction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b392-7\">. Following a full and thorough review of the record and the docket entries, we note that, while the trial judge\u2019s 6 January 1999 order granted Respondent\u2019s injunction, the order did not address explicitly Petitioner's counterclaim requesting an injunction to restrain the Temple from using the 1934 bylaws and Love El from representing himself as the Temple\u2019s President. Despite this lacuna in the order, one could infer the trial judge\u2019s probable intent to deny Petitioner\u2019s claims because no other resolution of those claims could coexist logically with the relief granted. We need not determine whether this appeal is premature, however, because Petitioner\u2019s appeal is authorized by Md. Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol., 2000 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12 \u2014 303(3)(i), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">A party may appeal from any of the following interlocutory orders entered by a circuit court in a civil case:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">(3) An order:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">(i) Granting or dissolving an injunction, but if the appeal is from an order granting an injunction, only if the appellant has first filed his answer in the cause.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b394-6\">. In his 5 May 1997 \"amended and supplemented answer\u201d to his motion to dissolve the interlocutory injunction entered against him, Petitioner asked the court to \"[ojrder Love-El to immediately turn over all records and assets belonging to said corporation to [Petitioner].\u201d Moreover, his 27 June 1997 counterclaim and his 9 July 1997 amended counterclaim request, respectively, that he \"take possession of all trust property and assets into his immediate physical custody and possession\u201d and that the Circuit Court establish a trust account for \"all proceeds from trust property are deposited and maintained until awarded to [Petitioner], or ... [taken] into his possession and control....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b394-7\">. Although the intermediate appellate court concluded that the record did not \"reflect whether [the Temple] owned specific real or tangible personal property,\u201d it also stated that the Temple operated more than 300 temples around the country. We conclude from Petitioner\u2019s assertions in the Circuit Court record that he sought control of the property, assets, and records deriving from these temples.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
