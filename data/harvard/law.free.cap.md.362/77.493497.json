The trial court in Sellers\u2019s trial erred in not recognizing that Petitioner\u2019s attorney effectively had been removed from the defense\u2019s witness list, and thus was no longer subject to the sequestration witness rule. Moreover, the trial judge did not err in refusing to grant Petitioner\u2019s motions to dismiss or for depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\n<em>A. The Murder</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">On 28 March 1997, Baltimore County Police were dispatched to a wooded area near the intersection of Route 40 and Jones Road in Baltimore County. The responding officers found a dead body, later identified as that of Michael Keller (Keller). The next day an autopsy was performed by an assistant state medical examiner, who ultimately testified at Tharp\u2019s trial that the wounds found on Keller\u2019s body included nine stab wounds to the back, any one of which would have caused death within two minutes and, in combination, killed Keller in less than one minute. This witness also testified that Keller sustained a non-fatal, one-inch deep cut to the throat while apparently still alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Additional testimony at Tharp\u2019s trial revealed that Tharp, Sellers, and William Minton (Minton), were involved in Keller\u2019s murder. Minton, testifying as a State\u2019s witness,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> explained that Tharp and Sellers came to Minton\u2019s house on 25 March 1997, to seek his assistance in a plot against Keller. Sellers asked Minton if he would help beat up Sellers\u2019s roommate, Keller, because Keller stole from him and had not contributed money toward rent or food. Minton understood that the three would take Keller to Delaware where they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>would assault him, take his money,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and abandon him. The proposed site for the intended assault was changed later to Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">On 27 March 1997, Tharp and Minton reconnoitered the area near Jones Road and determined that it was suitable for the planned attack on Keller. Under the guise of going to a party, they then picked up Sellers and Keller at their residence. The four men went to the Jones Road area and proceeded to walk down a dirt road to a pond. According to Minton\u2019s testimony, Sellers suddenly grabbed Keller in a bear hug and fell to the ground, knocking down Minton with them. Sellers got Keller face down on the ground and tried to handcuff his hands behind his back. Keller offered to pay Sellers the money that he owed him, but Sellers responded that it was too late. Tharp, Sellers, and Minton then began kicking Keller. At some point, Minton feigned a sprained ankle to avoid having to continue to kick Keller. He walked a short distance away from the others and remained there with his back to the action, but nonetheless overheard Tharp become startled and upset, asking Sellers what he was doing. Minton turned around and saw Sellers stab Keller three times in the back. Minton again turned his back on the scene, but he \u201cheard the stabbing continue ... [ajbout six or seven more times\u201d and heard Tharp refuse to aid Sellers. Tharp walked over to Minton and suggested that the two of them leave without Sellers. As they started to leave, Sellers caught up with them and the trio walked back to the car. They got into the car, at which point Minton noticed that Sellers had Keller\u2019s necklace. The next day, Sellers stated that the night before he had taken Keller\u2019s identification and left a vial of drugs on Keller\u2019s body so that the murder would appear drug-related.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Detective Jay Landsman took a statement from Tharp on the evening of 29 March 1997. Tharp acknowledged that he had gone to the Jones Road area with Sellers and Keller on the 27th of March, but claimed that he had dropped them off and returned later to pick up Sellers who was alone. Sellers reportedly told him that Keller had remained in the woods. In his statement, Tharp also claimed that he only learned of Keller\u2019s death from a TV Channel 13 news story.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">On 31 March 1997, Landsman and two other officers arrested Tharp. During the ride to the station house, Tharp volunteered to relate to Landsman \u201ceverything\u201d and directed the officers to where the men had placed the knives, handcuffs, and various other items used during the attack. Later, at police headquarters, Tharp gave the police a statement explaining how he, Sellers, and Minton had induced Keller to accompany them to the woods. He further explained the details of the attack, and particularly that he had cut Keller\u2019s throat, and found Keller\u2019s necklace in his car, but gave it to Sellers.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Throughout his trial, Tharp maintained that he believed that Sellers only intended to fight Keller, not to kill him. He testified that Sellers only began stabbing Keller after he, Tharp, had walked away from the affray. Tharp claimed that he hesitated to intervene because the stabbing went beyond what was supposed to be only a fight. He stated that he screamed at Sellers to stop the stabbing. Additionally, Tharp testified that he did not stab Keller in the neck to \u201cput him out of misery,\u201d as he had maintained in his second statement to the police, but because Sellers ordered him to \u201cdo something.\u201d Tharp believed that Keller was dead by the time he stabbed him because he was not moving and had been stabbed several times previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\n<em>B. The Sequestration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Sellers was tried before Tharp. At Sellers\u2019s trial on 29 October 1997, after the selection of the jury and immediately before opening statements, one of the attorneys representing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Sellers and one of the prosecutors<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> made a joint motion to sequester witnesses, which the trial judge granted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge ordered that \u201c[a]ny persons who testify during the trial should be removed to the hallway at this time, not to discuss the case either before or after they testify until the case is completely concluded.\u201d The prosecution reminded the court that the sequestration applied to Tharp\u2019s trial attorney, who was present in the courtroom, because he was on Sellers\u2019s submitted witness list.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court then specifically requested Tharp\u2019s trial attorney to leave the courtroom. Sellers\u2019s attorney rose in objection: \u201cWe\u2019ll waive [Tharp\u2019s trial attorney]\u2014 he\u2019s our witness lift [sic]. We\u2019ll waive.\u201d (Second alteration in original). The prosecution, upon implied inquiry by the judge, refused to \u201cwaive.\u201d The court, on the asserted ground that Tharp\u2019s attorney lacked standing to do so, answered in the negative to Tharp\u2019s attorney\u2019s query regarding whether he could object. Advising the court that he would be at his office, Tharp\u2019s attorney left the courtroom saying \u201c[i]f I can\u2019t watch I\u2019m gonna leave.\u201d We fast forward approximately eleven months to Tharp\u2019s trial because the record of Sellers\u2019s trial falls silent at this point as to any further matters of consequence to the issues at hand in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">On 28 September 1998, immediately before Tharp\u2019s trial was to begin, his attorney made a motion to dismiss the charges for prosecutorial misconduct or, in the alternative, a motion to postpone Tharp\u2019s trial and permit him instead to depose all of the State\u2019s intended witnesses in Tharp\u2019s trial who also had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>testified at Sellers\u2019s trial. During argument on his motion to dismiss, Tharp\u2019s attorney reminded the Circuit Court of his sequestration from Seller\u2019s trial approximately a year earlier. He stated that he was present at Sellers\u2019s trial to act as Tharp\u2019s attorney in the event that Tharp was called to testify and otherwise \u201cto observe the witnesses and listen to the testimony.\u201d According to Tharp\u2019s attorney, \u201c[i]t was known by everyone concerned that I had absolutely no knowledge, no firsthand knowledge, no factual knowledge about the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Tharp\u2019s attorney recounted his recollection of what took place at various points during Sellers\u2019s trial, including an unrecorded chambers conference, in the presence of the judge, the prosecuting attorneys, himself, and Sellers\u2019s attorneys, the day following the initial sequestration. At this chambers conference, he asserted that the judge reconsidered his sequestration. According to the transcript of the oral argument on Tharp\u2019s pretrial motions at his own trial, his attorney described the following exchange that reportedly took place at the pertinent chambers conference during Sellers\u2019s trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al\">[THARP\u2019S TRIAL ATTORNEY]: Uhm, your Honor indicated that so long as the State was continuing to object to my presence that I would not be permitted to sit in the courtroom, and your Honor asked [the State\u2019s attorney] if he was still objecting. [The State\u2019s attorney] at that time said, and I, if this isn\u2019t a direct quote, it\u2019s very close, he indicated, <em>Trials are a chess game. Checkmate. Now, I\u2019m not sure I know what that means, but I took that to mean that he had the upper hand; </em>... it was not going to do anything ... to jeopardize his case ..., an in his opportunity to get a conviction against [Tharp], He also said, as part of that same discussion that [Tharp\u2019s] trial was coming up. That there would certainly be an advantage to my being in court. Then said that bit about it\u2019s chess game. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Tharp\u2019s attorney then argued that he was barred from the courtroom during Sellers\u2019s trial for the wrong reason \u2014 a strategic ploy by the prosecution. He explained that although he later was able to obtain a transcript of Sellers\u2019s trial, \u201cthere\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>a lot more that goes on in that trial than can be covered in a transcript \u2014 there\u2019s ... how someone testifies, body language, credibility, those sorts of things.\u201d He maintained that his sequestration amounted to prosecutorial misconduct and accordingly Tharp\u2019s charges should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The prosecutor responded that he remembered making the chess game remark, but that possibly he had taken some poetic license in its formulation. The prosecutor continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At\">I guess [Tharp\u2019s Attorney\u2019s] saying that somehow his client has right to a, see the whole trial happen before his trial. But he doesn\u2019t. I mean, it, he was sequestered not because of anything the State did, and he hasn\u2019t been prejudiced in any way as a result of it; ... [he] was on the Defense \u25a0witness list. And if any misconduct at all \u2014 I mean, we really didn\u2019t know why he was on the list. And if the Court will recall, there was a long line of witnesses called by the Defense so it wouldn\u2019t have really surprised me if the Defense ... tried to call [Tharp\u2019s attorney] for some obscure reason. So we did it just to ... tactically, yes, but in the case against Mr. Sellers, not really against the case against [Tharp]. So I think there\u2019s been no foul.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Tharp\u2019s attorney retorted that he had a personal right, as a citizen, to be at Sellers\u2019s trial and that Sellers\u2019s rights had been violated because the prosecution was \u201cputting on a trial [Sellers\u2019s trial] to exclude me simply to gain strategic advantage in ... [Tharp\u2019s] trial.\u201d He further maintained that the prosecutor must have known that he would not be called as a defense witness for Sellers because if he was a fact witness regarding Keller\u2019s murder he would be unable to act as Tharp\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">The court, after examining Maryland Rule 5-615, determined, in Tharp\u2019s trial, that it had not violated the Rule by granting and enforcing sequestration in Sellers\u2019s trial and, thus, denied Tharp\u2019s motion to dismiss. Tharp then made a motion for depositions. He requested that the court convert the trial into a series of depositions so that he would have the opportunity to see and to hear the witnesses testify that were common to Sellers\u2019s trial and Tharp\u2019s imminent trial and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>therefore, place his attorney in the same position that he would have been had he been present at Sellers\u2019s trial. The court denied this motion as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">In a final initiative, Tharp\u2019s attorney purported to remind the court that, at Sellers\u2019s trial when Tharp ultimately was called as a witness by Sellers, he stood with Tharp, outside the presence of the jury, and advised him to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege. The court thereupon assertedly excused Tharp\u2019s attorney \u201cpermanently.\u201d Tharp\u2019s attorney further recounted that he later attempted to reenter the courtroom during Sellers\u2019s trial to listen to Minton\u2019s testimony. The court, however, reportedly with hand gestures, indicated that he was to leave, and he complied. Tharp\u2019s attorney then asked the court to reconsider its denial of Tharp\u2019s motions. In response, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">I don\u2019t have an independent recollection of any of that [from Seller\u2019s trial]. It does not alter my conclusion that you were properly excluded when you were on a witness list for . .. [Sellers]. I don\u2019t know exactly the context in which you asked me if you were excused permanently and I indicated yes. Certainly if your client was going away to the Baltimore County Bureau of Correction you weren\u2019t going to be needed anymore to represent him but you were still on the witness list and we were in the ... [defense\u2019s] case at the time so, again, I don\u2019t think that anything that I have done in this case ... violated Rule 5-615 and will not grant[, the] relief requested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The trial judge proceeded with Tharp\u2019s trial. He ultimately was found not guilty of first degree premeditated murder and first degree felony murder, but guilty of second degree murder and robbery with a dangerous or deadly weapon. The judge imposed a thirty-year sentence for the second degree murder conviction and a consecutive twenty-year sentence for the armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">\n<em>C. Direct Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Tharp appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>ments. <em>Tharp, </em>129 Md.App. 319, 742 A.2d 6. With regard to the sequestration of Tharp\u2019s attorney, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that Sellers\u2019s attorney effectively had removed Tharp\u2019s attorney from the defense witness list by excepting him from the sequestration motion. <em>Tharp, </em>129 Md.App. at 338, 742 A.2d at 16-17. The intermediate appellate court disagreed, however, with Tharp\u2019s argument that the Circuit Court \u201cviolated fundamental fairness and due process\u201d in not granting his motion for depositions. <em>Tharp, </em>129 Md. App. at 341, 742 A.2d at 18. The court stated that it did not find that the \u201cdepositions were necessary to prevent a failure of justice\u201d in light of the facts that Tharp\u2019s attorney ultimately obtained a transcript of Sellers\u2019s trial and that the record did not show that \u201cany witnesses, other than ... Minton, testified in both trials.\u201d <em>Tharp, </em>129 Md.App. at 342, 742 A.2d at 19. The court concluded that even if the denial of the taking of the depositions amounted \u201cto some conceivable error,\u201d Tharp failed to demonstrate any resultant harm. <em>Tharp, </em>129 Md. App. at 342-43, 742 A.2d at 19 (discussing <em>Dorsey v.

As for how it applies to public trials, we have stated that \u201c[u]nder no circumstances should a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>be so concluded as to have the appearance of a Star Chamber<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> proceeding, but cases sometimes occur which have a demoralizing influence on the spectators and to some extent on the community,\u201d necessitating exclusion of some members of the public. <em>Dutton, </em>123 Md. at 389, 91 A. at 422-23.

In that opinion, the intermediate appellate court observed that \u201cprophylactic measures, including closure, may be warranted under some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>circumstances, ... to maintain order, to preserve the dignity of the court, and to meet the State\u2019s interests in safeguarding witnesses and protecting confidentiality.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>125 Md.

Maryland Rule 5-516, <em>see supra </em>note 1, is a clear exception to a criminal defendant\u2019s right to a public trial. In effect, those sequestered by Rule 5-615 are no longer considered members of the general public for purposes of exclusion from the courtroom during criminal proceedings, and a criminal defendant\u2019s right to a public trial is in no way damaged by proper sequestration under Rule 5-615.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">There are good reasons for this exception.

State, </em>219 Md. 67, 70-71, 148 A.2d 433, 435, <em>cert. denied, </em>361 U.S. 847, 80 S.Ct. 102, 4 L.Ed.2d 85 (1959). Additionally, the object of Maryland Rule 5-615 \u201cis to prevent one prospective witness from being taught by hearing another\u2019s testimony; its application avoids an artificial harmony of all the testimony; it may also avoid the outright manufacture of testimony.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Redditt v.

There is no express exclusion for attorneys from\" the sequestration of witnesses rule.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If an attorney is placed legitimately on the witness list and a sequestration motion is made, the attorney is subject to sequestration. By the same token, if an attorney is not subject properly to Rule 5-615, he or she is .considered to be a member of the public, just as other persons not included on the witness list. As such, he or she may assert the right of the public to attend a trial, with the attendant right to seek judicial protection if that right assertedly is abridged. <em>See infra </em>Part V.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Taking into consideration the purpose of Rule 5-615, Petitioner argues that the Rule was intended to apply only to those \u201creasonably expected to be witnesses at the trial.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 15. According to Tharp, his trial attorney\u2019s assertion that the trial judge, the State, and Sellers\u2019s counsel at Sellers\u2019s trial knew that he \u201chad absolutely no knowledge, no firsthand knowledge, no factual knowledge of the case,\u201d coupled with the lack of any assertion to the contrary by the prosecutor or the trial judge, demonstrates that \u201cneither party [to Sellers\u2019s trial] had any reasonable basis for believing that ... [Petitioner\u2019s attorney] would be called as a witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Regardless of whether Petitioner\u2019s trial attorney in Sellers\u2019s case may not have been a fact witness, we disagree as a general principle that a threshold inquiry must be made by a trial judge in every case <em>merely </em>because an attorney\u2019s name appears on a witness list; however, we do perceive that a trial judge has both the right and the responsibility to inquire into the legitimacy of the presence of any person on a witness list in situations where a reasonable and prudent person would question an apparent or obvious abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">There is no pre-existing Maryland case law expressly supporting the proposition that Rule 5-615 requires any threshold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>inquiry by any party or by the trial judge. We have stated that \u201calthough under our prior rules the sequestration of witnesses rested within the discretion of the trial court, \u2018the granting of a request to exclude witnesses is now obligatory and is no longer discretionary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson, </em>283 Md. at 199, 388 A.2d at 927 (quoting <em>Swift v. State, </em>224 Md. 300, 306, 167 A.2d 762, 765 (1961)) (citing <em>Brown v. State, </em>272 Md. 450, 477, 325 A.2d 557 (1974)); <em>see Nickerson v.

The Rule states that the \u201ccourt <em>shall </em>order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witness.\u201d Md. Rule 5-615 (emphasis added). We have determined that \u201c \u2018shall\u2019 ordinarily indicates a mandatory intent, unless the context of the statute indicates otherwise.\u201d <em>Burch v. State, </em>358 Md. 278, 284, 747 A.2d 1209, 1212 (2000) (citing <em>Hirsch v. Md. Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, </em>288 Md. 95, 116, 416 A.2d 10, 21 (1980)). Moreover, we have declared that the witness sequestration rule, unless there is an objection or applicable exception, \u201cprovides that upon the request of a defendant or the State, the court <em>shall </em>\u2018order that the witnesses be excluded from courtroom until called upon to testify\u2019 \u201d and thus have concluded that \u201c[t]he present rule ... changed the former rule of law in that the granting of a request to exclude -witnesses is now obligatory and is no longer discretionary.\u201d <em>Swift, </em>224 Md. at 306 &amp; n. 2, 167 A.2d at 765 &amp; n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Unless there is an applicable exception, objection, or apparent or obvious anomaly, the proper request for a sequestration order, the rule being obligatory and framed in mandatory terms, ordinarily triggers no responsibility on the part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the court to make threshold inquiries into why a witness is on the witness list. We are unwilling, however, to reduce this principle to a hard and fast rule, the language of the rule notwithstanding. It is appropriate, as a general principle, to maintain that sequestration ordinarily is required when requested and no objection is made; however, we shall not encourage trial judges to turn a blind eye, in the absence of an objection, to obviously questionable situations or apparent shams, e.g., a party placing a member of the press on a witness list to exclude him or her from a courtroom, a defendant placing a prosecutor or the victim or members of the victim\u2019s family on the list to exclude such persons, and the like. Where a judge, applying a reasonable and prudent person standard, would question, on its face, the inclusion on a witness list of a person, the court, rather than hidebound to sequester without inquiry, should resolve promptly the apparently anomalous situation. Through prudent exercise of this superintending duty, the court can insure against mischief in the use of Rule 5-615.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Petitioner, in the present case, relies on <em>Addy v. Texas, </em>849 S.W.2d 425 (Tex.App.1993), to argue the trial court should have made findings as to why his trial attorney was on the witness list before sequestering his attorney, and that his attorney should not have been excluded because \u201cthere was no suggestion as to how ... [Petitioner\u2019s attorney] might have qualified as a competent witness in Sellers\u2019s case.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 15-17 (citing Md. Rule 5-602, which bars a witness from giving testimony on a matter in the absence of evidence that he had personal knowledge of the matter). Petitioner argues that the prosecutor was unable to demonstrate that Petitioner\u2019s attorney had any personal knowledge of the case; all that the prosecutor claimed was that \u201cit wouldn\u2019t have surprised me if the Defense ... tried to call ... [Petitioner\u2019s attorney] for some obscure reason.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 16-17. Petitioner\u2019s application of <em>Addy v. Texas </em>to the present case is off the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">In <em>Addy v. Texas, </em>the issue was whether \u201cthe exclusion from the courtroom of six friends of an appellant denied him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>the right to a public trial.\u201d 849 S.W.2d at 428. On the second day of testimony, the prosecutor \u201crequested that six spectators be sworn in and placed under the [sequestration of witnesses] rule as potential witnesses\u201d because there was \u201ca great possibility\u201d that she was going to call them to testify. <em>Addy, </em>849 S.W.2d at 426. The defense counsel countered that the six spectators had no knowledge of any of the facts of the case and were not going to testify. <em>Id. </em>The trial court, however, had the spectators removed from the courtroom in the belief that the sequestration rule had been invoked properly. <em>Id. </em>Before the end of the trial, the prosecutor stated that the true reason for having the six spectators removed was that there was a security risk for the State\u2019s informant to have the six friends present. <em>Addy, </em>849 S.W.2d at 428. The Court of Appeals of Texas found that the trial court incorrectly sequestered the six friends from the courtroom because \u201cthe trial judge never made findings to justify removing appellant\u2019s friends from the courtroom.\u201d <em>Addy, </em>849 S.W.2d at 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><em>Addy </em>does not support Tharp\u2019s argument that the court was obligated to make findings in support of sequestration, based solely on his attorney\u2019s presence on the witness list. <em>Addy </em>does support, however, the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s discussion of the need for findings before sequestering members of the public \u2014 those not on a witness list. <em>Tharp, </em>129 Md.App. at 339-41, 742 A.2d at 16-17 (\u201cBecause ... [Petitioner\u2019s attorney] was no longer a witness when he was excepted from the motion to sequester, he was merely a member of the public.\u201d). The Court of Special Appeals\u2019s conclusion that Petitioner\u2019s attorney effectively had been removed from the defense\u2019s witness list parallels the essence of the Texas court\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">In <em>Addy, </em>the prosecution attempted to exclude the six friends on the basis that they may testify, though later admitting that they were omitted for security reasons. The Texas court discussed how the prosecution attempted to employ the witness sequestration rule improperly and ultimately, as in the present case, the six friends effectively were not on the witness list but were excluded improperly from the trial as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>members of the public.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In the present case, Sellers, the defendant in the trial, placed Tharp\u2019s attorney on the witness list. There is no question that his name was initially on the witness list. The question in the present case, however, is whether the trial court erred in not recognizing Sellers\u2019s attorney\u2019s obtuse \u201cwaiver\u201d comment as amounting to an effort to \u201cwaive\u201d Petitioner\u2019s attorney from the witness list and, thus, from the sweep of mandatory sequestration.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">In <em>Addy, </em>the issue was whether the trial court erred in excluding appellant\u2019s six friends, who were placed illegitimately on the witness list, from the courtroom. The Texas court stated that its witness sequestration rule was not intended to permit the prosecution \u201cto identify any spectator as a witness and [subsequently] have that person removed from the courtroom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The heart of the Texas court\u2019s ruling was to deter the prosecution from having \u201cunlimited power to control who stayed in the courtroom during trial by merely invoking the provisions of the \u2018exclusions of witnesses rule\u2019 to those it considered undesirable as spectators.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Petitioner here suggests that \u201cthe effect of applying Rule 5-615(a) to exclude ... [his attorney] would be to give the State (or any party) power to remove any witness from the courtroom. The Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>could not have been intended to permit such an irrational result.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">We agree with Petitioner and the Texas court in that respect. The Court of Special Appeals addressed this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ac-dedup-0\">We reiterate that the <em>defense </em>placed ... [Petitioner\u2019s attorney\u2019s] name on its witness list, and the <em>defense </em>requested that witnesses be sequestered. This was not a situation in which the State named an individual as a witness with no intention of calling that person to testify and then strategically moved to sequester witnesses for the sole purpose of keeping that person out of the courtroom. We caution that such a tactic would likely amount to bad faith as well as violate the canon of ethics. That is far from what occurred in this case, however, and accordingly we decline to address the issue of bad faith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-6\"><em>Tharp, </em>129 Md.App. at 336 n. 6, 742 A.2d at 16 n. 6. Petitioner suggests that, assuming that his trial attorney was not removed effectively from the witness list, findings should have been made prior to the sequestration of Petitioner\u2019s attorney, and in not doing so, the trial court gave the prosecution power to remove witnesses arbitrarily from the courtroom. As stated <em>supra, </em>we disagree with the argument that the mere inclusion of a person on a witness list, absent more, triggers a requirement that the trial judge make threshold findings or inquiries; however, we also conclude that, in those situations when a trial judge reasonably should recognize that an apparent or obvious misuse of sequestration may be afoot, the judge has the right and responsibility, even absent an objection by a party, to inquire and make any required findings or take action as may be appropriate to the circumstances. In the present case, the prosecution was given the ability to attempt to gain an improper strategic advantage if the trial court erred in not recognizing the effort by Sellers\u2019s attorney as essentially removing Petitioner\u2019s attorney from the witness list. The court permitted the prosecution to have the last determination of whether Petitioner\u2019s attorney would be sequestered. Respondent is correct in stating that \u201c[t]he [State] bears no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>burden to proffer some reason why a defense witness might be called to testify, nor is the trial court required to set forth \u2018factual findings\u2019 suggesting why the individual might be called.\u201d Respondent\u2019s Br. at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">To ensure that one party is not given an inordinate amount of power over the other party in the sequestration of witnesses and to ensure that a defendant is provided with a public trial, it is necessary to follow the mandates of Rule 5-615: to allow sequestration of witnesses on the witness list; to have the granting of the sequestration ordinarily be mandatory, unless there is a clearly recognized exclusion, valid objection, or apparent or obvious anomaly that would trigger inquiry by a reasonable person; and, to permit a party to take a potential witness off his or her witness list if the person is not going to testify and therefore should not be subject to sequestration. If Tharp\u2019s attorney effectively was removed from the witness list, he became a member of the public and findings would have to be made,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> as in the <em>Addy </em>case, before he could be banned from the courtroom. <em>See, e.g., Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 48, 104 S.Ct. at 2216, 81 L.Ed.2d 31 (stating that for a party to have a hearing closed from part or all of the press or public, the party that wants to have the hearing closed must \u201cadvance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced, the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest, the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding, and it must make findings adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>to support the closure\u201d); <em>Carter, </em>356 Md. at 223, 738 A.2d at 880 (finding that \u201cthe trial court did not make the requisite case-specific finding necessary to justify the closing of the courtroom to the public\u201d); <em>see also Colbert, </em>323 Md. at 300, 593 A.2d at 228-29 (\u201cA court\u2019s case by case determination concerning whether conditions are present which permit closure requires that representatives of the press and the general public \u2018be given an opportunity to be heard on the question of their exclusion.\u2019 \u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Globe Newspaper Co. v.

Respondent contends that \u201cSeller\u2019s counsel could have easily stated that he was removing ... [Tharp\u2019s attorney] from the defense list. Counsel did not do so, however, and the trial court accordingly correctly excluded ... [Tharp\u2019s attorney] from Sellers\u2019s trial.\u201d Respondent\u2019s Br. at 12. We disagree and find the following conclusions of the intermediate appellate court to be correct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ab-dedup-0\">In this case, ... [Tharp\u2019s attorney] was listed as a witness for the defense. Defense counsel moved for the exclusion of witnesses. Significantly, defense counsel then <em>excepted ... </em>[Tharp\u2019s attorney] <em>from the motion. </em>The effect of this exception was to <em>remove ... </em>[Tharp\u2019s attorney] <em>from the defense witness list. </em>As ... [Tharp\u2019s attorney] was not on the State\u2019s witness list, <em>he was no longer a witness in ths case. </em>While Rule 5-615 permits the court to exclude witnesses on its own initiative, it does <em>not </em>authorize the court to exclude non-witnesses from the courtroom. Indeed, doing so without adequate justification may result in the denial of the defendant\u2019s right to a public trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number><em>Tharp, </em>129 Md.App. at 338-39, 742 A.2d at 16-17 (footnotes omitted). The Court of Special Appeals, in reaching the above conclusions, reiterated that, according to Tharp\u2019s attorney\u2019s recollection as recited at Tharp\u2019s trial on 28 September 1998, Sellers\u2019s attorney, at Sellers\u2019s trial, stated that Tharp\u2019s attorney was not a fact witness.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Tharp, </em>129 Md.App. at 338 n. 8, 742 A.2d at 17 n. 8. Tharp\u2019s attorney stated to the trial judge that Sellers\u2019s attorney \u201ctold the [cjourt that I was not a fact witness ... and at the time ... [the prosecution] did not question that.\u201d Although we are unable to find in the record of Sellers\u2019s trial where this statement was uttered to the trial judge, assuming it was communicated (because neither the trial judge nor the prosecutor contradicted Tharp\u2019s attorney\u2019s recollection), stating that he was not a fact witness tends to support the conclusion that Sellers\u2019s attorney was taking Tharp\u2019s attorney off of the witness list. <em>See supra </em>note 6. As a practical matter, there may be a difference between those placed on a witness list and those who actually testify. A party can place most anyone on a witness list-subject to a bad faith challenge-but only testimony based on factual knowledge, even expert opinion, is admissible. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-602; <em>see also supra </em>note 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Whether viewed individually or cumulatively, the three occasions during Sellers\u2019s trial when the propriety of sequestering Tharp\u2019s attorney arguably was brought to the trial judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>attention lead us to conclude that the court erred in maintaining its resolve to bar him from the courtroom. First, the ambiguity of Sellers\u2019s \u201cwaiver\u201d remark notwithstanding, a reasonable person, charged with the protection of the defendant\u2019s right to a public trial and the public\u2019s right <em>to </em>attend court, would have inquired of Sellers\u2019s counsel specifically what he intended to convey by his \u201cwaiver\u201d remark. The \u201cwaiver\u201d comment was in response to the State pointing out that the sequestration request included Tharp\u2019s attorney. In this circumstance, Sellers\u2019s attorney\u2019s remark could be construed reasonably as being aimed at waiving Tharp\u2019s attorney from the effect of the sequestration motion (particularly if coupled with an assertion that Tharp\u2019s attorney had no factual knowledge), thereby intending to redact his witness list. Respondent does not argue that a witness list cannot be modified, but rather that \u201cthe deletion (or addition) of an individual from a witness list is a matter that can and should be accomplished with ease and clarity, through a simple request by counsel.\u201d Respondent\u2019s Br. at 12. Respondent\u2019s point cuts both ways. If the trial judge was confused as to what Sellers\u2019s counsel intended to accomplish by his \u201cwaiver,\u201d a clarification could have been requested simply and expeditiously. Though Respondent\u2019s argument is not without persuasive force as a general rule, it is more appropriate, given the rights at stake, for us to take a broader view of the court\u2019s responsibility under these circumstances to appreciate, or at least inquire further regarding, what Sellers\u2019s attorney was attempting to do-to redact the defense witness list in Sellers\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The trial court erred from the inception in not inquiring further or not recognizing that Tharp\u2019s attorney had been redacted from the witness list, given the circumstances, and thus was no longer subject to Rule 5-615. The Court of Special Appeals aptly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">The rule [5-615] also allows the court to exclude witnesses on motion of a party. In this case, the State did not move to exclude ... [Tharp\u2019s attorney]. Instead, in ruling on . .. [Seller\u2019s attorney\u2019s] motion, the court deferred to the State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>position. Therefore, ... [Tharp\u2019s attorney] was not properly excluded \u201cupon the request of a party,\u201d as provided in the rule. We note that, even if the State had moved to sequester ... [Tharp\u2019s attorney] under Rule 5-615, granting such a motion would have been improper. As we have discussed, [Tharp\u2019s attorney] was not named on the State\u2019s witness list, and had just been effectively removed from the defense witness list. Therefore, he was no longer a witness subject to the rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-5\"><em>Tharp, </em>129 Md.App. at 388 n. 9, 742 A.2d at 17 n. 9. Furthermore, the trial court incorrectly deferred to Respondent\u2019s position after Tharp\u2019s attorney had been removed from the witness list and was no longer subject to 5-615. In so doing, the trial court fell prey to what we now warn against: giving the prosecution the \u201cunlimited power to control who stayed in the courtroom during trial by merely invoking the provisions of the \u2018exclusion of witnesses rule\u2019 to those [the State] considered undesirable as spectators.\u201d <em>Addy, </em>849 S.W.2d at 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">This principle particularly rings true in the present case, when it appears from what reportedly occurred at the chambers conference on the second day of Sellers\u2019s trial that the prosecution was attempting \u201cto get a leg-up,\u201d not in Sellers\u2019s case, but in Petitioner\u2019s case. As noted, the prosecutor was the same in both cases. He admitted to making remarks regarding the idea that trials are a \u201cchess game.\u201d Petitioner argues that the prosecution gained a strategic advantage. According to Petitioner, the prosecution was able to prepare more fully for Petitioner\u2019s trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">An attorney\u2019s presence in the courtroom during a co-defendant\u2019s trial may aid his trial preparation in countless, more specific ways. For example, had ... [Petitioner\u2019s attorney] been allowed to remain, he could have assessed how effective the attorneys were in examining the witnesses at the Sellers trial. He may have modified his approach to particular witnesses based on those assessments. Also, from seeing the jurors\u2019 reactions to a witness, a trial lawyer can better judge the witness\u2019s persuasiveness. This information may affect strategy in a fundamental way. For instance, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>a crucial State witness is very strong and seemingly unscathed by vigorous cross-examination, counsel may decide to advise his client to accept a plea offer. All the advantages of observing the Sellers trial were no doubt known to the prosecutor when, with obvious pleasure, he reacted to the trial judge\u2019s exclusion ruling by saying to ... [Petitioner\u2019s attorney], \u201cTrials are a chess game. Checkmate.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AV\">Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 19. It is arguable whether the prosecution, in making the chess analogy, was referring to Sellers\u2019s trial, Tharp\u2019s trial, or both. Defending against Petitioner\u2019s trial attorney\u2019s allegations at Tharp\u2019s trial, the prosecutor stated that he made these comments in relation to Sellers\u2019s trial. Additionally, it is at least debatable (though we conclude otherwise on the merits) whether the prosecution understood that Sellers\u2019s attorney wanted to remove Petitioner\u2019s attorney from the defense\u2019s witness list or was being obtuse on purpose. Respondent argues that \u201cit is clear that both the trial court and the prosecutor <em>in fact </em>believed that .... [Tharp\u2019s attorney] remained a potential witness.\u201d We shall not decide whether the prosecution actually understood that there was a redaction or whether the prosecution was acting in a purely strategic manner to gain an advantage over Petitioner\u2019s attorney. The Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-4\">Except for ... [the prosecution\u2019s] offhand remark that trials are like a game of chess, arguably suggesting that the State had some strategic reason for excluding ... [Tharp\u2019s attorney], ... [Tharp] presents us with no indication that the State\u2019s opposition to his presence was in bad faith. Indeed, other than this isolated and ambiguous comment, nothing in the record remotely indicates that the State opposed ... [Tharp\u2019s attorney\u2019s] presence in the courtroom for any reason other than that contemplated by the rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number><em>Tharp, </em>129 Md.App. at 336 n. 6, 742 A.2d at 16 n. 6 (citing <em>Jones v. State, </em>125 Md.App. 168, 724 A.2d 738 (1999)). Furthermore, because of the relative murkiness of the motives of the prosecution, we are unable to agree with Petitioner that the prosecutor\u2019s actions in Sellers\u2019s trial amounted to prosecutorial bad faith.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The circumstances of the present case, however, demonstrate why it is necessary that a trial court make clear, before the sequestration of witnesses, any potential ambiguity regarding whether a party is redacting its witness list.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Finally, even were we of a mind to deem the \u201cwaiver\u201d remark to be so ambiguous as not to have triggered recognition of its significance or a need to inquire further, and assuming some allowance for the vagaries of recollection regarding the content of what may have been said at the unrecorded chamber\u2019s conference on the second day of Sellers\u2019s trial, we have no hesitation declaring that the trial judge erred by \u201cpermanently\u201d barring Tharp\u2019s attorney from Sellers\u2019s trial following his appearance as Tharp\u2019s counsel (where he served only to advise Tharp of his right not to incriminate himself) when Tharp was called as a defense witness. The trial judge did not contradict Tharp\u2019s attorney\u2019s recitation that, when he attempted to return to the courtroom to listen to Minton\u2019s testimony during Sellers\u2019s trial, she waived him out of the courtroom. Having observed come to pass that which apparently had been foretold was the reason Tharp\u2019s attorney\u2019s name was placed on the defense witness list in the first instance, the court was obliged, at least, to question whether there was a legitimate reason to maintain sequestration of Tharp\u2019s attorney. Were we to fail to recognize such an obligation, we might foster occasions of potential future mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>chief in the use of Rule 5-615 and placing at risk the public trial rights discussed <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Petitioner contends that the Court of Special Appeals erred in finding that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of his trial attorney from Sellers\u2019s trial was harmless error. We need not resolve this point as we conclude there was no error in Tharp\u2019s trial. Although we have determined that the trial court erred in excluding Petitioner\u2019s attorney, the error was in Sellers\u2019s trial, not in Petitioner\u2019s. It follows that any primary harm resultant from that error occurred in Sellers\u2019s trial and with regard to Sellers\u2019s right to a public trial or Tharp\u2019s attorney\u2019s right, as a member of the public, to attend.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See supra </em>Part II. The Court of Special Appeals accurately noted that the issue in the present case is not whether there was a denial of Petitioner\u2019s \u201cSixth Amendment right to a public trial,\u201d but that that issue needs to be addressed \u201cbecause it lies at the heart of the court\u2019s error in excluding ... [Petitioner\u2019s attorney] from the courtroom in the Sellers case.\u201d <em>Tharp, </em>129 Md.App. at 339, 742 A.2d at 17 (emphasis in original). The intermediate appellate court reiterated \u201cthat the exclusion order occurred in Sellers\u2019s case, not in\u201d Tharp\u2019s and thus, \u201cthe question ... [Tharp] presents on appeal is whether, <em>in light of that error, </em>the court in his case erred in refusing to grant relief in the form of a dismissal or permission to depose the witnesses common to both cases.\u201d <em>Tharp, </em>129 Md.App. at 341, 742 A.2d at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>\n<em>A. Motion to Dismiss</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Tharp argues that, in light of the trial court\u2019s error in sequestering his attorney from Sellers\u2019s trial, the trial court, in Tharp\u2019s trial, erred in not granting either his motion to dismiss based on prosecutorial misconduct or his motion for depositions. With regard to the motion to dismiss, Tharp argues that the prosecutor\u2019s actions, in conjunction with the sequestration order in Sellers\u2019s trial, were \u201cclearly intended to hinder ... [his] trial preparation. In comparable circumstances, governmental misconduct has been deemed sufficient to support dismissal of the charges.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 28 (citing <em>Washington v. Burri, </em>87 Wash.2d 175, 550 P.2d 507 (1976)). As stated above, we are unable to conclude that the prosecution\u2019s action amounted to prosecutorial misconduct. Therefore, the trial court did not error in refusing to grant Tharp\u2019s motion to dismiss based on prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">\n<em>B. Motion for Depositions i. Rule U-261</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">As for the motion for depositions, Tharp maintains that he should have been provided with the opportunity to depose the witnesses as justice, due process, and fundamental fairness dictate. We conclude, however, that the Court of Special Appeals was correct in affirming the trial court\u2019s denial of depositions. We further agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the trial court\u2019s actions did not violate fundamental fairness and due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Maryland Rule 4-261 controls when, in criminal cases, depositions may be ordered. In the circuit courts in criminal cases, depositions are available when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">the parties ... agree, without an order of court, to take a deposition of a witness, subject to the right of the witness to move for a protective order under section (g) of this Rule. Without agreement, the court, on motion of a party, may order that the testimony of a witness be taken by deposition if satisfied that the witness may be unable to attend a trial or hearing, that the testimony may be material, <em>and </em>that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>taking of the deposition is necessary to prevent a failure of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Md. Rule 4 \u2014 261(b) (emphasis added). According to the Rule, which is expressed in the conjunctive, depositions may be ordered on the motion of a party as long as each of the following three situations is present: (1) the witness will be unable to attend the trial or hearing; (2) the testimony may be material; and (3) the deposition is necessary to achieve justice. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4-216(b). If the rule had been written in the disjunctive, only one of the above three situations would need to be demonstrated to trigger the court\u2019s discretionary authority whether to grant a motion for depositions. As none of the three situations are present in this case, the trial court pellucidly was correct in not granting Tharp\u2019s motion for depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">First, Tharp\u2019s attorney wanted to depose persons who would be testifying at Tharp\u2019s trial, not those who would be unable to attend the trial, as Rule 4-261 contemplates. By requiring that if depositions are to be taken they be of those witnesses unable to attend trial, the Rule implies that the depositions are for the introduction of evidence at trial and not for mere discovery or trial preparation, as was Petitioner\u2019s intended use of the depositions in this case. <em>See Kardy, </em>237 Md. at 536-37, 207 A.2d at 90 (discussing Rule 727, the predecessor to 4-261, and remarking that the taking of depositions, in criminal cases, usually indicates that the testimony is to be reduced to writing, \u201cin due form of law, by virtue of a commission or other authority of a competent tribunal, or according to the provisions of some statute law, to be used on the trial of some question of fact in a court of justice\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Second, discerning the manner of delivery of the testimony at Sellers\u2019s trial was not <em>material, </em>though it may have been <em>helpful. </em>The adjective \u201cmaterial\u201d is defined by <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>as \u201c[o]f such a nature that knowledge of the item would affect a person\u2019s decision-making process; significant; essential.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 991 (7th ed.1999). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>have defined a \u201cmaterial fact\u201d in civil law as a fact \u201cthe resolution of which will somehow affect the outcome of the case.\u201d <em>King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 111, 492 A.2d 608, 614 (1985) (citing <em>Lynx, Inc. v. Ordnance Products, Inc., </em>273 Md. 1, 8, 327 A.2d 502, 509 (1974)) (referring to Md. Rule 2-501(a)). It is logical that the same definition of materiality applies to Rule 4-261 and its phrase \u201cthe testimony may be material.\u201d Md. Rule 4-261(b). Thus, for a deposition to be taken pursuant to Rule 4-261(b), the deposition must be one that may somehow affect the outcome of the case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Petitioner\u2019s attorney wanted to take the depositions so that he would be able to observe \u201cthe meaning, the credibility, and the persuasiveness of a witness\u2019s testimony,\u201d referring to those witnesses who testified at Sellers\u2019s trial and who likewise the State intended to call as witnesses at Tharp\u2019s trial. Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 17. Petitioner\u2019s attorney, however, had a transcript of Sellers\u2019s trial, and there is no indication, as the Court of Special Appeals stated, that Petitioner\u2019s attorney \u201cwas actively seeking testimony from these witnesses beyond what was revealed in Sellers\u2019s trial transcript.\u201d <em>Tharp, </em>129 Md.App. at 342, 742 A.2d at 19. The taking of depositions was in no way essential to Tharp\u2019s case and would in no way affect the outcome of Tharp\u2019s case, particularly because his attorney had a transcript of the Sellers trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Petitioner cites <em>Corbett v. State, </em>130 Md.App. 408, 746 A.2d 954 (2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>359 Md. 31, 753 A.2d 3 (2000), in arguing that \u201cnon-verbal factors are <em>essential </em>to discerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>the real import of a witness\u2019s answer\u201d and that \u201cone could not know whether ... [a witness] truly did not remember or was refusing to testify.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br., at 17-18 (emphasis added). In <em>Corbett, </em>the Court of Special Appeals, in discussing the use of prior inconsistent statements at trial, noted that the State \u201cconced[ed] ... that from the cold record, it is impossible to determine whether ... [the witness] was being evasive in her answers or whether she was unable to answer because her memory was faulty.\u201d <em>Corbett, </em>130 Md.App. at 426, 746 A.2d at 963.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">The <em>Corbett </em>case is distinguishable from the present case. <em>Corbett </em>is about prior inconsistent statements and whether a witness\u2019s trial testimony was truly inconsistent with the witness\u2019s prior out-of-court statement. <em>Id. </em>The present case involves no such issue, and there is no question of whether witnesses testified inconsistently. In addition, as Respondent points out, Tharp\u2019s attorney \u201cwas free to talk with, and observe, any willing witness in preparation for trial.\u201d Respondent\u2019s Br. at 15. We have noted that \u201ca defendant and his counsel are at perfect liberty to interview and interrogate prospective witnesses, subject to the witnesses\u2019 acquiescence in such interrogation.\u201d <em>Grandison v. State, </em>305 Md. 685, 740, 506 A.2d 580, 607 (1986) (citing <em>Kardy, </em>237 Md. at 541, 207 A.2d at 92).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Tharp had ample opportunity through the transcript and through the opportunity to interview prospective witnesses to put himself on equal footing with the prosecution. Thus, the need for depositions was not material and the effect of not having them was not prejudicial error that we are prepared to recognize.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Lastly, in the present case, the taking of the depositions is not necessary \u201cto prevent the failure of justice.\u201d Md. Rule 4-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>261. Tharp argues that \u201c[jjustice is not served when a prosecutor, for purposes of \u2018checkmating\u2019 defense counsel, ... prevails upon the trial court to deny defense counsel important information about witness testimony, information which the prosecutor would obtain.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 23-24. Again, we do not conclude on this record that the prosecution acted in bad faith. Tharp\u2019s attorney had access to the transcript of Sellers\u2019s trial. Furthermore, as the Court of Special Appeals pointed out, \u201cthe record does not disclose whether any witnesses, other than ... Minton, testified in both trials.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Tharp, </em>129 Md.App. at 342, 742 A.2d at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">\n<em>ii. Depositions Outside of Rule 4-261</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ahr-dedup-0\">Tharp, recognizing the difficulty he confronts in trying to fit his argument into the mandate of Rule 4-261, alternatively argues that \u201cRule 4-261 ordinarily delineates the situations in which a deposition may be ordered in a criminal case; however, ... this Court has recognized a court\u2019s inherent power to order forms of trial preparation in unique cases when justice requires.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 28. Rule 4-216, however, is the only possible ground available upon which Tharp\u2019s argument could hope to gain purchase. The Court of Special Appeals noted that \u201c[t]here is no provision in the Maryland Constitution, Maryland Rules, or statutes of this state that requires or even explicitly permits the taking of pre-trial depositions of the State\u2019s witnesses in criminal cases.\u201d <em>Tharp, </em>129 Md.App. at 341, 742 A.2d at 18; <em>see Kardy, </em>237 Md. at 536, 207 A.2d at 89 90 (stating that there is \u201cno explicit authority to take pretrial depositions ... contained in any Maryland statute or rule of court, or in the Maryland Constitution\u201d). We agree. Additionally, we have stated that \u201c[tjhere is no inherent power in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>court of this State to direct the taking of depositions in criminal cases and whatever power exists is conferred by Rule 727 [former Rule 4-261], which derogates the common law and must be strictly construed.\u201d <em>State v. Collins, </em>265 Md. 70, 78, 288 A.2d 163, 168 (1972) (citing <em>Kardy, </em>237 Md. 524, 207 A.2d 83; <em>Young v. State, </em>90 Md. 579, 45 A. 531 (1900)).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">To argue that we should recognize some inherent ability vested in trial courts to order depositions as justice requires, outside of Rule 4-261, Tharp relies on <em>State v. Haas, </em>188 Md. 63, 51 A.2d 647 (1947), <em>overruled on other grounds, In re Petition for Writ of Prohibition, </em>312 Md. 280, 305, 539 A.2d 664, 676 (1988). In <em>Haas, </em>we held that trial courts have a right \u201cto permit the defendant to examine his confession in advance of the trial.\u201d <em>Haas, </em>188 Md. at 75, 51 A.2d at 653. In so holding, we noted that this right was not recognized by the common law, but that \u201claw is a growth and a great many matters, commonplace to us now, were not thought of many years ago.\u201d <em>Id. Haas, </em>however, does not apply to depositions, as demonstrated by <em>Collins, supra, </em>which states that Rule 4-261 exclusively governs depositions in criminal trials. <em>See also Kardy, </em>237 Md. at 539, 207 A.2d at 91 (stating the <em>Haas </em>opinion \u201cdid not discuss or consider anything relative to the taking of depositions\u201d). Moreover, in <em>Goldsmith v. State, </em>337 Md. 112, 651 A.2d 866 (1995), we maintained that even though \u201cwe have expanded the common law and given trial courts some authority to either require or permit discovery ... [,] the right to pre-trial discovery is strictly limited to that which is permitted by statute or court rule or mandated by constitutional guarantees.\u201d <em>Goldsmith, </em>337 Md. at 122, 651 A.2d at 871 (citing <em>Kardy, </em>237 Md. at 537, 207 A.2d at 90; Charles E. Torcia, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Procedure \u00a7 334, at 547 (13th ed.1990)). It is clear then that trial judges have no power beyond that conferred by Rule 4-261 to order depositions in criminal trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Tharp also incorrectly relies on <em>In re United States, </em>878 F.2d 153 (5th Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, Noons v. United States, </em>493 U.S. 991, 110 S.Ct. 538,107 L.Ed.2d 536 (1989) and <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number><em>States v. Carrigan, </em>804 F.2d 599 (10th Cir.1986), to contend that federal courts will permit trial courts to order depositions in exceptional circumstances. <em>Carrigan </em>addressed the context of a petition for a writ of mandamus by the Federal Government \u201cseeking vacation of a pretrial order directing that defendants in a criminal action be allowed to depose particular prospective government witnesses.\u201d <em>Carrigan, </em>804 F.2d at 601. The district court ordered that depositions be taken of witnesses who had refused to be interviewed by the defense because the prosecution had discouraged the witnesses from talking to the defense; the prosecution \u201cat least strongly implied that the witnesses should decline the requested defense interviews, and substantially chilled these witnesses\u2019 previously expressed willingness to discuss the facts with the defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit denied the petition, but with reluctance,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> inferring that it denied the petition simply because of the high standard required for granting a petition for writ of mandamus.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>Carrigan, </em>804 F.2d at 605. The circumstances of the present case are distinguishable from <em>Carrigan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In the present case, there is no evidence that the prosecution \u201csubstantially chilled\u201d the witnesses so that they would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>not agree to interviews by the defense. As is noted above, the record does not suggest that Tharp\u2019s attorney was prevented from interviewing any willing witnesses. Observing a trial may be easier than interviewing the witnesses and may provide the same information as interviews, but the denial of the former does not equate to the denial of the opportunity to do the latter, particularly when Petitioner\u2019s trial attorney knew from the transcript of Sellers\u2019s trial who testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">In <em>In re United States, </em>the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals granted the government\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus \u201cdirecting the district court to set aside a pretrial order in a pending criminal case providing for the defense to take, ex parte, the discovery deposition of a witness.\u201d 878 F.2d at 154. The Fifth Circuit distinguished <em>Carrigan </em>by remarking that in <em>In re United States </em>there was no allegation and no evidence that the prosecution impeded the defense\u2019s ability to interview or to talk with the witness. 878 F.2d at 157. Therefore, the \u201ckey element of <em>Carrigan </em>is wholly missing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court also stated that the deposition order was for discovery purposes and that the rules governing depositions in criminal cases \u201cdo[ ] not authorize depositions for discovery purposes, as the authorities uniformly recognize.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>In re United States, </em>878 F.2d at 156; <em>cf supra </em>pp. 29-30. In the present case, similar to <em>In re United States, </em>there is no indication that the prosecution inhibited Tharp\u2019s trial attorney from interviewing or speaking with witnesses, and, as discussed, Rule 4-261 circumscribes the use of depositions in criminal trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Lastly, Petitioner employs <em>Kardy, </em>237 Md. 524, 207 A.2d 83, to contend that we have stated that \u201cconstitutional provisions as well as statutory ones may be the source of authority to take depositions in criminal cases.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 28. Petitioner, however, takes this quoted passage out of context. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>What we stated in <em>Kardy </em>was that <em>Young, </em>90 Md. 579, 45 A. 531, was cited often for the proposition that \u201c[depositions can be taken ... in criminal cases only within the limitation of the authority granted by constitutional or statutory provisions or by the concurrent consent of the accused and the prosecution.\u201d <em>Kardy, </em>237 Md. at 538, 207 A.2d at 91 (second alteration in original). <em>Kardy </em>and <em>Young </em>address the limits upon, not the source of, the taking of depositions in criminal cases. In <em>Kardy, </em>we concluded that the criminal defendant has no constitutional right to take pretrial depositions; to find otherwise would leave Rule 727, the predecessor to Rule 4-261, without vitality. <em>Kardy, </em>237 Md. at 542, 207 A.2d at 93; <em>see also Goldsmith, </em>337 Md. at 126, 651 A.2d at 873 (\u201c[I]n <em>Kardy, </em>... this Court held that a criminal defendant has neither a state nor federal constitutional right to take the deposition of a potential witness.\u201d). Therefore, <em>Kardy </em>in no way supports the proposition that depositions in criminal trials may be taken outside of Rule 4-261, or in the interest of justice or fundamental fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">In sum, there was no error at Tharp\u2019s trial. Accordingly, we do not consider the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s alternative holding on the ground of harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">The last matter that we comment upon serves as a reminder for the guidance of bench and bar. The reminder appears propitious, given the circumstances of the present case, so that eases such as this one may be avoided in the future.
