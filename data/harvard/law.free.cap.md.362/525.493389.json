His convictions arose from a series of events that took place on November 10, 1997, which left a disabled woman, Judy Forrester, in her home, bound with duct tape and fatally shot. After the jury\u2019s verdicts, the court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the first degree premeditated murder conviction and a consecutive sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for conspiracy to commit murder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Johnson appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the crime of conspiracy to commit murder is an illegal sentence. The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, held that \u201cthe trial court properly sentenced appellant to life without parole for his conviction of conspiracy to commit murder.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Johnson filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari, presenting one question: \u201cIs a sentence of life without parole for the crime of conspiracy to commit murder an illegal sentence?\u201d We granted the petition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number><em>Johnson v. State, </em>356 Md. 634, 741 A.2d 1095 (1999), and we shall answer the question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">In Maryland, \u201c[(Conspiracy is a common law offense and is a misdemeanor.\u201d <em>Archer v. State, </em>145 Md. 128, 136, 125 A. 744, 747 (1924). There is a general limitation upon the punishment for the offense of conspiracy, however, which is prescribed by statute. Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 38, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">\u201c\u00a7 38. Punishment for conspiracy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">\u201cThe punishment of every person convicted of the crime of conspiracy shall not exceed the maximum punishment provided for the offense he or she conspired to commit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Consequently, under \u00a7 38, the punishment for a person convicted of conspiracy to murder cannot exceed the maximum punishment which is provided for first degree murder.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">The punishment for first degree murder is set forth in Art. 27, \u00a7 412(b), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-10\">\u201c(b) <em>Penalty for first degree murder. </em>\u2014 Except as provided under subsection (g) of this section, a person found guilty of murder in the first degree shall be sentenced to death, imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole. The sentence shall be imprisonment for life unless: (l)(i) the State notified the person in writing at least 30 days prior to trial that it intended to seek a sentence of death, and advised the person of each aggravating circumstance upon which it intended to rely, and (ii) a sentence of death is imposed in accordance with \u00a7 413; or (2) the State notified the person in writing at least 30 days prior to trial that it intended to seek a sentence of imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>ment for life without the possibility of parole under \u00a7 412 or \u00a7 413 of this article.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The State argues that, because imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole is an authorized sentence for first degree murder, Art. 27, \u00a7 38, makes it an authorized sentence for conspiracy to commit first degree murder. The defendant, on the other hand, argues that prior Maryland cases, as well as the legislative history of Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 38 and 412(b), support his position that life imprisonment is the maximum permissible sentence for conspiracy to commit first degree murder, and that, therefore, a life sentence without the possibility of parole is not authorized by \u00a7 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">As shown by the language of Art. 27, \u00a7 412(b), the basic sentence for first degree murder \u201cshall be imprisonment for life.... \u201d The greater sentences of death or imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole cannot be imposed unless certain special conditions are met. In addition to the notice requirements set forth in \u00a7 412(b), there are special conditions for the imposition of death or life without the possibility of parole contained in other statutory provisions. <em>See </em>Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 412(c), 412(g), 413, and Code (1999), \u00a7 6-112(c) of the Correctional Services Article; <em>Sucik v. State, </em>344 Md. 611, 616-617, 689 A.2d 78, 80 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Consequently, death or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole are \u201cenhanced\u201d sentences for first degree murder, and are dependent upon special circumstances. As former Chief Judge Robert Murphy stated for the Court in <em>Sucik v. State, supra, </em>344 Md. at 615, 689 A.2d at 80, \u201c[i]t was for special cases \u2014 and special defendants \u2014 that the legislature created this enhanced penalty [of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole].\u201d Moreover, \u201c \u2018[because an enhanced punishment statute is \u201chighly penal, [it] must be strictly construed.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Sucik v. State, supra, </em>344 Md. at 616-617, 689 A.2d at 80, quoting <em>Taylor v. State, </em>333 Md. 229, 237, 634 A.2d 1322 (1993), quoting <em>Jones v. State, </em>324 Md. 32, 38, 595 A.2d 463 (1991). <em>See also Lewis v. State, </em>348 Md. 648, 656, 705 A.2d 1128, 1132 (1998) (where \u201cthe provision enhancing the sentence was ambiguous, the ambiguity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>must be resolved in favor of the defendant\u201d); <em>Malcolm v.

State, </em>341 Md. 513, 520, 671 A.2d 495, 498 (1996) (basic life imprisonment is an authorized sentence for conspiracy to commit murder, but the death penalty is not an authorized sentence);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Hardy v. State, </em>301 Md. 124, 140, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>482 A.2d 474, 483 (1984) (basic life imprisonment is the maximum penalty for attempted first degree murder);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>De-Leon v. State, </em>102 Md.App. 58, 70-86, 648 A.2d 1053, 1058-1067 (1994); <em>State v. Michael, </em>2 Md.App. 750, 752-753, 237 A.2d 782, 783 (1968). The same position was taken by the Supreme Court of the United States in construing a federal statute providing that the sentence for attempt or conspiracy \u201c \u2018may not exceed the punishment prescribed for the offense which was the object of the attempt or the conspiracy,\u2019 \u201d <em>Bifulco v. United States, </em>447 U.S. 381, 396, 100 S.Ct. 2247, 2257, 65 L.Ed.2d 205, 217 (1980) (enhanced penalty for the target offense, which places a special limitation upon parole, is not applicable to conspiracy to commit the target offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The Maryland opinion containing the most extensive discussion of this issue is Judge Moylan\u2019s opinion for the Court of Special Appeals in <em>DeLeon v. State, supra, </em>102 Md.App. at 70-86, 648 A.2d at 1058-1067. <em>DeLeon </em>involved a conviction of conspiracy to violate the controlled dangerous substances laws. As previously mentioned, Art. 27, \u00a7 290, provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that the sentence for such conspiracy \u201cmay not exceed the maximum punishment prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the ... conspiracy.\u201d The issue in <em>DeLeon </em>was whether the reference in \u00a7 290 to the maximum sentence for the target offense included an enhanced penalty for the target offense which limited parole under certain circumstances. The <em>DeLeon </em>court held (102 Md.App. at 72, 648 A.2d at 1059)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">\u201cthat when a sentencing provision such as \u00a7 290 states that the punishment for an inchoate crime shall not exceed the maximum punishment provided for the target crime, such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>provision contemplates the ordinary maximum available for all who perpetrate the target crime and does not incorporate the enhanced penalty provisions available only for certain of those perpetrators.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">In support of this holding, the court in <em>DeLeon, </em>102 Md. App. at 73, 648 A.2d at 1060, pointed out that parole was not \u201can inherent part of the judicial sentencing function\u201d and that, \u201c[ejxcept in those limited circumstances when the Legislature has expressly empowered the courts to impose no-parole provisions under certain very specifically designated circumstances, the parole function is exclusively within the control of the executive branch of government.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals indicated that, for the judiciary to \u201cimpose conditions on parole eligibility,\u201d there must be an \u201cexpress grant of authority by the Legislature,\u201d and a \u201cspecific legislative grant of authority,\u201d 102 Md.App. at 74, 76, 648 A.2d at 1061-1062. Neither \u00a7 38 nor \u00a7 290 nor \u00a7 412(b) of Art. 27 contains an express or specific grant of authority. The <em>DeLeon </em>opinion, 102 Md.App. at 77, 648 A.2d at 1062, also relied on the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Bifulco v. United States, supra, </em>pointing out that <em>\u201cBifulco </em>is the mirror image of the case now before us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Finally, Judge Moylan for the court in <em>DeLeon </em>pointed to various specific provisions in Art. 27 where the General Assembly expressly authorized enhanced penalties for particular types of conspiracies. The court then stated (102 Md.App. at 85, 648 A.2d at 1065):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">\u201c[WJhen the Legislature wants specifically to provide enhanced penalties for ... conspirators, it knows how to do so expressly and does not rely on implication.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-8\"><em>See also Lewis v. State, supra, </em>348 Md. at 659, 705 A.2d at 1133-1134, where Judge Raker for this Court quoted with approval the above passage from <em>DeLeon. </em>The <em>DeLeon </em>opinion concluded (102 Md.App. at 86, 648 A.2d at 1066-1067):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALO\">\u201cWe hold that \u00a7 290 does not incorporate into the sentencing available for conspirators enhanced penalty provisions for violations of substantive target crimes. Enhanced pen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>alties are available for otherwise qualifying conspirators only if the law has \u2018otherwise provided\u2019 enhanced penalties for such conspirators.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Furthermore, nothing in the legislative history of Art. 27, \u00a7 38, or Art. 27, \u00a7 412(b), supports the argument that \u00a7 38 was intended to incorporate an enhanced maximum sentence associated with the substantive offense or that \u00a7 412(b) contemplated a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for conspiracy to commit murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Prior to 1961, Art. 27, \u00a7 38, provided that the punishment for conspiracy was not more than ten years imprisonment. In <em>Scarlett v. State, </em>201 Md. 310, 320, 93 A.2d 753, 757-758, <em>cert. denied, </em>345 U.S. 955, 73 S.Ct. 937, 97 L.Ed. 1377 (1953), this Court held that one convicted of conspiracy could be sentenced to a longer term of imprisonment than the maximum term provided for the substantive offense as long as the term of imprisonment for the conspiracy did not exceed ten years. By Ch. 691 of the Acts of 1961, the General Assembly repealed former \u00a7 38 and enacted an entirely new \u00a7 38 in its present form. The title to Ch. 691 indicated that the only purpose of the enactment was to provide that the punishment for conspiracy \u201cshall not exceed the maximum punishment provided for\u201d the substantive offense. The Court of Special Appeals, just seven years after the enactment of Ch. 691, stated <em>(State v. Michael, supra, 2 </em>Md.App. at 753, 237 A.2d at 784):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">\u201cIt seems obvious to us the intention of the legislature was simply to avoid the effects of <em>Scarlett v. State, </em>201 Md. 310, 93 A.2d 753 (1953) which held that an accused could, in some cases, receive a much longer term for a conspiracy than for the completed crime which was the object of the conspiracy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-8\"><em>See also Gary v. State, supra, </em>341 Md. at 519, 671 A.2d at 498 (while the legislature\u2019s purpose in 1961 may have been \u201cto prevent harsher sentences for conspiracy than were authorized for the substantive crime,\u201d it is \u201clogical to conclude that the legislature also intended to ensure\u201d that conspirators be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>punished as severely as those committing the substantive crimes).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Obviously the General Assembly, when it enacted Ch. 691 of the Acts of 1961, did not contemplate that conspiracy to commit murder could be punished by the enhanced sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, as no such sentence existed in Maryland at that time. Nonetheless, as previously mentioned, not too long after Ch. 691 was enacted, the statute was construed as not authorizing the enhanced punishment of death for \u201ca conspiracy to commit a capital offense.\u201d <em>State v. Michael, supra, 2 </em>Md.App. at 753, 237 A.2d at 783. This construction of Ch. 691 has never been changed by the General Assembly, and was reaffirmed by this Court in <em>Gary v. State, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The enhanced penalty of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for first degree murder was first enacted by Ch. 237 of the Acts of 1987. The title of Ch. 237, as well as its legislative history, indicates that this enhanced penalty was enacted only \u201cas a penalty for first degree murder.\u201d <em>See Laws of Maryland 1987, </em>Ch. 237, at 1048. The Report of Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee on the bill which became Ch. 237, signed by the Committee\u2019s Chairman, stated (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\"><em>\u201cLife imprisonment without the possibility of parole is needed as a sentencing option in first degree murder cases </em>because there are people committing heinous crimes; for example, serial killers, who are not eligible for the death penalty. In addition, a death penalty proceeding is a long, expensive process and a tremendous drain on resources. Life without parole would be less costly and would have the effect of preventing the defendant from killing again. <em>The intent of this bill is to add imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole to the sentencing options available upon a finding of guilty of murder in the first </em>degree.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avk\">For discussions of the legislative history of Ch. 237, <em>see Sucik v. State, </em>344 Md. at 615, 689 A.2d at 79-80; <em>Woods v. State, </em>315 Md. 591, 601, 556 A.2d 236, 241 (1989). The legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>history of Ch. 237 discloses that the only offense which was mentioned, in connection with life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, was first degree murder. The enhanced penalty was enacted for \u201ckillers, who are not eligible for the death penalty\u201d and as an alternative to the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">We hold, therefore, that life imprisonment without the possibility of parole is not a legal sentence for conspiracy to commit murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED IN PART. CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO STRIKE THE \u2018WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE\u201d FROM THE SENTENCE FOR CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT MURDER, TO VACATE THE SENTENCE FOR CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT ROBBERY, AND, AS SO MODIFIED, TO AFFIRM THE JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY.

Johnson was also sentenced to a ten-year concurrent sentence for robbery with a deadly weapon, a two-year concurrent sentence for first degree burglary, a ten-year concurrent sentence for use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence, and a four-year concurrent sentence for conspiracy to commit robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b569-7\">. The Court of Special Appeals did hold, however, that Johnson \"was improperly sentenced for two conspiracies\u201d and that \"[h]is four-year concurrent sentence for conspiracy to commit robbery ... is illegal.\u201d The intermediate appellate court\u2019s opinion concluded by \" \u2019remand[ing] the case in accordance with this opinion,' presumably for the trial court to vacate the sentence for conspiracy to commit robbery.\u201d No issue has been raised in this Court with regard to this holding by the Court of Special Appeals. In this connection, <em>see, e.g., Jordan v. State, </em>323 Md. 151, 159-162, 591 A.2d 875, 879-880 (1991); <em>Tracy v. State, </em>319 Md. 452, 459-460, 573 A.2d 38, 41-42 (1990); <em>Mason v.

Although Art. 27, \u00a7 38, generally limits the maximum punishment for conspiracies, there are other statutes which more particularly prescribe punishments for some specific types of conspiracies. See, e.g., Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 286(c), (d), and (e). There is, however, no such particularized statutory provision for conspiracy to murder; accordingly, the limitation upon the allowable sentence prescribed by Art. 27, \u00a7 38, is controlling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b572-6\">. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>at 1108 (7th ed., 1999), defines an \"inchoate offense\u201d as \"[a] step toward the commission of another crime, the step in itself being serious enough to merit punishment.
