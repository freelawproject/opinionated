It appears that the pipe froze and eventually burst due to an open window in Chia\u2019s apartment. Plaintiff now sues Chia, the condominium, and the condominium\u2019s management company on the theory that the leakage resulted from these defendants\u2019 alleged negligence. The motion court granted all three defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>dants summary judgment dismissing the complaint. We now modify to reinstate the complaint as against Chia, and affirm in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\">With regard to Chia (who had been out of the country for four weeks at the time the leak occurred), an issue of fact exists as to whether he was responsible for the open window in his apartment. Chia\u2019s deposition testimony does not eliminate this issue of fact. We note that the building superintendent\u2019s statement opining that the window had been blown open during a storm appears to be unsupported speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The condominium and the management company, however, were entitled to summary judgment, since neither of these defendants had any responsibility, under the condominium bylaws, for the maintenance of the exposed sprinkler pipe or the window in Chia\u2019s apartment. Further, there was no evidence to support an inference that the building superintendent had opened the window. Nor can plaintiff proceed against the condominium and the management company under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, since it is clear that the offending instrumentalities (i.e., the window and pipe) were not under the exclusive control of these defendants <em>(see Kambat v St. Francis Hosp., </em>89 NY2d 489, 494 [1997]; <em>J.E. v Beth Israel Hosp., </em>295 AD2d 281, 285 [2002], <em>lv denied </em>99 NY2d 507 [2003]).
