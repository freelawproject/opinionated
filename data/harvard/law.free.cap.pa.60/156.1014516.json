Harris. The important allegations were, that the plaintiff was a tobacco merchant in New York, and made superior cigars, knpwn as the <em>\u201c Cfolden drown,\u201d </em>which he sold in large quantities. In the year 1858 he devised a trade-mark, to wit, a <em>Grolden drown, </em>and had labels with the mark lithographed and printed, which for his protection, he entered on the 18th of December 1858 in the office of the District Court of the Southern District of New York, in conformity with the Acts of Congress respecting copyrights: from that time this trademark has been used by him, and become identified with the Golden Crown cigars. The labels are used by placing a larger one inside of the cover of the cigar-box, and a smaller one over the edge of the box where the cover is opened. The defendant, who is a printer, has made and is still making a great number of counterfeit labels of the plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark for persons unknown to the plaintiff, who are using them to deceive the public and induce the belief that they mark the \u201c Golden Crown\u201d cigars, and thus deprive him of the exclusive use of his trade-mark; the defendant was notified to stop printing the counterfeit labels of the trade-mark, but he refused, and said he intended to continue printing and disposing of them. The prayer was that the defendant be restrained from printing and counterfeiting the plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark, &amp;c. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-13\">Exhibit marked \u201cA\u201d of the genuine labels containing the trade-mark; also an exhibit of the alleged counterfeit, were attached to the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-14\">The genuine labels were parallelograms, nearly square; on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>smaller was inscribed \u201c Golden Crown,\u201d below which was \u201cL.

He charges that the defendant, who is a printer by trade, has counterfeited this mark, and sells copies of it to persons engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigars, by whom they are used to his damage. The answer of the defendant admits these allegations; but sets up as a ground for the non-interference' of the court, that the articles thus sold by the plaintiff were manufactured in the city of New York, and that the trade-mark in question contains upon it the declaration that they are the product of a \u201c factory of cigars from the best plantations de la Vuelta Abajo, Calle del Agua, Habana.\u201d The case having been heard on bill and answer, the bill was dismissed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">The maxim which is generally expressed, \u201c He who .comes into equity must come with clean hands,\u201d Snell\u2019s Principles 33, but sometimes, in stronger language, \u201cHe that hath committed iniquity shall not have equity,\u201d Francis\u2019s Maxims 5, has been often applied to bills to restrain by injunction the counterfeiting of trade-marks. The ground on which the jurisdiction of equity in such cases is rested, is the promotion of honesty and fair dealing, because no one has a right to sell his own goods as the goods of another: Croft <em>v. </em>Day, 7 Beav. 84. \u201cIt is perfectly manifest,\u201d said Lord Langdale, \u201c that to do this is a fraud, and a very gross fraud.\u201d It is plain that there is no class of cases to which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>maxim referred 'to can be more properly applied. Tbe party who attempts to deceive the public by tbe use of a trade-mark, wbicb contains on its face a falsehood as to the place where bis goods are manufactured, in order to have tbe benefit of tbe reputation wbicb such goods have acquired in the market, is guilty of tbe same fraud of wbicb be complains in tbe defendant. He certainly can have no claim to tbe extraordinary interposition of a tribunal, constituted to administer equity, for tbe purpose of securing to him tbe profits arising from bis fraudulent act. Thus, in Pidding <em>v. </em>How, 8 Sim. 477, tbe plaintiff bad made a new sort of mixed tea and sold it under tbe name of \u201c Howqua\u2019s Mixturebut as be bad made false statements as to tbe teas of wbicb bis mixture was composed, and as to the mode in wbicb they were procured, tbe court refused an injunction, Yice-Ohancellor Shadwell remarking, \u201c it is a clear rule, laid down by courts of equity, not to extend their protection to a person wljose case is not founded in truth.\u201d In Flavel <em>v. </em>Harrison, 10 Hare 467, an injunction was refused, where an article was sold by tbe name of Elavel\u2019s Patent Kitchener, for wbicb there never' bad been a patent. In Leather Cloth Company <em>v. </em>American Leather Cloth Company, 11 House of Lords Cases 533, though decided on tbe ground that tbe mark used by tbe defendants was substantially different from that of tbe plaintiffs, yet it may be fairly inferred from all tbe opinions that, if necessary, tbe decree of Lord Chancellor West-bury would have been affirmed on tbe broader ground. Th|i\u00e9, a company, wbicb bad gained reputation by a particular manufacture, on discontinuing their business, transferred their stamp or trade-mark, wbicb indicated them as tbe manufacturers, to other parties; and it was tbe opinion expressed that such assignees would not be protected in equity in tbe use of that mark on goods manufactured by themselves. \u201cSo,\u201d said Lord Cranworth, \u201cin tbe cases of bottles or casks of wine stamped as being tbe growth of a celebrated vineyard, or cheese marked as tbe produce of a famous dairy, or of bops stamped as coming from a well known hop-garden in Kent or Surrey, no protection would be given to tbe sellers of such goods, if they were not really tbe produce of tbe place from wbicb they purported to come.\u201d It is contended, however, that this case is different, because there were marks or words used with these labels inconsistent with the idea that they were held forth as manufactured in Havana. On tbe label is printed, \u201cEntered according to Act of Congress, A. D. 1858, by Lorin Palmer, in tbe Clerk\u2019s Office of tbe Southern District of New York.\u201d Apart from the fact that this is in such very small type, and so abbreviated that it would probably escape the observation of every one whose attention was not specially directed to it, a circumstance wbicb rather strengthens tbe evidence of an intention to mislead tbe public, what is there in tbe fact that tbe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>design or engraving had been copyrighted in the United States, inconsistent with the declaration that the cigars, contained in the box, were manufactured in Havana of Cuban tobacco ? But, again, it is said that the United States\u2019 internal revenue stamp would at once undeceive the purchaser, there being a difference between the stamp used for articles imported and for those of domestic manufacture. New persons would stop to notice this difference; and besides, as it is alleged, the trade-mark is pasted on the inside of the lid, and when the box is open for the purpose of retailing, the trade-mark is brought directly in the view of persons wishing to purchase, and the revenue stamp is not seen unless the lid is turned down, and the box examined on the outside. It is contended, further, that the falsehood is in a foreign language, of which it is to be presumed that the plaintiff\u2019s customers are ignorant. Yet there is certainly enough to convey to every one who can read that the cigars are from \u201c Havana.\u201d It is true, that when a slander is uttered in a foreign tongue, it is necessary, in an action for damage, to prove that the hearers understood the language; for it will not be .presumed that, being ignorant of the meaning of the words, they afterwards repeated them to those who understood them: 2 Starkie on Slander 52; but there is no such rule in an action for a libel in a foreign language, for <em>litera scripta manet; </em>that may be read and explained by those who do to those who do not understand it. The case of a written or printed libel has a much closer analogy to the point before us than that of spoken slander. But above all this, it is not necessary that any one person has been actually deceived or defrauded; it is enough that it is a misrepresentation, calculated to have that effect on the unwary and unsuspicious.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
