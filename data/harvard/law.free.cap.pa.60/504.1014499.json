I have made this clause, not from any fear of its <em>prolalle </em>necessity, but from prudence and precaution. If she dies without lawful issue, this sum to go to her brothers in the same manner as specified above in the larger sum. I desire also that for two years after my demise, my dear niece, Ellen Keene, shall inhabit the house now mine, at the north-west corner of Tenth and Chestnut streets; the bequest of it not to take place until that period; and it is my earnest solicitation that my dear friend, Sarah Pogson Smith, shall, during that period, inhabit it with her; and if afterwards my dear Ellen Keene does not marry, that she and Mrs. Pogson Smith may live together, the latter transferring to my beloved niece the friendship and interest she has always shown to me, becoming also a <em>maternal </em>guardian of <em>her </em>welfare and happiness, her virtues and her religious principles; and may God bless my prayers and my endeavors for the happiness in this world, and in the world to come, of her who has been for these ten years past the object of my affections and of my most anxious solicitude and tender regard.

F. Smith 268. The subject being personalty, the limitation is to be construed to be upon a failure of issue at the death of the first taker who gets but a life estate: 2 Redfield on Wills 372, \u00a7\u00a7 20, 21, 22, and notes; Hawkins on Wills 197; Emma Myers\u2019s Appeal, 13 Wright 111. \u201cChildren, lawful issue\u201d means children: Walker v. Milligan, 9 Wright 180; 2 Jarman on Wills *353, *355; Ryan <em>v. </em>Cowley, Lloyd &amp; Goold 10; Carter <em>v. </em>Bentall, 2 Beav. 551. The petitioner and his brothers and sisters have a right to have security from the life tenants: Act of February 24th 1834, \u00a7 49, Pamph. L. 82, Purd. 303, pi. 184; Duval\u2019s Appeal, 2 Wright 120, 121; Bedford\u2019s Appeal, 4 Id. 18.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-7\"><em>JE. K.

L. 208, Purd. 766, pi. 17, 18; Halsey <em>v. </em>Tate, 2 P. F. Smith 311; Okesson\u2019s Appeal, 2 Grant 303. The fund to pay the legacies is real estate still unsold. It is unconverted real estate: Chew <em>v. </em>Nicklin, 9 Wright 84; Annewalt\u2019s Appeal, 6 Id. 414.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-8\">If the limitation over of the $30,000 bequest on Ellen\u2019s death is in the event of her dying \u201c without children living at her death to Henry and James for life, with executory bequest to their children,\u201d then if Ellen were to leave grandchildren and leave no child living at her death, the grandchildren would take nothing. Such a construction is not adopted in the absence of express words: Doe <em>v. </em>Perryn, 3 Term R. 484; Weakley <em>v. </em>Rugg, 7 Id. 322; Doe <em>v. </em>Considine, 6 Wall. S. C. 458; Rewalt <em>v. </em>Ulrich, 11 Harris 390.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-9\">It means if having had any; for such would as soon as born take a vested remainder absolutely: Lantz <em>v. </em>Trusler, 1 Wright 482. It is not like McBride <em>v. </em>Smith, 4 P. F. Smith 245.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-10\">They would take as purchasers: Guthrie\u2019s Appeal, 1 Wright 9; Bacon\u2019s Estate, 7 P. F. Smith 504; Train <em>v. </em>Fisher, 15 S. &amp; R. 149. The alternative limitation would not be considered too remote: Lewis on Perpet. 373; Sm. Ex. Int\u2019s., \u00a7 541; Hawkins 212, 213.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>The limitation to Henry and James is joint. It is to them <em>nominatim: </em>Hawkins on Wills 90, 111; 2 Jarm. 157, 167, 111; 2 Powell on Devises 368; Buffar <em>v. </em>Bradford, 2 Atk. 220; Morley <em>v. </em>Bird, 2 Ves. 628; Campbell <em>v. </em>Campbell, 4 Bro. C. C. 15; McKeehan <em>v. </em>Wilson, 3 P. F. Smith 74; Wilson <em>v. </em>McKeehan, Id. 79, 80. The right of the survivor to take the whole is un- . questionable, irrespective of our Act of Assembly: Baldwyn <em>v. </em>Johnson, 3 Bro. C. C. 455; Frewen <em>v. </em>Relef, 2 Id. 221; Putnam <em>v. </em>Putnam, 4 Bradford N. Y. Rep. 208; 1 Rep. on Leg. 485.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-6\">This bequest to the two legatees is unaffected by the Act of \u2022 31st March 1812, \u00a7 1, 5 Smith L. 395, Purd. 569, pi. 1, which only takes away the right of survivorship as to those who \u201chold\u201d or are \u201c possessed\u201d of an estate or thing in joint tenancy: Newbold <em>v. </em>Pritchett, 2 Whart. 46.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzV\">\u201c The interest only to their uses\u201d is not expressed to be <em>for </em>life, but without limit of duration. Now, the interest of a bequest given without limit as to time, is equivalent to a gift of the principal: Phillips <em>v. </em>Chamberlaine, 4 Vesey 51; Adamson <em>v. </em>Armitage, 19 Id. 416; Barford <em>v. </em>Street, 16 Id. 135; Hawkins <em>v. </em>Hawkins, 7 Simons 173, 197; Elton <em>v. </em>Sheppard, 1 Bro. C. C. 533; Humphrey <em>v. </em>Humphrey, 6 Eng. L. &amp; Eq. 113; Hawkins on Wills 123; Haig <em>v. </em>Swiney, 1 Sim. &amp; Stu. 487; Clough <em>v. </em>Wynne, 2 Madd. 439; Stretch <em>v. </em>Watkins, Id. 143; Hawkins 124, 126; Earl <em>v. </em>Grim, 1 Johns. Ch. Rep. 494; Garret <em>v. </em>Rex, 6 Watts 14; Heilman <em>v. </em>Heilman, 4 Rawle 440; Campbell <em>v. </em>Gilbert, 6 Whart. 72; Silknitter\u2019s Appeal, 9 Wright 365; Van Rensselaer <em>v. </em>Dunkin\u2019s Executors, 12 Harris 252.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-8\">The contingent limitation to Henry and James and to their children was to the latter as persons who would take in course of succession from them what their parents had first enjoyed. If the former would take the whole interest, it could only be so that their children could take; and as James predeceased the testatrix, he could transmit nothing to his children: Womrath <em>v. </em>McCormick, 1 P. F. Smith 504. The Act of May 6th 1844, \u00a7 2, Pamph. L. 565, Purd. 1017, pi. 15 (supra), does not save this bequest to such children, as the will of the testatrix was made November 18th 1843, she dying May 11th 1866. The act is exclusively prospective: Mullock <em>v. </em>Souder, 5 W. &amp; S. 198; Martindale <em>v. </em>Warner, 3 Harris 471, 479; Kurtz <em>v. </em>Saylor, 8 Id. 205; Neff\u2019s Appeal, 9 Id. 243; Fisher <em>v. </em>Farley, 11 Id. 501; Becker\u2019s Appeal, 3 Casey 52; Dewart <em>v. </em>Purdy, 5 Id. 114; Gable <em>v. </em>Daub, 4 Wright 217; Taylor <em>v. </em>Mitchell, 7 P. F. Smith 209.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-9\">In the $10,000 legacy \u201cunmarried\u201d is, never having been married; consequently the limitation over of the interest of the gift cannot possibly take effect: Maugham <em>v. </em>Vincent, 18 L. J. Rep. N. S. Ch. 329; Hall <em>v. </em>Robertson, 21 Eng. L. &amp; Eq. Rep. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>504 ; Bell <em>v. </em>Phyn, 7 Vesey 458; Maberly <em>v. </em>Strode, 3 Id. 450; Shreiner\u2019s Appeal, 3 P. F. Smith 106.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-6\">The limitation over of the interest only is for the want of marriage of the legatee; \u25a0 and as that event has taken place, such limitation is inoperative: Holmes <em>v. </em>Holmes, 5 Binn. 252; Griffith <em>v. </em>Woodward, 1 Veates 316; Jessup <em>v. </em>Smuck, 4 Harris 327; Vaughan <em>v. </em>Dickes, 8 Id. 514; Matlack <em>v. </em>Roberts, 4 P. F. Smith 148.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-7\">The words dying <em>\u201cunmarried </em>and without issue\u201d make \u201cunmarried\u201d to have a meaning other than as a mere step towards having issue, since as the event of marriage or not is necessarily ascertained within the life of the first taker, it prevents the limitation being one after an indefinite failure of issue, and, therefore, prevents its being too remote: Eichelberger <em>v. </em>Barnitz, 9 Watts 450; Scott <em>v. </em>Price, 2 S. &amp; R. 63, 64.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-8\">Should Henry\u2019s wife survive him, in which case clearly he will not \u201c die unmarried,\u201d and the limitation over cannot take effect, it will remain with Henry that he may provide for his widow: Everett <em>v. </em>Cooke, 7 East 269; Framlingham <em>v. </em>Brand, 3 Atk. 390; Baldwin <em>v. </em>Rawling, 2 B. &amp; Aid. 448; Hawkins on Wills 210; Re Rye\u2019s Settlement, 10 Hare 111.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-9\">As to the residuary clause, the rule is, that the first taker in a will is presumed in law to be the favorite of the testator: McFarland\u2019s Appeal, 1 Wright 300; Rewalt <em>v. </em>Ulrich, 11 Harris 388; Wilson <em>et al. v. </em>McKeehan, 3 P. F. Smith 79. The word <em>devolve </em>denotes legal succession: Haldeman <em>v. </em>Haldeman, 4 Wright 35; Clark <em>v. </em>Baker, 3 S. &amp; R. 477; Train <em>v. </em>Fisher, 15 Id. 149; Potts\u2019s Appeal, 6 Casey 168. If unmarried, she may give to her brothers as she pleases; but there is no restriction if married: Griffith <em>v. </em>Woodward, 1 Jarm. 457; Everett <em>v. </em>Cooke, 7 East 269; Framlingham <em>v. </em>Brand, 3 Atk. 390.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-10\">Every intendment is to be made against holding a man to die intestate, who sits down to dispose of the residue of his property: Smith\u2019s Ex. Int\u2019s., \u00a7 341; Note 3 to Maberly <em>v. </em>Strode, 3 Vesey 456; Brown <em>v. </em>Higgs, 4 Vesey 716; Hall <em>v. </em>Dickinson, 1 Grant 240; Baldwin <em>v. </em>Rawling, 2 B. &amp; Ald. 441. The word <em>estate </em>is as broad as if she had said to her and to her heirs and assigns: Womrath <em>v. </em>McCormick, 1 P. F. Smith 504. \u201c If she dies <em>unmarried\u201d </em>means without having any husband living at her decease: Sanders\u2019 Trust, Law Reporter, Law Rep. 1 Eq. Cas. 675.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-12\">The power in the niece of disposing of the property upon the uncertam event \u201cif she dies unmarried,\u201d is not an imperative direction to make an appointment: Hambright\u2019s Appeal, 2 Grant 321; Second Reformed Presbyterian Church <em>v. </em>Disbrow, 2 P. F. Smith 224; Brook <em>v. </em>Brook, 3 Sm. &amp; Giffard\u2019s Reps. 280.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-13\">If the power to devise the residue be the only means of disposing of the residue, and that be a trust, or duty, it has by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>events preceding the death of the testatrix, become fixed in favor of her only living brother, Henry: Graef <em>v. </em>De Turk, 8 Wright 527; Horwitz <em>v. </em>Norris, 13 Id. 213; Brown <em>v. </em>Higgs, 4 Vesey 708; Hawkins on Wills 62.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A7ch\">March 1st 1869,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered,</p>\n<p id=\"ABRP\">by</p>\n<author id=\"b510-7\">Agnew, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AtF\">It is not necessary we should determine the rather difficult question, what ultimate interest in the estate of Sarah L. Keene the appellant might take under her will. It is sufficient to say, he has no present interest, immediate or remote, that will enable him to maintain his petition for an account and settlement of the estate. His interest is so entirely contingent and uncertain, it may never have an actual existence. It is a hare possibility, dependent on the death of Ellen K. Mitchell without issue, and even after that comes a question of survivorship between Henry and James, to he decided before any part can reach the children of James Keene, now deceased, of whom the petitioner is one. The 1st article of the 57th section of the Act of 29th March 1832 provides that the proceeding to compel appearance, to answer in the Orphans\u2019 Court, shall be on the petition of any person <em>interested,, </em>whether such interest be immediate or <em>remote. </em>The legislature, in using the term remote, certainly did not mean a mere possible interest so contingent and uncertain it may never' happen. If those who have existing interests, immediate or remote in the time of enjoyment, but which must <em>certainly </em>fall into possession at some time, do not call the executor or trustee to account, or if there he none such, it does not seem to he necessary to the due administration of justice, that one having no interest should maintain a suit that may never result in any benefit to himself. Though this point has not been expressly decided, \u25a0we find analogies that support the conclusion. Thus, an heir at law cannot, during the lifetime of his ancestor, maintain a bill of ' discovery of facts or deeds necessary to the title of the estate, on the ground that he has no title whatever, but only a future or prospective interest: Snell\u2019s Principles of Equity 486. A bill to perpetuate testimony will not lie in favor of a remainder-man against tenant in tail, who can bar the remainder: Id. 491. And in Okeson\u2019s Appeal, 2 Grant 303, it was held, that a claimant of a legacy presumed to be paid by lapse of time, was not entitled to cite executors into court to answer his claim. For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed at the cost of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
