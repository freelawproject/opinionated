Reiff and John H. Umstead, executors, &amp;c. The widow died on the 15th of June 1868, and the surviving executors had on hand \u00a77000, which they were prepared to pay over to the persons legally entitled under the will, but they were willing to pay to the petitioners only the interest of the one-seventh part of said fund; whereas the petitioners claimed that they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>entitled, each, of them, to the one-seventh part of the said fund of $7000, absolutely under the will of the said testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-6\">The petitioners prayed for a citation to the executors, and a decree that they should pay to each of them absolutely one-seventh part of the fund in their hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-7\">Jacob P.

But for the word <em>trust </em>there could be no doubt that they .must give security: Act of February 24th 1834, \u00a7 49, Pamph. L. 82., Purd. 303, pi. 184; Olevenstine\u2019s Appeal, 3 Harris 495; Duval\u2019s Appeal, 2 Wright 12 O.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b363-11\">D. <em>S. Mulvany, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"At7i\">The first part of the will makes an absolute gift; another clause places all the children on the same footing. To make all harmonize, the estate in the first takers must vest absolutely: Billing <em>v. </em>Billing, 5 Simon 232; Harrison <em>v. </em>Foreman, 5 Ves. 207; Cambridge <em>v. </em>Rous, 8 Id. 13; Hinckley <em>v. </em>Simons, 4 Id. 161; 1 Roper on Leg. 609.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A6D\">February 1st 1869,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b363-12\">The opinion of the court was delivered,</p>\n<p id=\"AZh0\">by</p>\n<author id=\"b363-13\">Sharswood, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Az7\">It is beyond any question that the petitioners took under the will of their father, after the death of the widow, express estates for life. What is contended to be in the first part of the will an absolute bequest, <em>\u201c </em>all my estate of whatsoever kind the same may be, I give, devise, and bequeath unto my seven children in equal shares,\u201d is qualified by the words which immediately succeed \u201cin manner following, to wit:\u201d and that is as to the shares of the sons \u201c to hold to them respectively, their heirs and assigns forever,\u201d but as to the shares of the daughters, they \u201c shall be held by them respectively * * * * for and during the term of their natural lives respectively\u201d with remainders to their children. There is another clause in the subsequent part of the will which is supposed to contradict this, and place all the children upon an equal footing. It is that in which he authorizes his executors before the death of his wife at her request, to divide so much of his personal estate consisting of bonds, mortgages, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>other securities as she might designate among all his children, \u201c so that each of them shall have an equal share of the same, and upon such division, the share of each of my said children shall be held by them respectively, their heirs and assignsbut this clause is immediately followed by a proviso, which limits the shares of the daughters according as he had before directed: \u201c Provided, however, that the shares thus coming to my said daughters shall be held by them in trust for the same term and under the same powers, provisions and limitations as are before mentioned, of and concerning their respective shares of my estate.\u201d Construing the whole will together there is no inconsistency in it. There is no absolute gift to the daughters in any part.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Nor do the words \u201c in trust\u201d vary the construction. For this, Clevenstine\u2019s Appeal, 3 Harris 495, is a direct authority. The testator did not intend to make his daughters trustees for themselves, and for their children after their death. Th'e words were introduced here as in the case cited under some vague idea that they were necessary. It was at one time the received opinion that a gift or bequest for the separate use of a married woman was not lawful without the interposition of trustees, but that opinion has been long since exploded: Hill on Trustees 420. Indeed, since the Act of April 11th 1848, \u201c to secure the right of married women\u201d (Pamph. L. 536), all property which may be owned by a married woman at the time of her marriage or which shall accrue to her afterwards, \u201c shall be owned, used and enjoyed by such married woman as her own separate property.\u201d The testator therefore in providing that the shares of his daughters \u201c shall be held by them respectively in trust to take and receive the income and interest thereof, and to appropriate the same respectively to their own use each and every year for their own sole and separate use whether covert or sole,\u201d did nothing which the law would not have done without any such provision, except as to their power of disposition under the ruling of The Pennsylvania Company <em>v. </em>Foster, 11 Casey 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The existence of a trust in the tenant for life for the remaindermen was not considered in Clevenstine\u2019s Appeal, to take the case out of the purview of the forty-ninth section of the Act of February 24th 1834 (Pamph. L. 83), which enacts that \u201cwhenever personal property is bequeathed to any person for life or for a term of years or for any other limited period or upon a condition or contingency, the executor of such will shall not be compelled to pay or deliver the property so bequeathed to the person so entitled, until security be given in the Orphans\u2019 Court, having jurisdiction of his accounts in such sum and form as in the judgment of such court shall sufficiently secure the interest of the person entitled in remainder whenever the same shall accrue or vest in possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Decree reversed at the cost of the appellees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
