Both Joseph and William died intestate, unmarried and without issue, William having died first. His sister Sarah Karker granted all her share in his estate to her grandson. When J.oseph died the grantee under this deed claimed that Joseph\u2019s estate was only an estate tail, that William had a vested remainder in Joseph\u2019s share, and that Sarah Karker\u2019s deed had not only passed her share in William\u2019s estate, but a part of <em>Joseph's </em>share.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-7\">In opposition to this it was claimed that Joseph took an absolute fee, .and that WillianT(having died before Joseph) never had an interest in Joseph\u2019s share.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-8\">The question therefore was, whether the words above quoted gave Joseph a fee simple or a fee tail.

The testator died on or about February 1st 1802, leaving surviving his widow and six children. After making various provisions in his will for his family, which it is unnecessary to recite, he gives in the 14th item thereof unto his son Joseph Rex two tracts of land particularly described, <em>\u2018 </em>to hold to him, his heirs and assigns for ever, subject only to the delivery of one-half of the fire-wood, and alsa one equal half part of the expense of keeping a cow for his said wife during her natural life, and except the water which may be spared willed unto his said son William.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-12\">\u201c The next item bequeaths all the residue of the personalty to his sons William and Joseph Rex, their heirs and assigns for ever. Had the will stopped at this point, the family would have been spared much litigation, and the court considerable difficulty. The devisee, Joseph Rex, was, however, at that time in \u2018 a declining state of health;\u2019 and, anxious to provide for the very probable contingency of his death before the decease of the testator, or at all events before the decease of the brother William, the testator added the clause which has given rise to conflicting claims before the auditor, and to learned and exhaustive arguments before the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-13\">\u201c The paragraph alluded to is in these words: <em>\u2018 </em>Item: <em>In ease </em>my said son Joseph, who is NOW in a declining state of health, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>shall happen to <em>dye </em>intestate, and without issue, then, and in that case, I give, bequeath and devise the estate, real and personal, willed, bequeathed and devised unto him, to my son the said William Rex, and to his heirs and assigns for ever, subject to the payment of 1501. to each of my other sons, the said Jacob and John Rex, or to their respective heirs and assigns.\u2019 The will then concluded with a clause appointing William and Jacob Rex executors, and revoking all former wills.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-6\">\u201c The uncertainty of man\u2019s expectations was well illustrated, by the results in this ease. The son, whose early death was thus anticipated and provided for by the father, survived not only the testator, but his brother William. The father, as already stated, died in 1802, William Rex died in the year 1845, and Joseph Rex survived until the year 1859. As both of these sons died intestate, unmarried and without issue, it might have been that the heirs of one being the heirs of the other devisee, there would still have been no room for disputation. It seems, however, that shortly after the death of William Rex, his sister Sarah Rhoner, theretofore Sarah Karker (named in the will of her father Sarah Carager), by deed dated April 23d 1845, in consideration of natural love, of past support, and of $1, conveyed to her grandson, Jacob Karker, and his heirs, \u2018 all her interest in and to the estate of her late brother, William Rex, deceased.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-7\">\u201c If this grantee can therefore successfully maintain his position that this deed passed not only the estate of William in his own right, but also in what is here called the remainder of Joseph\u2019s estate, or if, in other words, William died seised of a vested remainder in Joseph\u2019s estate, which passed to his sister Sarah amongst his other heirs, then this deed sweeps to the grandson all Sarah\u2019s distributive share, to the utter exclusion of her other descendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-8\">\u201c To accomplish this result it is of course necessary for Mr. Karker to demonstrate that upon the death of the testator, John Rex\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-9\">\u201c 1st. Some interest in Joseph\u2019s share instantly vested in William.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-10\">\u201c 2d. That this interest in Joseph\u2019s share was an estate not liable to be defeated by Joseph\u2019s survivorship.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-11\">\u201c If he can succeed in establishing these propositions, then it follows that instantly upon the death of John Rex, tho foot of William was planted upon his brother Joseph\u2019s share, and that, although he died before Joseph, his heirs stood in his shoes; that Sarah Karker, as one of those heirs, was thereupon in like manner seised of an estate in Joseph\u2019s share which by her deed passed to her grandson, to the present exclusion of his own father, and all who would but for that deed inherit Joseph\u2019s share as the descendants of his sister Sarah.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>\u201c This statement of the relative positions of these different claimants brings us to the words of the will which is to decide between them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-6\">\u201cAnd here it should be remarked that none of the numerous cases with which the books abound can be declared to be an unerring guide to the true construction of this will. Like all other such instruments, it must, subject to the general rules upon this subject, be its own interpreter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-7\">\u201c Mr. Redfield has well expressed this thought in his valuable treatise on Wills, p. 423. He says: \u2018 Precedents ought never to be allowed an arbitrary and unbending control of any case not precisely analogous \u2014 we might say not strictly identical. * * * We ought never to forget that mere analogies never rise above the character of assistants. We should not, therefore, allow ourselves to become slaves to them.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-8\">\u201c The same writer has also wisely told us that \u2018 There is in the majority of cases an opportunity to adapt general rules of construction to the <em>particular circumstances </em>of each case as it arises. And when it is not found practicable to bring the cause to that result which the particular facts and circumstances seem to indicate as the most conformable to reason and justice, it is always to be feared that the comprehension and wisdom of the court fell short of the emergeney in which they were placed.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-9\">\u201c To the same effect is the syllabus of Passmore <em>v. </em>Huggins, 25 Law J. Rep. N. S. Ch. 251, 21 Beav. 103. \u2018 In.the construction of wills the court will consider the intention of the testator, the state of the parties provided for, and to remove inconsistencies,\u2019 will change a word. Our Supreme Court have enunciated the same principle in Rewalt <em>v. </em>Ulrich, 11 Harris 388.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-10\">\u201c In construing this will, let us look to the intention of the testator as illustrated by the state of the parties provided for, in order, as Mr. Redfield says, \u2018 to bring the cause to that result which the particular facts and circumstances seem to indicate as the most conformable to reason and justice.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-11\">\u201c The will is here our only directory. It tells us that the testator remembered well, and, as far as we can judge, impartially, his wife and all his children. He does not appoint Joseph one of his executors, refers to him as then \u2018 in a declining state of health,\u2019 and declares that \u2018 in case Joseph shall happen to die intestate and without issue, then and in that <em>case </em>the testator bequeaths and devises all the real AND PERSONAL estate devised unto him, to William Rex\u2019 in fee, subject to the payment of 150?. each, \u2018to Jacob and John Rex.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-12\">\u201c It is clear, therefore, that the father thought his son Joseph might soon die. He does not say, that in the event of that death, all the estate bequeathed to Joseph shall pass to or belong to William; but seeming to regard it as probable that Joseph might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>die before the testator, and desirous of being spared in such a contingency the trouble of drawing a new will, he uses the peculiar form of expression \u2018 <em>they, and in that ease I give\u2019 </em>the estate to William which I have heretofore devised to Joseph, and I direct William, whose share is thus increased, to pay 150i. to each of his brothers Jacob and John, in order, as we read the will, to readjust the division of the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-6\">\u201c Does this mean that Joseph was to have but an estate tail, which without fine, recovery or bar, would be but a poor life estate to him ? To give the will this construction we must strike out the words \u2018 <em>heirs and assigns for ever\u2019 </em>which have always been descriptive of a fee simple, and the word \u2018 <em>intestate\u2019 </em>which clearly recognised the already bestowed power of devising, and which is at utter war with the existence of an estate tail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-7\">\u201c Now, although it is very true that by numerous decisions in Pennsylvania the words \u2018 shall happen to die without issue\u2019 have been construed to mean an indefinite failure of issue, and hence to cut down a fee simple to a fee tail, yet in no case that I have been able to find has this decision been applied to instruments expressly or impliedly conferring the power to devise. And this for the very simple reason that no court could call a man tenant <em>in tail </em>who had the power to devise a fee simple.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-8\">\u201cA brief examination of the Pennsylvania authorities on this point will illustrate this position.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-9\">\u201cIn Clark <em>v. </em>Baker, 3 S. &amp; R. 470 (1817), Theodoras Lord devised his plantation to his daughter and granddaughter, \u2018to hold to them and the survivor and their lawful issue for ever.\u2019 Then followed a cross-remainder to the survivor in default of lawful issue of the deceased, and if \u2018 both should die without leaving lawful issue, then remainder to Daniel Williams.\u2019 This was held to give the daughter and granddaughter estates tail. It will be observed that there was no power of devise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-10\">\u201c It is true there was a power of sale, but C. J. Tilghman did not regard this as inconsistent with the estate tail, for he quotes from the will to show that this authority really gave no right to dispose of the corpus of the estate, as \u2018 the principal had to be locked up for the benefit of the daughter and granddaughter and their issue indefinitely.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-11\">\u201c In G-ause <em>v. </em>Wiley, 4 S. &amp; R. 509 (1818), there was a devise to the testator\u2019s daughters, and if either of them should \u2018 die without issue, then the inheritances to descend to the next elder.\u2019 This was in connection with the w'hole will construed to be an estate tail, but in no clause of the instrument was there an express or impljed power of devising.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-12\">\u201c The same remark is applicable to Eichelberger <em>v. </em>Barnetz, 17 S. &amp; R. 293 (1828), where the limitation was in these words, \u2018if my grandson Abraham should die without issue, the part, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>willed to him, is to fall to my heirs hack, to be divided amongst my children.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-6\">\u201c In Caskey <em>v. </em>Brewer, in the same volume, p. 441, the clause cutting down the fee simple reads, \u2018 if either of my said daughters should die without issue, then the share of said daughter shall vest in the other daughters,\u2019 &amp;c.; but here again was no grant or recognition of a power to devise the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-7\">\u201c The other cases I have examined are Heffner <em>v. </em>Knepper, 6 Watts 18 (1837); Eichelberger <em>v. </em>Barnitz, 9 Id. 447 (1840); Langley <em>v. </em>Heald, 7 W. &amp; S. 96 (1844); Vaughan <em>v. </em>Dickes, 8 Harris 609 (1853); Pierce <em>v. </em>Hakes, 11 Id. 231 (1854); Braden <em>v. </em>Cannon, 1 Grant 60 (1854); Ivins <em>v. </em>Scott, 2 Casey 215 (1856); Price <em>v. </em>Taylor, 4 Id. 96 (1857); Rancel <em>v. </em>Cresswell, 6 Id. 158 (1858); Criley <em>v. </em>Chamberlain, Id. 161 (1858); Doyle <em>v. </em>Mullady, 9 Id. 264 (1859); Kay <em>v. </em>Scates, 1 Wright 31 (1860); Wynn <em>v. </em>Story, 2 Id. 166 (1861); Barnet <em>v. </em>Deturk, 7 Id. 92 (1862); and Hagerty <em>v. </em>Albright, 2 P. F. Smith 274 (1866).,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-8\">\u201c Without encumbering this opinion with extracts from the wills construed in each of those cases, it is sufficient to say that in no one of them is there an express or implied power of general devise in the first taker.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-9\">\u201c In Doyle <em>v. </em>Mullady, 9 Casey 264, and Wynn <em>v. </em>Story, 2 Wright 166, there was an attempted restriction on the power of disposition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-10\">\u201c In Barnet <em>v. </em>Deturk, 7 Wright 92, there was a proviso to the limitation over that if the son \u2018 should sell the aforesaid property he may grant and assign it as he likes.\u2019 A sale was made by the devisee though for a nominal consideration, and his grantee immediately reconveyed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-11\">\u201c In a very able opinion by Woodward, P. J., this exercise of the power was held to divest the estate limited to the plaintiffs, and the Supreme Court, in a learned review of the law by Read, J., affirmed the judgment, declining, however, <em>\u2018to </em>examine into the exact nature of the estate that would have been vested\u2019 in the first taker if he had not made the conveyance referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-12\">\u201cKay <em>v. </em>Scates, 1 Wright 31, may be regarded as overruled by Barnet\u2019s Appeal, 10 Id. 392, and Shailkland\u2019s Appeal, 11 Id. 113, so far as it affirmed Kuhn <em>v. </em>Newman. With reference, however, to the point now before us for decision, Kay <em>v. </em>Scates is untouched by any later authority, and it has been therefore examined in connection with its kindred cases, which rule that the expression \u2018leaving no issue\u2019 indicates an indefinite failure of issue, and therefore reduces the fee simple to a fee tail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-13\">\u201c In Kay <em>v. </em>Scates there was a power of appointment, limited, however, \u2018 to the issue\u2019 of the first takers, and that case is therefore no exception to the remark, already made, that no one of the testaments referred to in the decisions which favor Jacob Karker\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>construction of this will contained a word which expressly or impliedly gave to the first taker the right of devising the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-6\">\u201c Let us then see whether the will of John Rex gave the power of- devising to Joseph Rex, and if it did, let us next inquire whether this distinction between it and the other cases referred to is or is not of importance in determining the true construction of the clause now in dispute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-7\">\u201c The will says: \u2018 In case my said son Joseph, who is now in a declining state of health, shall happen to <em>dye </em>intestate and without issue, then and in that case\u2019 the real and personal estate is devised to William Rex, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-8\">\u201c It is therefore too clear to need argument that William could take nothing of Joseph\u2019s share unless Joseph died intestate and without issue. If Joseph left a will, the estate would of course pass to his devisees, and this must be regarded as a clear recognition of his right to devise the estate given to him in the preceding sentences. What then is the estate over which a man has the absolute power of general, uncontrolled, unlimited devise ? Who can, with any regard to technical propriety, call such an estate a fee tail ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-9\">\u201c Upon this point the case of Church <em>v. </em>Disbrow, 2 P. F. Smith 219, must be regarded'as conclusive,'not only because it is the last decision, but because the industry of the learned judge who delivered the opinion, and of the able counsel who argued the cause, have supplied us with perhaps every citation touching the question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-10\">\u201cWoodward, C. J., says: \u2018A devise of an estate generally or indefinitely, with a power of disposition over it, carries a fee.\u2019 It will be observed that there the devisee was only to hold the estate \u2018during her lifetime,\u2019 but she was also \u2018to dispose of the same as should seem best to her,\u2019 with a strong expression of the testator\u2019s wish that the devisee should leave the property for the benefit of a certain charity. She died without having made any deed or will; but our District Court and the Supreme Court ruled that she had taken a fee simple, and that the land descended 'to her heir at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-11\">\u201cHere, then, in John Rex\u2019s will we find a fee simple in Joseph, with an express recognition of an uncontrolled power of devise. What shall happen in case of Joseph\u2019s intestacy, he 'being absolute owner, is for the law to declare. The testator could not say that although Joseph had the fee and the power to will, yet, if he died intestate, the law should not take its course. This has been attempted, but the effort has been frustrated by the courts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-12\">The case of Gulliver <em>v. </em>Vaux was an ejectment which raised the question of the proper construction of the will of Thomas Turney. It was decided in 1746, but, so far as I can ascertain, was not reported for upwards of a century after the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>had been entered. In the argument of Holmes <em>v. </em>Godson, 8 De Gex, McN. &amp; G. Rep. 156 (1856), Mr. Lee, as <em>amicus curice, </em>referred the court to this case, and the reporters deemed it of sufficient importance to extract it from Mr. Justice Burnett\u2019s MSS., and to publish it at p. 167, following the report of Holmes <em>v. </em>Godson. The language in Turney\u2019s will is almost identical with the words we have been considering. He says, \u00a3 in case it shall so happen that all my three children shall depart this life without leaving issue, &amp;c., and <em>without appointing the disposal of the same, then and in such case, </em>I give,\u2019 &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-6\">\u201c The arguments there were directed to the same points as those discussed at our bar.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-7\"><em>\u201c </em>On the one side it was contended that the first takers had but an estate tail, and that the words referring to the appointing power might mean <em>\u2018 </em>not having disposed thereof by fine or recovery.\u2019 It was also urged, that at all events it was good as an executory devise. The defendant\u2019s counsel contended that it could not be a remainder, because it came after a fee, and that as an executory devise it was too remote.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-8\"><em>\u201c </em>Willes, L. C. J., was of opinion that the bequest was not good as a remainder, but that it would hold as an executory devise. In which opinion Abney, J., concurred, but Burnett, J., differed from his brethren upon ground not taken in the argument, to wit, that this was \u2018a condition or contingency repugnant to the estate devised, and must be void;\u2019 which he illustrated and supported by a number of authorities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-9\">\u201c The advantages of a minority were well asserted in this case, for the note-book adds, \u2018 Afterwards, upon conference between us, Willes, L. C. J., and Abney, J., changed their opinions, and Willes, L. C. J, delivered the resolution of the court agreeable to my opinion.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-10\">\u201c Holmes <em>v. </em>Godson, 8 De Gex, McN. &amp; G. 153, arose upon the will of Rev. Thomas Yates Ridley. He devised certain real and personal estate to his son, to vest upon attaining twenty-one years of age, with a limitation over, \u00a3 in case my dear son shall not live to attain the age of twenty-one years, or having attained the age of twenty-one years, shall not have made a will.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-11\">. \u00a3\u00a3 Lord Justice Knight Bruce, after referring to the cases cited, \u00a3 not less than twelve,\u2019 decided that the words \u00a3 or having attained the age of twenty-one years, shall not have made a will,\u2019 were of no force, and the son having attained his majority, it was held that the estate had vested in him, and did not divest by his subsequent death intestate. This opinion was concurred in by Lord Justice Turner, and the gift over was declared repugnant and void.\u2019 The will of Henry Naglee was twice before our Supreme Court in Williams <em>v. </em>Leech, 4 Casey 89, and Naglee\u2019s Appeal, 9 Id. 89. There after a devise in fee, came a clause restraining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>the power of alienation, reducing the fee to a life estate, and declaring that after the death of the first taker the property should he equally divided among the children. Yet it was decided that none of these clauses touched the fee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-6\">\u201c\u2022To the same effect are Reifsnyder <em>v. </em>Hunter, 7 Harris 41, and Walker <em>v. </em>Vincent, Id. 369. Mary Biddle\u2019s Estate, 4 Casey 60, although decided upon a point which will he noticed hereafter, distinctly recognised the principle of the law which disregards limitations over inconsistent with the fee of the first taker. It will also he observed that the power in Joseph of making a will is fatal to the executory devise, if such it is to be called, in favor of William: Vide Jackson <em>v. </em>Robbins, 16 Johns. Rep. 585. The two are pronounced by all the authorities as \u2018 perfectly incompatible and repugnant to each other, <em>and the latter is to he rejected as void.\u2019</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-7\">\u201c It may be answered to all this that the word \u2018 intestate,\u2019 in recognising a power to devise, confers no greater estate than had been previously given by the words <em>\u2018 </em>heirs and assigns for ever;\u2019 that they clearly give an estate in fee simple; and that as every tenant in fee can devise, the word \u2018 <em>intestate,\u2019 </em>upon which so much stress has been laid, is after all but mere surplusage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-8\">\u201cBut the moment the objector advances this argument, he moves into check. For it should not be lost sight of in this discussion that Mr. Karker can only recover by cutting down the fee simple in Joseph to a fee tail. When, therefore, he answers that the word \u2018 intestate\u2019 is surplusage as applied to a fee simple, he instantly destroys his whole case. If, therefore, the issue'here is between a fee simple and a fee tail, the word \u2018 intestate\u2019 gives its fiat to the discussion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-9\">\u201cIt would seem, therefore, that the same word distinguishes this from the other limitations over in our books, and that the subsequent attempt of the testator to make a new law of intestacy has not been favored by the courts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-10\">\u201c There is another expression in this devise which should not be lost sight of. The testator says, <em>\u2018 In case\u2019 </em>his son \u2018 who is now in a declining state of health shall happen to <em>dye\u2019</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-11\">\u201cWas he thinking, as he published these words, of a death which might overtake Joseph fifty-eight years thereafter? He must have known that properties in the neighborhood of large cities increase greatly in value with the efflux of time. He could not foresee the rise which has taken place in the values of half a century past, but he may fairly be presumed to have had the usual understanding possessed by men of the most ordinary intelligence upon such a subject. In the light of that reflection can it be supposed as within the range of possibility that this testator intended 300i. as the sum which should at any period of time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>however remote, equalize the devise over to William of a double share of the estate ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-6\">\u201c Let us turn from conjecture to the definition which the law has applied to the words before us.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-7\">\u00a3\u00a3 Where personal estate is given to a person indefinitely or absolutely, <em>\u2018 </em>and in case of his death\u2019 to another, this disposition, though apparently constituting a gift of a life interest with a <em>quasi </em>remainder, * * is, in the absence of all indications of a contrary intent, construed to amount to an hypothetical limitation of the absolute interest, to take effect <em>in the event of the person named as first taher surviving the testator, </em>with 'an alternative limitation over, to take effect in case of the death of the first taker in the lifetime of the testator, &amp;c. : Smith on Executory Devises [338-9].</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-8\">\u00a3\u00a3 And again, \u00a3 even where the gift over is not simply on the event of death,\u2019 but without issue, &amp;c., the death will be construed not to mean a death generally, at some time or other, but in the testator\u2019s lifetime, &amp;c.: Id.

Judge Burnside, in an opinion of three lines, decided against the limitation over. It was ar\u2019gued before the court in banc as here, that the expression \u00a3 in case of the death,\u2019 meant \u00a3 death <em>generally </em>or <em>whenever </em>it might happen ;\u2019 but Bell, J., in delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court, says : \u00a3 l am satisfied, * * upon the authority of all the cases, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>by this phrase the testator did <em>not </em>mean death generally, but in the contingent sense of death occurring within a particular time,\u2019 &amp;c. Lie then reviews the English cases and quotes at length from Powell on Devises, ch. 37. The sum of all the authorities there cited, when applied to the case now before us, requires us to rule that John Rex \u2018 referred <em>to the death of his devisee in the lifetime of the testator.\u2019 </em>The case of Caldwell <em>v. </em>Shilton was followed by the decision in Mary Biddle\u2019s Estate, 4 Casey 60, in rvhich, after a devise in fee embracing both realty and personalty, the testatrix added limitations over \u2018in the event of her daughter\u2019s death without children.\u2019 This court ruled that the devisee took but an estate for life, but the Supreme Court reversed, and decreed the estate to the devisee <em>in her absolute right. </em>Lowrie, J., says: \u2018 The subsequent dispositions were intended to take effect if Anne should die before her mother.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-6\">\u201c The next year Vice-Chancellor Wood decided the same way in Schenck <em>v. </em>Agnew, 4 Kay &amp; Johnson\u2019s Ch. Rep. 405. In that case, after a bequest in fee, the testator added, <em>\u2018 </em>and in the event of her death then to her youngest surviving son.\u2019 The old argument was repeated that this meant \u2018 death generally,\u2019 but the Vice-Chancellor said: <em>\u2018 </em>He had looked into the authorities, and had come to the conclusion that * * the plaintiff was entitled * * absolutely; the gift to her youngest son being a substantial gift intended to take effect <em>in the lifetime of the testator.\u2019 </em>He added that there was but one case, Lord Douglass <em>v. </em>Chalmer, which appeared at all to stand in the way, but of that case he signify cantly said that <em>it appeared never to be cited except for the purpose of being distinguished.\u2019 </em>Hagerty <em>v. </em>Albright, 2 P.

And if it should be answered that this is all mere technicality and refinement, may it not be fairly replied that Mr. Karker\u2019s claim is itself founded upon the subtlest of all reasoning, for he would introduce here a jargon of limitations over, indefinite failures of issue and fees tail, of which this good testator had probably never heard or even dreamed, and the slightest intimation of which would have driven him to a cold intestacy.

This makes it unnecessary to enter into a detailed examination of the numerous authorities cited by the counsel on both sides. John Rex, by his will, devised two tracts of land to his son, Joseph Rex, his heirs and assigns for ever, which was followed by this clause: \u201c Item. All the rest and residue of my personal property, of every description, not hereinbefore willed and bequeathed, I give and bequeath unto my sons, William and Joseph Rex, share and share alike, and to their heirs and assigns for ever.\u201d The estates thus given to Joseph Rex were absolute and unqualified, and both species of property are placed on the same footing. Then comes the clause which occasions the present dispute: \u201cItem. In case my said son Joseph, who is now in a declining state of health, shall happen <em>to dye intestate </em>and without issue, then, and in that case, I give, bequeath and devise the estate, real and personal, willed, bequeathed and devised unto him, to my son, the said William Rex, and to his heirs and assigns for ever, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>subject to the payment of one hundred and fifty pounds to each of my other sons, the said Jacob and John Rex, or to their respective heirs and assigns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The testator died in 1802. William Rex died in March 1845. Joseph Rex remained in possession of the land devised to him until his death in 1859. Both brothers died intestate, unmarried and without issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">It is unnecessary to consider whether the language used indicated a definite failure of issue, either in the lifetime of the testator or of William, because the words \u201c <em>shall happen to die </em>intestate\u201d negative entirely the idea that the clause gives only an estate tail to Joseph, with remainder to William. There is first an unqualified gift or devise in fee simple, and then a condition entirely repugnant to this estate upon which this is to go over to William. The result of the authorities is succinctly stated by Jarman on Wills, vol. 2, p. 15, thus: \u201cA power of alienation is necessarily and inseparably incidental to an estate in fee. If, therefore, lands be devised to A. and his heirs upon condition that he shall not alien or charge them with any annuity, the condition is void. And in like manner, a condition or conditional limitation annexed to a devise in foe, purporting to give the property over- in case the devisee shall die intestate, or shall not part with the property in his lifetime, is repugnant and void; since, in the first case, it would not only defeat the rule of law, which says that upon the death intestate of an owner in fee simple, his property shall go to his heirs at law, but also deprive him of the power of alienation by act <em>inter vivos, </em>and in the second case it would take away the testamentary power from an owner in fee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">And the same author, in the same volume, page 19, says, \u201cIt is clear, therefore, that if a legacy were given to a person, his executors, administrators and assigns, an injunction not to dispose of it, though followed by a limitation over in case of non-compliance, the restriction would be void, and a gift over, in case of the legatee dying without making any disposition, would he also rejected as a qualification repugnant to the preceding absolute gift.\u201d The same doctrine is stated by Justice Williams, in the second volume of his treatise on \u201c The Law of Executors and Administrators,\u201d p. 176. The principles thus stated are supported by all the English and American cases cited in the argument, to which may be added Annin\u2019s Executors <em>v. </em>Vandoren\u2019s Administrator, 1 McCarter Ch. R. (N. J.) p. 135, decided by Chancellor Green.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Agreeing therefore with the court below, the decree is affirmed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
