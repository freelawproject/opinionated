Murray testified for the plaintiff that witness had been informed by Lyday that he desired to borrow $2500, and would give two good endorsers; that the plaintiff informed witness that he wished to lend that sum, and witness told plaintiff of his conversation with Lyday, and that J. H. Lyday and the defendant would be endorsers, who, the plaintiff said would be satisfactory.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-19\">W. G. Lyday gave witness the note endorsed by J. H. Lyday and defendant; witness gave the note so endorsed to plaintiff, and received $2500 from him, which he paid to W. H. Lyday. On the 1st of May 1866 witness and plaintiff went to the Second National Bank, and plaintiff told the cashier he wished to leave the note for collection; the cashier directed him to put his name both above and below the names of the other endorsers, which he did. C. H. Riggs the cashier testified, that the waiver of protest was endorsed the day the note fell due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-20\">W. G. Lyday testified, that when he got the endorsement he told the defendant nothing, but that he was getting money from the plaintiff; he told him his brother was a surety, and asked defendant for his name also; defendant did not object; the endorsement of defendant, his brother, was for his own accommodation ; he told the defendant that the money was for himself; the defendant afterwards endorsed the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-21\">The plaintiff having closed his evidence, the court (Stowe,\u2019 J.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>on motion of the defendant directed a nonsuit, which the court in banc refused to set aside.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-6\">The plaintiff took a writ of error, and assigned for error the entering of the judgment of nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b37-7\"><em>M. W. Atcheson, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afk\">\u2014 Prior to Jack <em>v. </em>Morrison, 12 Wright 113, it had not been supposed by the profession, that the Act of April 26th 1855 (Frauds), Pamph. L. 308, Purd. 497, pi. 4, would prevent recovering on such an endorsement as in this case: Smith <em>v. </em>Kessler, 8 Wright 142. This legislation was not directed against such contracts of endorsement. Such blank endorsement is sufficient to satisfy the statute. An irregular endorser, as in this case, has been held to be liable: Leech <em>v. </em>Hill, 4 Watts 448; Taylor <em>v. </em>McCune, 1 Jones 460; Kyner <em>v. </em>Shower, 1 Harris 444; Becker <em>v. </em>Levy, 2 Am. Law Reg. 444. The cases of Schollenberger <em>v. </em>Nehf, 4 Casey 189; Fegenbush <em>v. </em>Lang, Id. 193; Barto <em>v. </em>Schmeck, Id. 447; although qualifying this doctrine, affirm the principle of Leech <em>v. </em>Hill. Oral proof may be given that the endorser became absolutely bound: Barclay <em>v. </em>Weaver, 7 Harris 396. Steininger <em>v. </em>Hoch, 3 Wright 263, was on a note since the Act of 1855 : Welford <em>v. </em>Beazley, 1 Wilson 118; Violett <em>v. </em>Patton, 5 Cranch 142; Rey <em>v. </em>Simpson, 22 How. 341. In Ohio where there is a similar statute, under proofs such as are here, the plaintiff could recover: Bright <em>v. </em>Carpenter, 9 Ohio 139 ; Seymour <em>v. </em>Mickey, 15 Id. 515; Ulen <em>v. </em>Kittredge, 7 Mass. 233; Moies <em>v. </em>Bird, 11 Id. 436; Samson <em>v. </em>Thornton, 3 Metc. 275; Tenney <em>v. </em>Prince, 4 Pick. 385; Austin <em>v. </em>Boyd, 24 Id. 64; Perkins <em>v. </em>Catlin, 11 Conn. 213; Pierce <em>v. </em>Irvine, 1 Minn. 369; Story on Prom. Notes, \u00a7 479; 2 Pars, on Notes, pp. 3, 121; Leonard <em>v. </em>Vredenburg, 8 Johns. 29; Nelson <em>v. </em>Dubois, 13 Id. 175; Browne on Frauds 409, 409a. As guarantor, defendant was liable, the principal being out of the state: Boyd <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 12 Casey 355.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b37-8\"><em>Kirhpatrieh 8p Mellon, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMy\">\u2014 Under the Act of 1855 the plaintiff could not recover: Jack <em>v. </em>Morrison, <em>supra; </em>Spils <em>v. </em>Gilmore, 1 Comstock 321; Hall <em>v. </em>Newcomb, 7 Hill 416; Drake <em>v. </em>Marshall, 21 Ind. 433; Wright <em>v. </em>Morse, 9 Gray 337; Schollenberger <em>v. </em>Nehf, <em>supra; </em>Brown on Statute of Frauds, \u00a7 360; Farebrother <em>v. </em>Simmons, 5 B. &amp; Ald. 333; Wright <em>v. </em>Dannah, 2 Camp. 203; Coleman <em>v. </em>Garrigues, 18 Barb. 60.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AF\">May 11th 1869,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b37-9\">The opinion of the court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"A_u\">Sharswood, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANK\">\u2014 This was an action by the payee against the endorser of a promissory note. By the testimony of the maker of the note, it appeared that the defendant was told by him that he was getting money from the plaintiff; that his brother was one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>of his securities; and that he asked him for his name also. That subsequently the defendant called and endorsed the note. This was before it was endorsed by the plaintiff. A few weeks before maturity the plaintiff left it for collection at a bank in Pittsburg; and there, by the direction of the cashier, wrote his name both above and below the name of the defendant. When the note fell due the defendant waived protest. These were all the material facts, and after the evidence was given the learned judge below entered a nonsuit, which was afterwards confirmed by the court in banc. It is admitted that the case was rightly decided, if Jack <em>v. </em>Morrison, 12 Wright 113, is to be considered as law. We have had occasion recently to reconsider that case upon an argument before a full bench, in the ease of Schafer <em>v. </em>The Farmers\u2019 and Mechanics\u2019 National Bank of Easton, 9 P. F. Smith 144, on a writ of error to the Court of Common Pleas of Northampton county, and have come to the unanimous conclusion to reaffirm that decision; and the question ought now, therefore, to be considered as entirely at rest in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
