Her establishment required two houses to he thrown into one. She furnished one room for her parlor, and another for her bed-room. Everything outside of these apartments was used for the purpose of keeping up the school. The furniture of her apartments was appraised at $1345. The remaining articles of furniture used for her boarding scholars were sold for $4500. The clause in her will under which this controversy arose was in these words: \u201c I give and bequeath all my household furniture to my friend Rhoda W. Smith, she paying to my friend Susan A. Noble, of West Chester, if the latter be then living, the sum of $250.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-14\">There was also a residuary clause, as follows: <em>\u201c </em>All the rest, residue and remainder of my property I direct to be converted into money and kept invested by my executors, and the interest thereof to be paid to the said Rhoda W. Smith during her life, and at her decease I will and direct all the capital thereof to be divided among all the grandchildren then living of David Townsend, of West Chester, share and share alike.\u201d The residuary legatee contended before the auditor that under the words \u201c household furniture\u201d Miss Smith could only take such articles of furniture as the testatrix had at the time of her death for her own domestic use and convenience. The residuary legatee therefore claimed the proceeds of the sale of all the beds and furniture for the use of the scholars. The auditor, Isaac Hazlehurst, Esq., decided in favor of the residuary legatee, and Miss Smith excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>There was also an exception to the form of stating the account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-6\">In the court * below the following opinion was delivered by Brewster, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-7\">\u201c The twelve exceptions which have been filed to the report of the auditor in this estate may, for the purposes of this opinion, be arranged under two classes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-8\">\u201c 1st.

We pass then at once to the consideration of the third clause of the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-11\">\u201c The auditor has given the questions here presented a careful and patient investigation. His report has been prepared with great learning and industry, and we have only arrived at a different conclusion from that stated by him after considerable reflection and hesitation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-12\">\u201c The controverted clause of the will is in these words: \u2018 <em>I </em>give and bequeath all my <em>house household </em>furniture to my friend, Rhoda W. Smith, she paying to my friend, Susan A. Noble, of West Chester, if the latter be then living, the sum of $250.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-13\">\u201c It was contended before the auditor by the counsel of Rhoda W. Smith that, by the term \u2018 household furniture\u2019 all the articles of the household which were not consumed in their enjoyment, but which were required for the house, passed to the legatee under this bequest. On the other hand, the counsel for the residuary legatee contended that the expression \u2018household furniture\u2019 should be confined to such goods and furniture as were necessary to the personal comfort and convenience of the testatrix.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A27\">\u201c The following, amongst other facts, are reported to us by the auditor: That William Anna Hoopes died in this city on the 14th day of March 1866, leaving no blood relations nearer than seeond cousins. She commenced keeping a boarding-school in this city in the year 1852. Occupying at first but a part of a house on Walnut street, she was so successful in her business as to be able to rent, at the end of a few years, an entire house in Locust street, and finally to take the adjoining house, into which she cut communicating doors, making one large mansion, where she had during the last year of her life thirty boarders and fifty day scholars. The furniture required for this establishment exceeded in value $6000. She occupied for her own purposes exclusively but two rooms, and the controversy in this case is as to the extent of the word \u2018household,\u2019 the residuary legatee claiming to circumscribe it to the portion of the premises the testatrix occupied for her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>own use, and the exceptant contending that all the furniture, save the articles used in the school, passed to her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-6\">\u201c The auditor has decided in favor of the residuary legatee, and the specific legatee has excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-7\">\u201c It would seem strange to a layman that such a controversy should arise. The words \u2018household furniture\u2019 are not words of art, they find their place in the transactions of every-day life, and, save for the learning which has been expended upon their definition, would seem to be very intelligible even to the most limited comprehension.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-8\">\u201c Without the assistance of a lexicon a school-boy would define a man\u2019s household the place where he holds house \u2014 his home. That which supplies it is its furniture. The home is not confined to the particular bed-room in which the master of the house sleeps; for it may include his rooms for guests and apartments he never enters. So too it may properly embrace a school-room, for he may teach in his parlor, where many physicians and dentists practise their professions. It is difficult, therefore, to understand how the particular use of a portion of a^dwelling makes it any the less part of the household. Suppose this testatrix had taught a class in her own private parlor, could the residuary legatee claim that the chairs and tables therein were any the less household furniture ? Or if the deceased had occupied with her boarders one large dormitory \u2014 as is frequently the case in large establishments \u2014 would the bed in which she slept have passed as \u2018household furniture,\u2019 but all the other beds have gone to the residuary legatee ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-9\">\u201cIt was admitted at the bar that the expression \u2018household furniture\u2019 in her policy of insurance, or her bill of sale, would have included everything in dispute. So too it was conceded that if she had stopped keeping school one day before she died it would have been very difficult for the residuary legatees to maintain their position. And it must also he admitted that if the bequest had been \u2018all my household and school furniture,\u2019 it would have passed not only all the books, desks, &amp;c., called \u2018school furniture,\u2019 but also all the beds and other articles of household furniture used by the scholars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-10\">\u2022 \u201c It will be observed that the word \u2018 house\u2019 appears before the word \u2018household\u2019 \u2014 whether this was a mere repetition, or was introduced by design, was not argued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-11\">\u201c Having said thus much upon the reason and common sense of the case, let us turn to the authorities upon this subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-12\">\u201c The text-books state the principle in a few words. They say: \u2018 Household goods\u2019 will only include things in \u2018 domestic use, and not what a testator has in the wmy of trade:\u2019 Ward on Legacies 217; 1 Roper on Legacies 225. The plain reading of this sentence would, be decisive against the residuary legatees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>for no one would call the furniture of a scholar\u2019s parlor or bedroom goods kept \u2018 in the way of trade\u2019 any more than the schoolmaster would be styled a tradesman. But it is said that the cases cited in the treatises rule this point in favor of the residuary legatees. We have therefore felt it to be our duty to examine them. Franklin <em>v. </em>Countess of Burlington, 2 Vern. Rep. 511 (1705), was a bequest by the Earl of Burlington of \u2018furniture and pictures\u2019 of his three houses. It was held that by these words \u2018the plate\u2019 passed. The general question as to whether \u2018 plate\u2019 will pass by a bequest of household furniture is also discussed by Mr. Raithby in his note to that report, but there is nothing therein approaching the question in this case. The later case in the same volume, Lillcott <em>v. </em>Compton, p. 638, is to the same point, but merits a passing commendation for the brevity with which the reporter gives the whole case in a single line.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-6\">\u201cMasters <em>v. </em>Masters, 1 P. Wms. Rep. 424 (1718), is simply to the point that a devise of all household goods will pass all household goods owned by the testator at the time of his death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-7\">\u201cNicholls <em>v. </em>Osborn, 2 P. Wms. 420, touches the question of plate. Pratt <em>v. </em>Jackson, Id. 302 (1725), is the first of the cases cited which approaches this point. There, by articles of marriage settlement, it was stipulated that the wife should have \u2018 the household goods, or utensils, or household stuff,\u2019 &amp;c., of the husband at the time of his decease. The husband, beside his house in London, furnished an hospital at Gosport for invalids. Lord Chancellor King decreed that the wife was entitled to the personal property at the hospital, but he was reversed in the House of Lords (3 Bro. P. C. 199), the objection to the ruling being that \u2018 household goods\u2019 could not mean beds and sheets \u2018 used at a place where the testator himself <em>never lived, </em>but the furniture was provided and the undertaking carried on by agents and servants.\u2019 In other words, the hospital was not his household.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-8\">\u201c This case is also noted by Mr. Sanders (3 Atk. 62), where he tells us that the goods at the hospital were \u2018 <em>made use of by the government.\u2019 </em>The case of Crichton <em>v. </em>Symes, 3 Atk. 61 (1743), is also foreign to this inquiry. It turned upon the construction of a devise of \u2018 goods wearing apparel\u2019 \u2014 Lord Chancellor Hardwicke supplying the conjunction <em>and, </em>so as to make it read \u2018goods <em>and </em>wearing apparel.\u2019 A rule of construction, which, if applied to this will, might possibly, as already hinted, relieve it of all difficulty by making it read \u2018 all my house <em>and </em>household furniture,\u2019 meaning thereby not only the furniture of the household in the sense of family, but all the <em>furniture in the house.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-9\">\u201cThe case of Le Farrant <em>v. </em>Spencer, 1 Ves. Sr. 97 (1748), was a devise by an East India captain of \u2018 all his household furniture, linen, plate and apparel whatsoever.\u2019 The Lord Chancellor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>directed the case \u00a3to be sent to a master to distinguish what goods he had for his own domestic use, and what <em>for trade or merchandise.\u2019 </em>The circumstances of the case are not reported, but it is to be inferred that some of the testator\u2019s property claimed by the legatees had been kept <em>\u2018for trade or merchandise,\u2019 </em>which can hardly be affirmed in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-6\">\u201cKelly <em>v. </em>Powlett, 2 Amb. 605 (1763), was another decision upon the vexed point of plate passing as furniture, but in their opinion the court say, p. 609, <em>\u2018 </em>household furniture has as general a meaning as possible. It is incapable of a definition. It is capable only of a description. It comprises everything that contributes to the use or convenience of the householder or ornament of the house.\u2019 And further: \u00a3 I do not rely on the circumstance of the plate being in common use; the keeping her chamber and not using the plate would not -be an exemption, nor would any other occasional <em>nonuser. </em>The case where <em>nonuser </em>is an exemption must be like the case of Le Farrant <em>v. </em>Spencer, where the testator bought the plate to trade with.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-7\">\u201c The case of Cole <em>v. </em>Fitzgerald, 1 Simons &amp; Stuart 189 (1823), turned upon a bequest of \u00a3 household furniture and other household effects.\u2019 Yiee-Chancellor Sir John Leach held that this expression embraced \u00a3 all property in the house and <em>on the premises </em>intended for use, consumption or ornament. He accordingly gave to the legatee pistols, models, paintings, an organ, and even the parrot, books, wine and liquors.\u2019 He added, <em>\u2018 </em>If the <em>hay-stach </em>was only for use, it would pass; if <em>for sale, </em>it would not pass.\u2019 Cornewall <em>v. </em>Cornewall, 12 Sim. 303, Gooch <em>v. </em>Gooch, 33 Maine 535, and Bunn <em>v. </em>Winthrop, 1 Johns. Ch. R. 329, apply to legacies, of plate and jewelry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-8\">\u201c Manning <em>v. </em>Purcell, 31 Eng. Law &amp; Eq. R. 452 (1855), was the last case cited. In it, as in Pratt <em>v. </em>Jackson, <em>supra, </em>the testator had furniture in two places, one his household, the other a betting-office miles distant. It was true that he \u00a3 sometimes slept at the tavern,\u2019 but it was in no sense his home. Lord Justice Turner, referring to Lord Hardwicke\u2019s ruling, said, the words <em>\u2018 </em>household furniture\u2019 would only pass what the testator kept for his domestic and personal use. A number of cases are cited by Williams on Executors 1063, in support of the principle which he extracts from the authorities, viz., that by the term <em>\u2018 </em>household goods\u2019 all articles of household <em>\u2018 </em>acquired by a testator for his house, will pass to the legatee.\u2019 The exception as to trade or business is noted. In Carnagy <em>v. </em>Woodcock, 2 Munf. 239, the court applied the expression to \u00a3 everything tending to the comfort and accommodation \u00f3f the householder.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-9\">\u201c In a late English case, Dean <em>v. </em>Gibson, 4 Law Rep. 3 Eq. Cas. 713, the devise was of personal property, but the testatrix <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>added, \u2018 consisting of money and clothes.\u2019 Vice-Chancellor Wood held that this was merely a <em>falsa demonstration </em>and that not only the money and clothes hut <em>all </em>the personal property passed to the legatee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-6\">\u201cWe have thus gone through with the tedious and laborious task imposed upon us by this argument. There seems through this long array of cases to be but little, if any contradiction, and hardly the appearance of conflict. Other cases may perhaps be found upon this point, but if they were multiplied indefinitely, I apprehend that we would have to come back to the common sense of the case at last. Goods, miles away from a testator\u2019s dwelling, are not his household furniture. Goods at his home, under the same roof where he eats, sleeps and lives, are his household effects, unless he keeps them for traffic or merchandise. Then they are in no proper sense for the use of his household. But round his hearthstone he may have a family, large or small, of relatives, friends, guests, scholars, servants, or in the olden time retainers or even soldiers; they are all, in the ordinary acceptation of the word, a part of the household, and all the furniture is household furniture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-7\">\u201c Nor can I understand that the previous life of this testatrix can shed any light upon this question. That she had at the commencement of her professional labors but little of this world\u2019s goods is nothing to the point. That her merit and industry brought\u2014 as they always bring \u2014 success, and enabled her to increase her stock of furniture, takes from it nothing of its character as belonging to her household. Indeed, if such an argument has any place in the cause, we might turn it to the advantage of the specific legatee whose assistance through long years of toil had doubtless contributed its share to the success of this establishment, and thereby earned the gratitude of the employer and principal. But we have only to deal with this will as we find it. We cannot doubt that if this testatrix had made a bill of sale \u2018 of all her household furniture,\u2019 the purchaser would have acquired a title to something beyond the contents of one bed-room and parlor. Nor can we believe that an insurance company which had underwritten <em>\u2018 </em>the household furniture\u2019 in that establishment, would ever have been permitted to escape from paying for a loss upon the plea that their policy only covered the chairs and carpets of two apartments. But it must be admitted that this is all <em>house fumibwre, </em>and as that word appears in the will we cannot strike it out. Standing alone, it would carry the case in favor of this specific legatee, and it certainly loses none of its force by the tautology of the sentence. Interpreting this devise in the light of these practical suggestions, we cannot doubt that this bequest passed all the specific legatee has here claimed, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>exceptions, from the 7th to the 10th, inclusive, are therefore sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-6\">\u201c The other exceptions are dismissed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-7\">An appeal was taken from this, decree to the Supreme Court by Anna T.

That the circumstances of the property and the testator with reference to it may be resorted to to assist the construction, is a principle perfectly well settled: 1 Jarman 363. What, then, is the meaning of the words \u201chousehold furniture?\u201d In that excellent old work, \u201c A Treatise of Equity\u201d (of which Henry Ballow is the reputed author, and which is the text of Fonblanque, so that with the elaborate notes which have been added by later editors, it has at length become, as has been well remarked, \u201c a rivulet of text meandering through a wilderness of notes\u201d), it is said that \u201chousehold stuff is <em>mstrumentum patrisfamilias domestieum et quotidianum:\u201d </em>Book IV., ch. 1, \u00a7 11, p. 103. It proceeds to enumerate \u201c tables, stools, chairs, carpets, hangings, beds, bedding, basins with ewers, candlesticks, all sorts of vessels serving for meat and drink, being of earth, wood, glass, brass or pewter, pots, pans, spits, and such like.\u201d It comprises, as has been said in several cases, everything that contributes to the convenience of the householder or ornament of the house: Kelly <em>v. </em>Powley, Amb. 610; Cole <em>v. </em>Fitzgerald, 1 Sim. &amp; Stu. 189; Carnagy <em>v. </em>Woodcock, 2 Munf. 239. It is contended, however, that the circumstances in this case show that the testatrix used these words in a more restricted sense. These circumstances are, that the testatrix kept a boarding-school; that the greater part of the furniture in question was for the use of the boarders; that they form a very large proportion of her whole fortune, and that a part only of the house in which she lived was furnished for her own use and comfort. Hence it is argued that the bequest should be confined to the articles so used by her. I agree that the furniture of the schoolroom is not household furniture; desks, stools, slates, inkstands, maps, globes, &amp;c., cannot be brought within that category. The fact that the testatrix occupied one of the rooms of the house in which she resided for the purpose of a school would make no difference. But as to the remaining articles it is not easy to see how those employed for the comfort and convenience of boarders can be distinguished from such as are for the use of the members of the family, or of guests entertained withouj; pay. It cannot be pretended that these would not be included; otherwise the words would be narrowed down by construction to articles used personally by the testatrix herself; and for this there is neither reason nor authority. It certainly cannot be affected by the size of the establishment. A poor widow ekes out her livelihood in a small house by taking two or three boarders; would not the furniture of her parlor and kitchen, as well as of her guest-chambers, pass by a bequest of her household stuff? If so, can it make any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>difference that there are fifty or one hundred boarders ? Where is the line to be drawn ? No doubt if a cabinetmaker or upholsterer, or other tradesmen were to make a will in those words, articles in his store or shop answering to the description would not pass, though he might have his residence in the same building. They would be in the way of his trade. So, if the keeper of a hotel lived in a different house the words would admit of a different construction. This is the extent to which the authorities relied on by the appellant go. We concur, therefore, in the conclusion at which the court below arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed, at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
