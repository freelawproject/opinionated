Reiff, son of John Reiff, late of the township of Whitpain, in said county, deceased, was presented, setting forth; as in the petition in the preceding case (Reiff\u2019s Appeal, p. 361), and this additional clause of the will which preceded the clause to his daughters. \u201c To my son Daniel, the one equal seventh part; to my son Jacob, the one equal seventh <em>part; </em>to my son William, the one equal seventh part; to my son Charles, the one equal seventh part, to hold the same to them respectively, their heirs and assigns for ever.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-10\">The prayer was for _ a citation to the executors and a decree that they should pay to the petitioner his legacy absolutely. Jacob P. Reiff, one of the executors, answered, admitting the facts set out in the petition, but was \u201c not willing to pay to the said Charles P. Reiff any part of said money absolutely, being advised that under the provisions of said will he cannot safely do so. Pie therefore declines to make such payment until security shall be given, to be approved by the court, for the payment of the principal to the persons who under the said will would be legally entitled to it in case of the death of the said Charles P. Reiff without issue.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-11\">The court (Chapman), P.

Reiff, one of the sons, presented his petition in the court below, praying the court to make an order on the executors to pay him one-seventh of the fund absolutely. The answer of one of the executors submits that the legacy of the petitioner is by the terms of the will subject to a contingency, and therefore declines to make such payment until security shall be given pursuant to the provision of the Act of Assembly \u201c relating to executors and administrators,\u201d passed February 24th 1834, \u00a7 49 (Pamph. L. 83). The court below made the order as prayed for.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">This case cannot be distinguished from Galland <em>v. </em>Leonard, 1 Swanst. 161. There a testator gave the residue of his personal estate to trustees in trust to place the same out at interest during the life of his wife, and pay her a certain annuity, and upon her death to pay and divide the said trust moneys unto and equally \u25a0between his two daughters. In case-of the death of his daughters or either of them leaving a child or children living in trust for the children, and the testator declared that the children of each should be entitled to the same share his, her or their mother would have taken, if living. The Master of the Rolls, Sir Thomas Plumer, held that the testator intended only to substitute the children for the mother in the event of the decease of the latter during the widow\u2019s life, and that the daughters who survived the widow became absolutely entitled. To the same effect are Da Costa <em>v. </em>Keir, 3 Russell 360, and Home <em>v. </em>Pillans, 2 My. &amp; K. 15. These cases may be considered as establishing this general rule of construction that where there is a bequest of personalty in terms absolute in remainder after a life interest \u2014 with an alternative bequest in case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>of the death of the legatee to children of the legatee or in default of children then over, such contingency will be construed as limited to the period of the life interest, and unless it occur during that period \u2014 the bequest becomes absolute. \u201c The avowed aim of every construction,\u201d says Mr. Roper, \u201cbeing to give effect to the intention of the testator as expressed in or collected from the will, it seems that when a bequest is not immediate but in remainder with an executory limitation in case of the death of the legatee, these expressions will be applied to the period when the remainder takes effect in possession, viz.: the death of the person taking the preceding interest1 Roper on Leg. 409, 1st Am. ed.; 2 Jar-man on Wills 693. It follows that the order made by the court below was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Decree affirmed, and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
