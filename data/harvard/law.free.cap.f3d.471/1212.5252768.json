Haswanee raises two issues. First, he argues that the IJ abused its discretion in denying his motion for a continuance because he had an approved labor certification and an immediately available visa number, and his Form 1-140 petition for an employment-based visa was pending. Second, he argues that the BIA and IJ denied him due process and equal protection of the law in denying his motion to continue while his visa petition was pending. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we grant Haswanee\u2019s petition for review in part, vacate the decision of the BIA, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-15\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-16\">Haswanee, a native citizen of Pakistan, entered the United States on March 23, 1999 as a nonimmigrant visitor for pleasure with authorization to remain until September 21, 1999, which time was extended one year, until September 22, 2000. Haswanee, however, remained in the United States beyond that date, and, on March 6, 2003, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> issued him a notice to appear (\u201cNTA\u201d), charging him with removability under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), (a)(1)(C)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), (a)(1)(C)\u00ae, as an alien who remained in the United States longer than permitted and who failed to comply with the conditions of his nonimmigrant status. The NTA further charged that Haswanee had been employed for wages or other compensation from March 15, 2000 to the time of his NTA without authorization from the INS. On April 25, 2001, Haswanee\u2019s employer filed an application for alien employment certification (\u201clabor certification\u201d) on his behalf, which the United States Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d) certified on February 18, 2004. In addition the DOL instructed that the certification must be attached to the 1-140 petition and filed with the INS. On April 20, 2004, Haswanee\u2019s employer filed an I-140 immigrant petition for alien worker on his behalf. The INS confirmed receipt of Haswanee\u2019s 1-140 on May 5, 2004, and indicated that it generally took 350 to 400 days to process such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>During his hearing before the IJ in his removal proceedings, Haswanee moved to continue his proceedings until the resolution of his 1-140 petition. The IJ denied Haswanee\u2019s motion for a continuance, finding that, unlike a family-based visa petition, no case law existed that required a continuance based upon a pending employment-based visa petition. The IJ further found that Haswanee\u2019s knowing violation of the immigration laws could not be overlooked, \u201cand, as a matter of discretion, the [IJ did] not find that the approved labor certification] [wa]s compelling either to grant a continuance or to grant voluntary departure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">Haswanee appealed the decision to the BIA. The BIA dismissed his appeal, affirming the IJ\u2019s decision to deny the continuance. It noted that Haswanee\u2019s 1-140 visa petition had not been approved as of the date of the BIA\u2019s decision. The BIA further found that Haswanee had not established that he was <em>prima facie </em>eligible for adjustment of status under INA \u00a7 245(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a) because he was not the beneficiary of an approvable visa petition and had been \u201cout of status\u201d for failing to refrain from working unlawfully and to leave the United States by his required date. Citing <em>Zafar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>426 F.3d 1330 (11th Cir.2005), the BIA concluded that the IJ did not abuse its discretion in denying Haswanee\u2019s motion to continue, and, further, that <em>Bull v. INS, </em>790 F.2d 869 (11th Cir.1986) did not apply because Haswanee did not establish his <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">\n<em>II. Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Av9\">\n<em>A. Continuance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-6\">Haswanee argues on appeal that he is eligible to adjust his status pursuant to INA \u00a7 245(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i), but that the IJ\u2019s denial of his request for a continuance and order of removal jeopardizes his eligibility because, if he leaves the United States, he will become ineligible for relief. He contends that the BIA deviated from its own policies and prior unpublished decisions, in which the BIA had granted a continuance in cases where an 1-140 petition was pending. He also asserts that the IJ\u2019s denial was in direct conflict with our decision in <em>Zafar </em>because, according to Haswanee, our reasoning in <em>Zafar </em>is that, where a petitioner has an approved labor certification and there is a visa immediately available, the continuance should be granted. Haswanee further argues that the facts of his case are analogous to those in <em>Bull </em>because petitioners for an 1-140 employment-based visa that are not on a waiting list are akin to petitioners for an 1-130 family-based visa. In his reply brief, he notes that his case is similar to, and should be governed by, our recent decision in <em>Merchant v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1375 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-8\">An IJ has discretion to grant a continuance in an immigration proceeding \u201cfor good cause shown.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29. We have jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s discretionary decision to deny Haswanee\u2019s motion for a continuance for an abuse of discretion. <em>Zafar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1357, 1362 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-9\">An alien that is present in the United States may adjust his status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence pursuant to the requirements in INA \u00a7 245, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255. In the case of an alien lawfully admitted into the United States, such alien may adjust his status \u201cif (1) the alien makes an application for such adjustment, (2) the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence, and (3) an immigrant visa is immediately available to him at the time his application is filed.\u201d INA \u00a7 245(a), 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). However, an alien that overstayed his visa and became illegal is barred from applying for \u00a7 1255(a) adjustment of status. INA \u00a7 245(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-5\">Nevertheless, as an exception to \u00a7 1255(e)\u2019s bar, \u00a7 1255\u00ae states that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-6\">(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (c) of this section, an alien physically present in the United States\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-7\">(A) who\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-8\">(i) entered the United States without inspection; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-9\">(ii) is within one of the classes enumerated in subsection (c) of this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-10\">(B) who is the beneficiary (including a spouse or child of the principal alien, if eligible to receive a visa under section 1153(d) of this title) of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-11\">(i) a petition for classification under section 1154 of this title that was filed with the Attorney General on or before April 30, 2001; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-12\">(ii) an application for a labor certification under section 1182(a)(5)(A) of this title that was filed pursuant to the regulations of the Secretary of Labor on or before such date; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-13\">(C) who, in the case of a beneficiary of a petition for classification, or an application for labor certification, described in subparagraph (B) that was filed after January 14, 1998, is physically present in the United States on December 21, 2000;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-14\">may apply to the Attorney General for the adjustment of his or her status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1231-15\">INA \u00a7 245(i)(l), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(l). Nonetheless, as we explained in <em>Zafar, </em>\u201c[t]he mere filing of a labor certificate application with the DOL does not make an alien <em>eligible </em>for adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255\u00ae. Rather, there are two additional and more difficult <em>statutory eligibility requirements </em>in \u00a7 1255\u00ae that must also be met.\u201d <em>Zafar, </em>461 F.3d at 1363 (emphasis in original). Specifically, \u00a7 1255(i)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-18\">(2) Upon receipt of such an application and the sum hereby required, the Attorney General may adjust the status of the alien to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-19\">(A) the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-20\">(B) an immigrant visa is immediately available to the alien at the time the application is filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1231-21\">INA \u00a7 245(i)(2), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-22\">Here, Haswanee sought an employment-based visa and his employer filed an 1-140 visa petition on his behalf. According to the federal regulations that describe the procedure for receiving an employment-based visa, \u201c[a]ny [U.S.] employer desiring and intending to employ an alien may file a petition for classification of the alien\u201d \u2014 an 1-140 visa petition \u2014 which must be \u201c[a]c-companied by any required individual labor certification.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.5(a), (c), (g), (l). The petition may be approved or denied, and in the event of approval: (1) a visa number will be assigned if available and (2) \u201cthe approved visa petition (Form 1-140), will be retained by the [immigration service] for consideration with the application for permanent residence (Form 1-485).\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 204.5(n), 245.1(g). Haswanee had immediately available visa numbers during his proceedings before the IJ and BIA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>In <em>Zafar, </em>we addressed the issue of whether the IJs abused their discretion in denying three petitioners\u2019 motions to continue where the petitioners did not have approved labor certifications and had not filed 1-140 visa petitions or 1-485 adjustment of status applications. <em>Zafar, </em>461 F.3d at 1362. We held that the IJs did not abuse their discretion because, at the time of the petitioners\u2019 removal hearings, they had not received an approved labor certification, filed an 1-140 visa petition, or filed an 1-485 application. <em>Id. </em>at 1363-64. We thus concluded that the petitioners were not eligible to receive an immigrant visa nor had they established that an immigrant visa was immediately available, and, therefore, they could not meet the statutory requirements for adjustment of status under INA \u00a7 245(i)(2), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(2). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1232-5\">In <em>Merchant v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1375 (11th Cir.2006), we faced the issue of whether the IJ abused its discretion in denying a continuance where Merchant had an approved labor certification and had filed 1-140 and 1-485 applications. <em>Merchant, </em>461 F.3d at 1376-77. While the government in <em>Merchant </em>conceded that Merchant had the aforementioned documents, the government maintained that Merchant had not satisfied \u00a7 1255(i)(2)(A) because his visa petition had not been approved. <em>Id. </em>at 1378. We rejected that argument, stating that \u201cthe statute clearly provides that an alien in Merchant\u2019s shoes need only be \u2018eligible\u2019 to receive the visa, not that he must have the visa in hand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, we determined that \u00a7 1255(i)(2)(B) also did not require that the alien have the visa \u201cin hand\u201d because \u201cboth the Regulations and the BIA case law construe ... \u00a7 1255(i)(2)(B) as meaning that an <em>immigrant visa number </em>be immediately available to the alien.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1378 n. 4 (emphasis added). Thus, we concluded that Merchant was eligible for an immigrant visa and eligible for adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255(i) because he had an approved labor certification and an immediately available visa number, and had filed an 1-140 petition for visa and an 1-485 application for adjustment of status. <em>Id. </em>at 1378-79. We also explained that our decision was not inconsistent with <em>Zafar, </em>as <em>Zafar </em>\u201cexpressly left open issues involving stages of this process beyond the mere filing of the application for labor certification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1380 (citing <em>Zafar, </em>461 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>at 1367).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1233-5\">As an initial matter, Haswanee\u2019s case is distinguishable from <em>Zafar </em>because Has-wanee had an approved labor certification and had filed an 1-140 visa petition. Based upon the record in the instant case, Haswanee is at a stage in the process that is between where the <em>Zafar </em>petitioners and Merchant sat during their removal proceedings. Specifically, Haswanee has an approved labor certification and has filed an 1-140 visa petition, which places him at a later stage than the <em>Zafar </em>petitioners, but has not established that he filed a 1-485 application for adjustment of status as Merchant had. Therefore, Has-wanee\u2019s case will turn on the question of whether an approved labor certification, an immediately available visa number, and an 1-140 visa petition are sufficient to satisfy the statutory requirements of INA \u00a7 245(i)(2), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-6\">Following the reasoning of both <em>Zafar </em>and <em>Merchant, </em>Haswanee has satisfied the statutory requirements. Pursuant to the Federal Regulations, Haswanee had completed his duties with regard to his 1-140 visa petition, namely, obtaining an approved labor certification and filing it along with his petition. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.5(a), (c), (g), (i). Moreover, he had an immigrant visa number immediately available. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 204.5(d); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.1(g)(1). Thus, Haswanee was \u201celigible to receive an immigrant visa\u201d and an \u201cimmigrant visa [wa]s immediately available to the alien at the time the application [wa]s filed.\u201d INA \u00a7 245(i)(2), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(2). The only difference between Haswanee and Merchant is that Merchant had also filed an 1-485 adjustment of status application. Regardless, Haswanee met the statutory requirements and, according to <em>Merchant, </em>we conclude that he was eligible for adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255(i). <em>See Merchant, </em>461 F.3d at 1379.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-10\">However, the government argues, and the BIA alternatively found, that because Haswanee had not filed an application for adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255(i), he could only be considered for an adjustment under \u00a7 1255(a), which left him subject to the statutory bar of \u00a7 1255(c). The government cites no authority for this proposition. In response, Haswanee notes he was not required to file the application for status adjustment during removal proceedings because the DHS could not have adjudicated it. Federal Regulations clearly state that the DHS does not have jurisdiction over adjustment of status applications when the alien has been placed in removal proceedings. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 245.2(a)(1), 1245.2(a)(1). Hashwanee is therefore eligible for status adjustment; the unfiled application cannot render him ineligible under \u00a7 1255(i) when the DHS would not even have had jurisdiction over his petition. The record establishes that, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>time Haswanee requested his continuance, he stated that he intended to file for relief under \u00a7 1255(i). There is nothing in the government\u2019s arguments, the record, or our binding precedent that would support applying the \u00a7 1255(c) bar here because, as discussed above, Haswanee met the relevant statutory requirements of \u00a7 1255(i) and indicated before the IJ that he would pursue such relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, in applying the reasoning and holdings of <em>Zafar </em>and <em>Merchant </em>to Haswanee\u2019s case, we hold that the IJ abused its discretion in denying Haswanee\u2019s motion for continuance where he had an approved labor certification and an immediately available visa number, and had a pending visa petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-4\">\n<em>B. Due Process and Equal Protection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-5\">Haswanee argues on appeal that the BIA\u2019s dismissal of his appeal, and the IJ\u2019s denial of his motion to continue, violated his due process rights because the findings require him to leave the country despite his immediate eligibility for adjustment of status relief. He also maintains that his equal protection rights were violated because, had he not been required because of his Pakistani origin to appear for registration as part of the now-suspended National Security Entry Exit Registration System (\u201cNSEERS\u201d), he would not have been placed in removal proceedings. He further asserts that, in other jurisdictions, IJs typically grant continuances in circumstances such as these, but in Atlanta, aliens are treated differently. Lastly, Haswanee maintains that it was beyond the INS\u2019s internal policy and general public policy to deny him the opportunity to legalize his status under \u00a7 1255(i).</p>\n<p id=\"Anx\">We have jurisdiction to review substantial constitutional claims raised in the immigration context. <em>Moore v. Ashcroft, </em>251 F.3d 919, 923-24 (11th Cir.2001). The petitioners in <em>Zafar </em>raised constitutional claims similar to those raised by Haswanee. <em>See Zafar, </em>461 F.3d at 1367. We rejected the petitioners\u2019 due process arguments because their requested relief, namely, a continuance of their removal proceedings, was discretionary relief for which no constitutionally protected right existed. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Tefel v. Reno, </em>180 F.3d 1286, 1300 (11th Cir.1999)). As to their equal protection claims, we first determined that it was not an equal protection violation to require the aliens to register pursuant to the NSEERS process. <em>Zafar, </em>461 F.3d at 1367 (citing <em>Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., </em>525 U.S. 471, 489-92, 119 S.Ct. 936, 142 L.Ed.2d 940 (1999) (finding that the INS retains inherent prosecutorial discretion as to whether to bring removal proceedings)). We also rejected the <em>Zafar </em>petitioners\u2019 equal protection argument regarding differing treatment between IJs in Atlanta and those in other jurisdictions because the petitioners did not cite, nor did we find, any ease law supporting the argument. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-8\">Because Haswanee\u2019s due process and equal protection arguments are nearly identical to those made by the petitioners in <em>Zafar, </em>we will follow our precedent and similarly reject Haswanee\u2019s arguments. First, pursuant to <em>Zafar, </em>there is no constitutionally protected right to the discretionary relief of a continuance of his removal proceedings. Moreover, as to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>equal protection arguments, Haswanee offers no support in the record or case law tending to show an equal protection violation. Lastly, to the extent that Haswanee argues that the BIA violated the INS\u2019s internal policies, we need not rely on those policies given the statutory basis for our decision, which is discussed in issue II.A. above, and our recognition that INS internal memoranda \u201care for the convenience of the INS and [do] not have the force and effect of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1365 (quotation omitted) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-5\">\n<em>III. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-6\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we hold that the IJ abused his discretion in denying Haswanee\u2019s motion for a continuance. We nonetheless conclude that the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s denial of the motion to continue did not violate Haswanee\u2019s constitutional rights. Accordingly, we <em>grant </em>Haswanee\u2019s petition for review in part, <em>vacate </em>the decision of the BIA, and <em>remand </em>for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-7\">PETITION GRANTED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1229-13\">. The Homeland Security Act (\"HSA\u201d), effective November 25, 2002, created the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\u201d) and abolished the INS. Pub.L.No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135. The HSA transferred INS functions to the DHS. This case was initiated while the INS was still in existence. This opinion, therefore, refers to the INS rather than the DHS as the relevant agency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1231-16\">. Visa availability information is distributed by the U.S. Department of State (\u201cDOS\u201d), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>availability is based on the priority given to the alien's employment classification. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(b)(3); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.1(g)(1). Haswanee\u2019s classification was that of \"Skilled Worker\u201d under INA \u00a7 203(b)(3)(A). According to the DOS's Visa Bulletins for December 2004 and April 2006, the months within which the IJ and BIA, respectively, denied Haswanee's motion for a continuance, visa numbers were available for aliens in Haswanee's classification. <em>See </em>http://travel.state.gov/visa/frviAiulletin/bulletin 1343 .html; http://travel.state.gov/visa/frvi/ bulletinAulletin2847.html. On appeal, Has-wanee asserts that he had immediately available visa numbers during his proceedings before the IJ and BIA. The government does not concede that fact, but neither does it explicitly contest it. While Haswanee\u2019s exact priority date is unclear from the record and his brief, the date the DOL accepted his labor certification for processing was April 25, 2001. Thus, April 25, 2001 is his priority date for purposes of his 1-140 visa petition. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.5(d) (\"The priority date of any petition filed for classification under section 203(b) of the Act which is accompanied by an individual labor certification from the [DOL] shall be the date the request for certification was accepted for processing by any office within the employment service system of the [DOL]\u201d). \"An immigrant visa is considered available for accepting and processing the application Form 1-485 i[f] the [employment classification of the] applicant has a priority date on the waiting list which is earlier than the date shown in the [DOS's Visa] Bulletin (or the Bulletin shows that numbers for visa applicants in his or her category are current).\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.1(g)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1233-7\">. Also in <em>Merchant, </em>we addressed the applicability of our previous decision in <em>Bull, </em>in which we held that the IJ abused its discretion by refusing to grant a continuance where the petitioner was married to a U.S. citizen and had filed an 1-130 application for a family-based visa. <em>Merchant, </em>461 F.3d at 1378. Similar to Merchant, Haswanee asserts that the rationale we applied in <em>Bull </em>should be applied to his case. Our treatment of <em>Bull in Merchant </em>is equally applicable here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-8\">Although <em>Bull's </em>involvement with the favored family-based visa context is a distinguishing factor, [the petitioners in <em>Bull </em>and Merchant] are somewhat similar in that both had applied for visas and both were eligible for them. Thus, we think <em>Bull </em>provides some support for the conclusion we reach[ed] [in Merchant].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEs\"><em>Merchant, </em>461 F.3d at 1378. Similarly, as discussed more fully below, our decision in <em>Bull </em>provides some support for our holding that the district court abused its discretion in denying Haswanee's request for a continuance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1234-6\">. Haswanee also appears to contend that, after the BIA's dismissal of his appeal, he filed a motion to reopen in the BIA and submitted a copy of his 1-485 and I-485A adjustment of status forms. The record does not contain evidence of Haswanee\u2019s motion to reopen or adjustment of status forms, and Haswanee did not file a notice of appeal with regard to the BIA\u2019s alleged denial of his motion to reopen. Accordingly, we will not consider any argument with regard to the alleged motion to reopen.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
