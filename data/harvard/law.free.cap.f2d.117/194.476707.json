Appellants urge that the verdict of the jury was excessive, and that a- motion for a new trial on this ground was erroneously denied. It does not appear that the trial judge committed any abuse of discretion. The court stated: \u201cThe court has given careful consideration to the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses relating to the question of damages and it is our independent judgment that the verdict responds truly to the real merits of the controversy on the evidence submitted, and that the damages awarded are not excessive. There is nothing in the trial of the case that convinces the court that the jury acted in passion or prejudice or that it did not administer substantial justice.\u201d The judgment must be affirmed.
