See 114 F.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">After the Government had filed a notice of appeal (on February 3, 1939) from the October, 1938, judgment, it obtained a rehearing in the District Court, which resulted in a vacation of the 1938 judgment and a dismissal of the veteran\u2019s suit. This action was taken on the authority of the subsequently decided Towery case. United States v. Towery, 306 U.S. 324, 59 S.Ct. 522, 83 L.Ed. 678. On May 5, 1939, the trial court granted the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss its appeal from the 1938 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Thereupon (July 21, 1939) the <em>veteran </em>filed notice of appeal from the second\u2014 the dismissal of suit \u2014 judgment. On the veteran\u2019s appeal from this second judgment, this court held: (1) (a) That the trial court was without jurisdiction to vacate a former judgment after notice of appeal therefrom had been filed. (1) (b) The trial court had no authority to dismiss an appeal pending in this court. 114 F.2d 267, 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">This court in an obiter (made to \u201cavoid future litigation\u201d) considered the effect of the July 3, 1930 amendment, 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 445, extending the statute of limitations, upon automatic insurance. Sec. 401 of the War Risk Insurance Act, 40 Stat. 409. We concluded the extension was inapplicable to war risk automatic insurance and, a fortiori, this veteran was barred from all recovery. There was a dissent from this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">We there stated that the District Court\u2019s second judgment, of dismissal of the suit, must be reversed as of no efficacy, and the opinion added, \u201cThe appeal of defendant [the Government] from the first judgment <em>is still pending but it is not before us at this time. </em>The District Court\u2019s order dismissing the appeal from the first judgment is of no force or effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">In August, 1940, this court granted the Government leave to docket its appeal from the first judgment. The veteran moved to dismiss this appeal, which motion was denied without prejudice to a renewal thereof at the hearing on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-15\"><em>Validity of Appeal. </em>The veteran moves to dismiss this appeal (which it must be conceded has had an \u201cunusual\u201d career), on the ground that no record on appeal was filed within fifty days from March 15, 1939 (May 4, 1939), as required by Rule 73 (g) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-16\">Rule 73 (g) provides that the <em>record \u201cshall be filed </em>with the appellate court and the- action there docketed within <em>40 days </em>from the date of the notice of appeal; except that, when more than one appeal is taken from the same judgment to the same appellate court, the district court may prescribe the time for filing and docketing, which in no event shall be less than 40 days from the date of the first notice of appeal. In all cases, the district court in its discretion and with or without motion or notice may extend the time for filing the record on appeal and docketing the action, if its order for extension is made before the expiration of the period for filing and docketing as originally prescribed or as extended by a previous order; but the district court shall not extend the time to a day more than 90 days from the date of the first notice of appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-17\">We reach the conclusion that the appeal is properly and legally before us for our consideration, despite the mandatory statement in the Rule 73 (g) as to the requirement of time within which the record must be filed, for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b313-18\">(a) Rule 73 (g)\u2019s mandatory requirement is alleviated in its rigidity by subsection (a) of the same rule which renders the failure to comply with subsection (g) non-jurisdictional. Subsection (a) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-21\">\u201cWhen an appeal is permitted by law from a district court to a circuit court of appeals and within the time prescribed, a party may appeal from a judgment by filing with the district court a notice of appeal. Failure of the appellant to take any of the further steps to secure the review of the judgment appealed from does not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground only for such remedies as are specified in this rule or, when no remedy is specified, for such action as the appellate court deems appropriate, which may include dismissal of the appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>The court in Burke v. Canfield, App.D.C., 111 F.2d 526, 527, held that the effect of subsection (a) of Sec. 73 of the Rules was to leave \u201cthe matter to this court\u2019s discretion, and as the rules involved are new, * * * the appeal should not be dismissed. * * * the error was not necessarily fatal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">(b) It was the purpose of these rules to expedite appeals and guard against dilatory tactics. In the instant case the parties were diligent, and it is perfectly apparent why the Government\u2019s appeal was not prosecuted \u2014 it was proceeding along a course it deemed the most expedient, namely, correcting, in the District Court, that court\u2019s erroneous decree. It was. confronted by a situation wherein a subsequently announced Supreme Court decision made its decision erroneous. In attempting to correct the mistake, the Government failed to appreciate the legal complication which occurred by reason of its pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">As soon as this court determined that after an appeal is taken all proceedings in the District Court are stayed, appellant so proceeded. Since we held that the District Court was also without jurisdiction to dismiss the appeal pending in this court, it followed that the appeal was still, and is still, validly pending here.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">(c) The fact that the Government\u2019s record on appeal was not filed within the prescribed, or extended, time is here immaterial, as a matter of fact. We have the complete record before us because of the appeal taken by the veteran in the previous appeal, and this record is complete so far as the issues here presented for determination are concerned. It is interesting in this connection to note Rule 75 (k) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">\u201cWhen more than one appeal is taken to the same court from the same judgment, a <em>single </em>record on appeal shall be prepared containing all the matter designated or agreed upon by the parties without duplication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">We have heretofore permitted the printed record presented in the veteran\u2019s appeal to stand as the record on this appeal, after having a \u201cre-designation\u201d of its contents and certification by the clerk of the District Court. This record was refiled on this appeal, August 16, 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\"><em>The Merits. </em>We here adopt the obiter stated in the opinion on the veteran\u2019s appeal, No. 7068, following the heading \u201cApplicability of Statute of Limitations (Act of July 3, 1930) to \u2018Automatic\u2019 Insurance,\u201d and as a consequence hold that the suit of the veteran should be dismissed because his claim was barred by the Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed with directions to dismiss the action.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b314-13\">TREANOR, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ABt\">(dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-14\">I am of the opinion that the veteran\u2019s claim under his so-called \u201cAutomatic Insurance\u201d was not barred and that he is entitled to recover on the merits. See dissenting opinion in previous appeal, Cause No. 7068, reported in 114 F.2d 267.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
