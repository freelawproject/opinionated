The order directed the respondent employer, Los Angeles-Seattle Motor Express, and the union to cease and desist from performing, maintaining or otherwise giving effect to the condemned hiring hall agreement and to take certain affirmative action which the Board found would effectuate the purposes of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">Among the affirmative acts which the order required of the union and employer jointly was to make whole one Lester II. Slater for any loss he may have suffered from the discrimination which the Board held had been practiced against him under the hiring hall agreement; and to reimburse all casual employees for the initiation fees and dues which, the Board said, had been \u201cexacted from them as the price of their employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">We think the Board\u2019s order is correct except that it goes too far in directing reimbursement of the dues and fees paid to the union by all casual employees. National Labor Relations Board v. American Dredging Co., 3 Cir., 1960, 276 F.2d 286.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The order should be modified to confine the reimbursement feature to Slater alone. As so modified, the Board\u2019s order will be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-16\">. We have considered the opinion of the Seventh Circuit in National Labor Relations Board v. Local 60, 1960, 273 F.2d 699, but are constrained to the view that the Third Circuit opinion more aptly applies to the problem presented on the record before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b695-13\">EDGERTON, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A8U\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-14\">The Board rightly says \u201cThe basic issue in this case is the propriety of the Board\u2019s finding that the Union\u2019s exclusive hiring hall agreement violated the Act on its face.\u201d I think this finding is wrong and the order should be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-15\">The court appears to hold that an exclusive hiring-hall agreement is necessarily unlawful. My impression is that \u201cThe hiring hall is legal and has always' been held so.\u201d N. L. R. B. v. Mountain Pacific Chapter of Associated General Contractors, Inc., 9 Cir., 1959, 270 F.2d 425, 429. An \u201cagreement that hiring of employees be done only through a particular union\u2019s offices does not violate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>Act \u2018absent evidence that the union unlawfully discriminated in supplying the company with personnel.\u2019 95 N.L.R.B. at 435.\u201d N. L. R. B. v. Swinerton, 9 Cir., 202 F.2d 511, 514, certiorari denied 346 U.S. 814, 74 S.Ct. 24, 98 L.Ed. 341. \u201c \u2018The factor in a hiring-hall arrangement which makes the device an unfair labor practice is the agreement to hire <em>only </em>union members referred to the employer.\u2019 Del E. Webb Construction Co. v. N. L. R. B., 8 Cir., 1952, 196 F.2d 841, 845.\u201d Eichleay Corp. v. N. L. R. B\u201e 3 Cir., 1953, 206 F.2d 799, 803. The present hiring-hall arrangement expressly negatives any such agreement, by requiring employment to be \u201conly on a seniority basis\u201d irrespective of whether the \u201cemployee is or is not a member of the Union.\u201d Without violating this agreement, the employer cannot discriminate \u201cin regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership\u201d in the union, in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (3) of the Labor Management Relations Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>and the union cannot \u201ccause - or attempt to cause an employer to discriminate against an employee in violation of\u201d that section.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The agreement does not contain the language the Board required in the Mountain Pacific case, 119 N.L.R.B. 883, 897, but this does not make it unlawful. N. L. R. B. v. Mountain Pacific Chapter of Associated General Contractors, Inc., 9 Cir., 270 F.2d 425, 431. \u201cWithin the area in which collective bargaining was required, Congress was not concerned with the substantive terms upon which the parties agreed.\u201d Local 24 of Intern. Brotherhood of Teamsters, etc. v. Oliver, 358 U.S. 283, 295, 79 S.Ct. 297, 3 L.Ed. 2d 312. The possibility that the arrangement may at some future time lead to unlawful discrimination does not invalidate it. Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham Board of Education, 358 U.S. 101, 79 S.Ct. 221, 3 L.Ed.2d 145, affirming D.C., 162 F.Supp. 372, 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">The court upholds the Board\u2019s finding that the discharge of employee Slater resulted from the hiring provisions of the contract and was discriminatory. Slater had not obtained or sought employment through the hiring hall. I think his discharge for this reason did not discriminate against him or violate the Act. To interpret the Act as \u201cfurnishing statutory protection to employees who choose to violate valid provisions of labor-management contracts\u201d would not be \u201cconsistent with the underlying purpose of the Act to promote * * * collective bargaining agreements * * N.L.R.B. v. Furriers Joint Council, 2 Cir., 224 F.2d 78, 80. Slater was a member of the Union in good standing. I cannot see that his discharge for failing to comply with an agreement between the Union and the employer encourages union membership.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-5\">. 61 Stat. 140 (1947), as amended, 29 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 158(a) (3) (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b696-15\">. \u00a7158(b) (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
