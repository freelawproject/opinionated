The court then ordered a money judgment in favor of appellants against appellee in the sum of $1,775. We are unable to say that the record as a whole does not support the findings of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-22\">It follows from the foregoing that the judgment of the District Court must be and is</p>\n<p id=\"b231-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
