Or so they say.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Keele Hair &amp; Scalp Specialists, Inc., William Keele, Thelma P. Keele, J. H. Keele, Rogers Hair Experts, Inc., and American Advertising Bureau Inc. petition for review of an order to cease and desist issued against them by the Federal Trade Commission. The Commission\u2019s complaint charged petitioners with engaging in unfair and deceptive acts and practices in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We dismiss the petition for review and affirm the Commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The Commission complaint charged petitioners with disseminating, through the United States mails and by various means in interstate commerce, false and misleading advertisements.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These advertisements represented that the petitioners\u2019 treatments and the use of their drug and cosmetic preparations would check thinning hair, prevent and overcome all types of baldness, and induce new hair to grow where before there was only fuzz. The complaint charged that the petitioners\u2019 treatments and drug preparations will have no effect whatever on \u201cmale pattern baldness\u201d, the type of baldness that occurs in 90 to 95 per cent of the cases of baldness. The Commission contends that the advertisements were false and misleading in using the word \u201ctrichologist\u201d to represent that the Keele or Rogers employees and representatives had competent training in dermatology and other branches of medicine dealing with the treatment of scalp disorders. Petitioners denied that they had engaged in any false or misleading advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">A hearing was held and evidence was presented by both parties. The Examiner found that petitioners\u2019 practices violated the Federal Trade Commission Act and issued a cease and desist order that did not however require petitioners, in the future, to disclose certain material facts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Both parties appealed to the Commission. The Commission denied petitioners\u2019 appeal, granted the appeal of counsel supporting the complaint, and issued a Commission order tracking the Examiner\u2019s order except by modifying it to require the disclose of certain material facts relating particularly to male pattern baldness. The order now before us<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is substantially similar to the order ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>proved of in Erickson v. Federal Trade Commission, 7 Cir., 1959, 272 F.2d 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\n<em>Are the Commission\u2019s findings supported by substantial evidence?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">In reviewing the Commission\u2019s findings the Court is guided by certain basic principles. The findings of the \u2022Commission are presumed to be supported by competent evidence, and if so supported are conclusive. Federal Trade Commission v. A. McLean &amp; Son, 7 Cir., 1936, 84 F.2d 910, certiorari denied 299 U.S. 590, 57 S.Ct. 117, 81 L.Ed. 435; Federal Trade Commission v. Wallace, 8 Cir., 1935, 75 F.2d 733; 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 45(c). The inferences reasonably to be drawn from the evidence are for the Commission. Federal Trade Commission v. Pacific States Paper Trade Ass\u2019n, 1927, 273 U.S. 52, 63, 47 S.Ct. 255, 71 L.Ed. 534. The possibility of drawing either \u2022of two inconsistent inferences from the evidence does not prevent an administrative body\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence. N.L.R.B. v. Nevada Consolidated Copper Corp., 1942, 316 U.S. 105, 62 S.Ct. 960, 86 L.Ed. 1305. The inferences drawn by the administrative agency will not be set aside merely because the courts would have drawn a different inference. N.L.R.B. v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 1943, 319 U.S. 50, 60, 63 S.Ct. 905, 87 L.Ed. 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Some of the newspaper advertisements read, in part: \u201cFamous triehologist will demonstrate how to grow thicker hair * * * and guarantees it\u201d; <em>\u201cA </em>complete, private examination is given by a trichologist * * * \u201d; \u201cThis examination is very thorough and highly technical.\u201d The advertisements pictured a man in a white coat examining the scalp of a patient against a background of a chart depicting a cross-section of the scalp. In these advertisements the petitioners invited prospective customers to visit a temporary office, usually at a hotel, and receive a \u201cfree demonstration\u201d and advice as to the condition of their hair and scalp. The petitioners or their representatives, attired in their white coats, interviewed the customers in a room containing the ubiquitous scalp chart and other props such as an array of test-tubes, a flasholens, and an orange stick. The trichologist (here salesman), pointing to the chart from time to time, would give a short talk explaining the causes of baldness, to the best of his ability within the limits of the smattering of knowledge picked up in a five-day sales-training course at Keele\u2019s Hair Experts. The trichologist examined the customer\u2019s scalp under a bright light. He questioned the customer about his health. Two of petitioners\u2019 salesmen testified that customers had referred to them as \u201cDoctor\u201d during the course of the examination. There is ample evidence to support the Commission\u2019s finding that petitioners in their advertisements and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>their treatments falsely represented that their salesmen were trained in dermatology or some other branch of medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d Ed.1958) defines trichology as \u201cthe science treating of the hair\u201d. The scientific training that Keele\u2019s representatives received consisted of \u201cabout five days out on the road and about a day in learning the chart talk, how to set up a display and examine a client and to enroll them\u201d. The so-called trichologists were salesmen with no medical training. Describing them as \u201ctrichologists\u201d was a fraudulent use of a title which, by natural association in one\u2019s mind with such titles as \u201cneurologist\u201d, \u201cgynecologist\u201d, or \u201cendocrinologist\u201d, was intended to deceive the public.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The Commission found that the petitioners had fraudulently represented that their preparation and treatment would cure male pattern baldness. Three physicians who were specialists in dermatology testified that male pattern baldness is the most common type of baldness (90 to 95 per cent). The two specialists in dermatology who testified for the petitioners also recognized male pattern baldness as the most common type, that heredity is a factor, and that once it starts there is nothing to stop it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The uncontradicted testimony is that male pattern baldness can not be prevented, arrested, or corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Although 90 to 95 per cent of baldness is of the incurable, male pattern type, petitioners\u2019 advertisements representing that they could prevent baldness made no exceptions for this type. The petitioners advertised that they could treat all types of baldness, for example: \u201cBut the hopeless eases are few\u201d; \u201cNo man need be bald\u201d; \u201cBut today baldness is unnecessary\u201d; \u201cNinety-five per cent of all cases of hair loss come within the scope of Keele Treatment\u201d; \u201cKeele has a successful treatment for every type of hair loss\u201d; \u201cDid you know that 76% of all U. S. males will lose their hair to some degree by their 28th birthday? But \u2014 did you know that 95% of this disfiguring hair loss could be avoided with proper corrective treatment under trichological supervision? \u201d; \u201c95% of all cases of Hair Loss can be helped * * * the real truth is that most bald men need not have lost their hair at all.\u201d The Commission\u2019s findings that petitioners\u2019 \u201cpreparations, whether used singly or in combination, and regardless of the method of treatment followed in connection with the preparations, will have no effect on male pattern baldness\u201d is fully supported by the testimony of the medical experts who appeared before the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">In Erickson v. Federal Trade Commission, 7 Cir., 1959, 272 F.2d 318, Erickson Hair and Scalp Specialists utilized the-same sure-fire selling techniques as Keele Hair Experts. They too ran afoul of the Federal Trade Commission. The cease and desist order in that case is almost identical with the one issued in the instant case. In a well considered opinion the Seventh Circuit affirmed the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>mission order. See also Mueller v. United States, 5 Cir., 1958, 262 F.2d 443.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">\n<em>Has the Commission the power to require affirmative disclosure?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Petitioners argue, citing Alberty v. Federal Trade Commission, 1950, 86 U.S.App.D.C. 238, 182 F.2d 36, 43, certiorari denied 340 U.S. 818, 71 S.Ct. 49, 95 L.Ed. 601, that the Commission cannot order them to disclose what their product and treatment will <em>not do.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Act states that the term \u201cfalse advertising\u201d includes \u201cnot only representations made or suggested * * * but also the extent to which the advertisement fails to reveal facts material in the light of such representations.\u201d Cease and desist orders compelling affirmative disclosure are enforced by the courts when they are necessary to prevent deception.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">There is nothing in the Alberty case that prevents enforcement of a cease and desist order requiring affirmative disclosure. The Alberty case simply held that the Commission must make certain findings before compelling affirmative disclosure.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the instant case the Commission made the required findings and on the basis of these findings issued its order requiring that the petitioners disclose affirmatively that Keele preparation would not be effective against male pattern baldness. Failure to disclose that approximately 95 per cent of the cases of baldness fall within the male pattern type is plainly misleading, when the petitioners claim they treat effectively virtually all cases of baldness.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-15\">\n<em>Did the petitioners change their advertisements in accordance with the request of the Commission?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b71-16\">The complaint was filed against the petitioners on July 17, 1956. Petitioners allege that beginning May, 1955, their advertisements were changed materially to conform to the wishes of the Commission. They allege that the early offensive advertisements were not used after that date. The contention is without merit. At least five of the exhibits admitted into evidence against the petitioners without objections were advertisements published in 1956. They contained the same kind of false advertising that appeared in the earlier advertisements. The Commission is entitled to enforcement of its order prohibiting advertisements misleading the public when the advertisements are of a type apparently long characteristic of the parties in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>The petition to review and set aside the cease and desist order of the Commission is denied, and enforcement of the order of the Commission is now ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Enforcement ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-19\">.

The complaint alleged that because petitioners failed to disclose and reveal in their advertisements (1) that the vast majority of cases of thinning hair and baldness are the beginning and more fully developed states of male pattern baldness and (2) that petitioners\u2019 preparations will have no therapeutic value in the treatment of this type of baldness, petitioners\u2019 advertisements were misleading in a material respect and constituted \u201cfalse advertisements\u201d as defined in the Federal Trade Commission Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b68-14\">. \u201cThe petitioners were ordered to cease and desist: 1. Disseminating or causing to be disseminated by means of the United States mails or by any means in commerce, as \u2018commerce\u2019 is defined in the Federal Trade Commission Act, any advertisement which represents, directly or by implication that the use of said preparations, alone or in conjunction with any method of treatment: Will cheek thin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>ning hair, prevent or overcome baldness, cause new hair to grow, or cause the hair to become thicker, unless such representations bo expressly limited to cases other than those of male pattern baldness, and unless the advertisement clearly and conspicuously reveals the fact that the great majority of cases of thinning hair and baldness are the beginning and more fully developed states of same male pattern baldness and that said preparations will not in such cases check thinning hair, prevent or overcome baldness, cause new hair to grow, or cause hair to become thicker. 1[2. Disseminating or causing to be disseminated by means of the United States mails or by any means in commerce, as \u2018commerce\u2019 is defined in the Federal Trade Commission Aet, any advertisement which represents, directly or by implication: That respondents or any of their agents or employees are trichologist, or that they have had competent training in dermatology or other branches of medicine having to do with the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the hair or scalp. 1[3. Disseminating or causing to be disseminated by any means any advertisement for the purpose of inducing or which is likely to induce, directly or indirectly, the purchase of said preparations in commerce, as \u2018commerce\u2019 is defined in the Federal Trade Commission Aet, which advertisement contains any representation prohibited in paragraphs 1 and 2 hereof.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b70-7\">. Dr. John H. Lamb, a physician specializing in dermatology, testified for the Commission that to be termed a trichologist a person should have medical training, with a medical degree and some special training in dermatology. Other eminent dermatologists testified that to be able to diagnose and treat disorders of the hair and scalp, a person should have a degree in medicine and special training in dermatology.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b70-8\">. One of petitioners\u2019 advertisements states: \u201cTrichologist Green dodged no issues. He quickly took up the most widely spread <em>theory </em>of baldness- \u2014 heredity. \u2018Mankind\u2019s unrealistic belief that baldness is hereditary stems from a misinterpretation of the theory of genetics. Theory does not state that any person must be bald because baldness exists in the family. What it does say, is that in some families, a tendency <em>exists toward </em>an undernourished scalp.\u2019 The purpose of the Rogers Hair and Scalp-Clinic is to teach the methods of strengthening the weak scalp and nourishing it to a healthy, vigorous condition. \u2018A healthy scalp will grow hair if it is not already completely bald\u2019, assures Green.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b71-9\">. Mueller v. United States, 5 Cir., 1958, 262 F.2d 443, was an action by the government to recover a penalty for violation of a cease and desist order.
