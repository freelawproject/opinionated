The principles discussed in that opinion are fully applicable to the present case, and we do not consider that the differences between the words and services involved in the two cases make it necessary or useful to add to or repeat what was there said. In this case as in that the words sought to be registered are of such a nature that they convey to the customer information as to the services offered rather than identify and distinguish the services of the applicant from those of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">The decision of the Commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
