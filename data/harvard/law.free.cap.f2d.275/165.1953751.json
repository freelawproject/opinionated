We think that under the decision of this court in Johnston Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Communications Comm\u2019n, 1949, 85 U.S. App.D.C. 40, 175 F.2d 351, the action of the Commission in this regard was within its power and was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Appellant further urges that the Commission erred in determining that certain misrepresentations in intervenor\u2019s application, inserted by an unauthorized person, did not constitute a willful, and deliberate misrepresentation by the intervenor and that the intervenor was not guilty of a willful and knowing concealment of material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">We think that the finding of the Commission that Best Cabs did not commit acts of deliberate and willful misrepresentation and did not deliberately conceal the facts of such misrepresentation is supported by the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Finding no reason to disturb the decision of the Commission, that decision is</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">-Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-27\">. This affidavit was filed and deemed by the Commission a satisfactory compliance with the directions of the Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
