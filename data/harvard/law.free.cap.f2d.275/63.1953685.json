The jury returned a general verdict for the defendant, and answers to some twenty-eight special interrogatories. They were numbered one to ten, but several contained subsidiary questions. These interrogatories and the answers thereto are important to this appeal. They read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">\u201c1. On November 9, 1951, did Jerome B. Nash in words or substance state and represent to M. 0. Anderson that Anderson Buick Company need not concern itself about termination of its distributorship as long as it continued to penetrate the market and maintain price class performance and for at least so long a period as was required to amortize the $500,000 mortgage?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">\u201cAnswer: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-8\">\u201c2.

Because interrogatory number one was answered in the negative, no answer was required of the jury as to interrogatory number six. And the negative answer to nine (a) made answers to nine(b) and nine(c) unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-20\">Judgment in favor of the defendant was entered based on the jury\u2019s general verdict. The trial judge previously had dismissed M. 0. Anderson, individually, as a plaintiff. At the time of the jury\u2019s verdict the trial judge had under consideration a motion to dismiss as to A. B. C. Packard, Inc., the successor corporation to the one Anderson, with the defendant\u2019s help, had originally organized. After the jury\u2019s verdict the trial judge indicated he was in accord with the jury\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-23\">Appellant raises five specifications of error which we shall consider in turn:</p>\n<p id=\"b114-24\">I. THE COURT ERRED IN FAILING TO INSTRUCT THE JURY THAT GENERAL MOTORS OWED ANDERSON A DUTY TO DISCLOSE AS A MATTER OF LAW.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-25\">II. THE COURT ERRED IN REFUSING TO SUBMIT TO THE JURY ANDERSON\u2019S CLAIM BASED ON NASH\u2019S 1947 REPRESENTATION TO ANDERSON.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-26\">III. THE COURT ERRED IN INSTRUCTING THE JURY THAT ANDERSON WAS PRECLUDED FROM CLAIMING THAT HE SIGNED THE DISTRIBUTORSHIP AGREEMENT OF NOVEMBER 1, 1952 BECAUSE OF GENERAL MOTORS\u2019 NONDISCLOSURE OF ITS DISTRIBUTORSHIP POLICY.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-27\">IY. THE COURT ERRED IN AWARDING GENERAL MOTORS AS AN ITEM OF COST REPORTERS\u2019 FEES FOR PREPARING A TRANSCRIPT OF THE PROCEEDINGS AT THE TRIAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-28\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-29\">The fifth point is the point we shall first mention. It was that:</p>\n<p id=\"b114-30\">THE COURT ERRED IN GRANTING DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION FOR A DIRECTED VERDICT AND MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF\u2019S ACTION FOLLOWING THE VERDICT OF THE JURY.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-31\">Although the trial court on August 28, 1957 entered an order \u201cgranting defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdict and motion to dismiss,\u201d it subsequently, on August 30, 1957, signed and entered a judgment based on the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of General Motors Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and against the A. B. C. Packard, Inc., a Washington corporation. Appellant in its brief has stated it considered the judgment on the verdict the matter to be considered on this appeal (Appellant\u2019s Brief, p. 37, n. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>31). Inasmuch as appellant appealed only from the August 30, 1957 judgment (as amended), and the order denying a new trial, the August 30, 1957 judgment is the only matter before us. We therefore will not consider appellant\u2019s point III (described herein as Point V) with respect to the August 28, 1957 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">We turn next to the principal issue on this appeal \u2014 did General Motors owe a duty to Anderson <em>as a matter of law </em>to disclose \u201cGeneral Motors Distributorship Termination Policy,\u201d and secondarily, if so, should the court have then so instructed <em>as a matter of law </em>instead of submitting the question to the jury (which found there was no duty to disclose) ?</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The existence or nonexistence of the duty to disclose depends generally upon the relationship between the parties. In this instant case we have two business entities entering into annual contracts over a period of eighteen years. There is no question but that one party was, during all that time, an economic giant, the other, relatively, an economic pigmy. Such economic inequality may well be a tangible force of tremendous power in shaping the terms of the contract eventually signed, or may preclude the smaller entity from willingly entering into any contract.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But once the contract is signed, such economic inequality <em>per se, </em>does not create a legal fiduciary relationship between the contracting parties, <em>absent </em>(a) those terms within the contract sufficient to create that relationship; or (b) those facts outside the contract which, <em>per se, </em>create \u201cfraud\u201d sufficient to require the creation of a duty to disclose no matter what technical relationship may be created by the terms of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-14\">To establish such a duty to disclose, appellant relies on two Washington cases, Ikeda v. Curtis, 1953, 43 Wash.2d 449, 261 P.2d 684, and Perkins v. Marsh, 1934, 179 Wash. 362, 37 P.2d 689, and the Restatement of Torts \u00a7 551, 37 C.J.S. Fraud \u00a7 16 and 23 Am.Jur., Fraud &amp; Deceit, \u00a7 78. Neither of the eases cited by appellant seem applicable to the factual situation here existing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Here during the entire period of appellant\u2019s operation the relationship between the parties was governed by written contracts identical to those used generally by Buick distributors throughout the United States. These contracts spelled out in detail the rights and obligations of each of the parties. While appellant contended that each of these contracts was entered into as a result of business compulsion and was induced by fraud based on a lack of disclosure, the jury specifically found that each (at least from 1947 to 1952, inclusive) was entered into as the free act of the parties thereto. Each agreement was for the stated term of one year, each was subject to cancellation by either party (by the appellant on thirty days\u2019 notice and by the appellee on ninety day notice); each was a personal service contract, cancelable immediately if the individual appellant died or became insolvent. Each agreement provided that the appellant-distributor was not the agent nor legal representative capable of binding the appellee; each provided that there were no other agreements or understandings, either oral or written, between the parties.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">The trial court came to the conclusion, independently of the jury, that there was nothing in the relationship between the parties, either as created by the terms of the contract or by reason of any factual situation existing <em>dehors </em>the contract, that created a relationship of trust and confidence between the parties sufficient to compel the disclosure of any indefinite future policy to discontinue its then existing methods of selling automobiles.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">Thus Section 551 of the Restatement of Torts cited by appellant has no application. If one party has an absolute right to cancel a contract with or without cause at any time upon a month?s notice, he can be under no duty to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>close the possibility of a change in business procedures which might cause him <em>in futuro </em>to fail to renew a contract which has then terminated by its express terms. Nor do we find any relationship created by the course of dealings between the parties in this case comparable to the legal relationships enumerated in 37 C.J.S. Fraud \u00a7 16d.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Failing to bring its case within the facts of the cases cited or the general principles of law enunciated in the reference volumes, appellant nevertheless persists that General Motors had a duty of disclosure as a matter of law because there allegedly exists a clear <em>trend </em>of authority to establish such a duty \u201cwhenever it is required in the interests of fair dealing.\u201d To become more than a trend there must exist either legislation or much clearer and much greater judicial recognition of the worth of the legal theory, which as yet must be held a theory, and nothing more.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-13\">In support of the thesis that here there existed a confidential relationship, requiring disclosure of future policy, appellant cites various cases. We have carefully gone over them and find apt language, but none factually comparable to the facts existing in this case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-14\">Applying the general language of the cases cited in note 7, with their differing facts, appellant seeks to apply the general rule that \u201ca confidential relationship, as that term is understood in the law of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>fraud, existed between General Motors and Anderson in this instant case * * - [due] in part from the fact the distributor is an agent of the manufacturer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">The relationship created by the written contract between a manufacturer and. a distributor of automobiles depends upon the terms of that contract, not the label of \u201cDistributor\u201d and \u201cSeller.\u201d Here by its express terms the distributor was not the agent or legal representative of the seller <em>\u201cfor any purpose whatsoever.\u201d </em>Compare such denial of agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>to the language used in the contract relied on by appellant in the case of Champion Spark Plug Co. v. Automobile Sundries Co., 2 Cir., 1921, 273 F. 74, at page 80. There the contract provided, \u201c \u2018second party is hereby made and constituted sales agent and distributor by the first party.\u2019 The term \u2018agent\u2019 is employed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">As the court below instructed the jury (and we believe correctly), \u201cthese agreements constitute in law an absolute and complete refutation of any claim of reliance upon any representation other than those expressly set forth in the agreements,\u201d <em>unless </em>the jury found that appellant, as it charged, had been caused to enter into the agreements by \u201cbusiness compulsion,\u201d or fraud on the part of the appellee. Both by its general verdict and its answer to interrogatory ten, the jury answered, as to each year from 1947 to 1952, inclusive, that there had been no \u201cbusiness compulsion\u201d on appellant and no signing of the agreements because of any lack of disclosure by General Motors to Anderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">There is still another important practical matter to consider in connection with appellant\u2019s position that \u201cif there was a duty on General Motors to disclose as a matter of law that it did not intend to perpetually renew its distributorship contracts, the jury\u2019s general verdict necessarily would have been in favor of Anderson rather than of General Motors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">That has to do with damages. We are here again required to turn to the law of Washington.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nine essential elements of a cause of action for fraud have long been established by the Supreme Court of that state. Before recovery for fraud there must be proved (1) a representation of an existing fact; (2) its materiality; (3) its falsity; (4) the speaker\u2019s knowledge of its falsity or his ignorance of its truth; (5) his intent it should be acted on by the person to whom it is made; (6) ignorance of its falsity on the part of the person to whom it is made; (7) the latter\u2019s reliance on the truth of the representation; (8) his right to rely on it; and, (9) his consequent damage. Webster v. L. Romano Engineering Corp., 1934, 178 Wash. 118, 120-121, 34 P.2d 428, 430. The burden is on the plaintiff to prove all essential elements, and the absence of any of them is fatal to a recovery. Puget Sound National Bank v. McMahon, Wash.1958, 330 P.2d 559, 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-13\">Skipping for the present any question of an intent to deceive, and the alleged ignorance of the falsity, and the reliance claimed on behalf of appellant (all doubtful questions in view of the written contracts entered into by the parties and the questions left to the jury and decided by that body adversely to appellant), we come to the question of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-14\">This case presents a most unusual factual situation in this regard. General Motors never refused to continue Anderson Buick Company as its dealer. On July 10, 1952, Anderson and four other Northwest distributors were told by Buick\u2019s general sales manager that the current distributor agreement with each of them, expiring by its terms on October 31st, 1952, would be renewed (by a new agreement) covering a period ending June 30, 1953, and that after that all five distributors would be on a direct dealer basis. (Defendant\u2019s Ex. A-68.) This was notice of the proposed change in General Motors\u2019 business practices of almost a year. With full knowledge of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>proposed change, and on November 1, 1952, all five distributors including Anderson Buick Company entered into an agreement expiring June 30, 1953. We then quote from appellee\u2019s brief (omitting references to transcript):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-4\">\u201cOn May 22, 1953, Mr. Belfie wrote to appellant, among others, and advised it that Buick would offer it a direct dealer selling agreement, in the form then in effect with all Buick dealers, for a term beginning on July 1, 1953 and invited them to a meeting on June 9,1953 at Seattle. Four of the distributors accepted direct dealer selling agreements. Appellant alone rejected the offer, although it was offered an exclusive franchise for the City of Seattle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">\u201cAlthough repeated efforts were made by Buick to persuade appellant to accept a dealership contract, Mr. Anderson refused to consider the offer unless he was given special consideration of an undefined nature. Instead, he instituted negotiations with the Chrysler Corporation for a De Soto-Plymouth distributorship which began operations in mid-August, 1953.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">\u201cIn March of 1954, a Packard distributorship was also undertaken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">\u201cAfter the expiration of the Buick distributorship agreement on June 30, 1953, General Motors, in discharging in full each and every obligation imposed on it by the terms of the expired agreement paid Anderson Buick Company the sum of $145,112.68.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-13\">In 1936, when the business started, Anderson had invested $7,500 and General Motors $67,500. General Motors was paid off by Anderson from his profits. Again Anderson borrowed from General Motors, and again Anderson paid off. On the expiration date of June 30, 1953, Anderson\u2019s corporate net worth was $1,248,000, in round figures. During that time Mr. Anderson, individually, had realized from salary, bonus, withdrawals, dividends, capital gains on sale of property, rental income and increase in net worth, over $2,600,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-14\">During the later years of the representation of General Motors by Anderson, the retail operations were much more profitable than the wholesale operations. Although there is some dispute as to the exact figures, any comparison is striking. An audit by Lybrand, Ross Bros. &amp; Montgomery, covering the years 1950, 1951 and 1952, shows a net profit from Anderson\u2019s retail operations of $942,081; from wholesale operations, $6,743 (Defendant\u2019s Ex. A~ 51).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-15\">On the financial statements furnished by Anderson Buick Company to Buick Motor Division, the same years show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">Year Retail Operations Wholesale Operations</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFv\">1950 592,112 21,643</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxH\">1951 223,983 (17,826) loss</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASI\">1952 43,668 ( 9,439) loss</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-18\">or a three year net profit of $859,763 from retail operations and a net loss of $5,622 from wholesale operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-19\">It is true that the foregoing would not establish as a matter of law the inability of appellant to prove some damage. It does not affect his right to claim a cause of action existed. But it highlights the difficult fact situation with which appellant took his case to the jury. Such evidence undoubtedly had its very practical effect on the outcome of this litigation. It might partially explain (if we can ever explain accurately any jury\u2019s verdict) one reason influencing the jury\u2019s determination of many factual issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-21\">We conclude that the question as to whether General Motors had a duty to disclose any policy as to the renewals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>of its yearly contracts to Anderson was a question of fact for the jury\u2019s determination under proper instructions. The latter were given. This was not an issue of law for the court to take from the jury, either in the court below or on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Appellant\u2019s next point is that the court erred in refusing to submit to the jury Anderson\u2019s claim based on Nash\u2019s alleged 1947 representation to Anderson. (Nash was Regional Manager for Buick Motors Company.) Here appellant refers to Anderson\u2019s testimony of an alleged conversation and states generally that this \u201cwas more than sufficient to establish the making of the representations in question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Factually, appellant devotes two pages of his ninety-three page brief to this discussion, in broad and general language, of the evidence on this point. He fails even to attempt to comply with our rules 18(d) and (e), 28 U.S.C. requiring him to point out the evidence by reference to page and volume. There are no references whatsoever to where any such evidence may be found in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">We need not point out that there was evidence in the record beyond appellant\u2019s testimony. This, because relying on appellant\u2019s testimony alone the trial court found as a matter of law that appellant\u2019s own version of Mr. Nash\u2019s telephone conversation with Mr. Anderson in July 1927 failed to establish actionable misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">We have located and read the testimony in the record on which this finding is based. We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Nash merely confirmed the fact (already known to Anderson) that the distributorship of Howard Buick Co. of San Francisco was being cancelled because of its \u201cpoor job,\u201d that Anderson \u201chad nothing to worry about\u201d as long as he \u201cdid a job.\u201d \u201cMr. Curtice will later sit down and outline to you the long range program.\u201d The letter between the parties which followed (Plaintiff\u2019s Ex. 46) confirms this conversation. Furthermore, in its charge to the jury, the court set forth in detail Mr. Anderson\u2019s version of the conversation as well as Mr. Nash\u2019s conflicting version. The court then charged that while no recovery could be based thereon, the jury could and should consider the conflicting versions in connection with their consideration of the similarly conflicting versions of the conversation of November 9, 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">Appellant made no objection and took no exception to the court\u2019s instructions in this respect and, accordingly, is barred by the provisions of Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C. from any claim that the court erred in so charging the jury. While appellant took an exception to an initial ruling made by the court for the benefit of appellant\u2019s counsel during the course of appellant\u2019s own case, appellant abandoned its contention that the July 1947 conversation constituted an independent basis of recovery by failing to object to the instructions given to the jury at the close of the entire case after appellee\u2019s evidence on the matter had been presented. Cf. National Surety Corp. v. City of Excelsior Springs, 8 Cir., 1941, 123 F.2d 573, 156 A.L.R. 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">Further, even had the telephone conversation been sufficient factually to have constituted a misrepresentation, we still have the question of Nash\u2019s authority, in view of the terms of the contract, to aet for General Motors; the matter of any intent to deceive; and the matter of any action on Anderson\u2019s part in reliance upon any alleged misrepresentation or nondisclosure by appellee. What Nash said was, at best, but an expression of opinion by him and not any misrepresentation of an existing fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">If there had been any point to be preserved, and not waived, appellant failed to preserve it by failing to object or take exception to the instruction<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> given by the court below to the jury that the written agreements barred any claim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>reliance by Anderson other than those in the agreement, unless there was a finding by the jury of business compulsion or fraud. As we have said above, the jury found that appellant\u2019s execution of the agreements had not been so induced. The appellant is precluded from now claiming error.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Appellant next urges that the court erred in instructing the jury that appellant was precluded from claiming that the distributorship, agreement of November 1, <em>1952 </em>was entered into in reliance upon alleged misrepresentation and nondisclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">As we have seen above, there had been a specific disclosure by General Motors on July 10, 1952 that after June 30, 1953 Anderson would no longer be made a wholesale distributor of Buick automobiles, but could remain as a dealer. De.spite this Anderson entered into a new eight months\u2019 contract dated November I, 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">, Whether appellant knew of any \u201cpolicy\u201d on the part of General Motors to change its distributorship system <em>before </em>1953 is immaterial, if appellant knew as a fact that General Motors was then changing its distributorship contract and would refuse to renew it with Anderson. Anderson knew this at least by July 10, 1952. If he knew of this fact, he could not have entered into any contract on .November 1, 1952, under any <em>mistaken belief </em>or <em>reliance </em>upon a contradictory fact. The court so instructed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The instruction was proper and we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">Appellant\u2019s final specification of error has to do with an item of costs. Appellee claimed as costs the price of preparing a daily transcript of proceedings at the trial. Appellant objected, and the court clerk disallowed the item, there being no stipulation in the record and no order of court making such expense a taxable cost. Cf. Local Rule 56(g) (4), United States District Court for the Western District of Washington.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-15\">On appellee\u2019s motion to retax costs,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the court made the following statement and order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-16\">\u201cThe transcript of the minutes of the trial were necessary for the use of the Court. Each trial day found the minutes on the bench and frequent reference to them was made during trial by the Court, to the knowledge of counsel. When ruling upon various motions which involved the legal sufficiency of the evidence presented, the Court referred to the trial minutes. When passing upon requests to charge and in the preparation of the charge itself, the Court had frequent occasion to examine the testimony. This was particularly so when the Court prepared its statement of the undisputed facts, as well as when the analysis of the testimony was written on matters as to which there was a conflict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-17\">\u201cEarly in the trial the Court inquired of the reporters whether the trial transcript was being secured by counsel, and was advised by the reporters that it was. The Court was furnished with a daily transcript by the reporters but at no time did the Court enter an order so providing or ask either counsel to provide the transcripts. The Court assumed that counsel had complied with the Local Rules. The minutes were necessarily obtained for use on the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>of this suit. The item on the Bill of Costs \u2018Court Reporter\u2019s Fees\u2019 is allowed to the extent of $17.05 and $2,185.00, totaling $2,202.05, and is disallowed as to the charge for copies. This memorandum shall be an order entered nunc pro tunc ordering a copy of the minutes.\u201d (Tr. Yol. II, pp. 526-527.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Was the court without authority to make such an order? We think not. We attach no significance to the fact it was made \u201cnunc pro tunc.\u201d That \u201cLatin phrase is merely descriptive of the inherent power of the court to make its records speak the truth \u2014 to record that which was actually done, but omitted to be recorded.\u201d W. F. Sebel Co. v. Hessee, 10 Cir., 1954, 214 F.2d 459, at page 462. Here the making of the order at the hearing of the motion to retax costs was within the statutory authority of the court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920. This section reads in material part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">\u201cTaxation of costs. A judge or clerk of any court of the United States may tax as costs the following: ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">\u201c(2) Fees of the court reporter for all or any part of the stenographic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">This was a carry over provision from the Court Reporters Act of 1944, 58 Stat. 5, 28 U.S.C. (1940, Supp. V) \u00a7 9a(e), which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-12\">\u201cIn the discretion of the court any part or all of the fees for transcripts may be taxed as costs in the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4i\">And see the discussion by then Chief Judge Hincks in Perlman v. Feldmann, D.C.Conn.1953, 116 F.Supp. 102, 105-09, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">The four cases cited by appellant on this point are not in conflict with our ruling.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Had any order of the trial judge been made here during the trial, including a finding of its necessity, no question as to it could be raised here. The trial judge has the right to make such an order, and only the question of his power and not any question of an abuse of discretion can be raised on appeal. W. F. &amp; John Barnes Co. v. International Harvester Co., 7 Cir., 1944, 145 F.2d 915, certiorari denied, 324 U.S. 850, 65 S.Ct. 687, 89 L.Ed. 1410; Walker v. Lee, 9 Cir., 1934, 71 F.2d 622; United States v. Knowles\u2019 Estate, 9 Cir., 1932, 58 F.2d 718. We see no good reason in law why such an order, valid if made during the trial, cannot be made at its conclusion, whether or not designated as nunc pro tunc, so long as the matter then pending remains entirely within the jurisdiction of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">We think it proper to re-emphasize the determinative issues in this case, as we see them, and as found by the able trial judge in giving his reasons for not granting a new trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>\u201cIt was plaintiff\u2019s claim that this statement [that there was no intention on the part of General Motors to terminate the distributor and dealer franchises to Anderson Buick Company, so long as it continued to penetrate the market and maintain price class performance] was false in that it was not a true and honest statement of the then present and existing policy and intention of the defendant, General Motors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\">\u201cAnderson\u2019s version of this conversation with Nash was given in great detail by him; and Nash\u2019s version was also before the jury. Again, the testimony presented a sharp conflict; a question of veracity was presented for jury determination. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel, in his summation, thus referred to it:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">\u201c \u2018This is the conflict in testimony. Now in resolving this conflict, and, of course, it is your task to resolve the conflict, you are entitled to all the help you can get from your own experience in this Court and out of it. You can look at other uncontradicted evidence which bears on this conversation. You can appraise the witnesses and you can ask yourselves was Mr. Nash a truthful witness ? Which of these two witnesses am I inclined to believe? You can ask yourselves which in logic and reason probably happened and which story is more consistent with logic and reason.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">\u201cThe jury answered these rhetorical questions of counsel by their verdict; they rejected the testimony of Anderson and accepted the testimony of Nash.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">\u201cIn the second count of the complaint, as amended, the plaintiff alleged \u2018that in the period from 1937-1941 the defendant, General Motors, formulated and adopted a policy to terminate the distributorship of the plaintiff, Anderson Buick Company, after the plaintiff had developed the market for Buick automobiles, parts and accessories in the territory assigned to it where it would be more profitable for General Motors itself to distribute; that General Motors thereafter did not disclose this plan to the Anderson Buick Company and did conceal it from that company notwithstanding the relationship of the parties which it alleged to have been of such a nature as to require disclosure.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-9\">\u201cBasic to this second claim was the plaintiff\u2019s contention that a relationship of trust and confidence existed between plaintiff and defendant by which General Motors was bound in good faith under the law to disclose to it such a policy, if it existed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-10\">\u201cPlaintiff requested the Court to charge the jury that as a matter of law such a relationship did exist; defendant requested the Court to charge the jury exactly the opposite, to wit, that as a matter of law such a relationship did not exist. The Court declined to grant either request and left the relationship to be determined by the jury, based upon the evidence of the nature of the dealings had between the plaintiff and the defendant. The instructions to the jury as to the law applicable to this phase of plaintiff\u2019s claim were neither brief nor perfunctory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-11\">\u201cIt was upon the issues thus framed by defendant\u2019s denial of these claims asserted by the plaintiff that the jury returned a general verdict for the defendant and against the plaintiff, and a special verdict which was a final disposition, adverse to plaintiff, of all of plaintiff\u2019s claims.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">Finding no error, -we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-21\">.
