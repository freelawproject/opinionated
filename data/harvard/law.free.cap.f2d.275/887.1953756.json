D.C. Code \u00a7 22-502 (1951). But it found him guilty on the companion charge of carrying the pistol which he used to defend himself. D.C.Code \u00a7 22-3204 (Supp. VII 1959). The trial judge instructed the jury that appellant was guilty of carrying a dangerous weapon if he (1) carried the gun in a public place, and (2) it was not licensed. Appellant\u2019s primary point on this appeal is that the court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>refusing to instruct the jury that he could lawfully carry the gun in order to defend himself from a reasonably entertained fear of imminent bodily harm. The nub of his argument is that a conviction for carrying an unlicensed gun, following his acquittal on the assault charge, nullifies his right to self-defense. Expressed another way, he claims that his acquittal on the assault count conclusively demonstrates that he was carrying the gun for a lawful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">There does appear to be an inconsistency between acquitting a man of assault on grounds of self-defense, and convicting him for carrying the instrument used in that defense. But the statute flatly states that \u201cNo person shall within the District of Columbia carry * * * except in his dwelling house or place of business * * * a pistol, without a license * * * \u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 22-3204 (Supp. VII 1959). As appellant correctly points out, we have previously held that one is not guilty of carrying an unlicensed gun during the period it is actually used in self-defense, Wilson v. United States, 1952, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 135, 198 F.2d 299.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But we have made it clear that this doctrine is inapplicable where one anticipating harm carries a gun for an hour or more before the danger actually arises. Dandridge v. United States, 1959, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 157, 265 F.2d 349<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">We think the facts of this case are more analogous to Dandridge. Appellant and his assailant, one Royster, had engaged in several heated encounters in the year prior to the shooting. Shortly before their last encounter, appellant had observed Royster loitering in the neighborhood and, fearing attack, he, appellant, requested police protection on <em>sev</em>eral occasions as he went about his business. He testified that on the day of the offense, he repeatedly saw Royster in the neighborhood, that Royster had used abusive language and threatened to get between him and the door of his shop, that he requested two police officers to \u201cstraighten Royster up,\u201d and that they refused, saying they were \u2018\u2018off duty\u201d or were going to see that \u201cnothing happened.\u201d About 7:00 p. m. that evening, appellant left his shop to accompany his wife home. He put a gun in his pocket because he was afraid of Royster. He stopped briefly to speak with some friends in parked cars along the street. Within a few minutes, Royster was upon him with a stick and appellant shot him in the leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">In argument before the court, appellant\u2019s counsel pointed out that this case had an important factor which was absent in both Dandridge and Wilson, namely, appellant\u2019s request for police protection. He suggests that, even if we do not find Dandridge distinguishable, we should still hold that the statute does not apply where, as here, (1) the defendant was exposed to serious current threat, (2) he did not have time to get a license, and (3) he made a serious attempt to secure police protection. This is a very appealing suggestion. But it must be directed to the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">Congress did not express itself on the possibility that an exercise of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>common law right of self-defense in certain circumstances might involve a violation of the statutory prohibition against carrying an unlicensed pistol. But in light of the history of anti-weapons legislation evidencing the clearest intent to drastically tighten the ban on carrying dangerous weapons, we cannot assume that Congress was unaware of this apparent possibility.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is not suggested that this policy raises constitutional doubts. We therefore hold that the trial court properly refused the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\">Appellant also contends that the court erred in failing to instruct the jury on \u201ccriminal intent.\u201d Presumably he means that the jury should have been told that he had to carry the gun with intent to use it unlawfully. He relies upon Levine v. United States, 1958, 104 U.S. App.D.C. 281, 261 F.2d 747; and Mullen v. United States, 1958, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 25, 263 F.2d 275, which hold that criminal intent, or an evil state of mind, is an essential ingredient in crimes derived from the common law even though the modern statutory definition fails to so specify. But carrying a dangerous weapon without a license was not an offense at common law. 3 Burdick, Law of Crime \u00a7 742 (1946). All that is needed is an intent to commit the proscribed act. State v. Cortese, 1938, 104 N.J.L. 312, 140 A. 440, 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">Although the trial judge did not charge the jury that it must find that Cooke intended to carry an unlicensed gun in a public place, appellant\u2019s trial counsel made no objection. Since Cooke testified that he intentionally put the gun in his pocket before leaving the shop, this omission from the charge does not constitute plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b936-7\">. Wilson, accompanied by two women, stopped bis car in front of a bouse. One of the women got out of the car and went in. Wilson also got out and seated himself on the right front fender of the automobile. Soon after, the woman emerged from the house followed by a disorderly group of men and women who began to attack Wilson. Efe retreated to the other side of the car, opened the door, pushed the driver\u2019s seat up, and obtained a pistol which was on the floor of the car. As he backed away from his pursuers, Wilson fired three shots, inflicting slight wounds on the. victims. -We found that he was not in violation of the statute at the time he used the gun since \u201cthe exigencies of the occasion justified Wilson in obtaining a weapon and using it in self defense.\u201d But we also held that he could be found guilty of prior possession without a license if the jury found that the gun was on or about his person while it was under the car seat.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b936-13\">. Dandridge, after his difficulty with the complainant, took his pistol from his home, put it in his waistband, and went across the street, where he sat on a . neighbor\u2019s steps for over an hour before using it in self-defense. Cf. Williams v. State, 1914, 15 Ga.App. 311, 82 S.E. 817.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b937-5\">. In 1871 a law was enacted for the District of Columbia proliibting the carrying of dangerous weapons and imposing a fine of between twenty to fifty dollars. Laws of the District of Columbia, Part II, p. 33 (1871-72).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">The statute was amended after the turn of the century to make it unlawful to conceal a gun about one\u2019s person or to carry it openly <em>with the intent to use it unlawfully. </em>Violation carried the enlarged penalty of a fifty to five hundred dollar fine or one year in prison, or both. Code of Law for the District of Columbia, Anno., \u00a7 855 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">In 1932 Congress repealed this statute and enacted what is substantially the present \u00a7 22-3201. 47 Stat. 651. The penalty was increased to a thousand dollar fine or one year in jail, or both. The requirement that the gun be carried with intent to use it illegally was eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-22\">In 1943 the statute was amended to prohibit the carrying of an unlicensed pistol openly as well as concealed. 57 Stat. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-23\">In 1958 Congress provided that any person who violates \u00a7 22-3204 and has been previously convicted of a felony may be imprisoned up to ten years. 67 Stat. 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-25\">In 1953 Congress also strengthened the anti-weapons legislation by making it unlawful to possess a knife or similar instrument \u201cwith intent to use unlawfully.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 22-3214 (b) (Supp. VII, 1959). The Municipal Court of Appeals has held that this provision does not repeal by implication those portions of \u00a7 22-3204 which make it illegal to carry many of the same weapons without regard to intent. United States v. Shannon, D.C. Mun.App.1958, 144 A.2d 267.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
