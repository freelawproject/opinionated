The plaintiff appeals. A bottle of cleaning fluid was broken in an aisle of defendant\u2019s store. A store manager testified that he promptly picked up the glass, sent for a porter to clean the floor, and stood facing the back of the store \u201cto try to keep anybody from slipping\u201d. The plaintiff, a customer, approached the place from the front of the store, slipped in the fluid, fell and was injured. We think the jury should have been allowed to decide whether the manager was or was not negligent in failing to warn the customer of the danger or guard her against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-22\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
