(PFEL) asked the District Court to set aside an order of the Federal Maritime Board and the Maritime Administrator (collectively called \u201cthe Board\u201d) denying PFEL\u2019s application for permission to operate unsubsidized vessels between the Pacific Coast and Hawaii.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The United States intervened in the District Court as a plaintiff in opposition to the Board\u2019s order. Matson Navigation Company (Mat-son), which had intervened before the Board in opposition to PFEL\u2019s application, intervened as a defendant in the District Court in support of the Board\u2019s order. These are appeals by the plaintiffs from an order of the District Court granting the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Appellant PFEL operates a subsidized service between California and the Far East, and an unsubsidized service between California and Guam. Intervenor Matson has operated in the Pacific Coast-Hawaii trade for more than 70 years and is said to carry 98% of the cargo in that trade. Matson is not subsidized directly, but operates a subsidized service to Australia through Oceanic Steamship Co., a wholly-owned subsidiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">Section 805(a) of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1223(a), forbids the payment of a subsidy to any person who, without written permission from the Board, owns or operates vessels \u201cin the domestic intercoastal or coastwise service\u201d, which of course includes the California-Hawaii trade that PFEL seeks to enter. Persons interested in an application for such permission are authorized to intervene before the Board, and the Board is required to \u201cgive a hearing to the applicant and the intervenors.\u201d The Board is not to grant permission if the Board \u201cfinds it will result in unfair competition to any person, firm, or corporation operating exclusively in the coastwise or intercoastal service or that it would be prejudicial to the objects and policy of this chapter.\u201d It is made a misdemeanor for one who has received such permission \u201cto divert, directly or indirectly, any moneys used in foreign-trade operations, for which a subsidy is paid by the United States, into any such coastwise or intercoastal operations * *</p>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">After a long hearing, the Board\u2019s examiner recommended granting PFEL\u2019s application. The Board denied it by a divided vote. The Board found that if the application were granted, PFEL \u201cwould be in a position to concentrate primarily on high value commodities, and would, in effect \u2018skim the cream\u2019 in this trade\u201d between the Pacific Coast and Hawaii; that although PFEL\u2019s competition might divert less than 10% of Matson\u2019s tonnage, \u201cthe diversion of Mat-son revenues may be substantially greater\u201d ; that the diversion \u201cwould seriously jeopardize Matson\u2019s vessel replacement program, and would impede the proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>development and continuation of Mat-son\u2019s California/Hawaii service\u201d; and that the \u201crecord fails to show the need for service in excess of that presently-provided by Matson and other existing operators\u201d. The Board concluded that \u201cto permit PFEL to carry cargoes in the California/Hawaii trade would result in unfair competition to Matson in its California/Hawaii service, an exclusively domestic service, and would be prejudicial to the objects and policy of the Act.\u201d The Board thinks \u201ca subsidized operator should not be permitted to deprive regular domestic carriers of cargoes which they need, have the capacity to carry,\u201d and to which the Board considers them \u201cfundamentally entitled\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act subjects \u201cevery agency action\u201d to judicial review, except so far as \u201c(1) statutes preclude judicial review or (2) agency action is by law committed to agency discretion * * 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1009. The Merchant Marine Act does not preclude judicial review and does not commit the Board\u2019s action to the Board\u2019s discretion. Administrative action that requires a hearing and turns on the meaning and application of statutory language is usually subject to judicial review. As in Shields v. Utah Idaho Central R. Co., 305 U.S. 177, 183, 59 S.Ct. 160, 164, 83 L.Ed. 111, \u201cThe nature of the determination points to the propriety of judicial review.\u201d Nothing in the legislative history indicates a contrary intention. Accordingly the District Court had jurisdiction of this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The Board did not find, and the evidence does not show, that PFEL would have any competitive advantage over Matson in the California-Hawaii trade because it has a subsidy in the Far East trade. As the examiner said, \u201cMatson\u2019s witness admitted that the fact that PFEL has a subsidy would not permit PFEL to obtain more cargo in competition with Matson than it would without a subsidy.\u201d The Board did not find and the record does not show that PFEL would compete fraudulently; or that it would engage in cutthroat competition, either by fixing rates below cost and using the profits of its subsidized Far East trade to carry the loss, or by paying sub-standard wages, or by using sub-standard ships, or otherwise; or .that it would compete in any way that is unfair according to accepted legal or ethical standards. The Department of Justice, on behalf of the United States, urges that competition is not \u201cunfair\u201d within the meaning of the Act when it does not involve diversion of money to unsubsidized domestic operations from subsidized foreign operations, to the disadvantage of an unsubsidized operator. Congress plainly did intend to prevent that sort of competition. We heed not consider whether it intended to prevent some other sorts as well. We think Congress clearly did not intend to prevent anything that, the Board or the evidence attributes to PFEL.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">The Board practically equated unfair competition with effective competition. But what is bad for Matson is not necessarily bad for the country. However adequate Matson\u2019s service may be, and in whatever sense Matson may \u201cneed\u201d to retain its monopoly of the California-Hawaii trade, we cannot accept the Board\u2019s view that Matson is \u201cfundamentally entitled\u201d to retain this monopoly as against a competitor that is subsidized \u2014as Matson itself is, through its subsidiary Oceanic \u2014 in a different trade. Service and need would be important if the Board were a public utility commission passing upon an application to enter a regulated field, but have nothing to do with the question whether PFEL\u2019s competition with Matson would be \u201cunfair\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">The Board has disclosed no basis for its finding that PFEL\u2019s entry into the trade would be \u201cprejudicial to the objects and policy of the Act.\u201d Preservation of Matson\u2019s monopoly is not an object or policy of the Act. On the contrary, the public interest in ending this monopoly should be considered. The Act does not exempt the California-Hawaii <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>trade from <em>the </em>anti-monopoly policy which Congress has often expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">The appellants do not ask that we reverse the Board\u2019s finding with regard to \u201cobjects and policy\u201d, but only that the case be remanded to the Board so that it may reconsider this finding and clarify it if it is retained. We are adopting this suggestion. The Board should, at least, \u201cmake the basis of its action reasonably clear. We cannot find that it did so here.\u201d Radio Station KFH Co. v. Federal Communications Commission, 101 U.S.App.D.C. 164, 166, 247 F.2d 570, 572. \u201c \u2018Something more precise is requisite in the quasi-jurisdictional findings of an administrative agency. * * * We must know what a decision means before the duty becomes ours to say whether it is right or wrong.\u2019 \u201d Secretary of Agriculture v. United States, 347 U.S. 645, 654, 74 S.Ct. 826, 832, 98 L.Ed. 1015.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The judgment is vacated, and the case is ordered to be remanded for further proceedings by the Board limited to the question whether PFEL\u2019s entry into the trade would be \u201cprejudicial to the objects and policy of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-9\">. We dismissed for want of jurisdiction a petition for direct review of the Board\u2019s order in this court, expressing no opinion as to the District Court\u2019s jurisdietion of the present suit. Pacific Far East Line v. United States, 103 U.S.App.D.C. 104, 255 F.2d 182, certiorari denied 358 U.S. 866, 79 S.Ct. 97, 3 L.Ed.2d 98.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
