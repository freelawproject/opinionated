In the second trial before Judge Murphy, the issues involving the claimed negligence of defendant, alleged to have been the proximate cause of the death of plaintiff\u2019s testate in an airplane accident, were submitted to a jury which rendered a general verdict for the defendant. Plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the resulting judgment against her asserted certain errors in the judge\u2019s charge and a prejudicial summation on the part of defense counsel. As to the latter, while counsel\u2019s argument might perhaps have been in better taste, yet we are not convinced that it contained matter likely to mislead the jury or to prevent a fair verdict. In arguing to a jury, counsel must properly have some latitude so long as prejudice does not appear. As to the former, the criticisms of the charge as to various textual details do not add up to a showing of error, since the charge as a whole constituted a fair submission to the jury of the essential issues in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-22\">The defendant has taken a protective appeal to assert error in the earlier mistrial directed by Judge Dimoek. This becomes moot in view of our conclusion as to the fairness of the second trial. But in view of the result, we think we should direct, as we do, that no costs be taxed on this appeal in favor of either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-23\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
