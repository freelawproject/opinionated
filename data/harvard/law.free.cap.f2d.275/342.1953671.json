C.E.D.Pa.1959, 177 F.Supp. 421. The plaintiffs, purporting to represent themselves and a minimum of six hundred other employees similarly situated, sued Pennsylvania Railroad Company (Railroad) and the Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and Station Employees (Brotherhood) declaring that the action was brought under the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151 and following. The plaintiffs seek a mandatory injunction to compel the Railroad to equalize wages paid to \u201ctallymen\u201d in its eastern and central regions, damages for loss of earnings, punitive damages against the Brotherhood and a return of dues collected by the Brotherhood from the plaintiffs during the period in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">The material allegations of the complaint may be summarized as follows: Plaintiffs are \u201ctallymen\u201d employed by the Railroad in its eastern region and are members of the Brotherhood; as such, they are covered by a collective bargaining agreement entered into between the Railroad and the Brotherhood on May 1, 1942. At all relevant times, they say, eastern region \u201ctallymen\u201d were paid approximately $25 per month less than their central region counterparts. This geographic differential in pay was the subject of a dispute. It is claimed that an \u201cagreement\u201d (reduced to writing in a letter attached to the complaint) was entered into in 1950 removing the differential. The letter also provided for the elimination of certain tonnage rates (the exact nature of which is not made clear by the complaint) in the eastern region. Despite this \u201cagreement,\u201d it is alleged, the pay rates were never equalized, although tonnage payments to the eastern region \u201ctallymen\u201d were eliminated. The Brotherhood, it is charged, has never taken any steps to compel the Railroad to abide by its new \u201cagreement\u201d because \u201cthe Pennsylvania Railroad Company could control union officers at will.\u201d Accordingly, plaintiffs bring this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-15\">A seemingly insurmountable defense of the Railroad to this suit is Section 3, First (i) of the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 153, First (i). This section provides for the referring of unresolved disputes \u201cbetween an employee or group of employees and a carrier or carriers growing out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements concerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions,\u201d to the appropriate division of the National Railroad Adjustment Board. Beginning with Slocum v. Delaware, L. &amp; W. R. R., 1950, 339 U.S. 239, 244, 70 S.Ct. 577, 94 L.Ed. 795 and Order of Ry. Conductors v. Southern Ry., 1950, 339 U.S. 255, 70 S.Ct. 585, 94 L.Ed. 811, the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Court has held that primary jurisdiction in such cases as these lies in the Board and not in the courts, state or federal. See Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Day, 1959, 360 U.S. 548, 79 S.Ct. 1322, 3 L.Ed.2d 1422 and Union Pac. R. R. Co. v. Price, 1959, 360 U.S. 601, 79 S.Ct. 1351, 3 L. Ed.2d 1460, for the most recent reiterations and applications of this rule. The plaintiffs, themselves, acknowledge that \u201cdisputes between carriers and their employees as to interpretation of existing agreements must be referred to the National Railroad Adjustment Board.\u201d Plaintiffs argue that this litigation does not involve an interpretation of an existing agreement. In spite of the many words used in arguing this point, we think it has no merit. If plaintiffs have any claim at all against the Railroad it must be because of existing \u201cagreements\u201d between the Brotherhood and the Railroad; the allegation that the Brotherhood has permitted the Railroad to ignore the \u201cagreements\u201d does not remove this case from the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. This point alone would be sufficient to require dismissal of the complaint against the Railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">There is an additional reason why plaintiffs\u2019 basic claim against the Railroad must fall. That cause of action is based solely on a contract. According to the complaint,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that contract is embodied in a letter written by the General Chairman of the Brotherhood\u2019s Pennsylvania Railroad System Board of Adjustments to W. L. Nancarrow, General Manager of the Railroad\u2019s eastern region, under date of April 21, 1950. This letter is attached to the complaint and its authenticity is not denied by the defendants. The letter must be quoted in full because this is the peg upon which the plaintiffs hang their case. It says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">\u201cDear Sir:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">\u201cThis refers to your letter of April 7, 1950 which is in connection with our letter of January 21, 1949 filing formal notice in accordance with the procedures of the Railway Labor Act and our initial meeting held on February 15, 1949 with respect to our desire to abrogate the agreement of July 29, 1941 with respect to tonnage rates of pay applicable to certain positions at Philadelphia Transfer, Philadelphia Terminal Division, and to substitute in lieu thereof a new agreement to be effective as of March 1, 1949. \u201cWe quote from your letter:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-11\">\u201c 'We have given very careful consideration to your proposal in this matter; and, in view of the pronounced decrease in the total amount of tonnage handled, and because of the changed present day conditions, at the Philadelphia Transfer, we are of the opinion that it would be of mutual benefit to both Management and the Employees if the tonnage rates were eliminated entirely at this location.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-12\">\u201cIn accordance with our discussion at our meeting in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on April 18, 1950 we are agreeable to your suggestion. This is based on our understanding that the rate of pay for tallymen in the Eastern Region will be changed to the same rate of pay that is in effect in the Central Region, that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>$269.17 a month, and further, that the same considerations attendant to such monthly rated employees in the Central Region will be granted these employees. We suggest that this entire arrangement be made effective as of May 1, 1950.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ake\">\u201cWill you please advise if you concur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC7\">\u201cYours truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">\u201cs/S. Y. W. Loehr</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJRI\">\u201cGeneral Chairman\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A75\"> Wo think no amount of discovery, deposition or other procedural device can make this letter into a contract. The district judge described it as \u201ca mere offer or, possibly, a counter offer,\u201d 177 F. Supp. at page 428. We are sure it is no more than that and would be inclined to say it is simply an invitation for further comment from the' Railroad official to whom it is addressed. It is perfectly clear that an interpretation of a writing is for the court. An examination of this writing reveals plainly that it is not an acceptance under general principles of contract law<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or under the decisions of Pennsylvania courts <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in which state this letter was composed, mailed and received. We reiterate that no amount of discovery can turn a letter which on its face is not a contract into one.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">If the plaintiffs claim that the provisions of the earlier agreement have not been lived up to, they may make their claims to the Railroad Adjustment Board, assuming that the claims would still be timely. Individual claimants may present such claims to the board.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-18\">Whether or not plaintiffs\u2019 allegations against the Brotherhood are sufficient to state a cause of action under the Railway Labor Act and the line of cases stemming from Steele v. Louisville &amp; N. R. R., 1944, 323 U.S. 192, 65 S.Ct. 226, 89 L.Ed. 173, we need not decide <em>here. </em>The reason is that the plaintiffs have failed to allege exhaustion of their remedies within the union or an adequate reason for failure to do so. They say that their complaint \u201chas gone unheeded by all echelons of the Brotherhood since 1951,\u201d but nowhere is there an allegation that they have attempted to pursue remedies available to them within the Brotherhood\u2019s internal structure. Recent Pennsylvania decisions<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> show us that this Brotherhood does indeed provide internal remedies which appear adequate. In a case such as this, exhaustion of internal union remedies (absent an adequate reason for failure to do so) is a prerequisite to suit. Both Pennsylvania <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Federal<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> authorities support this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Without going into all the other bases of defense brought before both the district court and this Court, we think it abundantly clear that the judgment of the district court was correct and the decision will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b392-5\">. Paragraph VIII of the complaint reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">\u201cThis arbitrary differential, based on geography alone, was the subject of a dispute between the plaintiffs and the defendant railroad company and finally, S. Y. W. Loehr, General Chairman of the Pennsylvania Railroad System Board of Adjustment of the defendant Brotherhood proceeded to negotiate a settlement of the dispute \u2014 in accordance with the grievance processing machinery of the Railway Labor Act \u2014 and on August 1, 1951 an agreement was consummated by Mr. Loehr on behalf of the plaintiffs and Mr. Stewart, Superintendent of Stations &amp; Transfer on behalf of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. In substance the defendant railroad company agreed to pay \u201ctallymen\u201d on the Eastern Region the same monthly rate of pay then prevailing on the Central Region. Fringe benefits were likewise equalized between the two regions. This understanding between the Brotherhood and the carrier was reduced to writing as was the custom in like matters by a letter from Mr. Loehr to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company confirming the change in rate of pay. This letter is attached hereto and marked Exhibit \u2018A\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b393-7\">.
