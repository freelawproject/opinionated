The suit was the usual type for a patent infringement. The case went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>through the process of discovery and there was a pre-trial conference and a pre-trial order. Facts appeared on which the defendant based a claim of misuse of patents and other matters. Following the pre-trial conference, the plaintiff moved to dismiss and the court granted the motion to dismiss but with prejudice. The court denied the defendant counsel fees under 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 285. Such an award is necessarily one based upon the court\u2019s discretion and its consideration of what constitutes an exceptional case under the statute cited. We do not think that the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion against such an award in this instance is one which we can say constituted an abuse of that discretion. The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
