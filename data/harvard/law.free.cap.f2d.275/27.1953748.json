In 1947, he acquired, at a cost of $15,000, a co-ownership interest in a property in Pittsburgh occupied as a parking lot. The lot was 80 by 180 feet. It had on it only a small frame building adaptable for use in the operation of a parking lot. The property was filled, graded and blaektopped. It was served by the usual utilities\u2014 water, gas, electricity and telephone. It also had a railroad siding which was unused. In 1923, and for an undisclosed period thereafter prior to 1947, the property was used as a coal yard. Neighboring properties were industrial in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-18\">At the time taxpayer acquired his interest in the Pittsburgh property it was under lease as a parking lot. It remained so during the entire period of his co-ownership under annual leases which provided that the property could be used only for parking purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-19\">In 1952, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania condemned the Pittsburgh property and taxpayer was awarded $57,477' \u2014an excess of $42,477 over his $15,000 cost. Subsequently, he sought to acquire an industrial property of similar size in Pittsburgh but was unable to find any \u201cto accommodate my [his] desires\u201d. However, he found available, in the City of New Castle, Pennsylvania, about fifty miles from Pittsburgh, a 9% acre tract, industrially zoned, owned by the American Can Company. It had on it a two-story 694 x 80 feet building of brick and wood construction with concrete and wood floors, equipped with elevators, sprinkler and heating systems. It also had an engine room, garages and lumber shed. A part of the tract was surfaced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>with blacktop and cinders and was used for parking purposes by executives, employees and customers of a corporation conducting business on an adjacent property; another part had cinder surfacing for use in parking incidental to unloading shipments by rail on two Baltimore &amp; Ohio sidings which served the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Coincident with his learning of the availability of the New Castle property taxpayer also ascertained that the Federal Civil Defense Administration (\u201cAdministration\u201d) had previously considered leasing it but had not done so because of the physical condition of the buildings. He thereupon entered into negotiations with Administration to lease the property and obtained a lease commitment provided certain repairs, alterations and improvements were made. Taxpayer then negotiated the purchase of the property by the Arsenal Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation, from the American Can Company at a price of $155,000, of which $105,000 was represented by a mortgage on the property to the American Can Company. Thereafter, in August, 1953, taxpayer purchased all of the stock of the Arsenal Corporation for $64,029. At the time the New Castle property was the Arsenal's sole asset. Subsequently, Arsenal leased the New Castle property to Administration on a year-to-year basis for use for warehouse purposes and expended approximately $100,000 in making the repairs and improvements called for by the lease commitment. The rental paid by Administration did not include any amount as a charge for its use of the property for parking purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">In determining the tax deficiency in issue, the Commissioner determined that taxpayer was not entitled to the benefits of the \u201cnonrecognition of gain\u201d provisions of Section 112(f), and, accordingly that the gain of $42,477 realized from the condemnation of taxpayer\u2019s interest in the Pittsburgh property constituted long-term capital gain taxable in 1953. The Tax Court agreed on the ground that the New Castle property, acquired by taxpayer through stock ownership of the Arsenal Corporation, was not property \u201csimilar or related in service or use\u201d to the Pittsburgh property within the meaning of Section 112(f). This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">The sum of taxpayer\u2019s contention here is that he \u201cis in the business of investing-in industrial real estate for the purpose of producing income therefrom\u201d and since \u201cboth the condemned property and the replacement property were industrial properties which served the same function, use and purpose\u201d to him, to wit, \u201cproducing rental income therefrom\u201d that the purchased property is \u201csimilar or related in service or use\u201d to the one converted within the meaning of Section 112(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">There are then two arrows in the quiver of taxpayer\u2019s contention: (1) it is the \u201cservice or use\u201d to which he put his money for the production of rental income in the two properties involved, rather than the \u201cservice or use\u201d which the properties were designed to afford, or their physical characteristics, which is dispositive; and (2) the two properties were in fact similar in \u201cservice or use\u201d in that they are both \u201cindustrial properties\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">The Tax Court erred, says the taxpayer, in disregarding the factors stated, and applying instead a \u201cfunctional test\u201d to establish whether the Pittsburgh and New Castle properties were \u201csimilar or related in service or use\u201d, viz., the \u201cpurpose\u201d or nature of the properties themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">We do not subscribe to taxpayer\u2019s contention that the nonrecognition of gain provisions of Section 112(f) are available to him simply because both properties were used by him for the same \u201cuse\u201d \u2014 the production of rental income. Nor do we agree with him that the two properties are \u201cindustrial\u201d and thus \u201csimilar or related in service or use\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-13\">The fact that taxpayer \u201cused\u201d the money invested in the old and new properties for the similar purpose of producing rental income does not bring into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>play the nonrecognition of gain provisions of Section 112(f), and is impertinent to its application.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">The statute provides in two separate sub-sections that in order to qualify for its nonrecognition of gain relief there must be a \u201cconversion into similar property\u201d and \u201csimilar property\u201d is defined as \u201csimilar or related in service or use to the property so converted\u201d. The subsections referred to are (f) (1) and (f) (3) (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Sub-section (f) (1) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARI\"><em>\u201cConversion into similar property. </em>Into property similar or related in service or use to the property so converted * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Sub-section (f) (3) (A) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">\u201cNonrecognition of Gain. If the taxpayer during period specified in subparagraph (B), for the purpose of replacing the property so converted, purchases <em>other property similar or related in service or use to the property so converted </em>* * *\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-9\">Section 112(f) is not concerned with \u201cwhy\u201d taxpayer invests the proceeds of the converted property, but only \u201chow\u201d he does so, viz., into \u201csimilar or related in service or use\u201d property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">That brings us to consideration of taxpayer\u2019s contention that the Pittsburgh and New Castle properties are \u201csimilar\u201d because, he says, they are both \u201cindustrial\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">We cannot subscribe to this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"Asi\">First, we do not think that the Pittsburgh parking lot property can be considered \u201cindustrial\u201d because the word \u201cindustrial\u201d in its accepted connotation denotes \u201cthe processes or products of manufacture, or commercial production in general\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By no stretch of the imagination can the use of a lot for the public parking of cars be considered an \u201cindustrial\u201d use. On the other hand, the New Castle property, in its state prior to its acquisition by taxpayer and subsequent thereto, was within the classification of \u201cindustrial\u201d property.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-15\">We next consider the question as to whether the Pittsburgh and New Castle properties were otherwise \u201csimilar or related in service or use\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-16\">Taking first the Pittsburgh property:</p>\n<p id=\"b78-17\">It was 80 x 180 feet in size, filled, graded and blacktopped, and had on it \u201ca small frame building which was adaptable for use only in the operation of a parking lot\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The property had been leased and used for public parking prior to taxpayer\u2019s acquisition of an interest in it in 1947; it continued so under his ownership for some five years until the condemnation in 1952. There is not even a contention that taxpayer prior to the condemnation had planned to change the physical character of the Pittsburgh property or its use. Thus, the conclusion is inescapable that the \u201cservice or use\u201d of this property was as a public parking lot and that only.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-18\">As to the New Castle property:</p>\n<p id=\"b78-19\">It was more than nine acres in size and had erected on it these structures: a two-story building, 694 x 80 feet in dimension, equipped with elevators, sprinkler and heating systems; an engine room building, garages and lumber shed. While an undisclosed portion of the property was surfaced with blacktop and cinder and was used for parking purposes by an adjacent factory, it is clear that this was not merely a \u201cparking lot\u201d property. It may be noted, parenthetically, that the parking by the adjacent factory ceased after taxpayer\u2019s acquisition and the entire tract was \u201cfenced-in\u201d. Further, while the record does not disclose whether the American Can Company used the property for warehousing purposes during its ownership or occupancy, the record establishes that taxpayer (via Arsenal Corporation) leased the property to the Civil Defense Administration solely for warehouse purposes and further that $100,000 was expended in making repairs, alterations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>and improvements to the property to make it usable for such purposes. Indeed, taxpayer did not (via Arsenal) buy the New Castle property until he had obtained a commitment for its rental to the Administration as a \u201cwarehouse\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">In summary, then, the Pittsburgh property was suitable and used for public parking lot purposes and the New Castle property was suitable and used for warehouse purposes. Clearly they were not \u201csimilar\u201d properties, physically or otherwise, nor were they \u201csimilar or related in service or use\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">It would serve no useful purpose to review the numerous cases in which the courts have dealt with \u201cnonrecognition of gain\u201d since in each instance they were decided on their particular facts, except with respect to Steuart Brothers, Inc. v. Commissioner, 4 Cir., 1958, 261 F.2d 580 on which taxpayer premises his contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">In Steuart the converted real estate was held for rental purposes and the-proceeds of the condemnation were reinvested in real estate so as to produce rental income.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Fourth Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>granted nonrecognition of gain on its holding that (at page 584) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-4\">\u201cIn our view the taxpayer * * * is entitled to the benefit of the statute because the original real estate was held by it for investment purposes and the proceeds of the condemnation were reinvested in real estate of the same general class\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">In doing so it drew a distinction between situations where the taxpayer had himself used both the converted property and its replacement and those where both the old and new properties were held by the taxpayer for investment purposes and not \u201cused\u201d by him. It indicated that the \u201cfunctional test\u201d applied in the first instance but not in the second, and that in the latter the test was simply whether the two properties were in \u201cthe same general class\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The Court\u2019s finding in Steuart that there the converted real estate and its replacement were \u201cof the same general class\u201d is of course an ultimate finding of fact with which we are not here concerned, although as fact-finders often do, we might have arrived at an opposite determination on the score of such classification. Insofar however, as the test of classification was motivated by the Court\u2019s view that different standards are to be applied in such classification because of the status of the owners of the propertes \u2014 investors versus users\u2014 we must say that we cannot discern in Section 112(f) any basis for the application of varying standards in determining whether there has been a \u201cconversion into similar property\u201d or whether the replacement property is \u201csimilar or related in service or use to the property so converted\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">There remains for consideration the Commissioner\u2019s contention that the Pittsburgh property was \u201cunimproved\u201d whereas the New Castle property was \u201cimproved\u201d thus calling into play the provisions of Treasury Regulations 118, Sec. 39.112(f)-l(c) (9) which state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">\u201cThere is no investment in property similar in character and devoted to a similar use if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-10\">\u201c(i) The proceeds of unimproved real estate, taken upon condemnation proceedings, are invested in improved real estate\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">In support of his contention that the parking lot is \u201cunimproved\u201d property Commissioner cites Feist v. Fifth Avenue Bank, 1939, 280 N.Y. 189, 20 N.E. 2d 388, 389, where it was held that \u201cimproved\u201d real estate is \u201c * * * land which * * * is substantially enhanced in value by some probably durable structural improvement\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-14\">We deem it unnecessary here to consider this contention because of our view that the Pittsburgh and New Castle properties were not similar or related in service or use within the meaning of Section 112(f), irrespective of the question as to whether the Pittsburgh property was \u201cimproved\u201d or \u201cunimproved\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-15\">For the reasons stated the Decision of the Tax Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b76-8\">.

As stipulated by the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b79-6\">. In Steuart Brothers, Ine. v. Commissioner, taxpayer, a corporation, was engaged in the business of acquiring improved and unimproved realty for investment purposes. In 1948 it purchased a four and one-half acre tract of commercially zoned land in Washington and subsequently planned to improve the land with two warehouse properties and negotiated their leasing to two different parties. It was, however, unable to proceed with construction because of the imminence of condemnation proceedings which did in fact ensue. The proceeds of the condemnation were used by the taxpayer to acquire three properties. One of the properties was occupied in part by a one-story building used as automobile salesrooms, garage and service station and the remainder used as a parking and used car lot. The entire property was under a lease to an automobile dealer. The second property was improved in part with two one-story buildings used as automobile showrooms, automotive repair shop, garage and service station and the remainder as a parking and used car lot. This property, too, was leased to an automobile dealer. The third property was improved with a two-story building used as a service station prior to taxpayer\u2019s purchase and subsequent to it by the operator of a fleet of taxicabs.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">In deciding that the condemned tract was of the \u201csame general class\u201d and therefore similar within the meaning of Section 112(f) to the three properties which replaced it, the Court said at pages 582-583:</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">\u201c * * * The taxpayer\u2019s vacant land * * * had been definitely committed by contract to specific uses, which should be compared with the uses to which the land purchased with the proceeds of the condemnation award was actually devoted. Two buildings were designed for the original tract: (1) a one-story building to be leased to and used by a retail grocery store, and (2) a one-story warehouse to be leased to the Manor Beal Estate and Trust Company. The new properties were devoted generally to usages of the automobile business, the Rhode Island and Third Street properties were automobile showroom, repair shop, garage-service station, and parking lot by an automobile dealer; the Fourteenth Street property as a service station by the operator of a fleet of taxicabs. A comparison between these nses would be relevant if the taxpayer itself had used or intended to use the original land for the planned purposes and later, after the condemnation, had itself used the new land in the same way as its tenants used it. But the taxpayer was not in possession and did not itself actually use the newly acquired properties for any purpose. It held them for an investment exactly as it had previously held the condemned properties; and it is manifest that the purpose of the statute will be served if the taxpayer is not compelled at this time to recognize the gain which it was compelled to realize by the condemning power.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-13\">And at page 584:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-14\">\u201cThe Tax Court cites a number of decisions in which it found that the required similarity of use did not exist; but in these cases the use of the property by the taxpayer itself before the involuntary conversion took place was compared with the use of the new property by the taxpayer itself thereafter. There was no comparison of investments in real estate held by the taxpayer before and after the conversion, but not used by the taxpayer itself. In our view the taxpayer * * * is entitled to the benefit of the statute because the original real estate was held\u2019 by it for investment purposes and the proceeds of the condemnation were reinvested in real estate of the same general class.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
