A co-defendant, Calvin Johnson, did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">The evidence in the case is singular in several respects; first there were eyewitnesses who came on the scene as the assault on the victim was taking place; secondly the witnesses were police officers who immediately apprehended two of the three assailants, one of them the appellant. Hence no problem of identification of appellant exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">Two police officers testified they were cruising in the 500 block of 4th Street, S. W. at about midnight when their headlights fell on two men engaged in holding another on the sidewalk while a third was going through the pockets of the victim. As the police car turned into the scene, one attacker, who had been rifling the victim\u2019s pockets, fled and was not apprehended. Police picked up the other two; one of them, Calvin Johnson, was convicted along with appellant but did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">Police found the victim, James Davis, unconscious and bleeding. On recovering he said he had been walking down the street and on turning to see who was approaching him he was struck down and knocked unconscious. He was bleeding from wounds about his mouth. He could not identify the attackers. Later at the police station Davis told police he had been robbed of $39.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">Appellant and Calvin Johnson at the scene told officers they were simply walking down the street when they discovered Davis lying prone on the sidewalk and stopped because they were \u201cjust curious to see why he was there.\u201d Calvin Johnson\u2019s knuckles had a fresh cut which he said he had suffered by hitting them on a lamppost.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">Appellant and his companion were taken to the police station, searched and booked on a charge of investigation of robbery. No money was found on them. About an hour after their detention, appellant and Calvin Johnson gave a different account of the events. According to this second version they were walking behind Davis when the latter suddenly turned on them belligerently, asking \u201cWhat are you following me for.\u201d Davis then advanced on them threateningly but suddenly fell to the ground, injuring his mouth. Appellant and Calvin Johnson said no other person was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">At trial still a third version of events was given by the appellant. In this version appellant said Davis came up <em>behind them </em>and bumped <em>them </em>and began an argument, struck at appellant and fell to the sidewalk as he did so. Appellant said they were simply departing to avoid trouble when the police came.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-12\">The testimony of the police is in direct conflict with all versions of the events given by appellant and his co-defendant. The disputed issues of fact were submitted to the jury under proper instructions and a verdict of guilty was returned. Each of the co-defendants was sentenced 2 to 6 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-13\"> The issues raised on this appeal as now disclosed by the full record before us are so insubstantial as not to warrant extended discussion. Only two need be mentioned. The admission of appellant\u2019s statement to police at the precinct station about an hour after being booked is assigned as error under Rule 5(a), Fed.R.Crim.P., 18 U.S.C. However, no objection was made by the defense when these statements were offered. Gilliam v. United States, 1958, 103 U.S.App.D.C. 181, 257 F.2d 185, certiorari denied 1959, 359 U.S. 947, 79 S.Ct. 728, 3 L.Ed.2d 680. They were merely statements by which appellant and his co-defendant sought to exculpate themselves and indeed were utilized by appellant to try to make out a theory of \u201cself-defense.\u201d They were so similar to other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>statements relied upon by appellant that, in any event, their admission did not amount to prejudicial error, if arguendo, it was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Another assigned error is the prosecution\u2019s closing argument in which the government characterized the defense in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-5\">\u201cIn other words, these two men [defendants] thought they were in danger of serious bodily harm, and for that reason they struck and knocked this man down * * * and walked away and left him there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">Appellant immediately objected, pointing out that no one testified to witnessing an actual blow struck in self-defense. The court sustained the objection and ordered the statements stricken. The prosecutor then disclaimed to the jury any intent to mislead, claiming he was merely</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-7\">\u201crelying on the logical inference in the case. They [defendants] did not make a statement that they struck this man in self-defense or they were in fear of bodily harm, and I did not intend to convey that to you, ladies and gentlemen. It was only inference I was trying to say could be drawn therefrom. But I think the testimony is that they struck the man. He did fall to the street, and they left him there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">No further objection was taken by defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">These latter statements to which no objection was made do not amount to reversible error. Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s language was plainly nothing more than an expression of his opinion about the content of the evidence, \u201cBut <em>I think </em>the testimony is * * (Emphasis added.) The record as a whole fully warrants a conclusion that <em>some </em>person or persons \u201cstruck the man\u201d knocked him down and <em>some </em>persons, namely the co-defendants, held him while the unidentified elusive confederate rifled the victim\u2019s pockets. It was in this latter posture that appellant and his co-defendant were seen by the police officers under their headlights only seconds before they were apprehended; and as we noted, when apprehended, one of the co-defendants was found to have a fresh cut on his knuckles and the victim bleeding from fresh cuts about his mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">Other assigned errors are too insubstantial to warrant comment; some were not made the subject of timely objections and are not of a character to warrant review as \u201cplain error\u201d under Rule 52 (b), Fed.R.Crim.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b948-14\">EDGERTON, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AqQ5\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-15\">Two police detectives cruising in a squad car, at night, saw one Davis lying on a sidewalk. One of the detectives testified that appellant, a co-defendant, and a third man who ran away and was not apprehended, were \u201cstanding over\u201d Davis; that the defendants were \u201cholding the man by his shoulder\u201d; and that the third man was \u201cgoing through [Davis\u2019s] pockets.\u201d The other detective, who was on the side of the car nearest the scene, saw that the defendants \u201cwere over the man\u201d, \u201cwere bent down over him\u201d, but \u201ccouldn\u2019t say what they were doing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b948-16\">The defendants were arrested walking away from the scene. Neither had the money Davis missed.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-17\">The opinion of the court describes the officers as \u201ceyewitnesses who came on the scene as the assault on the victim was taking place\u201d and \u201cimmediately apprehended two of the three assailants.\u201d But neither officer, and no other witness, saw the appellant or anyone else strike Davis. Davis himself was unable to identify anyone as having struck him.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-18\">In his closing argument, the prosecutor made these statements regarding the testimony: \u201cOfficer Wesley said that they [the defendants] said they found a man lying on the street, found him lying on the street. They later changed that story to say the man turned around and asked him [sic] why was he following him, and reached in his pocket and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>it\u2019s the old story about they thought the man was going to strike them. In other words, <em>these two men thought they were in danger of serious bodily harm, and for that reason they struck and knocked this man down </em>on the street and walked away and left him there.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Defense counsel then said: \u201cI am going to ask that that statement be stricken because there was no testimony, as I recall, that Davis was struck in self-defense.\u201d This colloquy followed: \u201cThe Court: Will you read Mr. Blackwell\u2019s statement. (The statement in question was read by the reporter.) Mr, Ochipinti: I don\u2019t remember any such testimony they made to the officers. The Court: I will sustain your objection. The statement will be stricken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">But the prosecutor did not let the matter drop. He went on: \u201cWell, ladies and gentlemen, it wasn\u2019t my desire to mislead you that these defendants made any such statement. I was just only relying on the logical inference in the case. They did not make a statement that they struck this man in self-defense or they were in fear of bodily harm, and I did not intend to convey that to you, ladies and gentlemen. It was only inference I was trying to say could be drawn therefrom. <em>But I think the testimony is that they struck the man.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus the prosecutor told the jury that \u201cself-defense\u201d was \u201conly inference\u201d but that \u201cthey struck the man\u201d was \u201ctestimony\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">I have pointed out that there was no such testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">The accusatory and prejudicial part of the statement which the prosecutor had previously made, and which had been stricken on counsel\u2019s objection, was to the effect that the defendants said \u201cthey struck and knocked this man down * -x- The purported explanation, self-defense, which the prosecutor attributed to them, was not accusatory or prejudicial; on the contrary, it was exculpatory. No one could possibly have imagined that defense counsel\u2019s objection was aimed, and aimed exclusively, at the exculpatory part of the prosecutor\u2019s statement. It was obviously aimed at the accusatory and prejudicial part. The prosecutor proceeded to repeat that part in other words. The \u201ctestimony\u201d, he said, \u201cis that they struck the man.\u201d Defense counsel\u2019s objection, which he had just made, applied alike to the first form of the prosecutor\u2019s statement and to the second. It was therefore unnecessary for counsel to repeat his objection. We need not invoke F.R.Crim.P. Rule 52(b), which provides that \u201cPlain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">If anything had made it certain that the defendants struck the man, the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement \u201cthe testimony is that they struck the man\u201d might, perhaps, have been harmless. But it was by no means certain that the defendants struck the man, and the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement was by no means harmless. The evidence left it completely uncertain who, if anyone, had struck Davis. We cannot assume that no juror believed what the prosecutor said, or that no juror\u2019s vote was affected by this belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-13\">The case was by no means open and shut. The events happened at night. Particularly since the officer who had the best opportunity to see what the defendants were doing \u201ccouldn\u2019t say what they were doing\u201d, a jury might have a reasonable doubt whether they v/ere holding the man or merely looking at him. It was indispensable to the prosecution\u2019s case that the jury be led to believe the testimony of the only witness who said the defendants were holding the man, for there was no other strong evidence that they robbed him. Obviously the jury was more likely to believe the defendants held him if it believed they previously struck him. The prosecutor\u2019s misstatement, made in closing argument, may well have left the jury with the exceedingly damaging and wholly erroneous impression that a witness had seen the defendants strike Davis. In my opinion this made \u201cprejudice to the cause of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>accused * * * so highly probable that [the court] is not justified in assuming its non-existence.\u201d Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 89, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">\u201cIt is well settled that the jury\u2019s consideration in a case should be limited to those matters actually brought out in evidence and that summation should not be used to put before the jury facts not actually presented in evidence. This doctrine is especially important in criminal trials: the prosecutor represents \u2018a sovereignty whose obligation is to govern impartially.\u2019 Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 633, 79 L.Ed. 1314. As [that case] suggests, this obligation may cause a jury to place more confidence in the word of a United States Attorney than in that of an ordinary member of the Bar.\u201d United States v. Spangelet, 2 Cir., 1958, 258 F.2d 338, 342. Cf. Stewart v. United States, 101 U.S.App.D.C. 51, 55-56, 247 F.2d 42, 46-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">This case is unlike Allen v. United States, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 350, 273 F.2d 85, where the prosecutor\u2019s statement about testimony was only a prediction made in his opening argument and, moreover, concerned a relatively minor matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">I think we should reverse the conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
