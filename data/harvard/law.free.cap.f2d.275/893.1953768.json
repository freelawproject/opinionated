The appellant urges that the application showed false dates of first use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>trademark, that the representations in the application of use on the designated products are not supported by the facts, and that the judgment appealed from is therefore erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Upon consideration of the record, we reject the Commissioner\u2019s contentions and agree with the findings and conclusions of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
