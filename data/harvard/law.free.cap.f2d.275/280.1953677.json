The jury rendered a verdict for defendants, and plaintiffs brought this appeal, claiming several errors in the conduct of the trial and in the charge of the court. The only allegations of error which we regard as possessing any merit relate to the cross-examination of DiBari and the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>failure properly to charge on the doctrine of imputed negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Appellants claim that the certain questions put by defendants\u2019 counsel during the cross-examination of DiBari improperly implied that DiBari had suffered a previous injury to his foot in 1952, four years prior to the accident in question. As DiBari conceded that he \u201cprobably did\u201d suffer such an injury, we cannot see how it could have been error to have asked these questions. Nor do we think that defendants\u2019 counsel was under any obligation to further pursue this line of questioning. Upon redirect examination, appellants\u2019 counsel could have explored this line of inquiry to demonstrate the absence or nature of the prior injury. Moreover, counsel might have resolved the situation by requesting the court to require a showing of the basis for the line of inquiry pursued by defendants\u2019 counsel. In any event, since this line of inquiry related primarily to the extent of DiBari\u2019s damages, we doubt that it could have measurably affected the jury\u2019s verdict for the defendants on the question of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">As to the judge\u2019s charge to the jury, we find error as to Rubin which requires reversal of the verdict against him. Concededly, the judge should have charged the jury in accordance with the governing New York law, that while the contributory negligence of DiBari, the driver, would bar recovery by him and Castellano, the owner of the truck, it would not bar recovery by Rubin, a helper riding in the truck. Doctoroff v. Metropolitan St. Ry. Co., 1907, <em>55 </em>Misc. 216, 105 N.Y.S. 229; Restatement, Torts \u00a7\u00a7 485, 491 Comment (d) (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Thus the only question before us is whether counsel sufficiently advised the court of this principle of law. The court charged the jury that if it found DiBari guilty of contributory negligence it should find for the defendants. At the conclusion of the charge, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel took exception \u201cto that gprtion of your Honor\u2019s charge wherein you stated that if the jury found the plaintiff DiBari guilty of contributory negligence that the other plaintiffs could not recover.\u201d The court overruled the exception and gave no further charge. We think this exception was sufficiently explicit to comply with Rule 51, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> at least where as here the court was sitting in the state of the governing law. It was thus reversible error for the trial judge not to instruct the jury that DiBari\u2019s contributory negligence would not bar recovery by Rubin.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Affirmed as to DiBari and Castellano; reversed as to Rubin.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-18\">. \u201cNo party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objections.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
