After entering findings of fact and conclusions of law in favor of the Commissioner, the District Judge dismissed the action, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-16\">Macy, claiming to have invented an electrical connector, swore to and filed his application dated December 23, 1946, which was assigned to AMP, Inc. Patent No. 2,600,012 was issued to the latter on June 10, 1952. Macy had disclosed but had not claimed in his described Figure 19 the application of an F-crimp through a plastic sleeve. Without more, the Patent Office argues, the unclaimed subject matter passed into the public domain one year after the issue date.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-17\">Pierce on August 19, 1948, swore to and filed application No. 46967 claiming that <em>he </em>was the inventor of the unclaimed subject matter disclosed by Maey\u2019s described Figure 19. AMP, Inc. claims in essence that as co-assignee of Macy and Pierce, it was entitled to decide which of its two assignors was the prior inventor, and that the Patent Office was bound by its election.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-18\">The Macy patent having been issued on June 10, 1952, was cited by the examiner on January 16, 1953. He noted that Pierce\u2019s claims were fully met by Macy\u2019s described Figure 19. Macy thus became a reference for everything shown as of his filing date in 1946 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> unless Pierce or his assignee could \u201cswear back\u201d of Macy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On June 22, 1953, AMP, Inc., in response to the Office action of January 16, 1953, for the first time disclosed itself as assignee of Pierce. It then argued that the subject matter of Figure 19 was \u201cclearly not claimed\u201d in Macy and had been invented by Pierce. It urged that as common assignee, it was entitled to its patent on what Macy had claimed and entitled further to a patent on what Pierce had claimed. The Patent Office Tribunals in 1956 ruled adversely to AMP, Inc. The latter then could have pursued an appeal to the Court of Cus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>toms and Patent Appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1542 (1958). It there could have secured a ruling as to whether or not there had been adequate compliance with the appropriately applicable rule. Instead, AMP, Incorporated, sought relief in the District Court in a trial <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">We have pointed out that a Patent Office finding as to priority of invention must be accepted as controlling except that \u201cif the decision of the Patent Office is not warranted on the evidence before it, or if the new evidence reaches the necessary standard, the District Court may rule as the totality of the evidence may require.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"APZ4\">At the trial it clearly appeared that the Macy and Pierce applications were co-pending from 1948 to 1952. Both had been prepared by Mr. Safford, a patent attorney representing AMP, Inc. Although Patent Office Rule 79 authorizes a common assignee to protect itself in a situation such as this, AMP, Inc. filed no amendment to the Macy application.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There was no insertion in the Macy application that Pierce \u2014 not Macy \u2014 was the inventor of the subject matter of the described Figure 19. When questioned on this aspect, the witness replied: \u201cI did not do that. I should have done it. I overlooked it. As I say, I usually do it by amendment later.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">The record seems to us clearly to show that the Patent Office and the District Court did not err when they concluded that Pierce had not established himself as the first inventor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We perceive no ground pertinent to the issue here upon which the co-assignee \u2014 simply by virtue of that status \u2014 can obtain a greater right as against the public than it would possess in the absence of common ownership.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b940-15\">Macy testified that it never occurred to him to have an F-crimp through an outer plastic sleeve, and that he first learned of the concept from Mr. Safford while the latter was preparing the Macy application.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b940-16\">Mr. Safford testified that he received the plastic sleeve concept from Pierce in October, 1946. He discussed the Pierce disclosure thereafter with the president of AMP, Inc., with Pierce and one of the company engineers. Under examination by trial counsel the following evolved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-17\">\u201cQ. Can you explain the delay, Mr. Safford, between the disclosure by Mr. Pierce of the F-crimp with the plastic sleeve and the filing of the Pierce application in August of 1948?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-18\">\u201cA. Yes, it was decided at this conference that I mentioned that this was something important enough that we should protect our priority on it and it was to be disclosed in this Macy application which we were going to have to file so that we would have a record date on it, and <em>it was to be covered by broad claims.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-19\">\u201cQ. What do you mean by that? Do you mean by that that the Pierce invention incorporated also the Macy invention ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-20\">\u201cA. I was directed to make sure that <em>the claims on the Macy inven</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number><em>tion </em>did not have any unnecessary limitations which would exclude the application of the Macy invention where there was a plastic sleeve on it. The question of whether to file an application specifically on the Pierce application [s\u00bfe] had to go over because the corporation was then small. It was making a great many inventions and it couldn\u2019t file on all of them at that time.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">He testified that Figure 19 of the Macy patent was Mr. Pierce\u2019s invention. \u201cI put it <em>in Macy\u2019s application </em>because I believed that it was an improvement that was embodied in the best embodiment of his invention then known to us. <em>I filed both applications, not for the inventors, but for the assignee; </em>and I interpreted that to mean the best embodiment known to the assignee, since he was an actual party who filed the application.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">It seems clear that the co-assignee had exercised its claimed right \u201cto select the application in which the claims to the subject matter common to several applications should be placed.\u201d Macy took only what he claimed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">The trial judge found that the Pierce application <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> did not \u201cdefine novel subject matter in view of the disclosure in Figure 19 and the corresponding description in the specification relating thereto of the patent to Macy.\u201d He concluded that the Pierce claims are unpatentable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b939-14\">.

In Ex parte Lemieux, 115 U.S.P.Q. 148 (Bd.App. 1957), there was no interferant or other adverse party nor was there evidence of invention by anyone else prior to the applicant\u2019s filing date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b941-15\">. No affidavit by Pierce had been filed in the Patent Office proceeding other than his conventional affidavit in support of his 1948 application. He did not appear as a witness at the trial. It was testified, however, that an AMP, Inc. atttorney had called Pierce in 1954 with a view to the procurement of a Buie 131 affidavit. Pierce did not remember when he made the invention or whether there were any records. He had made samples, he recalled. Diligent search yielded neither records nor samples. Cf.
