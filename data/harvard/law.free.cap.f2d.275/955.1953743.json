Daggett &amp; Ramsdell, Inc. filed an opposition based on its registration \u201cPersonal Choice\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for use on after shave lotion, cologne, talc and deodorant cream.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">The Procter &amp; Gamble application was involved in another opposition, Roux Distributing Co., Inc. v. The Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Opposition No. 35,436, which was sustained on February 7, 1956, pursuant to a stipulation of January 26, 1956 between the parties thereto to the effect that \u201cPersonal Blend\u201d is descriptive when applied to shampoo. That appellee is not entitled to registration regardless of the outcome of this appeal is obvious, however opposer has insisted upon a resolution of the issue of likelihood of confusion, mistake or deception,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the ground upon which its verified notice of opposition was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">The Assistant Commissioner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-9\">\u201c \u2018Personal Blend\u2019 on shampoo suggests that someone has done something special for the purchaser; whereas \u2018Personal Choice\u2019 on after shave lotion and on opposer\u2019s other products suggests something which the purchaser does for himself. Considering the differences in the reactions stimulated by the respective marks when applied to the products, it is concluded that there is no likelihood of confusion or mistake of purchasers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-12\">The testimony adduced on behalf of Procter &amp; Gamble was directed in great measure to the use of \u201cPersonal\u201d and \u201cPersonal Size\u201d on \u201cIvory\u201d soap, apparently in the hope of showing \u201cPersonal\u201d to be closely associated with appellee in the public\u2019s mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-13\">Appellant relies upon its prior registration. It has also introduced catalogues, printed in 1956 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by its distributor, Fuller Brush Co., which date is after both the filing of the application for registration and the filing of the verified notice of opposition. Those catalogues show \u201cPersonal Choice\u201d to be used in conjunction with deodorant soap, as well as on cream hair lotion and the goods specified in the registration of \u201cPersonal Choice.\u201d A motion was made to strike the catalogues as being neither \u201cavailable to the general public in libraries [nor] of general circulation,\u201d Rule 2.123(c), Trademark Rules of Practice, 1956, 15 U.S.C.A.Appendix, the examiner finally ruling against appellee on that motion. Appellee has renewed his objection here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-14\">It is appellant\u2019s position that the opposition is not moot and that it is entitled to a judgment in its favor on the issue of likelihood of confusion since both marks are used on goods which are likely to come from the same source. , Appellant also asserts that neither of the marks is descriptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-16\">Appellee maintains that its mark is descriptive and further that \u201cPersonal\u201d alone is <em>per se </em>descriptive and therefore cannot be the subject of trademark registration. It apparently contends, also, that its extensive use of \u201cPersonal\u201d and \u201cPersonal Size\u201d on soap for many years prior to appellant\u2019s registration of \u201cPer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>sonal Choice\u201d would lead the public to <em>think </em>that the use <em>of </em>\u201cPersonal\u201d as all or part of a trademark on toilet articles would indicate that Procter &amp; Gamble is the source of the merchandise, and therefore it should prevail here. Finally, appellee argues that confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers is not likely insofar as the two marks in issue are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">The basic issue confronting us is whether \u201cPersonal Blend\u201d when applied to appellee\u2019s goods is likely to cause confusion, mistake, or deceive purchasers. Before discussing that issue, however, we will turn our attention to the other questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">It has been suggested that appellant cannot maintain this action since appellee stipulated in the Roux opposition that \u201cPersonal Blend\u201d is descriptive and therefore unregisterable. We do not agree with this contention since we believe that appellant has the right to press this proceeding to a conclusion, irrespective of the action taken by appellee in the Roux case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">Furthermore, even though appellee has stipulated in another action that \u201cPersonal Blend\u201d is descriptive, hence unregisterable, and maintains that position here, the fact remains that appellant has a registered trademark, and appellee\u2019s depreciating attitude toward its own mark is without significance in this proceeding. For the same reason the question of whether \u201cPersonal\u201d solely or in, conjunction with another word or words is registerable as a trademark is not in issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">As to the use of \u201cPersonal\u201d and \u201cPersonal Size\u201d by appellee on its \u201cIvory\u201d soap, we do not believe that this fact is persuasive in resolving the issues here presented because the evidence introduced by appellee in this connection convinces us that these words as used by appellee connote only the size of the bar of soap in the same <em>manner </em>as its other designations \u201cLarge\u201d and \u201cMedium,\u201d and would not be considered by the general public as indicia of origin of the merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">Since there is no doubt that appellant used its trademark before appellee used its, we come to the issue of whether \u201cPersonal Choice\u201d and \u201cPersonal Blend\u201d when applied to the goods of the litigants are likely to cause confusion as to origin. Our first consideration in this connection will be the goods of the respective parties and the purchasers of their merchandise. We can consider <em>only the </em>items <em>listed in </em>appellant\u2019s registration since we do not believe that the examiner was correct in admitting into evidence parts of Fuller Brush Catalogues which show additional uses of the mark \u201cPersonal Choice.\u201d There is no evidence showing that these particular catalogues were ever distributed to anyone or in any way made available to the general public, and therefore they cannot be treated as \u201cprinted publications\u201d such as books and periodicals available to the general public which may be introduced in evidence under Rule 2.123(c) of Trademark Rules of Practice,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 1956, without further identification and proof of their availability to the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-11\">Although, according to the registration \u201cPersonal Choice\u201d is applied only to after shave <em>lotion, </em>cologne, talc, and deodorant cream, and \u201cPersonal Blend\u201d is used on shampoo, we believe the articles to be so related, all being toilet articles purchased by members of the same general class, that if the trademarks applied to them are likely to cause confusion as to the origin of the merchandise appellant should prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-12\">Even though \u201cChoice\u201d and \u201cBlend\u201d are dissimilar in sound and ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>pearance, it is a well settled principle of trademark law that marks must be considered in their entireties.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Following that principle here, we are of the opinion that \u201cPersonal Choice\u201d and \u201cPersonal Blend\u201d are likely to cause confusion as to the origin of the goods. We believe that the distinction drawn by the Assistant Commissioner is without merit. It is extremely doubtful that purchasers would analyze who did what for whom, and even if they did \u201cPersonal Blend\u201d could signify that the purchaser himself concocted the \u201cBlend\u201d which then would become his \u201cChoice\u201d or if the blender was some other person, and the purchaser favored the particular \u201cBlend\u201d it would still be his \u201cChoice.\u201d Furthermore, we come to the opposite result from the Assistant Commissioner. We believe that the reactions stimulated by the marks when applied to the goods would result in a likelihood of confusion or mistake of purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\">Appellee argues that the decision in Shoe Corp. of America v. Juvenile Shoe Corp. of America, 266 F.2d 793, 795, 46 CCPA 868, is pertinent to this controversy and supports a decision in its favor. We do not agree. There we held that \u201cLazy\u201d as applied to shoes was not arbitrary but contained \u201ca definite suggestion of comfort, relaxation and suitability for informal wear.\u201d Furthermore, the fact that five third party trademarks involving the initial word \u201cLazy\u201d had been registered for shoes indicated to us that the word had \u201csuggestive significance\u201d as applied to shoes and hence, would be taken primarily as describing or suggesting some quality of the shoes rather than as indicative of their origin. The word \u201cPersonal\u201d as applied to the products is not suggestive of some quality of the merchandise involved and no evidence has been introduced to indicate that it is suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">The contention of appellee that appellant has failed to prove damage is without merit. Appellant has shown that \u201c[appellee\u2019s] mark so resembles the mark of [appellant) as to be likely when applied to the goods of [appellee] to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers,\u201d and from this damage will be presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">For the reasons stated the decision of the Assistant Commissioner is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1005-17\">.
