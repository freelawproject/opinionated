The seller, purchasers, and trust company joined in a declaration of trust, which designated Widney as \u201cpayee\u201d, the purchasers as \u201cbeneficiaries,\u201d and the trust company as \u201ctrustee.\u201d It recited that the balance of the purchase price in the amount of $45,000 was payable at the rate of $15,-000 a year for the succeeding three years, and provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">- \u201cThat the said trustee holds and will hold said property for the purpose of securing to the said payee the said deferred payments as above provided; and for the purpose of renting and selling the same; the sale price thereof to be not less than $90,000.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">The agreement provided that upon sale of the property, the trustee should receive %oth of one percent of the selling price, \u201cwhich fee shall be for the first year of the life of this trust, and shall, in no event be less than $90.00. Should this trust not terminate within one year from the date hereof, then the said trustee shall receive an additional sum of $25.00 for each year, or fraction of year thereafter.\u201d It further provided for \u201creasonable compensation for any extraordinary service performed\u201d by the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">After providing for disbursement of the \u201cproceeds of the sale of the property\u201d, the trust instrument prescribes in detail the procedure to be followed in the event of default in payment of the balance of the purchase price, followed by these provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-13\">\u201cThe said Trustee may, in its discretion, appoint S. J. White, * * * or such other person or persons as it may deem best, as its Agent for the sale of said property, to collect and disburse rents thereof, and to generally assume the care and custody of said property, but the said Trustee shall not be liable to any person for any default, defalcation or wrongdoing of any Agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-14\">\u201cIt Is Understood and Agreed that the said trustee will act in all matters in connection with this Trust, requiring the consent of the Beneficiaries hereunder, upon the written order and direction of at least a majority in Interest of said Beneficiaries hereunder; which written order and direction of at least a majority in Interest of the Beneficiaries hereunder shall be considered, so far as the said Trustee is concerned, the written order and direction of all of said Beneficiaries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-15\">\u201cThe said Trustee shall not be required to attend to or procure any insurance upon the buildings upon the said property, or to pay or attend to the paying of any taxes or assessments levied or assessed against the said property so long as this Trust shall continue, or to collect or disburse any rents thereof, but all such services shall be performed and the expenses thereof borne by the said Beneficiaries, or their representatives.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-16\">One of the original purchasers testified that they intended to sell the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>erty within the year, but did not do so. Instead the property was rented as a parking lot to different tenants from 1907 to 1956. The property was never improved or developed. No parcel was sold and no other property was acquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Pursuant to the trust instrument, S. J. White, one of the beneficiaries, was employed to manage the property. Upon his retirement the managerial duties were performed by one or more of the other beneficiaries. The beneficiaries negotiated all leases and determined the provisions thereof, including the term and rental. The trustee executed the leases pursuant to the written request of the beneficiaries holding a majority interest in the trust. In the original lease all the beneficiaries signified their approval in writing on the lease instrument. Prior to leasing the property it was necessary for the beneficiaries to contribute to the payment of taxes and interest. Their contributions were collected by White and delivered to the trustee, who paid the taxes and interest pursuant to White\u2019s written request. All rents were collected by White or one of the other beneficiaries, and delivered to the trustee. All inquiries regarding the property were referred by the trustee to the beneficiaries, who discussed the possible sale of the property with prospective buyers and fixed the price and terms of purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-20\">The trustee held title to the property until 1956 when the trust was liquidated. At the time of liquidation, the sole beneficiaries were Arthur Rohman and Jevne Shepherd Rohman, as co-trustees of the Ida S. Shepherd Trust, the Shepherd Trust having acquired complete ownership in 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-21\">The trustee of the Widney trust filed federal corporation income tax returns for 1949 <em>through </em>1956, and corporate income taxes and interest were paid. Timely claims for refund were filed by the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-22\">The primary question is whether the Widney Trust was an \u201cassociation\u201d taxable as a corporation under \u00a7 3797(a) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and \u00a7 7701(a) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as found by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-23\">Congress has power to tax as a corporation an unincorporated association in the form of a trust which transacts its business as if it were incorporated. To tax a trust as an association, (1) there must be associates who have entered into a joint enterprise; (2) the trust must have a \u201cbusiness purpose\u201d; and (3) there must be substantial resemblance to a corporation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The \u201csalient features\u201d in determining whether there is a substantial resemblance to a corporation are (1) title vested in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>single entity; (2) centralized management; (3) continuity; (4) transfer of beneficial interests; and (5) limitation of personal liability.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">It is the contention of the Government (1) that the recital in the lease that the trustee will hold the property for the purpose of securing the deferred payments and \u201cfor the purpose of renting and selling the same\u201d expressly stated a \u201cbusiness purpose\u201d; that the purpose of the trust must be determined from the trust instrument; that \u201cthe activities of the parties under the trust show that the trust had a business purpose\u201d; and (2) that the trust possessed features resembling a corporation. Appellants contend (1) that the holding of a single piece of unimproved property for sale and the rental thereof to a single tenant without any managerial service being performed by the trustee are insufficient to satisfy the \u201cbusiness purpose\u201d test; and (2) that the trust did not possess the characteristics of a corporation in that (a) the trust instrument did not provide for the transferability of the interests of beneficiaries; (b) limited liability was disclaimed under the terms of the trust; and (c) the trust did not have \u201ccentralized management.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\"> In our opinion the trust instrument meets the tests of \u201ctransferability of interests\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and \u201climited liability.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Does it satisfy the requirements of' \u201cbusiness purpose\u201d and \u201ccentralized management\u201d? In other words, was the trust engaged in carrying on a business enterprise for profit, with management in the trustee analogous to that in the board of directors of a corporation? While the parties agree substantially upon the criteria for determining these requirements, they disagree upon their application to the provisions of the trust instrument and the operations pursuant thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">The test of whether a trust instrument discloses an association for the purpose of carrying on a business must be determined from the instrument itself.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cThe parties are not at liberty to say that their purpose was other or nar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>rower than that which they formally set forth in the instrument under which their activities were conducted.\u201d Helvering v. Coleman-Gilbert, 296 U.S. 369, 374, 56 S.Ct. 285, 287, 80 L.Ed. 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">While the declaration of trust involved in this action recites that one of the purposes is \u201crenting and selling the property,\u201d other provisions limit and qualify this general statement. The provision for the trustee\u2019s compensation is hardly consistent with the operation of the trust property as a business, but rather implies the holding of the property for sale. While the trust instrument provides that the trustee may in its discretion appoint White or some other person as its agent to handle the property, it also provides that the \u201ctrustee shall not be liable to any person for any default, defalcation or wrong-doing of any agent,\u201d \u2014 an unusual provision for a management trust. The agreement expressly provides that the trustee shall not be required to procure insurance, pay taxes, or collect or disburse the rents, \u201cbut all such services shall be performed and the expenses thereof borne by the said beneficiaries or their representatives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\"> Even though the property was never sold and was rented for some 50 years before the trust was liquidated, the trustee did not at any time perform any managerial duties, but simply held title to the property, made the payments to the \u201cpayee\u201d (until 1942 when the purchase price was paid in full), paid the taxes, and distributed the net income to the beneficiaries, all pursuant to written directions of one or more of the beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">With respect to the \u201cbusiness purpose\u201d test, the essential question in the case of real estate trusts, as in other trusts, is \u201cwhether the paramount purpose of the trust was the carrying on of a business enterprise for profit,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as disclosed by the trust instrument in its entirety. We must determine whether the powers vested in the trustee by the declaration of trust established a business purpose \u201cbeyond the traditional scope of an ordinary trust for the holding of real estate.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The regulations refer to an \u201cordinary trust\u201d as one \u201ccreated by will or by declaration of the trustees or the grantor, the trustees of which take title to the property for the purpose of protecting or conserving it as customarily required under the ordinary rules applicable in chancery and probate courts.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">In ordinary real estate trusts, when the estate consists of unimproved property, it is usually the duty of the trustee to lease the property prior to sale, pay taxes and any mortgage indebtedness, collect the rents, and pay the net income to the beneficiaries. The trustee does not have the power to purchase additional real estate, construct buildings on the unimproved real estate, or operate a business thereon. Nor did the trustee of the Widney Trust. The trustee was not authorized generally to deal in land or to improve or operate real estate. On this basis most of the cases on which the Government relies are distinguishable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We cannot escape the conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>that the trust here involved is an ordinary real estate trust rather than a trust created to operate a business.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">It is necessary also that the trust meet the test of corporate resemblance, including \u201ccentralized management.\u201d In support of their contention that the trust fails to meet this test, appellants rely primarily upon Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Gerstle, 9 Cir., 1938, 95 F.2d 587. There four syndicates were formed to purchase realty in anticipation of a general rise in values. It was recited that the syndicate members were desirous of \u201cacting jointly in the purpose, management and, sale of real properties * * * and for that purpose have requested the syndicate managers to act as their agents and trustees.\u201d The parties agreed that the managers \u201cshould purchase, manage and sell the real properties for the account of the members, the managers to have complete discretion in the selection of the properties to be purchased, the amount of the purchase price, the details of management, the terms of sale and of mortgage, and of all other matters related to the syndicate operations.\u201d The anticipated l'ise in values, as in the Widney trust, did not occur. Instead there was a decline, which continued for many years, by reason of which the syndicate managers were \u201ccompelled to operate certain of the buildings and to rent the remaining unimproved properties.\u201d In holding that the syndicates were not \u201cassociations\u201d for tax purposes but rather \u201cjoint ventures,\u201d the court said in part: \u201cWhile the agreements gave the managers broad exclusive powers, the practice was to decide all questions of importance only after the views of all concerned had been obtained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">The facts in the instant case are similar in many respects. If anything, the powers of the Widney trust were more limited. The Government argues that the Gerstle case has been distinguished in subsequent decisions of this court holding trusts taxable as associations. This is true; but the distinction has been based on the fact that in the Gerstle case there was no \u201cgoverning directorate with the usual managerial functions.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The same is true here. There was no committee or board with managerial powers or duties; nor was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>the trustee granted managerial functions by the trust instrument. The retention of control of management by the beneficiaries negatives the existence of a \u201cgoverning directorate with the usual managerial functions.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">In view of our conclusion that the Widney Trust failed to meet the tests of \u201cbusiness purpose\u201d and \u201ccentralized management\u201d required for taxability as an association, it is unnecessary to consider the other specifications of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Reversed and remanded for computation of amounts due and entry of judgment in favor of appellants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b171-6\">.

The following excerpts from the opinion are pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-18\">\u201c3. \u2018Association\u2019 implies associates. It implies the entering into a joint enterprise, and, as the applicable regulation imports, an enterprise for the transaction of business. This is not the characteristic of an ordinary trust \u2014 whether created by will, deed, or declaration \u2014 by which particular property is conveyed to a trustee or is to be held by the settlor, on specified trusts, for the benefit of named or described persons. * * * In what are called \u2018business trusts\u2019 the object is not to hold and conserve particular property, with incidental powers, as in the traditional type of trusts, but to provide a medium for the conduct of a business and sharing its gains. Thus a trust may be created as a convenient method by which persons become associated for dealings in real estate, the development of tracts of land, the construction of improvements, and the purchase, management and sale of properties; * * <em>* </em>or for commerce, or other sorts of busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>ness; where those who become beneficially interested, either by joining in the plan at the outset, or by later participation according to the terms of the arrangement, seek to share the advantages of a union of their interests in the common enterprise. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">\u201c * * * Corporate organization furnishes the opportunity for a centralized management through representatives of the members of the corporation. The designation of trustees, who are charged with the conduct of an enterprise, \u2014 who act \u2018in much the same manner as directors,\u2019 \u2014 may provide a similar scheme, with corresponding effectiveness. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\">These principles are embodied in Treasury Regulations 111 promulgated under the Int.Rev.Code of 1939, Sections 29.-3797-1, 29.3797-2 and 29.3797-3; and in Treasury Regulations 118, Sections 39.-3797-1, 39.3797-2 and 39.3797-3, applicable to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1951.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b172-9\">.
