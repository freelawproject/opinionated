This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-17\">We are satisfied that there was no error in the trial leading to the conviction on the second count. That judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-18\">As to the first count (selling narcotics), the Government offered evidence that the appellant was asked by a plainclothes policeman to purchase narcotics <em>for him; </em>that he gave her money; that she went to a certain house where a seller of drugs was said to live; and that she later handed the officer a packet containing drugs. With the case in that posture, it became essential that the jury be instructed as to the elements necessary to' establish a sale by the appellant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> No such instruction was given. On that ground and without reaching other points raised, we hold that the court erred in failing to grant appellant\u2019s timely motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-19\">Affirmed as to the second count. Reversed as to the first count.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-11\">. These sections of the Code, (1958), denounce three separate offenses. Gore v.
