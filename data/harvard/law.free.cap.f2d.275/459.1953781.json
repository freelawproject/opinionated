It claimed damages from the time it was organized in 1938 resulting from the defendant\u2019s below and appellant\u2019s here alleged monopolization of the shoe machinery business. The defendant answered and relying upon the 1955 amendments of the Clayton Act, 69 Stat. 283, moved under Rule 56(b), 28 U.S. C.A., for partial summary judgment insofar as the plaintiff\u2019s complaint purported to assert any cause of action arising more than four years prior to the filing of the complaint, that is prior to December 14, 1952. The court below denied the motion and in its order of denial certified the question presented as appropriate for immediate appeal under \u00a7 1292(b). The defendant made timely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>application to this court for an appeal and we granted the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">As in Herman Schwabe, Inc., v. United Shoe Machinery Corporation, 274 F.2d 608, decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on January 20, 1960, a suit by the United States upon .the same \u201ccause of action\u201d as that in the case at bar was pending against the defendant between December 15, 1947, and June 23, 1954. Nor is there any other significant difference between the facts in this case and the facts in the Herman Schwabe, Inc., case in which the court considered and refuted the same arguments advanced by the plaintiff in the court below and again as the appellee on this appeal. We find nothing to add to the discussion of the Court of Appeals in that case. On the reasoning and statutory analysis of that opinion and on the cases cited therein:</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Judgment will be entered setting aside the order of the District Court and remanding the case to that Court for further consistent proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
