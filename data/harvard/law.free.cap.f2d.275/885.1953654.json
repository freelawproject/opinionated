It has a statutory corporate office in Baltimore, but its books and records are kept, meetings of stockholders and directors are held, and the corporate business is transacted in the District of Columbia. It was organized to carry out a court-approved reorganization of a bankrupt corporation. Its entire income consists of dividends from three subsidiary corporations, all of which are organized under District of Columbia law, have their principal offices and businesses in the District, and are engaged in the real estate title examination and insurance business.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-12\">The District of Columbia Income Tax Act of 1939 imposed a 5% tax on the income of every corporation, whether domestic or foreign, \u201cfrom sources within the District of Columbia.\u201d D.C.Code (1940 Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 47-1502(b), 1504(b). The District of Columbia Income and Franchise Tax Act of 1947 imposed a 5% tax on the income of every corporation, whether domestic or foreign, for \u201cthe privilege of carrying on or engaging in any trade or business within the District and of receiving income from sources within the District.\u201d D.C.Code (1951 Ed.) \u00a7 47-1571a. Congress declared its purpose \u201cto impose * * * a franchise tax upon every corporation * * * for the privilege of carrying on or engaging in any trade or business within the District and of receiving such other income as is derived from sources within the District * * * \u201d D.C.Code (1951 Ed.) \u00a7 47-1580.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-14\">The Tax Court held, and we agree, that petitioner received its income from \u201csources within the District\u201d and was therefore subject to these taxes. The \u201csources\u201d were petitioner\u2019s subsidiary corporations. Since they had their principal offices and businesses in the District, they were \u201cwithin the District\u201d ; they were \u201c \u2018domiciled\u2019 therein, corporately and commercially\u201d, as the Tax Court found. It is immaterial that some of their business was done elsewhere. We are not concerned with the sources of <em>their </em>income, but only with the sources of petitioner\u2019s income. Cf. Eastman Kodak Co. v. District of Columbia, 76 U.S.App.D.C. 339, 340, 131 F.2d 347, 348. We need not consider whether petitioner was \u201cengaging in * * * business within the District\u201d within the meaning of the franchise tax. Cf. District of Columbia v. Virginia Hotel Co., 92 U.S.App.D.C. 186, 187, 204 F.2d 390, 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
