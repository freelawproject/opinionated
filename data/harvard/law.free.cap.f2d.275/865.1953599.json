The facts were as follows. A number of railroad cars had arrived at the \u201cCentral\u2019s\u201d yard at Weehawken, loaded with freight and destined for Brooklyn. As the cargo on the cars was perishable, it was important to move them from Weehawken, and one, Korab, an official of the \u201cCentral\u201d called up White, an official of the respondent, the New York Dock Railway, and asked White if he had any car-floats available to carry the cars to Brooklyn. White answered that he had none, and Korab then said to him that the \u201cNew Haven\u201d had two floats at Weehawken, one of which White \u201cmight be able to hire\u201d for the purpose. Shortly thereafter White told Korab to \u201cGo ahead and load one of the New Haven floats,\u201d which White had meanwhile chartered from that railroad. The \u201cCentral\u201d loaded the float at a \u201cfloat bridge,\u201d towed her to Pier 8 at Weehawken, and left her lying there at about noon on October 24. A serious storm arose that afternoon during which the float \u201cbuckled\u201d about 130 feet from her stem and four out of twelve of the loaded cars rolled off and sank.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-13\">The judge found that when the \u201cNew Haven\u201d chartered (\u201cdemised\u201d) the float to the \u201cDock Company,\u201d the float was unseaworthy from \u201cgeneral wasting away and corrosion of her hull over a substantial period of time.\u201d In addition he found that there were two holes in her hull four or more square inches in area that were under water when she was loaded with twelve cars, although that was not more weight than she was designed to carry. The \u201cCentral\u201d had sued, not only the \u201cNew Haven\u201d but the \u201cDock Company,\u201d but the Judge dismissed the libel against the \u201cDock Company\u201d; and the \u201cCentral\u201d did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-14\">The \u201cNew Haven\u201d violated its warranty to the \u201cDock Company\u201d of the seaworthiness of the float; and, when the charterer of a ship is liable to a cargo owner, the cargo owner may hold the shipowner on his warranty to the charterer. Davis v. Dittmar, 2 Cir., 6 F.2d 141; S. C. Loveland Co. v. Eastern States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>Farmer\u2019s Exchange, 3 Cir., 92 F.2d 180; W. R. Grace &amp; Co. v. Charleston Lighterage &amp; Transfer Co., 4 Cir., 193 F.2d 539; Connecticut Adamant Plaster Co. v. James McWilliams Blue Line, Inc., 2 Cir., 253 F.2d 785. Indeed, in Davis v. Dittmar, supra, we held the shipowner, although the charterer, Dittmar, who had given a warranty to the cargo owner, had been discharged in bankruptcy. We held that the ship\u2019s warranty was a security for the charterer\u2019s warranty, which for that reason survived the discharge. In all the other decisions there was a circuity of action because the charterer was liable to the cargo owner for his failure to carry safely, and the loss was caused by the shipowner\u2019s breach of warranty to the charterer. The charterer was liable, but in all cases only secondarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">In the case at bar, as we have said, the \u201cCentral\u2019s\u201d libel was dismissed as against the \u201cDock Company,\u201d so that the situation was not within the doctrine we have just mentioned. Moreover, the libel charged both the \u201cNew Haven\u201d and the \u201cDock Company,\u201d not with any breach of warranty, but only with \u201cnegligence \u2022x- * * jn delivering to \u2018Central\u2019 a car-float which was unfit for the purpose intended.\u201d That, if proved, created a direct liability from the \u201cNew Haven\u201d to the \u201cCentral,\u201d regardless of any warranty. Flat-Top Fuel Co. v. Martin, 2 Cir., 85 F.2d 39; The Lizzie D. Shaw, 2 Cir., 92 F.2d 65. The difficulty we find in the case at bar is that the judge made no finding that the \u201cNew Haven\u201d was negligent. True, his fifth finding was, as we have said, that the damages were \u201ccaused by the unseaworthiness of the carfloat, by the lack of maintenance and the general wasting away and corrosion of her hull over a substantial period of time prior to the sinking\u201d; but that was not a finding that it was the \u201cNew Haven\u2019s\u201d negligence that allowed her to become unseaworthy, and in any event it is directly contradicted by the seventh finding that there \u201cwas no proof of condition of the No. 50 as of October 24, 1955, when she was chartered to the \u201cDock Company.\u201d Moreover, the fourth finding was that \u201cNew Haven breached the warranty of seaworthiness which, pursuant to the charter, it owed to Dock Railway,\u201d which certainly suggests, though it does not actually hold, that this was the basis for the \u201cNew Haven\u2019s\u201d liability, which was insufficient to support the decree, if, as the court held, the \u201cCentral\u201d had no claim against the \u201cDock Company.\u201d On these findings we cannot hold that the \u201cNew Haven\u201d was liable for negligence, and the cause must be remanded for further findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">The sixth finding was that the \u201cCentral\u201d was not negligent \u201cin loading or mooring the carfloat,\u201d and we do not think that this was \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d The only obvious defect was the two small holes we have mentioned and these do not appear to us to have been enough to charge the \u201cCentral.\u201d Moreover, it was not shown that these caused the float to \u201cbuckle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">The \u201cNew Haven\u201d has not suggested that, if its liability cannot stand upon its warranty of seaworthiness, but may stand upon its negligence in allowing the float to be used, it may limit its liability to the value of the float as was done in Flat-Top Fuel Co. v. Martin, supra (85 F.2d 39). We do not know whether this was because it supposed that its liability, if any, was under its warranty, in which event no limitation was possible. We do not now wish to foreclose either party on this issue of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">The decree will be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the foregoing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
