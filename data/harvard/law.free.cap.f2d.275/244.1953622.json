The only issue of fact was whether the collision took place on the east or west side of the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-21\">The appellant submits two questions on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-22\">I. \u201cIs an answer to a hypothetical question admissible where it decides an ultimate question of fact?\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-23\">II. \u201cIs an answer to a hypothetical question admissible where the hypothesis and answers are predicated upon speculation and assumption contrary to the evidence in the case ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-24\">The appellant made no objection to the construction of the hypothetical question at the time it was put to the witness and cannot be heard to complain about it now. The consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>to be given to the testimony of the expert was submitted to the jury under proper and complete instructions by the Trial Judge, leaving the jury free to exercise its untrammeled judgment upon the worth and weight of this testimony.
