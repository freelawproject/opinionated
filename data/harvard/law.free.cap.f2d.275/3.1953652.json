The accident was caused by a defective braking system in the other car. Appellees instituted this action against (1) the owner and driver, (2) the seller-repairer, and (3) the manufacturer. Only the seller-repairer was found to be negligent. It appeals, claiming that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>inherently incredible that the car, a taxicab, could be operated for two weeks and 1200 miles after the last repair if the braking system were defective in the manner charged. The negligence alleged is the installation of an under-sized rubber cup in one of the brake cylinders, resulting in a defective seal. Although there are many conflicts in the record, there is competent testimony from which the jury could find: (1) that, despite the defective part, the brakes would operate when installed and lose their effectiveness only gradually thereafter, and (2) that appellant\u2019s mechanic was negligent in failing to observe that the cup did not fit properly. Accordingly we find that the trial court did not err in submitting the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
