At the first trial in the District Court, the Judge upheld the validity of Patent No. 2,702,-998 held by plaintiff Purcell, for an elastic stocking, knitted of alternate courses of \u201cHelanca\u201d yarn and rubber, with the \u201cHelanca\u201d being fed to the knitting needles under no undue tension. However, the judgment was for the defendant on the ground of no infringement. The court accepted the testimony of the defendant\u2019s expert that its stocking was knit under \u201cheavy tension\u201d and thus omitted an essential process step of the plaintiffs\u2019 patent. While the plaintiffs appealed from the finding of no infringement, the defendant failed to cross-appeal from the finding of validity. Our opinion is reported in 258 F.2d 593, where the detailed facts are set out concerning the scope of the plaintiffs\u2019 patent and the manufacturing processes involved in the production of the two stockings in controversy. These details need not be repeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-15\">It was brought to our attention during the appeal that Scholl Manufacturing Co., Inc., the defendant\u2019s primary distributor, had, after the District Court\u2019s decision, circulated certain advertisements which apparently contradicted the position taken by the defendant in the District Court. The advertisement made the admittedly false boast that the defendant\u2019s stocking is the <em>only </em>kind that does not depend on all rubber yarn for elasticity. The advertisement indicated that the elasticity derives partly from some other material, which in this case could be only the \u201cHelanca\u201d yarn. This seemed to be in accord with the teaching of the patent and contrary to the defendant\u2019s insistence at the trial. Our uncertainty as to infringement being thus heightened, we remanded the case for additional testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-16\">At the rehearing, the District Judge received evidence pertaining to the Scholl advertisement, and additional expert testimony, and he concluded that [173 F. Supp. 74]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-17\">\u201cIn the light of all of the evidence, this court is now convinced that the process employed in the accused stocking is essentially the same as that taught by Purcell, and that the slight differences in tension arise solely from the necessity imposed by the insertion of the additional inelastic Nylon thread * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-18\">The court made revised findings, held that the defendant\u2019s stocking infringed the patent, and this time gave judgment for the plaintiffs. The defendant now appeals from the finding of infringe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>ment and also, in its brief, apparently contends that the patent is invalid, although this latter point was not developed in the argument. The plaintiffs cross-appeal from the denial of an award for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">First, as to validity, there is some question whether this issue is now entitled to be considered. At the first trial, when the District Judge upheld the validity of the patent, the defendant failed to appeal from this determination. Our remand was for reconsideration of the infringement issue only. More importantly, when the case came to us the defendant asserted invalidity of the plaintiffs\u2019 patent only if it should be broadly construed so as not to require the process of knitting the stocking with undue tension, allowing the alternating \u201cHelanca\u201d courses to stretch harmoniously with the rubber. Since this court expressly approved the District Judge\u2019s narrow construction of the patent, treating this process step as essential, it would seem that the question of validity was there settled. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">\u201cConsidering the ambiguity of the phrases and the conflicting interpretations adopted from time to time by the plaintiffs themselves, and considering also the defendant\u2019s testimony, <em>we are unable to say that the District Judge was clearly erroneous in his construction of the Purcell patent. </em>We therefore need not concern ourselves with the defendant\u2019s further argument that if the broader interpretation demanded by the plaintiffs were adopted, the patent would be invalid for lack of novelty over the prior art as disclosed by Neumager. Nor need we pass upon the related contention of the defendant that if the method of knitting is not a part of the patent, then the patentee has merely substituted another material (\u201cHelanca\u201d yarn) for that prescribed by Hinchcliff (inelastic yarn) and this would not be sufficient foundation for the patent * * *\u201d 258 F.2d at page 596. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Moreover, the defendant\u2019s present position is not altogether clear. While its brief seems to assert without qualification that the patent is invalid, its reply brief states: \u201cDefendant has no interest in attacking the Purcell patent, unless it is necessary to its defense of this case to do so. We have contended all along that if the patent is properly construed, it could not possibly be infringed by defendant\u2019s accused stockings.\u201d And later: \u201cClearly, if the Purcell patent is construed broadly to cover a stocking wherein the \u2018Helanca\u2019 yarn is fully stretched when knit, such result would have the effect of eliding the \u2018relaxed, condition\u2019 language of the patent claims. Under such construction, the patent obviously comprises nothing more than a mere substitution of materials.\u201d From this, the defendant\u2019s position still appears to be that the patent is invalid only if interpreted broadly. Since both courts have rejected the broad construction, and held that knitting without undue tension is an essential part of the patent, it would seem that the defendant is itself uncertain of its position as to validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">However, even if the validity of the patent, as construed in the District Court and in our previous opinion, is properly in issue here, we find no reason to disturb the District Judge\u2019s finding that the patent constituted invention over the prior art. The circumstances, which are discussed at sufficient length in our first opinion, warranted the District Judge\u2019s conclusion that the combination, overcoming deficiencies present in prior surgical stockings, was patentable.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Likewise, upon the amplified record, we perceive no error in the finding of infringement. The testimony presented much conflict over whether, in the defendant\u2019s knitting process, the \u201cHelanca\u201d was knit under a much greater tension than employed by the plaintiffs. There was expert testimony and other evidence supporting both the defendant\u2019s contention that the \u201cHelanca\u201d in the accused stocking is fully stretched like inelastic nylon, and the plaintiffs\u2019 contention to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>the contrary. The trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s stocking is knit with a degree of tension only slightly greater than the plaintiffs\u2019 stocking finds sufficient support (a) in the testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 expert witnesses, (b) in the experiments revealing that about four times as much tension could be placed on the \u201cHelanca\u201d than that used in the defendant\u2019s knitting process, and (c) in the admissions contained in the advertisements. The court not unreasonably was influenced by inconsistencies in the testimony of defendant\u2019s experts and their comparatively limited experience in the particular kind of hosiery knitting involved. Thus the trial court found the testimony of defendant\u2019s experts less credible than that of the plaintiffs\u2019. This record is an appropriate one for the application of what the Supreme Court has said with regard to Rule 52 (a), Fed.RuIes Civ.Proc. 28 U.S.C.A. in patent cases: \u201cTo no type of case is this last clause more appropriately applicable than to the one before us, where the evidence is largely the testimony of experts as to which a trial court may be enlightened by scientific demonstrations.\u201d Graver Tank &amp; Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Products Co., 1949, 336 U.S. 271, 274, 69 S.Ct. 535, 537, 93 L.Ed. 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Finally, we sustain the court\u2019s refusal to award attorneys\u2019 fees to the plaintiffs. The patent statute, 35 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 285, provides: \u201cThe court <em>in exceptional cases </em>may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) The plaintiffs have completely failed to show why this is an \u201cexceptional\u201d case meriting an award of counsel fees. There has been no showing of unconscionable conduct or bad faith or any other circumstances which might make such an award proper. In American Chain &amp; Cable Co. v. Rochester Ropes, 4 Cir., 1952, 199 F.2d 325, 330, we pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-5\">\u201cWhile the allowance of reasonable counsel fees to the defendant in a patent case is within the discretion of the District Court under 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 70, we have held that the discretion should not be exercised except in situations involving vexatious and unjustified litigation * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">See also: Phillips Petroleum Co. v.

Supp. 215, affirmed 4 Cir., 1950, 185 F.2d 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">For the above reasons, the decision of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"AW0\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
