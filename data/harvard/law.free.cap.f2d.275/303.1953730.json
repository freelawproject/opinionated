The order of dismissal in the second of said two actions was affirmed by this Court in Hicks v. Holland, 6 Cir., 235 F.2d 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-22\">As pointed out in the opinion in said case, in addition to the action being barred by a previous adjudication, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>complaint states no cause of action on the merits. Kenney v. Fox, 6 Cir., 232 F.2d 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">It is ordered that the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
