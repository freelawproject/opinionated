Morgan, J., presents the single question whether an estate is entitled to an estate tax marital deduction, \u00a7 812 (e) (1) (A), Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 812(e) (1) (A), for a portion of the proceeds of a policy of life insurance upon the life of the deceased spouse when the whole proceeds are held by the insurer under a settlement option of the policy, the terms of which provide that the surviving spouse shall receive monthly payments for the remainder of her life, but that if she should die before the expiration of twenty years then the decedent\u2019s daughter shall receive the payments until twenty years have elapsed. The district court found that that portion of the total proceeds allocable to the funding of a contingent life annuity from and after twenty years after the decedent\u2019s death qualified for the marital deduction. It was agreed by the parties that in no event would the portion of the proceeds necessary to fund the twenty years of monthly payments certain qualify for the deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-23\">We hold that no part of the proceeds so held by the insurer qualifies for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>estate tax marital deduction, and accordingly we reverse the decision below.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">The relevant facts are stipulated and may be briefly stated. The decedent held two life insurance policies on his own life, the total proceeds of which at his death were $30,207.10. Both policies were payable to his wife, Marion E. Meyer. The decedent elected substantially identical payment options under the policies prior to his death on September 14, 1952.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By the terms of the option selected in each policy his surviving wife was assured of monthly payments for the remainder of her life; but by the terms of each it was also agreed that 240 monthly payments would be made in any event and that they would be made to designated beneficiaries in the event that although the decedent\u2019s wife was living at his death, she did not survive to receive them all. In both policies the decedent\u2019s daughter, Shirley A. Meyer, was the person primarily designated to receive the guaranteed payments in the event of the death of her mother in less than twenty years. Both decedent\u2019s wife and daughter survived him.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">It was further stipulated and found that upon decedent\u2019s death the insurance companies concerned separately determined as a matter of their business practice the portion of the total proceeds required to fund the twenty years of payments certain, and both determined the sum required to fund the contingent life annuity for Marion Meyer from and after twenty years. The refund sought and recovered by the executors was $2,339.-72, which is the decrease in the estate tax which would result from increasing the marital deduction by $8,238.54, the total amount determined by the two insurers as required to fund the contingent life annuity. Neither insurance contract provided, and the decedent did not request, that there be any segregation of the proceeds of the policy between the amounts computable for the term certain and the amounts computable for funding the contingent life annuity. Both of the policies provide that the policy and the application therefor constitute the entire contract between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">On this appeal appellees rely exclusively on the authority of In re Reilly\u2019s Estate, 3 Cir., 1957, 239 F.2d 797 where it was determined that insurance proceeds held under what are for present purposes substantially identical contracts could be divided into two \u201cproperties\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 812(e) (1) (B) (i) and (ii). As a consequence it was held that the amount needed to fund the contingent life annuity qualified for the marital deduction because, although \u201cterminable\u201d within the meaning of the preamble to \u00a7 812(e) (1) (B), no \u201cinterest\u201d in that separate property passed to any person other than the surviving spouse so that the conditions of \u00a7 812(e) (1) (B) (i) and (ii) for disqualification of the gift to the spouse were not fulfilled. No oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>er court of appeals appears to have considered this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Since appellee concedes that the wife\u2019s interest in the portion of the total proceeds necessary to fund the payments for twenty years certain is disqualified, the sole question is whether, as the Third Circuit held, the proceeds may be separated into two separate properties. Section 812(e) (1) (A) and (B) distinguish between property and an interest in property, and the Senate Committee Report, S.Rcp. 1013 (part 2), 80th Cong., 2d Sess. (1948), U.S.Code Cong.Service 1948, p. 1225, expressly comments upon the distinction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">\u201cThe terms \u2018interest\u2019 and \u2018property,\u2019 as used in section 812(e) have separate and distinct meanings. The term \u2018property\u2019 is used in a comprehensive sense and includes all objects or rights which are susceptible of ownership. The term \u2018interest\u2019 refers to the extent of ownership * * * by the surviving spouse or other person, of particular property. For example, if the surviving spouse is specifically devised an estate for her life in a farm, the \u2018interest\u2019 passing to her is the life estate, and the \u2018property\u2019 in which such interest exists is the farm. \u2022x- \u2022\u00bb ThuS) jn case 0f a kg. quest, devise, or transfer of an interest which may be satisfied out of, or with the proceeds of, any property of the decedent\u2019s general estate or of a trust, the interest so bequeathed, devised, or transferred is an interest in any and all of such property. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">\u201cAs previously stated, it is necessary for the purposes of section 812 (e) (1) to distinguish between an interest in property and the property in which such interest is an interest. Thus if the decedent devises Blackacre to his wife for life with remainder to X, then X has an interest in the property (Blackacre) in which the surviving spouse has an interest. If the principal value of Blackacre was a coal mine which may be expected to be exhausted during the surviving spouse\u2019s life, nevertheless both the surviving spouse and X have an interest in the property, which is Blackacre. * * In the case of a trust or fund, the income beneficiaries and the persons who may receive any part of the corpus have an interest in the property represented by the assets of the trust or fund as of the date of the decedent\u2019s death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-14\">Although we think these examples speak clearly to the instant case to define the insurance proceeds as a single fund in which the wife has been granted a life estate with a remainder in the daughter, it is at least arguable on the basis of this alone that, as the Third Circuit found, the proceeds may be divided and the wife\u2019s interest treated as twofold: a life estate in one property, the payments certain, and a contingent life annuity in the other. But such doubt as we might otherwise entertain on this question is resolved by another portion of the same report in which in a specific example the present situation is expressly dealt with. After dealing at length with the provisions of (B) the Report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-15\">\u201cThe same principles apply in the ease of insurance proceeds and annuity contracts, as illustrated by the following examples:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-16\"><em>\u201cExample (1). </em>The entire proceeds of an insurance policy on the life of the decedent are payable to the surviving spouse and the value of such proceeds is included in determining the value of the gross estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-17\"><em>A marital deduction is allowed </em>with respect to the value of the proceeds <em>because no person other than the surviving spouse has an interest in the proceeds. The result will be the same whether such proceeds </em>are payable in a lump sum; are payable in installments to the surviving spouse, her heirs, or assigns, for a term; or <em>are payable to the surviving spouse for her life with no refund of the undistributed proceeds or with </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number><em>such a refund to her estate. </em>* <em>*\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">This example makes it plain that \u201cproceeds\u201d is identical with \u201cproperty\u201d at least in the situation treated by it, since the spouse\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d is referred to as an interest in the \u201cproceeds\u201d and not in a portion of them; and all possible doubt on this score is resolved by the specific example of a refundable life annuity in the entire proceeds given to the wife, in which instance it is clearly stated that the wife\u2019s interest will qualify <em>if </em>the refund is to be made to her estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The next subsequent example deals with annuities, and, if that is possible, even more clearly defines the contract creating the annuity as a single property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\"><em>\u201cExample (2). </em>The decedent during his lifetime purchased an annuity contract under which the annuity was payable during his life <em>and then to his spouse during her life if she survived him. </em>The value of the interest of decedent\u2019s surviving spouse in such contract at the death of the decedent is included in determining the value of his gross estate. <em>A marital deduction is allowed </em>with respect to the value of such interest so passing to the decedent\u2019s surviving spouse <em>inasmuch as no other person has an interest in the contract. </em>If upon the death of the surviving spouse the annuity payments were to continue for a term to her estate, or the undistributed portion thereof was to be paid to her estate, the deduction is nevertheless allowable with respect to such entire interest. <em>If, however, upon the death of the surviving spouse, the payments are to continue to another person (not through her estate) or the undistributed fund is to be paid to such other person, no marital deduction is allowable inasmuch as an interest passed from the decedent to such other person.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Thus considered both as a dedication of the entire proceeds to the creation of a refundable life annuity with the refund in someone other than the wife\u2019s estate, or considered as the dedication of the proceeds to the purchase of a refundable life annuity, the present case falls squarely within unambiguous examples given by the responsible Senate Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">Even if we assume that had the contract provided for the segregation of the-separate funds they could then have been considered separate properties, it is stipulated here and the contracts reveal that, no such segregation was provided for. In a similar situation we have rejected1 the view that what might have been accomplished at the outset, but was not,, ought nevertheless to be regarded as having been done. See Hoffenberg v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 1955, 223 F.2d 470, affirming 1954, 22 T.C. 1185.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">We do not agree with the Third Circuit that the example given in the Report of a gift to the decedent\u2019s wife and\" daughter as tenants in common of the-decedent\u2019s interest in a patent, as to-which it is clearly stated that the wife\u2019s, interest qualifies for the estate tax marital deduction, is in any way inconsistent with the view that the patent is a single-property, or that, conversely, the example may be said to support the view that the patent, by virtue of the gift, became - two separate properties. The Report expressly states that the interest given-to the wife qualifies because it does not come within \u00a7 812(e) (1) (B) (ii) although it is a terminable interest under-(i) . The reason it does not come within-(ii) is we think that the daughter\u2019s possession and enjoyment of her interest in. the single property take place at once, and not \u201cafter\u201d the termination of the-wife\u2019s terminable interest, and not because there were two properties created.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">We are similarly unpersuaded by resort to the analogy of \u00a7 812(e) (1) (G),.. which creates an exception from the terminable interest rule when, <em>inter alia, </em>the surviving spouse is given a power of appointment over the residue of the proceeds. While it is true, as the Third1\u2019 Circuit noted, that Regulation 105, \u00a7 81.- - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>47(a) (d) (2) contemplates the division of insurance proceeds into separate funds held by the insurer, it cannot be said that the Regulation contemplates that the resulting funds may be considered to be separate properties. It is perfectly consistent with the Regulation that it applies to an instance, such as that of a tenancy in common between the surviving spouse and another, in which although two interests are thus created in the single property, the wife\u2019s interest, because of \u00a7 812(e) (1) (G), is not disqualified. For example, if the surviving spouse received a life estate in one-half the proceeds with a power to appoint the remainder, and another person received one-half outright, the wife\u2019s interest would qualify if the life estate and the power met the requirements of \u00a7 812 (e) (1) (G), while without (G) it may be assumed that it would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Moreover, even if the Regulation might be said to be in some manner inconsistent with the view we have taken, we would not accord it great weight. It interprets and gives effect to a special exception to the terminable interest rule for powers of appointment over the proceeds of life insurance and annuity contracts. It would be hazardous, in the face of the convincing evidence for the contrary result, to reason in the present case from a policy concerning powers of appointment, especially because the statute in part (G) conditions the granting of the exception for powers of appointment on the fulfillment of special requirements not otherwise present. Thus, <em>inter alia, </em>payments to the surviving spouse under the option must commence not later than thirteen months after the decedent\u2019s death, a limitation conspicuously lacking here.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-6\">.

I would affirm the result below and would follow, as did the district court, D.C.W.D.N.Y. 1958, 166 F.Supp. 629, the lead of the Third Circuit in In re Reilly\u2019s Estate, 3 Cir., 1957, 239 F.2d 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">It is, and was stated in one of the exhibits attached to and made part of the parties\u2019 stipulation to be, the accounting and actuarial practice of the life insurance industry to do exactly what the companies here did. Upon the death of Mr. Meyer, under the settlement options he chose, each of the two companies set aside two distinct funds \u2014 each company estimating the amounts needed in each fund by reference to Mrs. Meyer\u2019s life expectancy as set forth in the applicable Mortality Table. In each case, one of these funds, the first one, was to provide payments certain for twenty years. If Mrs. Meyer died during this twenty year period the payments certain were to be made to another beneficiary. The status of these two first funds is not involved in this appeal. It is agreed they do not qualify for the estate tax marital deduction. In each case the other fund, the second one, was set aside to finance payments payable only to Mrs. Meyer for as long as she might live after the expiration of the twenty years and after the exhaustion of the first fund. These payments were not to begin until the twenty-year period had elapsed. There was no contingent beneficiary. If Mrs. Meyer died during the twenty year period the insurance companies would each pocket the full amount of this second fund. If she died after she began to draw against the fund, but before it had been exhausted, each company would pocket the unexhausted sums. On the other hand, if Mrs. Meyer lived longer than her life expectancy and thereby exhausted the second fund the insurance companies were obligated to continue to pay her out of company money the agreed payments until her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">It seems clear that the money needed to fund the payments for twenty years certain, and that needed to fund the continuing life long payments, were necessarily required to be kept separate and constituted separate entities. They were for different purposes, purposes contemplated by Mr. Meyer when he chose the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>particular settlement option that he chose, and their separation was required in order that neither Mr. Meyer nor the companies be disadvantaged in the execution of the settlement plan. Therefore, of what possible materiality can it be that this segregation of funds was not spelled out in the settlement contract? Or that Mr. Meyer didn\u2019t specifically request a division ?</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">To be sure, they were both settled for the primary purpose of providing installment payments to the surviving spouse during her lifetime. But there the similarity ceases and the dissimilarity is so marked that I think it error to consider that in each .case these two funds were but one property. If the interest of the surviving spouse in the property constituting the first fund should happen to terminate or fail by her death the balances remaining in that fund could pass without consideration to the contingent beneficiary. But the second fund was not so settled. While the interest of the surviving spouse in the property constituting the second fund might also terminate or fail by her early death those balances would pass for \u201can adequate and full consideration in money or money\u2019s worth\u201d to the insurance companies with whom the settlor had bargained on the chance that his widow would outlive her life expectancy and receive excess payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Hence I would hold that the portions of the proceeds of Mr. Meyer\u2019s insurance policies that by contract with him were set aside to fund payments to Mrs. Meyer after the twenty-year period had elapsed qualified for the allowance of the estate tax marital deduction. I believe this result is consistent with the purpose of Section 812(e) (1) \u2014 to make the tax treatment of married persons in community property and non-community property states more nearly uniform \u2014 and surely the arrangement with which we are dealing does not provide an avenue for abuse of the marital deduction provision. Consequently, since \u201c[i]n expounding a statute, we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy,\u201d United States v. Boisdore\u2019s Heirs, 1849, 8 How. 118, 122, 12 L.Ed. 1009; Mastro Plastics Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 1956, 350 U.S. 270, 285, 76 S.Ct. 349, 359, 100 L.Ed. 309; National Labor Relations Board v. Lion Oil Co., 1957, 352 U.S. 282, 288, 77 S.Ct. 330, 1 L.Ed.2d 331, I would affirm the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">I interpret the difference between my colleagues and me to turn on the fact that they are unwilling to consider as done what actually was done. They believe that, because there was no specific contract authorizing segregation, it is improper for estate tax purposes to divide the insurance proceeds into two funds. I am sure that if they agreed with me that two funds are permissible, they also would agree that the estate of Mr. Meyer would be entitled to the benefit of the marital deduction to the extent of the funds before us on this appeal. The specific wording of the Code\u2019s applicable provisions so provide. See 1954 I.R.C. \u00a7 2056(b) (1) (A) and (B), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2056(b) (1) (A, B); 1939 I.R.C. \u00a7 812(e) (1) (B) (i) and (ii), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 812(e) (1) (B) (i, ii). See also Reg. 105, \u00a7 81.47a(b) (2) and (3). The benefits of the marital deduction are deniable to a terminable interest only where a remainder interest in the entire property passes to some person other than the surviving spouse for less than adequate consideration, and this oth\u00e9r person may thereupon possess or enjoy the remainder interest after the termination of the wife\u2019s present interest. I think we would all agree that unless there are additional rights created in a property entity for the benefit of third' parties the interests passing to the surviving wife in that property entity are entitled to and should be accorded the benefit of the marital deduction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
