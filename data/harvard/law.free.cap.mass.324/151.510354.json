The defendant is engaged in a similar business at 600 Revere Beach Parkway, Revere, within an eighth of a mile of the plaintiff\u2019s place of business. This is a bill in equity to enjoin the defendant from carrying on business under any name containing the word \u201cParkway,\u201d and for damages and other relief. From a final decree dismissing the bill, the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">The Revere Beach Parkway, commonly known as the \u201cParkway\u201d in Revere, is a well travelled broad highway running through Revere and adjoining municipalities. Since 1917 the plaintiff has conducted business under his own name and under the name of \u201cParkway Garage,\u201d and a sign bearing the latter name has since that date been attached to the building used by him. In 1932 there were added the names \u201cDe Soto Plymouth,\u201d two makes of automobiles for which the plaintiff is an authorized dealer. Since prior to 1932 the plaintiff has enjoyed in Revere a valuable business reputation for fair dealing in the business of servicing and repairing automobiles and as a skilled mechanic in the repair of automobiles, and since 1932 in the sale and service of the two makes of automobiles. Most of the plaintiff\u2019s customers reside, and most of his business has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>been transacted with persons who reside, in Revere and vicinity. This valuable business reputation \u201cin that area\u201d is identified in the minds of \u201cmany of his customers and others\u201d with his own individual name, but \u201cin the minds of other persons in the same area\u201d his place of business and valuable business reputation are known and identified under the name \u201cParkway Garage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">In September, 1946, the defendant commenced the' construction of a building to contain a salesroom, gasoline station, and garage for the repair and servicing of automobiles. During the construction the defendant maintained near the building a sign bearing the legend \u201cNew Home of Parkway Motor Sales, Inc. Your new Dodge Plymouth Dealer.\u201d The defendant was incorporated in this Commonwealth in June, 1946. Prior to March, 1947, it had never been engaged in business in Revere or elsewhere, but since that date it has engaged in business as a dealer and in servicing and repairing automobiles. It has sent advertising matter to about one thousand persons in Revere and vicinity, including at least one customer of the plaintiff, and has advertised in newspapers.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Although the defendant knew prior to engaging in business that the plaintiff was conducting his business under the name \u201cParkway Garage,\u201d it did not knowingly mail advertising matter to the plaintiff\u2019s customers or intend by its advertising or method of doing business to lead the plaintiff\u2019s customers or the public generally to believe that the business of the defendant was the business of the plaintiff, or thus intend to appropriate the plaintiff\u2019s business or to trade upon the name and reputation of the plaintiff. The instances of confusion occurring in the misdelivery to the plaintiff of packages and invoices intended for the defendant and in the misdirection to the plaintiff of telephone calls intended for the defendant were due to errors arising from the fact that both parties were engaged in the automobile business in locations not far apart on the Revere Beach Parkway, each using the word \u201cParkway\u201d in the names under which the businesses were conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>. There is no similarity in appearance in the respective buildings, the arrangement of the approaches, or in the manner or method of display of signs. There is no similarity in the words used in any signs except \u201cPlymouth\u201d and \u201cParkway.\u201d The appearance and general arrangement of the defendant\u2019s building and surroundings and its method of doing business are so distinguished from those of the plaintiff and his place of business that a reasonably careful and intelligent person would not be misled into believing that the defendant\u2019s place of business was that of the plaintiff:</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">The parties are competitors for the sale of Plymouth automobiles and for the servicing and repairing of motor vehicles in Revere and adjoining municipalities. Neither sells any product on which the word \u201cParkway\u201d is marked or provides any service designated by that word. The word \u201cParkway\u201d is in common use in English speech. In its primary meaning it denotes a broad highway improved or beautified with trees or shrubs and grass plots. It is common knowledge that there have been for many years several parkways in Metropolitan Boston. Along the Revere Beach Parkway there are other establishments engaged in the servicing, repairing, or sale of motor vehicles and using the word \u201cParkway\u201d in the business name. In other cities and towns in Metropolitan Boston there are establishments using that word in the conduct of the automobile business and other businesses. The plaintiff was the first user of the word \u201cParkway\u201d in connection with the automobile service business on the Revere Beach Parkway in Revere. \u201cUpon all the evidence,\u201d however, the word \u201cParkway\u201d had not acquired a secondary meaning as designating the plaintiff\u2019s place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The foregoing facts appear in a report by the judge of the material facts found by him, which, although apparently. voluntary, is the equivalent of a report under the statute. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 214, \u00a7 23, as appearing in St. 1947, c. 365, \u00a7 2. The evidence is not reported. Consequently, the facts reported must stand except to the extent that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>are inferences from subsidiary findings or are inconsistent with each other or the pleadings. <em>Wiley </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>310 Mass. 597, 599. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Morson, </em>316 Mass. 678, 681. <em>Carilli Construction Co. </em>v. <em>John Basile &amp; Co. Inc. </em>317 Mass. 726, 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">The finding that \u201cParkway,\u201d a word in common usage, had not acquired a secondary meaning as designating the plaintiff\u2019s place of business was made upon \u201call the evidence,\u201d and cannot be treated as an inference from the other facts found. <em>Colby </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>311 Mass. 727. <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Chioda, </em>317 Mass. 446, 450. The existence of such a secondary meaning was an issue directly raised in the pleadings. It is a necessary part of the plaintiff\u2019s case. Ordinarily no exclusive right can be had in such a word. <em>Tent, Inc. </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>269 Mass. 211, 213. <em>Economy Food Products Co. </em>v. <em>Economy Grocery Stores Corp. </em>281 Mass. 57, 63. <em>China Clipper Restaurant, Inc. </em>v. <em>Yue Joe, </em>312 Mass. 540, 543. <em>First National Stores Inc. </em>v. <em>First National Liquor Co. </em>316 Mass. 538. <em>Union Oyster House Inc. </em>v. <em>Hi Ho Oyster House, Inc. </em>316 Mass. 543. The plaintiff, however, in substance contends that the finding that there was no such secondary meaning is inconsistent with other findings and the proper inference from other findings <em>(Distasio </em>v. <em>Surrette Storage Battery Co. </em>316 Mass. 133, 135). It is argued that the defendant knowingly \u201cappropriated the essential features of the plaintiff\u2019s trade name\u201d; that the plaintiff had used the name \u201cParkway Garage\u201d since 1917 and was the first user of the word \u201cParkway\u201d in the automobile service business on the Revere Beach Parkway; and that in the minds of \u201csome persons\u201d in the same area as the plaintiff\u2019s place of business his valuable business reputation is known and identified under the name of \u201cParkway Garage.\u201d The precise findings on the last point are that the plaintiff\u2019s valuable reputation in Revere and vicinity is identified in the minds of \u201cmany of his customers and others\u201d with his own individual name and \u201cin the minds of other persons in the same area\u201d with \u201cParkway Garage.\u201d These fall short of findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>permitting an inference that the words had acquired a secondary meaning as applied to the plaintiff\u2019s place of business. It does not appear how many \u201cother persons\u201d there are, much less that they are a substantial number of those members of the public who would be interested in patronizing the plaintiff. See Nims, Law of Unfair Competition &amp; Trademarks (4th ed.), 1038. It is entirely consistent with the findings that these \u201cother persons\u201d are very few. The judge surely has not found any facts indicating that \u201cParkway Garage\u201d is \u201ca name by which the plaintiff is generally known to the public.\u201d See <em>Staples Coal Co. </em>v. <em>City Fuel Co. </em>316 Mass. 503, 508. Indeed, the most cogent finding in this respect is that there are, in addition to those of the plaintiff and the defendant, other establishments in the same line of business along the Revere Beach Parkway using the word \u201cParkway\u201d in the business name. That the plaintiff was the first in the field cannot avail him in the circumstances. Any presumption arising from this fact <em>(New England Awl &amp; Needle Co. </em>v. <em>Marlborough Awl &amp; Needle Co. </em>168 Mass. 154, 156) has disappeared with the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Whatever may be thought of the conduct of the defendant, we cannot in the absence of a report of the evidence overturn the judge\u2019s findings. This is true not only of the decisive finding as to the absence of a secondary meaning of the word \u201cParkway,\u201d but of other findings which that finding renders immaterial. Among these are the finding that a careful and intelligent person would not be misled into believing that the defendant\u2019s place of business was that of the plaintiff, and the effect to be given to the instances of confusion in the delivery of packages and invoices, and the misdirection of telephone calls <em>(Silbert </em>v. <em>Kerstein, </em>318 Mass. 476, 478-479).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Cases such as <em>Blair\u2019s Foodland Inc. </em>v. <em>Shuman\u2019s Foodland, Inc. </em>311 Mass. 172, <em>S. M. Spencer Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>319 Mass. 331, and <em>Healer </em>v. <em>Bloomberg Bros. Inc. </em>321 Mass. 476, where it was found that a name had acquired a secondary meaning, are distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>The word \u201cParkway\u201d having acquired no secondary \u2022 meaning as designating the plaintiff\u2019s place of business, his rights are not enlarged by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 110, \u00a7 7A, inserted by St. 1947, c. 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
