L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 40, \u00a7 53, by ten or more taxable inhabitants of Cambridge, against the city, its treasurer, its auditor and its manager, to restrain the payment of increased salaries in its police and fire departments provided for by an ordinance enacted by the city council on November 22, 1948, to take effect on January 1, 1949. The allegations of fact contained in the petition were admitted, and the judge reported the case without decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-15\">Since January 1, 1942, the city of Cambridge has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>governed by Plan E, described in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 93-116, as inserted by St. 1938, c. 378, \u00a7 15, and as amended. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Election Commissioners of Cambridge, </em>309 Mass. 303. <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Treasurer of Cambridge, </em>310 Mass. 484. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>316 Mass. 351. <em>Quinlan </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>320 Mass. 124. It is agreed that in Cambridge the calendar year is the financial year.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The annual budget for the year 1948 was submitted by the city manager to the city council on February 16, 1948, and was adopted by the city council on March 31, 1948. It provided for the same salaries in the police and fire departments that were in force in 1947. On November 22, 1948, the city council adopted an ordinance, to take effect January 1, 1949, increasing those salaries. No provision for the. increases in salaries had been made by any supplemental appropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">By G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 44, \u00a7 33A, no increase in salaries could be made during the financial year subsequent to the submission of the annual budget unless provision therefor had been made by means of a supplemental appropriation. Under that statute it was held that a city council could increase salaries in one year to take effect at the beginning of the succeeding year. <em>Rock </em>v. <em>Pittsfield, </em>316 Mass. 348, 350. But by St. 1947, c. 298, \u00a7 1, it was provided that \u201cno ordinance providing for an increase in the salaries or wages of municipal officers or employees shall be enacted .\u2022 . . unless it is to be operative for more than three months during the financial year in which it is passed.\u201d The ordinance was obnoxious to that statute, because the increases were not to be operative during the year 1948.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The respondents invoke St. 1935, c. 214, \u00a7 1, which provides that \u201cSalaries of the members of the police\u2019and fire departments of the city of Cambridge shall be fixed by ordinance of said city, the provisions of any special or general law to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d The effect of the adoption of a Plan E charter upon that statute was not decided in <em>Quinlan </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>320 Mass. 124, 126, where the point was not argued. But St. 1935, c. 214, is in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>law a part of the Cambridge city charter, for G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 4, \u00a7 7, Fifth, defines \u201cCharter\u201d as including \u201cany special act or provision\u201d relating to a city ,or town. And in <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Mayor of Cambridge, </em>222 Mass. 574, 577, it was said that \u201cThe adoption by the voters of one of the four Plans of city charter specified in St. 1915, c. 267, is the equivalent of a new charter especially enacted by the Legislature for the adopting city.\u201d General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 44, \u00a7 33A, as appearing in St. 1947, c. 298, \u00a7 1, already cited, provides that the requirements there made for increases in salaries shall apply \u201cNotwithstanding any contrary provision of any city charter.\u201d We think that that provision now restricts the power of the city council under St. 1935, c. 214, \u00a7 1. It follows that the ordinance adopted on November 22, 1948, is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\n<em>Decree for petitioners.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
