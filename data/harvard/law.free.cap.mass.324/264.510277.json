A controversy having arisen as to the interpretation of \u00a7 2, the plaintiffs, who are members of the permanent uniformed fire fighting force of the city, brought this bill for declaratory relief against the chief engineer of the city\u2019s fire department.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">The questions for decision arise in this way: After St. 1948, c. 661, took effect, the defendant put into operation a schedule which requires the members of the city\u2019s fire fighting force to work in three shifts of eight hours each, that is, from 3 a.m. to 11 a.m., from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., and from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. Under this arrangement each member of the force is on duty two consecutive days from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. This means that once each week during a calendar day running from midnight to midnight a member will be on duty from midnight until 3 a.m. and from 7 p.m. until midnight. It is contended that this is not in compliance with that portion of \u00a7 2 of c. 661 which requires that the \u201cHours of duty within a calendar day shall be consecutive.\u201d Under the schedule each member of the force is off duty one day a week starting at 3 a.m. on one day and ending at 3 a.m. on the following day. The plaintiffs contend that under \u00a7 2 they are \u201centitled to not less than one day off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>in each calendar week\u201d and that this means a calendar day running from midnight to midnight.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The judge ruled that the schedule met the requirements of \u00a7 2 and a decree was entered accordingly, from which the plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">As stated above, under the schedule the plaintiffs are obliged once a week to be on duty from midnight until 3 a.m. and from 7 p.m. to midnight. Plainly this is not in compliance with the provision requiring that the hours of duty within a calendar day shall be consecutive.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">We are also of opinion that in providing that the day off shall run from 3 a.m. to 3 a.m. the schedule does not meet the requirements of the statute. It is true that in that part of \u00a7 2 which provides that the \u201cmembers shall be entitled to not less than <em>one day </em>off in each calendar week\u201d the word \u201ccalendar\u201d before the word \u201cday\u201d is. omitted, although earlier in the same sentence in dealing with hours of duty the expression \u201ccalendar day\u201d is used (emphasis supplied). Nevertheless, we think that the word \u201cday\u201d means a calendar day. Words and phrases used in our statutes (with the exception of those which are technical or have acquired a peculiar meaning in law) \u201cshall be construed according to the common and approved usage of the language.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 4, \u00a7 6, Third. It has generally been held that the word \u201cday\u201d when not qualified means a calendar day. <em>The Pocket Veto Case, </em>279 U.
