From a final decree dismissing the bill, the plaintiff appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judge made voluntary findings of fact, which appear to have been intended as a complete statement of the facts that influenced him to his decision. Compare <em>Birnbaum </em>v. <em>Pamoukis, </em>301 Mass. 559, 561-562. The evidence is not reported. Thus the question is whether facts found support the decree. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Morson, </em>316 Mass. 678, 681. <em>Chapin </em>v. <em>Ruby, </em>321 Mass. 512, 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Pertinent findings of the judge and facts admitted in the pleadings are as follows: The plaintiff, who is forty-nine years of age, is the son of the late Max Silverman (hereinafter sometimes called Silverman), with whom for about thirty years prior to the latter\u2019s death' on October 31, 1947, he had been in business \u201cunder a rather loose financial arrangement.\u201d Silverman was survived by two daughters, three sons, eight grandchildren, and four great grandchildren. Silverman made a will on March 14, 1946, in which his son, the defendant Harry Silverman, and the defendants Steinberg and Burofsky, his sons-in-law, were named executors. Under his will Silverman left his business to the plaintiff and \u201call the property connected therewith, excepting any bank accounts used in the conduct of the business and excepting any funds in any bank then or thereafter used by or in connection with the business.\u201d At the time the will was made Silverman \u201chad the funds in banks which later were deposited in the three bank accounts in dispute.\u201d Neither at that time nor when he died could the bequests made by him have been paid unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>the funds here involved belonged to his estate. \u201cIn January and March, 1947, the plaintiff got his father to put his savings in the three bank accounts in dispute.\u201d One was in the name of Max Silverman as trustee for Myer Silver-man; another was in the name of Max Silverman or Myer Silverman; and a third was in a joint account in the names of Max and Myer Silverman and the survivor. \u201cIn so doing . . . Silverman did not intend to create a present interest in nor to make a gift to his son Myer; ... he retained full and unrestricted dominion over the funds and . . . thereafter continued to consider them as his property.\u201d No gift of any interest in the funds was made to the plaintiff. The funds belonged to Silverman\u2019s estate. By instruments under seal dated November 5, 1947, the plaintiff assigned all his \u201ctitle and interest\u201d in the three accounts to the defendants as executors of Silverman\u2019s estate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In making the assignments, the plaintiff did not intend to, and did not in fact, make a gift of them to the estate. The assignments were made voluntarily and were \u201cnot induced by fraud, threats, fear or other improper influence.\u201d Rather they were made because the plaintiff \u201cfelt that the funds belonged to his father and not to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">The decree was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s bill, as amplified by specifications, alleged that the funds in the three accounts represented in whole or in part the plaintiff\u2019s earnings over many years; that these funds were retained by Silverman for his (the plaintiff\u2019s) benefit; and that he was induced to execute the assignments to the defendants by duress and coercion exercised by his sister Ethel Burofsky and the defendant Steinberg. The findings of the judge, however, do not sustain these allegations. The plaintiff\u2019s contention that the assignments were given under mutual mistake requires no discussion. It may be doubted whether relief on that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>ground is within the scope of the bill. But however that may be, there are no findings which would warrant relief either on that ground or on any other.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-7\"> The final decree also ordered the dismissal of the defendants\u2019 counterclaim, but it need not concern us since the defendants did not appeal from the decree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-6\"> The allegations in the plaintiff's bill, by which he is bound (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 231, \u00a7 87), incorporate by reference the assignments, and they show that each contained a recital that it was sealed. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. <em>4, </em>$ 9A; <em>Tupper </em>v. <em>Hancock, </em>319 Mass. 105, 107.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
