The defendant\u2019s only exception is to the denial of its motion for a directed verdict. It argues that there was no evidence of negligence or of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag\">It was the evening of a rainy day, and, in view from the door by which the plaintiff entered, there was an indentation in the floor containing a puddle \u201cabout two feet wide, and maybe larger,\u201d one quarter to one half inch deep, and \u201cdark in color.\u201d The floor was of wood, and \u201cvery wet where everybody\u2019s feet left wet tracks \u2014 it would leave puddles all around there.\u201d It was an oily floor, \u201cvery dark in color.\u201d There was no sawdust anywhere. Upon taking three or four steps after entering the plaintiff fell. Her sensation was that she could not save herself \u201calthough she tried.\u201d She landed \u201cright in the puddle.\u201d She slid along, she \u201cslid into the puddle.\u201d There were marks made by her shoes. She was lying in the puddle on her back, and was there about twenty minutes. \u25a0 While on the floor, \u201cshe felt oil all around at the place where she was sitting, and it was oily up against the counters.\u201d Her hands were in the water, and afterwards on her hands, which had been clean before, she saw \u201c.thick and gritty oil.\u201d The puddle was so big that she thought it would be noticeable while she was on the floor. The foregoing is from the testimony of the plaintiff and from that of another witness who was in the store at the time. The latter also testified that the floor \u201cwas dark, oil color, very dark and they oil it once in a while\u201d; that she had seen them \u201cput the oil in the water as they wash the floor every Saturday night at the close of the meeting.\u201d; that some Saturday nights she had been passing by and had seen them; that she could not tell the exact date of the last time she had seen them before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>accident; and that it might have been a week or two earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">There was evidence from the defendant that the floor had never been oiled, but that a certain floor preparation was used about once in six weeks. The defendant\u2019s store manager testified that he did not know whether the floor preparation was oily.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">There was no error. The jury could find that oil or an oily preparation had been applied to the floor over a considerable period of time, that it had been done negligently, and that as a result a dangerous condition existed which caused the plaintiff\u2019s fall. It is unnecessary to consider refinements based upon the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that she slid along, that \u201cshe slid into the puddle,\u201d and any inherent question whether she started falling before or after she reached the puddle. It would be quite enough if on the floor where she fell there was \u201cthick and gritty oil\u201d in sufficient quantity to soil her hands (see <em>Ventromile </em>v. <em>Malden Electric Co. </em>317 Mass. 132, 135), particularly if in combination with a generally wet condition. The defendant apparently concedes that there was evidence warranting a finding that the floor was excessively oily inside the puddle, but not outside. We think that this is too narrow an interpretation of the evidence. The jury was not required to find that the \u201cthick and gritty oil\u201d on the plaintiff\u2019s hands came exclusively from contact with the floor inside the puddle in its form and shape prior to the displacement which necessarily occurred from the plaintiff\u2019s lying or sitting in it. It could find that the substance on her hands was representative of what was to be found on the floor surrounding the original puddle.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Cases of this type are fraught with narrow distinctions. The present action seems to bear a closer resemblance to <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. </em>266 Mass. 12, <em>Trottier </em>v. <em>Neisner </em>Brothers, <em>Inc. </em>284 Mass. 336, <em>Paull </em>v. <em>Radlo, </em>293 Mass. 521, and <em>Laskey </em>v. <em>First National Stores Inc. </em>317 Mass. 624, than to the cases relied upon by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-14\">, <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
