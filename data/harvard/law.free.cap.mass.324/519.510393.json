For the background of the controversy, see proceedings for trespass prior to the takings. <em>Suburban Land Co. Inc. </em>v. Billerica, 314 Mass. 184. <em>Flower </em>v. <em>Billerica, </em>320 Mass. 193. The first petition now before us relates to a taking on March 22, 1940, on Marshall Street, Burtt- Road, Cherry Road, and Pine Road, and the second to a taking on August 23, 1943, on Lake Street. The petitioner\u2019s exceptions are to the refusal of his requests for rulings and to \u201cthe findings and rulings of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ASP\">The judge filed the following: \u201cCourt finds and rules plaintiff\u2019s easement was not exclusive of the defendant\u2019s right to take an easement by way of eminent domain. At the time of the trespass the plaintiff was engaged in the business of selling water: following the trespass and prior to the taking, no business was conducted by the plaintiff on the streets involved in these proceedings. The plaintiff has been paid by the defendant for damages due to trespass. In these proceedings the court finds and rules that the plaintiff has suffered no damage for which the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>is answerable. Court finds for the defendant. These findings and rulings dispose of the plaintiff\u2019s requests for rulings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Two of the petitioner\u2019s requests were: \u201c1. The plaintiff, at the time of the taking by the defendant, was the owner of the exclusive easement in Lake St., Marshall St., Burt St., Pine St. and Cherry St. for purposes of a water system. 2. The plaintiff, as the owner of the exclusive easement in Lake, Marshall, Burt, Pine and Cherry Streets, is entitled to recover damages, for the value of said easement, upon the taking by the defendant by eminent domain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The petitioner\u2019s rights were acquired as grantee under a deed dated May 23, 1935, from Suburban Land Company, Inc. On that date the land company foreclosed a mortgage given to it by the Nuttings Lake Water Company, Inc., and the petitioner acquired at the foreclosure sale all the right, title, and interest of the water company. <em>Suburban Land Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Billerica, </em>314 Mass. 184, 186. The foreclosure deed conveyed certain lots, structures, and equipment, and \u201cthe, sole and exclusive right (subject only to rights taken by eminent domain) to lay, maintain, operate, repair and remove, pipes, mains, fixtures and other conduits for the distribution of water through the following described real estate . . . [[including the ways in question]. In case of taking by eininent domain of any right, interest or property conveyed herein, all damages and compensation therefor shall be paid to the grantee.\u201d In <em>Suburban Land Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Billerica, </em>314 Mass. 184, 190, we said, \u201cWe are of opinion that the land company never parted with the fee in the streets in controversy and could, and did, convey in 1924 to the Nuttings Lake Water Company, Inc., an exclusive easement in these streets for purposes of a water system, to which easement the plaintiff Flower succeeded by the foreclosure deed of 1935.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">The \u201cexclusive easement,\u201d however, was expressly made \u201csubject only to rights taken by eminent domain.\u201d This phrase qualified the easement granted. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>South Boston Savings Bank, </em>148 Mass. 300, 304; <em>McRae </em>v. <em>Pope, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>311 Mass. 500, 504. The words \u201csubject to,\u201d used in their ordinary sense, mean \u201csubordinate to,\u201d \u201csubservient to,\u201d or \u201climited by.\u201d <em>Engleslein </em>v. <em>Mintz, </em>345 Ill. 48, 61<em>McCarter </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>245 N. Y. 43, 46. <em>Percival </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>82 Vt. 531, 547. <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Smythe, </em>61 Wyo. 209; 226. The petitioner\u2019s easement, therefore, was not \u201cexclusive\u201d of the easements taken by eminent domain by the respondent in these two cases. Nor could it in any proper legal sense be said to have been taken by the mere taking of a concurrent and competing easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">\u2022 The petitioner suggests in his brief that the phrase \u201csubject only to rights taken by eminent domain\u201d was used \u201csolely for the purpose of eliminating any warranty by the grantor to the grantee that the property would not be taken by eminent domain\u201d; and that this phrase and the provision that damages for a taking by eminent domain should be paid to the grantee \u201cindicate that the grantee was to look solely to the town\u201d for such damages. The concluding portion of the suggestion is, of course, a truism. The suggested purpose, moreover, would have been entirely superfluous even had there been a warranty deed. Covenants of warranty in a deed refer only to rights outstanding at the time of delivery and not to rights subsequently acquired. The exercise of the sovereign power to take by eminent domain is not a breach-of any of the ordinary covenants, which \u201cdo not warrant against those fundamental liabilities to action on the part of the sovereign power which lie behind all private titles.\u201d <em>Goodyear Shoe Machinery Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Terminal Co. </em>176 Mass. 115, 117. See <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>6 Mass. 246, 250; <em>Parks </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>15 Pick. 198, 205; <em>Boston &amp; Hingham Steamboat Co. </em>v. <em>Munson, </em>117 Mass. 34, 39-40; <em>Kares </em>v. <em>Covell, </em>180 Mass. 206, 209; Rawle, Covenants for Title (5th ed.) \u00a7 129. Nor can private individuals effectively contract that property will not be taken by eminent domain. <em>Brimmer </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>102 Mass. 19, 22. <em>Edmands </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>108 Mass. 535, 544. <em>Burt </em>v. <em>Merchants\u2019 Ins. Co. </em>115 Mass. 1, 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">There was no error in ruling that the petitioner\u2019s ease<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>ment was not exclusive of the respondent\u2019s right to take an easement by eminent domain, nor in denying the petitioner\u2019s requests numbered 1 and 2, which were based on a contrary hypothesis.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The petitioner\u2019s exceptions embrace the ruling that he had suffered no damage for which the respondent is responsible, and raise the question whether his easement was taken, irrespective of the extent of its exclusiveness. It is clear that so far as concerns the owner of the fee the laying out of the street gave rise to an easement for \u201cevery reasonable means of transportation, transmission and movement beneath the surface of the ground as well as upon or above it,\u201d including the use of the street for water pipes. <em>New England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Terminal Co. </em>182 Mass. 397, 399. <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>13 Allen, 146, 159-160. As sometimes has been said, the whole beneficial use of the land was taken. <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>164 Mass. 1, 10. This principle, however, has limitations, which are particularly important in cases like the present, where the property allegedly taken was not that of the owner of the fee: Thus, it is the common rule that \u201c \u2018when private property is taken in the exercise of the right of eminent domain, the taking must be limited to the reasonable necessities of the case, so far as the owners of the property taken are concerned.\u2019 <em>Rockport </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>174 Mass. 385, 390.\u201d <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>188 Mass. 226, 228. \u201cThe right to take private property for a public use is founded upon and limited by public necessity. Where the necessity stops there stops the right to take, both as to amount of land and the nature of the interest therein.\u201d <em>Winnisimmet Co. </em>v. <em>Grueby, </em>209 Mass. 1, 2. See <em>Agostini </em>v. <em>North Adams Gas Light Co. </em>265 Mass. 70, 73; <em>Leroy </em>v. <em>Worcester Street Railway. </em>287 Mass. 1, 14. The implied finding was at least warranted, if not required, that the acquisition of the petitioner\u2019s easement was not necessary to the accomplishment of the purposes of the respondent\u2019s easement. There Is no contention that the respondent has used, or attempted to use, the petitioner\u2019s pipes. Compare <em>Beals </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>245 Mass. 20, 24. On the contrary, the funda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>mental facts are that prior to the takings the respondent had entered upon the ways unlawfully, had laid pipes of its own, and had served the petitioner\u2019s customers. These acts, in fact, constituted the trespasses for which the petitioner recovered from the respondent. The latter hardly needed a duplicating set of pipes. At least there was no evidence that it did. There was no error of law in finding, in effect, that there was no taking of the petitioner\u2019s easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The fifth request, asserting a right to compensation for the value of the petitioner\u2019s \u201cfranchise,\u201d was rightly denied. The petitioner had no franchise, as he had no \u201cgrant from the sovereign authority.\u201d <em>Bank of Augusta </em>v. <em>Earle, </em>13 Pet. 519, 595. <em>People </em>v. <em>Union Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>254 Ill. 395, 404. <em>Milhau </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>27 N. Y. 611, 619. <em>State </em>v. <em>Twin Village Water Co. </em>98 Maine, 214, 230. See <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Gas &amp; Electric Light Commissioners, </em>197 Mass. 556, 557; <em>Metropolitan Home Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>202 Mass. 402, 404-405; <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Haverhill Gas Light Co. </em>215 Mass. 394. The remaining requests require no consideration. The third was given in substance. The fourth and sixth requests relate to damages only.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
