There was evidence that in May, 1945, the plaintiff, then a soldier in the United States army stationed overseas, procured the roll of film in question containing thirty-six exposures from the United States army signal corps. He used the film in his camera to take pictures of various places such as battlefields, bombed areas and concentration camps. Having returned to the United States shortly thereafter, he deposited the roll of film with an agency of the defendant in Somerville to be developed. The defendant operated a photographic film development service. While in its possession the film was lost. An offer to replace the lost film with a new roll was not accepted. The plaintiff had intended to make albums containing the pictures obtained from the roll of film and to sell these albums to his comrades in the army at a price of $2.50 per copy, the estimated cost of which was fifty cents. A certain number of orders for the album had been received by the plaintiff. The judge found for the plaintiff in the sum of $250, the defendant having excepted to the refusal of the judge to rule as requested that \u201cthe plaintiff was not entitled to recover any damages.\u201d It is contended by the defendant that there is no evidence as to how many, if any, of the thirty-six exposures might have resulted in pictures after development.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">We are of opinion that there is sufficient evidence to warrant a finding that pictures had been recorded on the film. The plaintiff \u201chad previously obtained films from the same source and used them in the same camera. These films were developed overseas and when developed showed satisfactory pictures.\u201d To show the occurrence of an event ordinarily evidence of the inherent capacity and strong tendency of something to cause that event is evidence that the event did so result therefrom. See Wigmore on Evidence (3d ed.) \u00a7 446. The capacity of the plaintiff\u2019s camera when operated by the plaintiff to produce pictures on film \u201cob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>tained . . . from the same source\u201d having been demonstrated, the probability of a like result in the present case was sufficiently strong to warrant a finding that the development of the film would have revealed pictures. <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Accident Co. </em>307 Mass. 246, 250, 251. <em>Epstein </em>v. <em>Boston Housing Authority, </em>317 Mass. 297, 301, and cases cited. See <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Spinney, </em>310 Mass. 749, 752; <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Bullard, </em>313 Mass. 72, 89; <em>Lubell </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>314 Mass. 245, 248; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Rapid Transit Inc. </em>317 Mass. 469; <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Yardley &amp; Co. Ltd. </em>319 Mass. 92, 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">The ordinary measure of damages for the loss of property by a bailee, which property, as in this case, has no market value, is the actual value of the property to its owner. <em>Stickney </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>10 Gray, 352 (stereotype plates). <em>Green </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad, 128 </em>Mass. 221, 226 (portrait). This rule of damages is applied both in actions of tort for conversion and in actions of contract for failure to deliver property. In determining such value the cost of the property may be taken into account and the practicability and expense of replacing it. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad (supra). Mather v. American Express Co. 138 </em>Mass. 55 (architect\u2019s plans). <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. </em>210 Mass. 188, 196 (custom made gowns). <em>Woonsocket Machine &amp; Press Co. </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>239 Mass. 211 (explosive shells). Sedgwick on Damages (9th ed.) \u00a7 250. As the plaintiff was entitled to recover at least the expense to him of replacing the roll of film there was no error in refusing to grant the requested ruling. <em>Tinkham </em>v. <em>Wind, </em>319 Mass. 158, 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">\u2019 At the oral argument in this court, however, it was agreed by counsel that at the trial, when the request for the ruling was presented to the judge, both counsel and the judge understood that the ruling referred to the right of the plaintiff to recover special damages. Special damages are the damages sustained by a plaintiff beyond the mere loss of his property. <em>Stickney </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>10 Gray, 352, 357. Here they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>would consist in the loss of profits which would have accrued to the plaintiff from the sale of albums containing the pictures. But we must deal with the case on the record as it is presented to us. Statements of counsel as to the course of proceedings at the trial made in briefs or in oral argument in this court are not to be considered in deciding the case where not made the subject of an agreement of counsel approved by the trial judge. <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>306 Mass. 404, 408. <em>Trites </em>v. <em>Melrose, </em>318 Mass. 378. <em>Comstock </em>v. <em>Dewey, </em>323 Mass. 583, 585. See <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Guernsey, </em>316 Mass. 106, 108. The excepting party \u201cis bound to see that the bill of exceptions includes all that is necessary to enable us to decide whether the rulings, of which he complains, were or were not erroneous.\u201d <em>Posell </em>v. <em>Herscovitz, </em>237 Mass. 513, 517. The ruling before us refers to \u201cany damages.\u201d We must take the phrase in its ordinary sense in the absence of anything in the record to warrant a different interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"AXj0\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
