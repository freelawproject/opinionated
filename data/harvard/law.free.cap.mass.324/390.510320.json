The defendant demurred and assigned as reasons: \u201c1. That the declaration sets forth no legal cause of action against the defendant. 2. Res judicata.\u201d The demurrer was sustained by a judge, who reported his ruling to the Appellate Division, which affirmed the order sustaining the demurrer and dismissed the report. The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">If either ground of demurrer is good, it will be enough to dispose of the appeal. <em>Hiller </em>v. <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., ante, </em>24. As the declaration cannot properly be interpreted as alleging that there was either a hearing or a judgment in the District Court, the ground of res judicata need not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The first ground of demurrer is good. The declaration contains no allegation that the premises were controlled housing accommodations. See the housing and rent act of 1947, U. S. C. (1946 ed.) Sup. I, Title 50, Appendix, \u00a7 1899 (a) (2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The clear, direct, and unequivocal allegation of a crucial fact is lacking. <em>North Station Wine Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number><em>Liquors, Ltd. </em>323 Mass. 48, 51, and cases cited. <em>First Portland National Bank </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>323 Mass. 492, 495. At common law a landlord could terminate a tenancy at will for any purpose without his motives or reasons being attacked by the tenant. <em>DeWolfe </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>229 Mass. 410, 413. <em>Mescall </em>v. <em>Somerset Savings Bank, </em>305 Mass. 575, 579. <em>Gabriel </em>v. <em>Borowy, ante, </em>231, 234. The missing allegation cannot be supplied by inference from the allegations as to the petition filed with the office of price administration. A demurrer, admits allegations of fact well pleaded, but does not admit inferences from such facts unless they are necessary inferences. <em>Comerford </em>v. <em>Meier, </em>302 Mass. 398, 402. The petition might have been mistakenly filed. If, nevertheless, the declaration be treated as containing an allegation that the premises were controlled housing accommodations, it still falls short of stating a cause of action. Whether the case at bar be regarded as an action \u201cfor deceit and fraud,\u201d as described in the report, or as an action for wrongful eviction, as also argued by the parties, it is governed by our very recent decision in <em>Gabriel </em>v. <em>Borowy, ante, </em>231, which is conclusive against the plaintiff. It is unnecessary to repeat what was there said. The plaintiff is not aided by the allegation of \u201cthreats of illegal eviction.\u201d That is a conclusion of law not admitted by demurrer. <em>Neustadt </em>v. <em>Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corp. Ltd. </em>303 Mass. 321, 326. <em>Stockus </em>v. <em>Boston Housing Authority, </em>304 Mass. 507, 511. <em>Walter </em>v. <em>McCarvel, </em>309 Mass. 260, 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-7\"> It is to be noted that a certificate of the office of price administration was not required after July 1, 1947, the effective date of the housing and rent act of 1947.
