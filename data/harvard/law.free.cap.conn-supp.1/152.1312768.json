In the act of turning the car around the hind wheels slipped down an embankment and the defendant thought it advisable that the plaintiff and another guest who were riding with him should alight from the car as he feared that it would tip over.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-15\">There was nothing about the act of the defendant in attempting to turn the car around that constituted wanton misconduct, nor was the act of driving the car at the speed complained of by the plaintiff such an act as constituted wanton misconduct. The attempt has been made by the plaintiff in this case to make out of ordinary negligence a case of wanton misconduct. The plaintiff has failed to establish a case of wanton misconduct and the guest statute bars any right to recovery for ordinary negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-16\">Judgment is entered for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
