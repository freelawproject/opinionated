This claim very properly was fully argued to the jury by the defendant during the trial, and the jury by its verdict found against the defendant\u2019s conten' tion. Upon all of the evidence, I am abundantly satisfied that it properly so found. Were I led to the opposite conclusion, the defendant\u2019s argument in support of this motion would still be without merit. This disputed question of fact upon con' flicting evidence was one solely for the jury\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">The defendant\u2019s claim upon the second ground was similarly limited, to claimed error in the Court\u2019s charge as to the law concerning head lights, the claim being that it gave \u201cno ade' quate explanation in this regard\u201d. This criticism is confined to such explanation with relation to the head lights upon the plaintiff\u2019s motorcycle. The undisputed evidence was that though this collision occurred at about 11:00 P. M., it was a bright moonlight night, the locus was further very fully ib luminated by the many electric lights of -a gasoline filling station in the point between these intersecting roads, and that both headlights of the defendant\u2019s car were brightly burning. The only conflict of evidence on this feature of the case was as to whether the plaintiff had any head light burning upon his motorcycle. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence was that there were twin headlights brightly burning attached to his handlebars before the crash, and that thereby one of them was smashed and the other was still burning after. The defendant\u2019s only evidence upon this issue was that there was no head light burning upon the motorcycle either before or after the accb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>dent. Upon the issue so presented the .Court concluded that any quotation from the statute or explanation thereof was unnecessary and superfluous, and so omitted it. At the con' elusion of the charge, however, counsel for the. defendant orally suggested that the court hadn\u2019t referred to the con' flicting claims as to headlights. The Court then charged the jury further thereon as appears in the charge. It is my con' elusion that this sufficiently and fully covered this issue which the jury had to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The motion to set aside the verdict is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
