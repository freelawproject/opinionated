This presents the only question involved in the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">By article XIV of the charter, the park commissioners are given the exclusive management and control of the parks, squares and public pleasure grounds and the exclusive right to erect and superintend the erection of buildings and structures thereon, and while the money necessary for the maintenance, preservation and improvement of the parks, squares, avenues and grounds is provided .by section 11, there is no charter provision for money for the erection of buildings and structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Article XIV-A gives the playground commissioners jurisdiction over the children\u2019s playgrounds and similar public recreation centers in the city and county of San Francisco, and by section 10 of that article the supervisors are required to provide money for the development, equipment and maintenance of such playgrounds and recreation centers.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">By an amendment added at the end of article XIV-A, but without being numbered as a section, the recreation centers known as \u201cthe Aquatic Park,\u201d situate adjacent to Fort Mason; \u201cFleishhacker Pool and Playfield,\u201d situate south of Sloat Boulevard and adjacent to the Pacific Ocean; the \u201cMunicipal Golf Links,\u201d situate in the Lake Merced lands, and \u201cThe Stadium,\u201d opposite the Polytechnic high school, together with such land now acquired or hereafter acquired by the city and county adjacent to said centers which the supervisors shall designate, shall be under the exclusive control and management of the park commissioners. There is no provision in the charter requiring the supervisors to provide funds for the maintenance and development of these recreation centers. The people of San Francisco placed them under the control of the park commissioners and required their maintenance and development, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>but did not create a specific charter fund like the one created for the parks and playgrounds, and, therefore, there being no other fund created or provided, the maintenance and development of these recreation centers must be paid for from the general fund. This construction has been placed upon this provision of the charter by the officials of the city and county.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\">We think that, since the voters sought to charge the park commissioners with the construction and maintenance of recreation centers which are outside of the ordinary park activities, it must be held that the voters, by necessary implication, intended that the park commissioners should receive the money necessary to carry on the additional work without recourse to its regular appropriation for the operating expenses of the parks. Unless it be held that recreation centers separately constructed and placed under the jurisdiction of the park commissioners by the voters by an amendment to article XIV-A can be provided for under separate appropriation, the entire plan of the people in creating these centers by charter amendment must fail and the will and desire of the voters and taxpayers be defeated for lack of necessary funds to build and maintain these centers. Article III, chapter I, section 11 of the charter, limiting the annual maximum tax rate, except for the purposes therein mentioned, to one dollar on each one hundred dollars valuation of the property assessed furnishes a guarantee against extravagance in such appropriations from the general fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Let the writ of mandate issue as prayed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
