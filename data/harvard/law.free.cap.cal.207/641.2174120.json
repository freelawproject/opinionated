Defendants answered, denying invalidity in said deed of trust and by cross-complaint set up the fact that a sale had been had thereunder at which defendant Webster Manufacturing Company became the purchaser and received a deed to said property from the trustee. The prayer of the cross-complaint was that the title of said defendant under said sale be declared valid and that a receiver be appointed to manage and control the property pending the termination of the litigation. Defendants had judgment as prayed for under their cross-complaint, which judgment this court, upon authority of case No. 12641, <em>Webster Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Byrnes, ante, </em>p. 630 [280 Pac. 101], has this day affirmed. (See case S. F. No. 12236, <em>Oakland Terminal &amp; Elevator Corp. </em>v. <em>Mercantile Trust Co. et al., post, </em>p. 794 [280 Pac. 107].)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-3\">After said above-mentioned cause was at issue upon the amended and supplemental complaint and amended and supplemental answer and cross-complaint, cross-complainants moved the court for the appointment of a receiver, alleging title in themselves, the insolvency of plaintiff, the commission of waste by it in connection with the property and neglect thereof. Upon these and other facts the court appointed a receiver to take charge of said property. The plaintiff appealed from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Inasmuch as said deed of trust has been declared valid <em>(Webster Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Byrnes, supra), </em>and has been held sufficient to pass title to the purchaser, the receivership was impressed upon property not owned by plaintiff but owned by the cross-complainant Webster Mfg. Company. All questions, therefore, are now moot and this order appointing said receiver is likewise hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
