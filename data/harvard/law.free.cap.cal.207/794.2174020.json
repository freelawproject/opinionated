Company as beneficiary, and to have same removed as a cloud upon the title to its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-12\">Defendants answered, denying invalidity in said deed of trust and by cross-complaint set up the fact that a sale had been had thereunder at which defendant Webster Mfg. Company became the purchaser and received a deed to said property from the trustee. The prayer of the cross-complaint was that the title of said defendant under said sale be declared valid and that a receiver be appointed to manage and control the property pending the termination of the litigation. Defendants had judgment as prayed for under their cross-complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>The deed of trust here involved is the same deed of trust referred to in case S. F. No. 12641, <em>Webster Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Byrnes et al., ante, </em>p. 630 [280 Pac. 101], this day decided, to which reference is made, and upon authority of that case, the judgment in \u2019 the instant case is hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
