The indictment charged \u201c that Chapin Bailey, on the-day of July, 1881, in the county aforesaid, did unlawfully and injuriously put and place, and cause to be put and placed upon and across the common highway leading from Hickory Grove to the mountain road, divers pieces of tim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>her, rails and other material, and did unlawfully suffer the same to be and to remain there,\u201d &amp;c. Th\u00e9 defendant moved to quash the indictment. The county court overruled the motion. At December term, upon trial, the jury found the defendant guilty, as alleged in the indictment, and assessed his fine at two dollars. Defendant moved for a new trial, and in arrest of judgment; which motions were overruled, and defendant excepted, and judgment was entered accordingly. From the judge of the circuit court of said county defendant obtained a writ of error; upon hearing whereof the circuit court affirmed the judgment of the county court. To which judgment of the circuit court, the plaintiff in error obtained from one of the j udges of this court a writ of error and supersedeas.

The prosecution was for a statutory offence, under \u00a7 1, ch. 26, of the Criminal Eevision Acts of 1877-8, which says: \u201cAny person who shall <em>Jcnowingly </em>and <em>wilfully, </em>without lawful authority, obstruct any road,\u201d &amp;c., &amp;c. The indictment, in describing and charging the offence, says that \u201cChapin Bailey, on the-day of July, in the county aforesaid, did <em>unlawfully </em>aud <em>injuriously </em>put and place,\u201d &amp;c., &amp;c. This, we think, is a fatal variance between the statutory definition of the offence and the allegations in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>In no case can argument or inference supply the total want of averment of an essential part or. element of the offence.

According to this definition, a road which has merely been ordered to be opened, but never actually opened, cannot be considered a highway or public road; and if the plaintiff in error was guilty of any offence, it was for a contempt of court in resisting the execution of its order to open the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">But the matter is not left to inference or construction; for Crawford Cushing, the court\u2019s own commissioner, who was ordered to <em>complete </em>the opening of the road, was a wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>ness on the trial for the prosecution, and he swore that on the presentation of his report, the court \u201c directed the opening (of the road) to be completed,\u201d when <em>\u201c </em>Mr. Bailey at once obstructed the road, and has kept it obstructed ever since.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The <em>onus </em>was on the prosecution to prove that the road or highway, for obstructing which the plaintiff in error was indicted and tried, was, at the time of the alleged obstruction, a regularly established and open road or public thoroughfare. Yet the Commonwealth\u2019s witness, who was the commissioner ordered by the county court of Prince William to complete the opening, swears that the order of the court was never executed, and the proposed road never opened; and that when he attempted to open it\u2014a year or more after the date of the order of court\u2014he was prevented by the said Chapin Bailey, the owner of the land, who had obstructed the road and has kept it obstructed ever since. On the application of R. C. Latham and others, the county court of Prince William county, at its January term, 1878, appointed Crawford Cushing a commissioner to examine and report upon a certain proposed road upon or through the land of the plaintiff in error. Here the proceeding was permitted to sleep until the June term, 1880, when Chapin Bailey, the plaintiff in error, filed his petition under \u00a7 7, ch. 181, Acts 1874-5, p. 178, protesting against the irregularity and unlawfulness of the proceeding; and praying for the appointment of a proper commission to assess his just compensation for his land, and for its allowance to him by the county court.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The law made it mandatory on the court to appoint five disinterested freeholders of the county for the purpose of ascertaining a just compensation for the land to be used for such road; and yet, though petitioned so to do by the land owner himself, a party to the proceeding in court, the county court of Prince William county failed wholly to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Judge Moncure, in the opinion of the court in the case of <em>Mitchell </em>v. Thornton, 21 Gratt. 178, said: <em>\u201c </em>The proprietor is entitled to receive as compensation at least the value of the land proposed to be taken for the road, or rather the value of the use of the land for the road, which is generally equal to the full value of the land. In addition to the value of the land, or the use of it, the proprietor is entitled to be compensated for the damage to the residue of the tract beyond the peculiar benefits which -will be derived, in respect to such residue, from the road; but if the damage to the residue of the tract fall short of such peculiar benefits, then the deficiency is not to be charged to the proprietor, nor deducted from the amount to which he is entitled on account of the land proposed to be taken for the road, as aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The plaintiff in error was not. guilty of any violation of law in protecting his own property, and in obstructing the unlawful seizure and confiscation of his land, and he was improperly and unlawfully convicted for so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">We are of opinion that the circuit court of Prince William county erred in affirming the judgment of the county court, which overruled the motion in arrest of judgment; and the judgment of the county court and the judgment of the circuit court are both reversed and annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
