The primary questions are whether the Board failed to consider the noneconomic hardship that petitioners\u2019 deportation might have on their family, especially on their two United States citizen children, and if so, whether the Board thereby failed to properly exercise its discretion. We hold that the Board\u2019s decision fails to reflect consideration of all the relevant hardship factors asserted by petitioners in reaching its decision regarding the existence of \u201cextreme hardship.\u201d Accordingly, we remand the case to the Board for further proceedings so that the \u201cextreme hardship\u201d determination may be made upon a proper consideration of all the asserted hardship factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-14\">Petitioners Joaquin and Maria Ramos are natives and citizens of the Philippines. On July 20, 1967, petitioners entered the United States at Savannah, Georgia, as nonimmigrant visitors for pleasure with permission to stay until October 20, 1967. They subsequently obtained permission to stay until April 20, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-15\">In February 1968, Mr. Ramos was hired by his present employer, the 3M National Advertising Company, to work in Chicago, Illinois. Mrs. Ramos obtained employment at a Chicago hospital as a medical technologist. While in Chicago, Mrs. Ramos gave birth to two children, Michael, who was born in May 1968, and Mark, who was born in December 1970. Because they were born in this country, both children are United States Citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-16\">Petitioners lived and worked in Chicago with their two children until 1974, when 3M transferred Mr. Ramos to Dallas, Texas. Mrs. Ramos obtained employment in Dallas, again as a medical technologist. Petitioners and their children have lived in Dallas since that time. Mr. Ramos\u2019s parents, who are aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence and partially dependent on petitioners for support, also lived with them in Dallas for a while.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-17\">Because petitioners failed to leave the' United States within the time authorized for their departure,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> deportation proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>ings were instituted against them. Petitioners conceded deportability, and applied for discretionary relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioners asserted that if they were deported extreme hardship would result to themselves, to their United States citizen children, and to Mr. Ramos\u2019s resident alien parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Following several hearings which concluded on January 26,1977, an immigration judge, in a written decision dated November 21, 1977, rejected petitioners\u2019 claims of hardship and denied their application for suspension of deportation. Petitioners appealed to the Board, which, on March 19, 1980, remanded the case to the immigration judge, holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">\u201cIn view of the amount of time that has passed since the last hearing on [petitioners\u2019] application, and the representations made on appeal concerning extreme hardship to the [petitioners\u2019] two United States citizen children, we have concluded that the record must be remanded so that it may be updated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">On remand, the immigration judge conducted a hearing on October 21, 1980, during which he received additional evidence. He then issued a written decision, dated April 8, 1981, which tracked almost word for word his initial decision denying suspension of deportation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In his decision, the immigration judge recited petitioners\u2019 assertions respecting the acclimation of their children to the \u201cAmerican way of life\u201d and the difficulty they would undergo as a result of a change of schools. And he referred to petitioners\u2019 attempt to obtain a continuance for psychiatric evaluation of the effect a return to the Philippines might have on their children.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>only response to or evaluation of these assertions was that \u201cthe children could stay with a sister of Mr. Ramos.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The immigration judge instead concentrated almost exclusively on the economic hardship that petitioners\u2019 deportation would have on themselves and on their children:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-4\">\u201cThe mere fact that an alien\u2019s economic opportunity in a foreign country may be somewhat less than they are in the United States, is not, by itself, sufficient to establish the \u2018extreme hardship\u2019 required .... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Petitioners again appealed to the Board, which, by decision dated November 17, 1981, affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s order. In its discussion respecting the \u201cextreme hardship\u201d issue, the Board, like the immigration judge, concentrated almost entirely on the assertions of economic hardship to petitioners and to their children, though the record plainly shows that petitioners did not rely primarily upon economic factors to establish extreme hardship.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, neither the immigration judge nor the Board recited or discussed the asserted hardship on Mr. Ramos\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">To be eligible for discretionary suspension of deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(1), an alien must show: (1) that he has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of time not less than seven years immediately preceding an application for relief; (2) that during this period, he was and is a person of good moral character; and (3) that \u201cin the opinion of the Attorney General,\u201d his deportation would result in \u201cextreme hardship\u201d to himself or to his spouse, parent, or child who is a citizen of the United States or a lawful permanent resident. An alien who meets these requirements is merely eligible for suspension of deportation, and is in no way entitled to such relief. <em>Faddah v. INS, </em>580 F.2d 132, 133 (5th Cir.1978). Thus, even where all the requirements are met, suspension of deportation may be denied in the exercise of discretion. <em>Vaughn v. INS, </em>643 F.2d 35, 37 (1st Cir.1981). The decision whether to suspend the deportation of an alien who satisfies the three statutory requirements is therefore discretionary, and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>subject only to a most restricted judicial review. <em>Foti v. INS, </em>375 U.S. 217, 228, 84 S.Ct. 306, 313, 11 L.Ed.2d 281 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">As to an alien\u2019s eligibility for discretionary relief, the determination whether he has satisfied the first and second statutory requirements are \u201cfindings of fact,\u201d and must \u201cbe supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record as a whole.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, unlike the first two requirements, the third statutory requirement, that of extreme hardship, is phrased in terms of \u201cin the opinion of the Attorney General,\u201d rather than simply in terms of the ultimate standard (extreme hardship) itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In <em>INS v. Wang, </em>450 U.S. 139, 101 S.Ct. 1027, 67 L.Ed.2d 123 (1981), the Supreme Court observed with respect to the words \u201cextreme hardship\u201d that \u201cthe Act commits this definition in the first instance to the Attorney General and his delegates,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 144, 101 S.Ct. at 1031, and they \u201chave the authority to construe \u2018extreme hardship\u2019 narrowly should they deem it wise to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145, 101 S.Ct. at 1031. We believe that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Wang </em>is inconsistent with those earlier Courts of Appeals decisions, such as <em>Bastidas v. INS, </em>609 F.2d 101, 104 (3d Cir.1979), which held that determinations of no \u201cextreme hardship\u201d were reviewable under the conventional \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test of section 1105a(a)(4) to essentially the same extent as determinations of the seven continuous years of physical presence and good moral character requirements of section 1254(a)(1). Other <em>pre-Wang </em>Courts of Appeals decisions had indicated that review of no \u201cextreme hardship\u201d determinations was under a more limited \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard. <em>See Brathwaite v. INS, </em>633 F.2d 657, 659-60 (2d Cir.1980) (recognizing differing standards, but not choosing between them).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">Our own pre- <em>Wang </em>decisions, while not expressly referring to differing standards of review for \u201cextreme hardship\u201d determinations as contrasted to the other two requirements of eligibility for discretionary relief under section 1254(a)(1), appear to have followed an abuse of discretion approach. <em>See Chokloikaew v. INS, </em>601 F.2d 216, 218 (5th Cir.1979).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In view of Wang\u2019s language concerning the authority of the Attorney General to define \u201cextreme hardship\u201d and to construe it narrowly, we doubt that there remains much, if any, scope for judicial <em>substantive </em>review, even under an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard, of no \u201cextreme hardship\u201d determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">We do not believe, however, that <em>Wang </em>foreclosed all review in this area. <em>Wang </em>does not question <em>Foti, </em>which clearly held that in a deportation proceeding denial of requested suspension of deportation under section 1254(a)(1) was judicially reviewable pursuant to section 1105a(a). At the very least, then, it would appear that judicial review remains available to ensure that an alien, denied relief under section 1254(a)(1) by reason of a no \u201cextreme hardship\u201d determination, has had a fair and full considera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>tion of his claims in this regard.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This seems to be the trend of the post-Wang decisions of other Courts of Appeals, and we are in general agreement with this view. <em>See, </em>eg., <em>Prapavat v. INS, </em>638 F.2d 87 (9th Cir.1981), <em>aff\u2019d on rehearing, </em>662 F.2d 561, 562 (9th Cir.1982) (remanded to Board because it \u201cdid not consider all the factors relevant to the \u2018extreme hardship\u2019 determination\u201d); <em>Santana-Figueroa v. INS, </em>644 F.2d 1354, 1356-57 (9th Cir.1981) (same); <em>Ravancho v. INS, </em>658 F.2d 169, 174-76 (3d Cir.1981) (same); <em>Phinpathya v. INS, </em>673 F.2d 1013, 1016-17 (9th Cir.) (same; Mr. Phinpathya\u2019s case), <em>cert. </em>granted,-U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 291, 74 L.Ed.2d 275 (1982) (\u201cquestion presented\u201d relates to issue of \u201ccontinuous physical presence\u201d in Mrs. Phinpathya\u2019s case). <em>Cf. Bueno-Carrillo v. Landon, </em>682 F.2d 143 (7th Cir.1982).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The factors generally relevant to a determination of extreme hardship are summarized as follows in <em>Bueno-Carrillo:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">\u201cWe do not believe that Congress intended the immigration courts to suspend the deportation of all those who will be unable to maintain the standard of living at home which they have managed to achieve in this country.... It is only when other factors such as advanced age, illness, <em>family ties, </em>etc. combine with economic detriment that deportation becomes an extreme hardship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-15\">The relevance of close family ties seems implicit in the statutory provision that the \u201cextreme hardship\u201d requirement may be met by showing such hardship to the citizen or legal resident spouse, parent, or child of the alien, even though no such hardship would result directly to the alien himself.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And there is ample authority in other Circuits for the proposition that imposing on grade school age citizen children, who have lived their entire lives in the United States, the alternatives of either prolonged and geographically extensive separation from both parents or removal to a country of a vastly different culture where they do not speak the language, is a matter which normally must be considered by the INS in its determination of whether \u201cextreme hardship\u201d has been shown. Ravancho<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>; <em>Prapavat </em><footnotemark>14</footnotemark>; Phinpathya.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This Circuit has not expressly so held, but we believe our prior decisions are not inconsistent with this ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>proach. In <em>Chokloikaew, </em>we held that a determination of no \u201cextreme hardship\u201d was not an abuse of discretion, noting with respect to the alien\u2019s various assertions of hardship, that the immigration judge \u201cconsidered each of those factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218. We went on to point out that \u201c[e]conomie detriment ... does not compel a finding of \u2018extreme hardship\u2019,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 218, and that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoP\">\u201cHe [the alien] lived in Thailand, where his family lives now, until he was twenty-one years old and should not suffer \u2018extreme hardship\u2019 in readjusting to social and economic conditions there. <em>Compare Acosta v. Landon, </em>S.D.Cal., 1954, 125 F.Supp. 434 (suspension of deportation granted to alien who had been in this country legally for almost forty years, had married a native-born United States citizen, and had four American-born children).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The discretionary determination respecting extreme hardship is not bound by any fixed rules; rather it depends upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Because this is so, the Attorney General can properly fulfill his duty to exercise his discretion only if he or his delegates actually consider those facts and circumstances. <em>Santana-Figueroa </em>at 1356<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>; <em>Phinpathya </em>at 1016. The Board\u2019s decision must reflect that it has meaningfully addressed and reached a reasoned conclusion on the alien\u2019s specific assertions of hardship that are based on evidence. The Board has a duty \u201cto \u2018give reasons which show that it has properly considered the facts which bear on its decision.\u2019 <em>Mejia-Carrillo v. INS, </em>656 F.2d 520, 522 (9th Cir.1981).\u201d <em>Prapavat, </em>662 F.2d at 562. The reasons given by the Board for denial of relief must \u201creflect[] consideration of\u201d the relevant evidence of claimed hardship. <em>Phinpathya </em>at 1016. As the reviewing Court, we must \u201cmake our decision,\u201d concerning the factors considered by the Board, \u201cbased on the Board\u2019s own articulation of its actions,\u201d rather than on assumptions. <em>Ravancho </em>at 175. As stated in <em>Santana-Figueroa:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\">\u201c. .. [W]hen allegations are specific and supported by evidentiary material, and the Board denies eligibility for relief, it must give reasons for its decisions showing that it has properly considered the circumstances.... To affirm on the theory that the Board necessarily considered whatever the petitioner asserted would free the Board of the obligation to articulate a reasoned basis for its decisions, eliminating any guaranty of rationality . ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1357.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-5\"><em>See also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 103.3, 242.18(a) (1982); <em>Perez v. INS, </em>643 F.2d 640, 641 (9th Cir.), <em>modified, </em>665 F.2d 269 (9th Cir.1981), <em>peti</em>tion <em>for cert. </em>filed,-U.S.-, 103 S.Ct. 320, 74 L.Ed.2d 296 (1982) (\u201cquestion presented\u201d relates to whether Court of Appeals erred in holding verification requirements for motions to reopen deportation proceedings could be disregarded in light of <em>Wang).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">It is undisputed that petitioners satisfied the first and second requirements of section 1254(a)(1). The immigration judge and the Board, however, held that petitioners failed to show extreme hardship, and thus, they were statutorily ineligible for discretionary relief.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">At the initial hearing before the immigration judge on January 26,1977, petitioners introduced evidence that their children, who were then eight and six years old, are in all respects culturally American; that they both speak English; that they do not speak the language of the Philippines, which is Tagalog (an Austronesian language); and that they have no emotional ties to the Philippines. Petitioners also testified that when they moved to Dallas from Chicago, their oldest son, Michael, had been emotionally traumatized by the relocation, and that a move to the Philippines would cause a more serious trauma because of the different culture.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In this same connection, petitioners testified to their concern about the effect the different culture of the Philippines would have on both children. Petitioners also testified to the hardship that their deportation would have on Mr. Ramos\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">It is evident from the written decisions of the immigration judge that he did not consider the emotional and other noneconomic hardships that petitioners asserted would result to their children and to Mr. Ramos\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>parents should they be deported, even though the Board, on the first appeal, had remanded the ease to the immigration judge to update the record, partly in response to petitioners\u2019 assertions of hardship to their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">In its opinion on the second appeal, the Board recited petitioners\u2019 contentions that \u201cthey <em>[i.e., </em>petitioners] would go through agony if separated from their United States citizen children,\u201d and that \u201cthe favorable factors in their cases, when combined with the economic detriment that they would allegedly suffer if deported, establish extreme hardship.\u201d The Board also recognized that extreme hardship \u201cdepends upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case\u201d; that \u201c[i]n determining whether such hardships exist one must consider all the factors involved in a case\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>; and that \u201cwhat circumstances constitute \u2018extreme hardship\u2019 require a delicate balancing and are rarely made by the Board on the basis of a single factor alone.\u201d The Board, however, proceeded to discuss only the economic detriment that would be caused by the petitioners\u2019 deportation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">\u201cIn concluding that extreme hardship has not been established in the instant case, we acknowledge that the [petitioners] may encounter some difficulty in obtaining similar employment for similar pay in the Philippines. <em>See Guadarrama-Rogel v. INS, </em>638 F.2d 1228 (9th Cir. 1981). Any economic detriment caused by their deportation, however, <em>in and of itself </em>is insufficient to support the statutory requirement of \u2018extreme hardship.\u2019 <em>See Blanco-Dominguez v. INS, </em>528 F.2d 382 (9th Cir.1975); <em>Pelaez v. INS, </em>513 F.2d 303 (5th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 892, 96 S.Ct. 190, 46 L.Ed.2d 124 (1975). The [petitioners] are still comparatively young and have accumulated considerable financial assets in this country. We do not find the possibility of their being unable to find jobs that pay as well as the ones in the United States to be so severe as to result in \u2018extreme hardship\u2019 if they are deported to the Philippines. In any event, they should benefit from the experience and maturity gained in the United States.\u201d (Emphasis added except in citations.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">The Board did not in any way address the asserted <em>noneconomic </em>hardship to petitioners themselves or to their children, and it also totally ignored the asserted hardship to Mr. Ramos\u2019s parents, even though these assertions were based on evidence. And, the Board accordingly also failed to consider <em>cumulatively </em>the hardship factors pertaining to each member of the statutory class. These failures amounted to a denial of the consideration which Mr. and Mrs. Ramos were entitled to have the Board give to their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">While we emphasize that we \u201cdo not question the Board\u2019s finding on the basis of our own view of what constitutes extreme hardship,\u201d we do hold that in making a determination of what constitutes extreme hardship, the decision of the immigration authorities must affirmatively reflect that they have meaningfully addressed and reached a reasoned conclusion concerning all the factors relevant to that determination which are based on evidence, a requirement that the Board itself abstractly recognized, but did not apply. <em>Prapavat </em>at 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">We recognize that the immigration authorities are burdened by a heavy case load. It is not our intention to require of them lengthy exegeses on immigration law or extended discussion of evidentiary minutiae. All we insist upon is a sufficient indication that they have a fair understanding of what the alien\u2019s various relevant contentions of hardship, supported by the evidence, actually are; that they have meaningfully considered and evaluated each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>these contentions; and that they provide a statement of the reasons why, in their opinion, these contentions do not, individually and in the aggregate, establish \u201cextreme hardship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">We reverse the Board\u2019s order as to both petitioners and remand the case to it for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-10\">.

Efforts were made on petitioners\u2019 behalf to obtain third preference visas for them and to obtain relief through a private bill in Congress. In January 1968, Mr. Ramos filed a petition for a third preference visa. Early in 1970, he discovered that the INS had lost this application, and in March 1970, he refiled it. In June 1971, the third preference visa was approved; however, it was revoked in May 1972, and administrative appeal was denied in July 1972. In August 1972, efforts were begun to have a private bill introduced in Congress on behalf of both the Ramoses, and such a bill was filed by Congressman Rostenkowski in February 1973. Mrs. Ramos applied for a third preference visa in September 1972, and it was granted in July 1973. However, all these efforts ultimately proved unavailing, and petitioners were or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>dered to leave the United States; Mr. Ramos by February 1, 1973, and Mrs. Ramos by February 7, 1975.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b271-8\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-9\">\u201cSuspension of deportation \u2014 Adjustment of status for permanent residence; contents \u201c(a) As hereinafter prescribed in this section, the Attorney General may, in his discretion, suspend deportation and adjust the status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, in the case of an alien (other than an alien described in section 1251(a)(19) of this title) who applies to the Attorney General for suspension of deportation and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-10\">\u201c(1) is deportable under any law of the United States except the provisions specified in paragraph (2) of this subsection; has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than seven years immediately preceding the date of such application, and proves that during all of such period he was and is a person of good moral character; and is a person whose deportation would, <em>in the opinion of the Attorney General, </em>result in extreme hardship to the alien or to his spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b271-11\">. Although the immigration judge found that petitioners had not established that their deportation would result in extreme hardship to themselves or to their United States citizen children, the judge stated in both decisions that they were \u201cstatutorily eligible for suspension of deportation\u201d but that \u201cthe factors that must be weighed do not indicate that they merit the granting of suspension of deportation.\u201d Section 1254(a)(1) clearly provides that one is eligible for suspension of deportation only if all the requirements, including a showing of extreme hardship, are met. Since the immigration judge found that extreme hardship was not shown, his statement that petitioners were \u201cstatutorily eligible,\u201d is not comprehensible, and nor is his further statement that \u201cthe factors ... do not indicate that they merit the granting of suspension.\u201d On appeal, the Board did not mention or discuss these latter factors. The Board\u2019s decision denying suspension rested exclusively on the determination that petitioners had failed to show extreme hardship. Accordingly, we can affirm the Board only if it properly disposed of the \u201cextreme hardship\u201d matter. <em>See Reyes v. INS, </em>673 F.2d 1087, 1091 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b271-15\">. A psychiatric evaluation of petitioners\u2019 children was performed by Dr. Frank E. Crumley, a child and adolescent psychiatrist. His January 26, 1977 report states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-16\">\u201c[Michael\u2019s] history reveals difficulty adjusting to school after the family moved from Chicago to Dallas. He would not talk in school for several months. His father had to attend school with him since he showed school phobia symptoms.... His speech, choice of toys, knowledge, and interest were typical of American boys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-17\">\u201c[Mark\u2019s] choice of toys and drawings were typical of American children.... He would be particularly vulnerable to a move at this age because he is just now developing relationships outside the home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APsN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>\u201c. .. Neither child has ever been separated from their parents. They have always been cared for by them. They have strong bonds toward their parents. It would be extremely traumatic if they were now separated from their parents. This would be particularly traumatic since there would be little or no understandable explanation for this in their minds. Even if there were other relatives available, they could not substitute for their own parents and the children would be emotionally orphaned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">\u201cOnce a child has adopted the culture of a country he is subject to rejection by peers if he is forced to readjust to the new culture. The child at age six and onward is particularly vulnerable to this .... Mark would be in a particularly vulnerable age at this time .... He showed evidence of anxiety about his ability to make friends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">\u201cMichael has already shown symptoms of school phobia and transient elective mutism, following a previous move even within the United States. He would be particularly vulnerable to exacerbation of these symptoms especially if he were forced to move outside of the country. He is very much identified with American culture. He is concerned about his ability to make friends and shows evidence of impending depression if he could not make appropriate friends. He is already described as a shy child .... [H]e would be prone to withdraw and isolate himself in depression.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-12\">\u201c. ..

It was attached to petitioners\u2019 brief to the Board on the first appeal. On remand, this matter was brought to the attention of the immigration judge.

In <em>Perdido v. INS, </em>420 F.2d 1179 (5th Cir. 1969), our major holding was that deportation of the parents of a citizen child does not violate the child\u2019s constitutional rights. We also held that for purposes of waiver under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(e) of the requirement that certain aliens admitted as students spend two years outside the United States before being eligible for return on a permanent basis, the fact that the aliens\u2019 one- and two-year-old citizen children would as a practical matter have to spend two years in the Philippines, was not an \u201cexceptional hardship\u201d of \u201cthe sort intended by Congress to call for the exercise of the waiver provision\u201d of section 1182(e). <em>Id. </em>at 1181. There is, of course, a great difference between the adjustment required of such infants and that of grade school age children. <em>Aalund v. Marshall, </em>461 F.2d 710 (5th Cir.1972), was concerned with deportation and denial of the discretionary relief of voluntary departure under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(e), which has an eligibility requirement of \u201cgood moral character,\u201d but <em>not </em>of \u201cextreme hardship.\u201d We held that the fact that the alien\u2019s deportation \u201cwould necessarily entail a de facto deportation of her infant child,\u201d a United States citizen, did not render the alien\u2019s \u201cunderlying deportation order\u201d void or arbitrary or capricious, nor render the alien, who had been properly found <em>not </em>of good moral character, eligible to be considered for voluntary departure. For these reasons, failure of the immigration judge to consider the effect of his order on the infant citizen child was immaterial, since \u201chad he done so, no different result <em>could </em>have obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 714 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-16\">In <em>Gonzalez-Cuevas v. INS, </em>515 F.2d 1222 (5th Cir. 1975), the aliens\u2019 entry from Mexico had been on 72-hour visas. In their deportation they requested, and were allowed, voluntary departure with deferral until the end of the school year to accommodate their children, two of whom (of a total of nine) were United States citizens. On appeal to this Court, they sought remand, as well as review of denial of requested reopening, to develop evidence supporting a further deferral until they could mature a priority position for an immigration visa. We again held that lawful deportation of parents of citizen children did not violate the <em>rights </em>of the children, and that the presence of citizen children did not confer on the illegal alien parents the legal <em>right </em>to further deferral of voluntary departure until their visas could be obtained. <em>Gonzalez-Cuevas </em>did not involve section 1254(a)(1) or other statute <em>expressly </em>dealing with \u201cextreme hardship,\u201d or the equivalent, <em>to </em>citizen children of a deportable alien.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-18\"><em>Faddah v. INS, </em>553 F.2d 491 (5th Cir. 1977), sustained denial of petition to reopen deportation proceedings to seek discretionary relief under section 1254(a)(1). Of the alien couple\u2019s four children, two were United States citizens (one bom after the decision of the Board, the age of the other being undisclosed). We noted that other than the children, the aliens had no immediate family in the United States, and did have some family in their native Finland. The children \u201chad English as their first language\u201d (presumably Finnish as their second). We held that extreme hardship was not established, and also that the aliens were not of good moral character and that their dilatory tactics made their required seven years\u2019 residence in doubt. Because of its rather unique facts, as well as it having been a reopening case (see note 10, <em>supra), </em>we do not consider <em>Faddah </em>as being inconsistent with our analysis here. <em>Aguilar v. INS, </em>638 F.2d 717 (5th Cir.1981), likewise involved an appeal from a refusal to reopen. We held the Board did not abuse its discretion in determining that an adequate prima facie case of extreme hardship was not made by aliens from Belize, one of whom had a four-year-old citizen child. We observed that the Board had expressly held there was no evidence the citizen child would suffer specific hardship if returned to Belize, and that all immediate relatives of the aliens lived in Belize, except the child\u2019s father, a United States citizen who was separated from the alien mother. The opinion does not indicate whether there was any showing the child was unable to speak Spanish. In <em>Men Keng Chang v. Jiugni, </em>669 F.2d 275 (5th Cir. 1982), we again sustained a refusal to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>open requested on the basis of claimed hardship to two citizen children, noting that these children were barely two years old and were then, and had been for most of their brief lives, residents of Taiwan. These holdings are not contrary to our present analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b276-7\">. \u201cBecause hardship depends on specific circumstances, <em>Banks v. INS, </em>594 F.2d 760, 762 (9th Cir. 1979), discretion can be properly exercised only if the circumstances are actually considered.
