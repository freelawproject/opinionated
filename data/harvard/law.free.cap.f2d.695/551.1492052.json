The findings of such a special master are entitled to the same deference as those of the typical factfinder, reviewable by a district court under the clearly erroneous standard. Fed. R.Civ.P. 53(e)(2) (\u201c[T]he court shall accept the master\u2019s findings of fact unless clearly erroneous.\u201d). Contrast this with the designation of a magistrate to conduct hearings under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 636(b)(1) where, on objection to the magistrate\u2019s findings, the district court must \u201cmake a de novo determination.\u201d <em>E.g., Nettles v. Wainwright, </em>677 F.2d 404, 409 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-23\">The magistrate here made an express finding of discrimination. The district court correctly reviewed that finding under the then law of this Circuit which provided that discrimination was an issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>\u201cult\u00edmate fact\u201d to which the clearly erroneous standard of appellate review did not apply. <em>E.g., Thompson v. Leland Police Department, </em>633 F.2d 1111, 1112 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>East v. Romine, Inc., </em>518 F.2d 332, 338-39 (5th Cir.1975); <em>Causey v. Ford Motor Co., </em>516 F.2d 416, 421 (5th Cir.1975).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, however, the Supreme Court rejected this Circuit\u2019s approach, concluding that a finding of discrimination is reviewable only for clear error. <em>Pullman-Standard </em>v. <em>Swint, </em>456 U.S. 273, 282, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 1787, 72 L.Ed.2d 66, 78-79 (1982). Although <em>Swint </em>concerned Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, not the Age Discrimination Employment Act (ADEA), there is no reason to distinguish between findings under the two statutes for appellate review purposes. <em>Cf. Smith v. Farah Manufacturing Co., </em>650 F.2d 64, 68 (5th Cir.1981) (in a <em>pre-Swint </em>decision, viewing the existence of age discrimination under the ADEA as an issue of ultimate fact, like the existence of race or other discrimination under Title VII).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">We therefore must remand to the district court for reconsideration of the magistrate\u2019s finding of discrimination in light of the standard of review set forth in <em>Swint.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-13\">. The Eleventh Circuit, in the en banc decision of <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir.1981), adopted as precedent the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit decided prior to October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
