The principal question is whether this statutory one-third reduction was applicable. We hold that it was not, as to a part of the time in issue, and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-14\">The material facts are undisputed. Appellant Neima Bormey (\u201cBormey\u201d) was born on January 10,1958. She suffers from a degenerative disease of the legs and arms, which has rendered her permanently disabled, and she lives at home with her parents and two sisters. In July 1974, the district office of the Social Security Administration determined that Bormey was eligible for full Supplemental Security Income (\u201cSSI\u201d) benefits as a disabled child. The administrative record shows that Bormey was paid full benefits because her parents told the district office that they had no income.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-15\">On November 8, 1977, when Bormey was 19, she made an application with the district office to be made the payee of her SSI benefits. On November 10, 1977, the district office, having learned that her father had worked and earned income as a painter for the past five years, notified Bormey that her SSI benefits were being suspended effective December 1977. The district office maintained that she was ineligible to receive those benefits because her father\u2019s income was deemable to her since she was under 21 and a student.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-16\">Bormey, who was represented by counsel and continued to be throughout all the subsequent administrative proceedings, requested a hearing before an administrative law judge (\u201cAU\u201d). On August 19, 1978, the ALJ ordered reinstatement of her benefits. He found that Bormey was an adult, and was not a regular student, and that, as such, her father\u2019s income was not deemable to her.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No party has challenged this determination. The ALJ remanded the case to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>the district office for recalculation of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">On October 2, 1978, the district office, following the August 1978 remand by the ALJ, determined that because Bormey was not contributing any money toward the household expenses, she was living in the household of her parents and receiving support and maintenance from them, and that accordingly the SSI benefits payable to her commencing in December 1977 must be reduced by one third pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382a(a)(2)(A) and the then implementing regulation, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1125 (now sections 416.1130-416.1145).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Bormey had been paid no SSI benefits during the period December 1977 through September 1978. In October 1978, she was paid in a lump sum ($1,208.58) benefits, reduced by one third on account of the support and maintenance she had received, for that period, and monthly payments to her were resumed at the rate of $126.27, also reflecting the one-third reduction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">On January 22, 1979, Bormey requested another hearing before an ALJ. At this hearing, which was held on May 7, 1979, both Bormey and her father testified that before her benefits were terminated, she contributed $100 a month toward the household expenses; that she lived in her parents\u2019 house with her mother and father and two sisters; that during the time her benefits were terminated, she had no income and was therefore unable to make any contributions; that after her benefits were resumed in October 1978, she again contributed $100 a month to the household expenses; that monthly household expenses totaled $697.10, of which $400 was for food and the balance for mortgage payments and utilities; that her pro rata share of the total household expenses was $139 per month; and that were she to receive full benefits, she would pay her pro rata share of all the household expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">The ALJ held that the one-third statutory reduction in Bormey\u2019s benefits was proper, and his decision was affirmed by the Administration\u2019s Appeals Council, thus becoming a final decision of the appellee, the Secretary of Health, Education, and- Welfare (now the Secretary of Health and Human Resources), who administers the SSI program.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">Having exhausted her administrative remedies, Bormey filed suit against the appellee in federal district court under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) seeking judicial review of the adverse decision. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The district court referred the matter to a magistrate, who conducted a hearing and recommended that appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment be granted. The district court accepted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation and rendered summary judgment for appellee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-15\">Our review is ordinarily limited to determining whether the record as a whole contains substantial evidence to support the appellee\u2019s findings. <em>Thomas v. Schweiker, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>666 F.2d 999, 1001 (5th Cir.1982). However, we must also determine whether appellee applied the proper legal standard in reducing Bormey\u2019s SSI benefits, and whether the proceedings below were conducted in conformity with the applicable statutes and regulations. <em>See Strickland v. Harris, </em>615 F.2d 1103, 1108 (5th Cir.1980); <em>Ferran v. Fleming, </em>293 F.2d 568, 571 (5th Cir.1961); <em>Chamberlain v. Schweiker, </em>518 F.Supp. 1336, 1338 (C.D.Ill.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">The first question raised by Bormey is whether, upon becoming an adult, she had a right to the standard (or full) SSI payment without regard to any support or maintenance she had received, or was receiving, from her parents before or at the time she became an adult. Bormey, in effect, argues that unearned income received by a recipient while he or she is a child cannot be used to reduce SSI benefits once the recipient becomes an adult, even though after becoming an adult that income is still being received. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The statutes which govern the SSI program plainly show it was Congress\u2019s intent that SSI benefits be paid only to the extent an individual\u2019s minimum income level is not being met from other sources. <em>See </em>H.R. Rep. No. 92-231, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1972] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 4989, 5135-36. <em>See also Weiss v. Schweiker, </em>519 F.Supp. 763, 765 (S.D.N.Y. 1981). Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381a,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a disabled individual\u2019s eligibility for SSI benefits is determined \u201con the basis of his income and resources.\u201d Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382a,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> income is defined as including both earned and unearned income, and unearned income includes \u201csupport and maintenance furnished in kind\u201d to the individual. If the individual lives in the household of another and receives both maintenance and support from that person, then the amount payable to the individual is reduced by one third. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382a(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-13\">It has long been recognized that in questions of statutory interpretation, the construction of a statute by an agency charged with its administration is entitled to some deference. <em>Dennard </em>v. <em>Richards Group, Inc., </em>681 F.2d 306, 315 (5th Cir.1982). The appellee has interpreted these statutes to require that an individual\u2019s income be an important factor in determining his or her initial or continuing eligibility for SSI benefits and the amount thereof. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.202 and 416.203.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Eligibility for SSI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>benefits and the amount payable is therefore based on the actual need of the individual whether at the time he or she makes an initial application for benefits or whether he or she already receives them. It follows that the actual needs of a recipient will be considered even when he or she becomes an adult. Thus, the income received by a child, which he or she still receives after becoming an adult, will be considered in determining eligibility for, and the amount of, SSI benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The \u201cbenefit anomalies\u201d described by Bormey in her brief which may occur as a result of this construction flow from the differences in the level of generosity of the applicant\u2019s or recipient\u2019s relatives or friends, and the statute was fashioned to recognize those generosity differences in determining initial and continuing eligibility for, and the amount of, SSI benefits. See <em>Usher </em>v. <em>Schweiker, </em>666 F.2d 652, 659 (1st Cir.1981). We hold that the unearned income being received by a recipient at the time he or she becomes an adult must be considered by the Social Security Administration in determining eligibility for, and the amount of, SSI benefits at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-18\">The next question raised by Bormey is whether the unearned income, in the form of support and maintenance, received by her from her parents triggered the statutory one-third reduction in her SSI benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-19\">Before October 3,1980, the application of the statutory one-third reduction was governed by 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1125, which was originally adopted on January 29, 1974. 39 Fed.Reg. 3674 (1974).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This regulation was, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>however, amended on July 7,1978, and sub-part K of the amended regulation provided that its provisions would be effective with January 1974, unless specifically indicated to the contrary. Effective October 3, 1980, the regulation was revised and reorganized. 45 Fed.Reg. 65541 (1980). The substantive provisions, however, remain essentially the same as the 1978 version and now appear as sections 416.1130-416.1145.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Section 416.1125, as amended in 1978, was in effect when Bormey\u2019s case was heard by the ALJ in May 1979.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The ALJ, however, applied the original (1974) version, and held that the statutory one-third reduction was applicable. This holding was based on the ALJ\u2019s finding that Bormey\u2019s contribution was less than her pro rata share of the household expenses, and on his conclusion that she was therefore living in the household of her parents and receiving support and maintenance from them. The magistrate who considered the motions for summary judgment on October 15,1980, applied the amended (1978) version of section 416.-1125, but he also determined that Bormey\u2019s benefits should be reduced by the statutory one-third reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">Applying the amended regulation to the facts found by the ALJ, we hold that although there is substantial evidence to uphold his factual findings, both the ALJ and the magistrate erred in their legal conclusion that the SSI benefits payable to Bormey were subject to the statutory one-third reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">Under section 416.1125(b)(1)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> as amended in 1978, the standard payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>amount for an eligible individual who (1) lives in another person\u2019s household and (2) receives <em>both </em>support and maintenance in kind from such person, is to be reduced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>one third, in lieu of determining the actual dollar value of such support and maintenance as unearned income to the eligible individual. This one-third reduction is statutory, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382a(a)(2)(A),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and when applicable, is irrebuttable regardless of any payment the individual may make toward his or her support and maintenance. Section 416.1125(b)(1). See <em>also </em>43 Fed. Reg. 29277, 29278-29279 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The first question is whether Bormey lived in the household of another. An eligible individual is presumed to be living in another person\u2019s household whenever the household has at least one other member who is not the eligible individual\u2019s spouse, minor child, or a person whose income is deemable to the individual, section 416.-1125(b)(2), <em>unless </em>the eligible individual has an ownership interest in the home, is liable to the landlord for payment of any portion of the rental charges, is living in a substitute home in the form of a noninstitutional care situation, or is paying at least a pro rata share of the average monthly total household operating expenses. Section 416.1125(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">The evidence shows that Bormey lived with her parents and two sisters; that none of their income was deemable to her; and that she failed to satisfy any of the exceptions of section 416.1125(b)(3). We therefore hold that the ALJ and the magistrate correctly determined that Bormey was living in the household of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">The second question is whether Bormey received <em>both </em>support and maintenance from her parents. Under section 416.-1125(a),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> support and maintenance in kind is defined as encompassing food, clothing, and shelter. When an eligible individual lives in another person\u2019s household he or she is presumed to be receiving in-kind support and maintenance in the form of both food and shelter from that person, and the one-third reduction applies unless the presumption is rebutted. Section 416.1125(b)(4). The applicability of the one-third reduction may be rebutted by showing, among other things, that an eligible individual does not receive <em>both </em>food and shelter from the person in whose household he or she lives. Section 416.1125(b)(6)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">Bormey proved that before her SSI benefits were erroneously suspended in De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>cember 1977, and after they were resumed in October 1978, she contributed $100 a month toward the payment of the household expenses. The evidence shows that as of May 1979 the pro rata monthly cost of Bormey\u2019s food was $80 and that of her shelter was $59. The evidence does not indicate whether Bormey\u2019s $100 payment was earmarked for food or for shelter. This $100 amount, however, was sufficient to cover the entire cost of one item and part of the other. The reasoning of the appellee, the AU, and the magistrate presumes that the $100 payment covered only part of each. We reject this presumption. Where a payment is capable of covering the entira\u00bb cost of each item (whether food or shelter) considered separately, as well as part of the other, we presume that it was intended as such, in the absence of any indication to the contrary. We hold that Bormey rebutted the presumption that the statutory one-third reduction applied by showing that she did not receive, without paying therefor, both food and shelter from her parents.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-16\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>\u201c(a) <em>General. </em>Unearned income includes support and maintenance furnished in cash or in kind unless otherwise excluded under this subpart K. Support and maintenance in kind encompasses food, clothing, and shelter or any portion of any or all of such items. Unless otherwise specified herein, the value of in-kind support and maintenance refers to its current market value. For purposes of this subpart K, the term standard payment amount refers to the Federal payment rate as described in \u00a7\u00a7 416.410-416.413.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>When an eligible individual lives in a household of another and receives from that person only food or shelter in kind, such support or maintenance is unearned income. Section 416.1125(d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In such case, effective with payments for December 1974, the maximum value of such support or maintenance is presumed to be one third of the applicable payment standard. The individual may rebut this presumption by establishing that the current market value of such support or maintenance, less any payment he or she makes therefor, is lower than the presumed value. Section 416.-1125(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">Because the ALJ and the magistrate erred in determining that the statutory one-third reduction applied, no determination was made as to whether, and if so to what extent, the then current market value of Bormey\u2019s food or shelter, less any payment made therefor, was lower than the presumed value. The case must therefore be remanded to the appellee for further proceedings to determine the proper amount of benefits due Bormey since October 1978, when she recommenced making her payments to her father.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>As to the period from December 1977 through September 1978, when Bormey was unable to make any payments to her parents because of the erroneous suspension of her benefits, she claims that appellee is estopped to apply the statutory one-third reduction. Bormey argues that if she had been paid her benefits during this time she would have used them to continue her $100-a-month payments to her parents for her food or shelter.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">There is some surface appeal to Bormey\u2019s argument, but we must reject it. At tfie May 1979 hearing Bormey, through her attorney, made it quite clear that she had not paid any of the lump-sum payment she received in October 1978 to her parents, and that she considered herself under no obligation to do so. Her position was that while her benefits were suspended she did not, expressly or impliedly, agree to reimburse her parents, either absolutely or conditionally on her receipt of benefits, for any of the food or shelter they furnished her during this period. Nor, according to her, did any such obligation arise as a matter of law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Her estoppel argument is based on the premise that if she had timely received the benefit checks she would have used them to pay for her support or maintenance. But what she seeks to achieve by estoppel is to force the government to now put her in a better position than she would have been in if matters had proceeded as she says they should and would have but for the erroneous suspension of her benefits. Even if she had received full benefits ($1,611.52) throughout this ten-month suspension period, and had accordingly continued io pay $100 a month ($1,000) to her parents for support or maintenance, she would have been left with only $611.52,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> as opposed to the $1,208.58 she eventually received in a lump sum and asserts she is entitled to fully retain. Bormey has not suffered any ultimate financial prejudice by reason of the erroneous suspension of her benefits.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Moreover, there is no assertion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>nor any indication in the record, that the suspension of benefits was for any invidious reason or consideration, or was anything other than a bona fide, and quite understandable, factual error. In these circumstances, we do not believe that the considerations of \u201cjustice and fair play,\u201d <em>United States v. Lazy F C Ranch, </em>481 F.2d 985, 988 (9th Cir.1973), weigh so heavily as to authorize an estoppel against the government. <em>See Schweiker v. Hansen, </em>450 U.S. 785, 101 S.Ct. 1468, 67 L.Ed.2d 685 (1981); <em>Augusta Aviation, Inc. v. United States, </em>671 F.2d 445, 448-50 (11th Cir.1982). Accordingly, we uphold the statutory one-third reduction of benefits applicable to the period December 1977 through September 1978, during which Bormey\u2019s parents, in whose house she lived, furnished her support and maintenance without any reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">We reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case to that court with directions to further remand the case to appellee for a redetermination of Bormey\u2019s benefits for October 1978 and subsequent months in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-12\">. Under the regulations, \u201ca child under age 21\u201d living with one or both parents may have \u201cdeemed\u201d to the child the income of a parent who is ineligible for SSI benefits. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1165 (1982). Under section 416.-1101 (1982) a \u201cchild\u201d is defined as an unmarried person, not the head of a household, who either is \u201cunder age 18 or is under age 22 and a student.\u201d So far as is here relevant, these same regulatory provisions were applicable to Bormey at all pertinent times. Since Bormey was unmarried, was not the head of a household, was living with her parents, and was over 18 and under 21, her status as a \u201cchild\u201d whose father\u2019s income could be \u201cdeemed\u201d to her depended on whether she was \u201ca student.\u201d She attended school, but did so irregularly. The ALJ determined that her school attendance was not sufficiently regular so as to constitute her a \u201cstudent\u201d; since she was over 18 and not a \u201cstudent,\" she was not \u201ca child\u201d; since she was not a \u201cchild\u201d her parents\u2019 income could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>not be \u201cdeemed\u201d to her, and denial of her benefits on the basis of such \u201cdeeming\u201d was accordingly held to be erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b255-9\">. Although it is undisputed that Bormey received full SSI benefits from July 1974 to November 1977, there is no direct evidence of the dollar amount of those payments as actually made to Bormey. However, it is indicated that full benefits were to be at the following monthly rates: from 7/1/74 to 6/30/75, $146.00; from 7/1/75 to 6/30/77, $157.70; from 7/1/77 to 6/30/78, $177.80; from 7/1/78, $189.40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b255-10\">.

If the individual pays <em>either </em>for his or her food <em>or </em>for his or her shelter, one might logically assume that a rebuttable one-sixth (or other fraction smaller than one third) reduction in benefits would be in order. The appellee, however, presumes a full one-third reduction even though one item of support and maintenance is being paid by the individual. Unlike the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>one-third reduction, there appears to be no statutory basis for this regulatory presumptive one-third reduction. On remand, we invite the appellee and Bormey to consider the validity of the presumptive one-third reduction of section 416.1125(d). Our doubts are apparently not shared by the Ninth Circuit, although it may not have directly addressed the above-indicated concerns. <em>Young v. Schweiker, </em>680 F.2d 680, 682 (9th Cir.1982).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b262-6\">. At the May 1979 hearing, Bormey\u2019s attorney stated to the ALJ:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">\u201cI think for the period in which the payments were suspended, I think the full benefit will be, got to be paid because the Administration is estopped from raising the issue that she was not contributing to household expenses, because the Administration with its action was claiming that position. But we don\u2019t raise in connection with that point any specific issues that claimant is going to repay Mr. Bormey [her father]. What we\u2019re trying to say is, from now on, if she gets full benefits, if she gets full benefit, she will contribute, she will contribute to the household expenses for instance starting from this point right now, not to the past. I think in the past we cannot go back and see was any obligation between the father and the claimant to pay or not to pay. They supported, at that time, without any obligation and nobody is asking for that money, I mean we\u2019re not asking for that money for claimant to repay Mr. Bormey. I think she\u2019s entitled to that during the period in which the payments] were suspended, she\u2019s entitled to the full benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">This position was never modified or retracted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b262-11\">. Indeed, to have been entitled to full benefits, without <em>any </em>reduction for the value of any unreimbursed food or shelter, she would have had to pay more than $100 a month, as the foregoing portions of this opinion reflect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b262-12\">. Nor have her parents been shown to have suffered legal prejudice as a result of such suspension. There was no claim or showing that they were legally obligated to support Bormey. Even if they were, the increased benefits Bormey seeks, she seeks for herself, not for them. <em>See </em>note 14, <em>supra. </em>Moreover, the administrative record reflects that Bormey successfully sought to have herself determined not a \u201cchild\u201d in order to avoid having her father\u2019s income \u201cdeemed\u201d to her, thus rendering her ineligible for any benefits. By its erroneous suspension of benefits, the government may have \u201cimposed\u201d upon the generosity of Bormey\u2019s parents, but a certain amount of such \u201cimposition\u201d is in any event inherent in the statutory scheme of reducing benefits for support and maintenance donated by others. The remedy for this instance of erroneous \u201cimposition\u201d on her parents is surely not to grant Bormey a greater net financial recovery than she could have possibly obtained had the error she complains of not occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
