G. L. &amp; C. Co., filed a petition in error, in the District Court, to reverse a judgment recovered by him against the company, in the Common Pleas, and when the case in error was called, moved to dismiss its petition. This being objected to by Duffy, the motion was overruled, and the judgment of the Common Pleas affirmed. And it is now insisted that in refusing to dismiss the petition, and in hearing the cause, the court erred.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b214-9\"><em>Estep </em>$ <em>Burke, </em>for the motion, cited Code, sec. 372, S. &amp; C. 1049,1050.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b214-11\"><em>Heisleys $ Green, </em>contra :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-12\">Section 372 of the code refers to ordinary actions only, and has no reference to proceedings in error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-13\">If a plaintiff' in error cau thus dismiss, he can evade the penalty of his undertaking in error, after it has operated as a <em>supersedeas, </em>the condition of such undertaking being merely payment by him if the judgment\u2019 sought to be reversed be <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-14\">The act of April 5, 1856 (S. <em>&amp; </em>C. 1170), first gave a plaintiff in error the right to dismiss his proceeding, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>this was taken away by the act of April 3, 1862. S. &amp; S. 601. If the last-named act be construed as merely taking away the right to dismiss in vacation, there is no reason for limiting the exercise of the right to term time, unless it be in order that the court may exercise its discretion in the matter. As to this power of the court, see 1 Troubat &amp; Haly\u2019s Practice, 450; <em>Pourr </em>v. <em>Frick, </em>2 Grant\u2019s Cases; <em>Conner </em>v. <em>Drake, </em>15 Ohio, 170; <em>Squiers </em>v. <em>Burgess, </em>31 Vt. 466; 18 How. (U. S.) 241; 2 Daniel\u2019s Pr. 1644; 11 Pet. 55.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b214-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"A2q\">We see no error in this. It is in the discretion of the court, whether it will dismiss a petition in error without the consent of both parties. Were it otherwise, great injustice might be done to the defendant, by delaying the enforcement of his judgment, and escaping the penalty imposed by the law for vexatious delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">\n<em>Motion overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>If a plaintiff in error has this right, he can harass the defendant in error by repeated proceedings, dismissing each when called for hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
