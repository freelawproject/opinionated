The condition thereof was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-6\">\u201c That whereas, the above-bound George Gearhart has been duly appointed, by the Court of Common Pleas, administrator of the <em>personal </em>estate of George Thresher, late, etc. Now, if the said George Gearhart shall well and truly do and perform all and every of the duties required of him, as administrator <em>as aforesaid, </em>according to law,, then,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-7\">It is alleged in the petition that Gearhart, on the 29th day of July, 1863, settled with the Probate Court, which found in his hands $648.23, which the court ordered him. to pay over according to law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-8\">The petition states that Mary Frink is the widow of George Thresher, deceased; and that, \u201cbeing the widow of the said intestate, George Thresher, she is entitled, as-such, to receive from the said administrator, George Gear-hart, the one-half part of the first four hundred dollars, and the one-third part of said.sum of $648.23 \u2014 in all, the sum of $349.41 \u2014 with interest from April 1, 1863.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-9\">A demand of this sum is averred, and that payment was refused. The defendants, Griswold and Baker, demurred to the petition. The demurrer was overruled. Then Griswold and Baker filed an answer in the action, which shows the-following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-10\">That the <em>personal </em>estate of the decedent, George Thresher,, amounted to $231.85; that the debts and charges of administration amounted to $491.90; that the <em>real </em>estate of the decedent was sold for $908.28; of the proceeds of the-sale, there was needed for the payment of debts <em>only </em>$260.05;. that the <em>surplus </em>of said proceeds, therefore, amounted to-$648.23.

Jur. 581; Williams on Ex\u2019rs, 1408; <em>Quinby v. Walker et al., </em>14 Ohio St. 193; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Loveland, </em>11 Ohio St. 214; <em>Arbuckle </em>v. <em>Tracy, </em>15 Ohio, 432; 20 B. Mon. 95; 4 J. J. Marsh. 49; 7 Dana, 1. When more land is sold than is necessary for the payment of debts, such excess is not \u201csold for the payment of debtsbut it is sold <em>to save such excess from, injury and loss, </em>and for the benefit, not .of the personal representatives, or distributees, or creditors, but of .the <em>heirs.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-9\">Such excess remains \u201c real estate.\u201d As to it, the administrator acts, not as administrator, but as trustee \u2014 just as a master in chancery, or receiver. Eor the due performance of his duties as such trustee of the excess, he must give bond. Administrator\u2019s Act, sec.' 131. Such bond is entirely distinct from the administration bond.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-10\">We contend that the bond sued on is not for the performance by Gearhart of <em>all </em>his duties as administrator of George Thresher. It was the duty of Gearhart, as administrator, to do <em>two </em>things; 1. To administer the <em>personal estate, </em>by converting the same into money and applying it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>the payment of debts. 2. To administer so much of the real estate as was necessary for the payment of debts, by converting the same into money and applying it to the payment of debts. These duties are separate and distinct, just as the personal estate and the real estate are separate and distinct things. As stated in section 117 of the administrator\u2019s act, the real estate can not be sold until it is ascertained that the <em>\u201cpersonal estate\u201d </em>is insufficient to pay the debts. In a number of other instances, the statute recognizes the difference between the \u201c personal estate \u201d and the real assets, and the duties of.-the administrator in regal\u2019d thereto. See secs. 70, 72, 117, 121, 162, 165, 170, 196.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-5\">The condition of this bond is: \u201c That whereas . . Gearhart has been duly appointed . . . administrator of the <em>personal </em>estate of George Thresher. . . . Now, if said Gearhart shall . . do and perform all and every of the duties required of him as administrator <em>as aforesaid\u201d </em>(that is, as administrator of the <em>personal </em>estate of George Thresher), then, etc. The bond is not for the performance \u25a0of his duties as administrator of the estate of Thresher, \u25a0but of the <em>personal </em>estate of Thresher. This is the letter of the bond, and the liability of sureties can not be extended \u25a0beyond the <em>strict letter </em>thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-9\">How, then, can these sureties be liable when they have \u25a0expressly limited their liability to the personal estate ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-10\">We think the case of <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Medary, </em>17 Ohio, 554, is much in point. \u201c The sureties, in a bond limited in its recitals, and conditioned to the faithful performance by the principal of his duties as a member of the board of public works, can not be made liable for his defalcation in not \u00a1accounting for money received as an acting commissioner.\u201d We request the court to read the opinion of Read, J.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-11\">This decision has been followed in all subsequent cases in this state. We ask the court to examine them:</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-12\"><em>McGovney </em>v. <em>The State, </em>20 Ohio, 93: \u201cThe undertaking of a surety can not be extended beyond the terms of the contract into which he entered.

Findley can not, by parol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>evidence, be made applicable to the estate of <em>Joseph </em>S. Bindley.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-5\"><em>The State </em>v. Cutting, 2 Ohio St. 2: \u201c Sureties are never . to be visited with penalties; and their liability is never to be extended beyond the strict letter of the obligation into which they have entered.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-6\"><em>Myers and Ingersoll </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>6 Ohio St. 501: As against the surety, the condition of a bond can not be at all varied from, or extended beyond, its plain terms.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-7\"><em>Hall </em>v. <em>Williamson, Adm\u2019r, </em>9 Ohio St. 17: A surety is only liable according to the express terms of his bond.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-8\">II. Even if the sureties on the administration bond are liable for the surplus money arising from the sale of the real estate, they are not liable to Mary Brink for any part thereof. The <em>heirs </em>of George Thresher can alone recover such surplus.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-9\">Considering <em>this surplus </em>as <em>real </em>estate, how must it be disposed of by the administrator ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-10\">The act of March 7, 1835 (Swan\u2019s Stat. of 1841, p. 286), and the act of Bebruary 24, 1831 (Id. 287), prescribe the mode of its distribution. Under the provisions of these acts, the widow in this case was not entitled to any part of this surplus, considering it as real estate. Her petition shows that she was entitled to claim only as widow \u2014 that there had <em>not </em>been an entire failure of kin of the intestate, in which event she would have been entitled to claim the surplus. Under the acts above cited, she could claim only one-third of the <em>personal </em>estate, unless there was an entire failure of kin of the decedent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-11\">The widow\u2019s dower was assigned to her by metes and bounds, or specially as of one-third of the rents and profits, or else she is still entitled to dower in the real estate sold. See Dower Act, 1 S. &amp; C. 517, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-12\">The act authorizing a widow\u2019s dower to be set off to her <em>in solido </em>was not passed until April 8,1857. 1 S. &amp; C. 622. But, if the widow\u2019s dower <em>could have been </em>assigned to her <em>in solido </em>in the proceedings for the sale of the real-estate, under the law in force at that time, it was either so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>set off to and received by her, or she made no demand to have it thus set off; and, therefore, her dower must have been assigned to her by metes and bounds, or specially as one-third of the rents and profits, or she still is entitled to have it so set off. If it had been assigned to her <em>in solido, </em>the Probate Court would have been required to determine the just value in money of her dower interest in the land, and, upon failure to pay the same, the measure of her recovery would have been that amount, not one-half of the first $400 of the surplus and one-third of the residue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-5\">III. The Common Pleas erred in overruling the demurrer of Griswold and Baker to the petition of the plaintiffs, for two additional reasons:</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-6\">1. Because the allegations therein show no <em>joint </em>cause of action in favor of the plaintiffs. The case of <em>Bartges </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neils, </em>13 Ohio St. 72, is an authority decisive of this point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-7\">2. Because the petition does not allege that the plaintiffs obtained leave of the court to sue on the bond. Distributees can sue without such leave only to recover their share of the <em>personal </em>estate. 1 S. &amp; C. 602, secs. 178, 179.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-8\"><em>F. C. Smith, </em>for defendants in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-9\">It is alleged that the default of the administrator arose from his neglect to account for and pay over the surplus of the proceeds of the sale of the real estate sold to pay the debts of the intestate, Thresher.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-10\">The securities on the bond, the plaintiffs in error, claim that Gearhart was administrator of the personal estate only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-11\">This bond was given under the administration law of 1841, and is governed by its provisions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-12\">That law (S. &amp; C. 569, sec. 13) provides that, \u201c Every administrator shall, before entering on the duties of his trust, give bond, . . . conditioned ... to administer according to law all the moneys, goods, chattels, rights, and credits of the deceased, and the proceeds of all his real estate that may be sold for the payment of his debts which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>shall at anytime come to the possession of the administrator,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-5\">The bond on which this suit was brought is conditioned, if the said Gearhart shall well and truly do and perform all and every of the duties required of him as administrator, as aforesaid, <em>according to </em>law, that it shall be void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-6\">This is a good bond. \u201c Where the conditions of a bond are cumulative, the omission of one can not invalidate the bond so far as the other operates to bind the party.\u201d <em>Farrar </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>5 Pet. 373.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-7\">The statute of 1831, relating to county treasurers (Swan\u2019s Stat. of 1841, p. 971), provides that the county treasurer shall give bond, etc., \u201cconditioned for the faithful discharge of his duties as treasurer.\u201d It was held that a bond given under that statute, conditioned that the treasurer shall faithfully and impartially discharge all the duties of his office, was a good statutory bond. <em>State of Ohio </em>v. <em>Findlay, </em>10 Ohio, 51; <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Goodyear, </em>1 Ohio, 170; <em>Bentley </em>v. <em>Dorcas et al., </em>11 Ohio St. 398; <em>Propeller Agents </em>v. <em>Wick &amp; Morgan, </em>12 Ohio St. 335; <em>Creighton </em>v. <em>Harden, </em>10 Ohio St. 579.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-8\">It is claimed in the argument that the bond recites that Gearhart was the administrator of the personal estate of Thresher only. There is no such <em>thing known to the law </em>as an administrator of personal estate only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-9\">Section 1 of the administration law of 1840 provides (S. &amp; O. 567), \u201c That upon the decease of any inhabitant of this state, letters testamentary, or letters of administration, on his <em>estate </em>shall be granted,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-10\">The term \u201c estate \u201d includes all of the decedent\u2019s <em>assets, </em>real as well as personal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-11\">But counsel for the plaintiffs in error claim that real estate is not assets, and cite some authorities to sustain this proposition. Among them, he cites section 531 of Story\u2019s Eq. Jur., as follows: \u201c In an accurate and legal sense, all the personal property of the deceased, which is of a salable nature and may be converted into ready money, is deemed assets.\u201d But the residue of the same section reads as fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>lows: \u201cBut the word (assets) is not confined to such property, for all other property of the deceased, which is chargeable with his debts or legacies, and is applicable to that purpose, is in a large sense assets.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-4\">Judge Swan, in his Manual for Executors and Administrators, page 47, lays down the same rule, citing Touchstone^ 496; Williams on Ex\u2019rs, 1012.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-5\">But this is no longer an open question in Ohio.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-6\">' The Supreme Court of Ohio, in the case of <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Graham et al., </em>4 Ohio, 126, say: \u201c The administrator is held liable on his bond . . for money arising from the sale of real-estate, as for the proceeds of the personal property. The proceeds of the former are to all intents and purposes <em>assets </em>as well as the latter. They are both appropriated in the same manner, and when land is turned into money, it is instantaneously <em>assets, </em>according to the legal acceptation of the term.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-8\">All the cases cited by counsel for plaintiffs in eiror, to show that this fund is not assets, are cases where the property in controversy was in no sense liable for the debts of the deceased, and do not come within the definition of assets as laid down by Judges Story and Swan as cited above.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-9\">The duties of the administrator are pointed out by the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-10\">The court of probate in making the appointment confer no authority whatever. The administrator\u2019s authority to act is given by and clearly defined in the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-11\">The recital in the bond that he has been appointed administrator of the <em>personal </em>estate, etc., should be rejected as surplusage. 1 Chit. PI. 229.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-12\">The administration law (sec. 117, S. &amp; C.) makes it the duty of the executor or administrator, as soon as he shall ascertain that the personal estate in his hauds will be insufficient to pay all the debts of the deceased, . . to apply to the Probate Court for authority to sell the rea estate of the deceased.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-13\">Section 162 (S. &amp; C. 598) of the same act provides that every executor or administrator shall be chargeable . . \u00ab <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>with all the proceeds of real estate sold for the payment of debts or legacies, etc. And sections 176, 177, and 178 (S. &amp; C. 602) provide for the bringing suits on the bond of the administrator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-5\">It is claimed, however, by the plaintiffs in error, that the plaintiff, Mary Erink, being the widow, she can not take as heir. It nowhere appears in this record that there were any other heirs than the widow, the plaintiff herein. And this court will not presume error for the sake of reversing the case. <em>Coil </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>18 Ohio, 28.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-6\">Code, section 28, provides that where a married woman is a party, her husband must be joined with her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-7\">Counsel for plaintiffs in error rely on section 131 of the administration act (S. &amp; C. 591), which provides that the executor or administrator shall, when he is ordered to sell more land than is necessary to pay the debts of the estate, give bond, etc. But this section must, for a proper understanding and construction of the law, be taken in connection with sections 130 and 132. Section 130 shows when and in what eases such additional bond must be given. That is, when it is represented to the court in the petition that it is necessary to sell some part of the real estate of the deceased, and such partial sale <em>will injure the value of the residue, </em>. . <em>then </em>the court may order the sale of the whole of the estate; and in such cases, and in such cases only, by section 131, a new bond is required. Even if the court neglected its duty in not requiring a bond, the plaintiffs should not be compelled to suffer for the neglect or fault of the court. <em>Comm\u2019r of Insolvents </em>v. <em>Way et al., 3 </em>Ohio, 103.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-8\">The doctrine that the securities are held only to the letter of the bond is fully admitted, but it is claimed that it has no application to the case at bar, as the bond in this case is a good common law bond</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-9\">There is no case where a bond fairly and regularly executed, and comprising substantially all the requisites of the statute, has been adjudged void, because it departed in some one or more particulars from the exact words of the statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>authorizing it to be taken. <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Woodyear, </em>1 Ohio, 170; <em>Collier </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>7 Ohio, pt. 1, pp. 235, 239.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-5\">This whole question, however, has been decided in the case of <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>4 Ohio, 126, where it is expressly held, \u201c That the securities of an administrator are liable for the proceeds of real estate sold by an administrator under an order of court for the payment of debts.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-6\">To be sure the court hold, in the case of <em>Baylies, J, etc. </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>1 Pick. 230, cited by counsel for plaintiff, that an administrator is not liable for refusing to pay debts of his intestate with the proceeds of real estate sold under a license for that purpose, upon a bond conditioned that after the payment of the debts he will secure the surplus on interest. But the court hold in that case <em>that he is liable on his administration bond. </em>See ease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-7\">The suit in that case was on a bond such as counsel for plaintiffs in error claim should have been given in this case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b96-8\">Day, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A52\">The questions to be considered in this ease are raised by demurrer to the answer. The action was brought to recover for the breach of an administrator\u2019s bond, in not paying over to the plaintiff\u2019 below the amount she claimed to be her distributive share of the estate of the intestate, remaining in the administrator\u2019s hands after the final settlement of his account.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">The plaintiff below averred, in her petition, that she was the widow of the intestate, and as such was one of the distributees of the estate, and entitled to recover one-half of four hundred dollars and one-third of the balance of the amount remaining in the administrator\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">The defendants below averred, in their answer to the petition, that the personal property of the intestate was insufficient to pay the debts due from his estate; that after paying out all the personal assets, the administrator sold, by order of the court, real estate left by the deceased, for the purpose of paying the remaining debts of the decedent\u2019s estate, and that there remained in his hands, after the final settlement of his account, of the proceeds of the sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>of the real estate, the sum of $648.23, which was ordered by the Probate Court to be distributed according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">Was this answer a sufficient defense to the claim made in the petition ? To answer this question, we must ascertain who arc entitled, \u201caccording to law,\u201d to the surplus of the proceeds of the sale of the real estate remaining in the hands of the administrator on the final settlement of his account.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Section 155 of the \u201c act to provide for the settlement of estates of deceased persons,\u201d provides that \u201cin all cases of sale by an executor or administrator .... of real estate of the deceased, under an order of court, . . . the surplus of the proceeds of the sale, remaining on the final settlement of the account, shall be considered as real estate, and shall be disposed of accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">From the facts stated in the answer, admitted by the demurrer to be true, it is clear that the money, claimed in the petition, is required by the statute to be \u201c considered as real estate,\u201d and is to be \u201c disposed of accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Regarding this surplus fund in the hands of the administrator as real estate, was the plaintiff below entitled to recover upon the ease made in the pleadings ? If not, the judgment rendered in her favor was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">Her right to recover is based solely on the ground that she was the widow of the deceased. The statutes in force at the time of his decease (1851) gave her no right to this surplus, considered as real estate, unless there was a failure of kin of the intestate, of which there is no pretense in the petition. On the contrary, she only claims in her petition to be <em>one </em>of the distributees of the fund; and it is noticeable that she bases her claim upon the statute relating to the widow\u2019s distributive share of the <em>personal </em>estate of the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">The only interest she had in the real estate of the deceased was that of dower, and she makes no claim in her petition based on that right. For aught that appears, her dower had been assigned, or the land may have been sold subject to her dower.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>The ease made in the petition is framed entirely upon the idea that th'e surplus, arising from the sale of real estate, is a part of the <em>personal </em>estate of the intestate; whereas, the statute declares that it \u201cshall be considered as <em>real estate, </em>and shall be disposed of accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The petition, in the light of the facts stated in the answer, fails to show that the plaintiff was entitled, in any capacity, to any portion of the surplus of the proceeds of the real estate in the hands of the administrator; therefore, no breach of the bond is shown in not paying to the plaintiff a part of the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">It follows that the Court of Common Pleas erred in sustaining the demurrer to the answer, and in rendering judgment for the plaintiff in the action. The District Coui't therefore erred in affirming the judgment of the Common Pleas. Both judgments must be reversed, the demurrer to the answer overruled, and the cause remanded to the Common Pleas for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">This disposes of the case without deciding the question, whether a refusal to pay the fund in the administrator\u2019s hands to the parties entitled to receive it, would be a breach of the bond on which the action is brought. It is not only unnecessary to consider the question in this case as it now stands, but it would be of questionable\u2019propriety, since the parties interested in sustaining the affirmative of the proposition are not before the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
