The answer alleges that the milk was diluted with water, and that, by the contract under which it was delivered, the milk was to be pure. The reply denied the adulteration of the milk. On the trial of this* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>issue, the defendant offered to prove that after the delivery of the milk the plaintiff was seen diluting other milk, which he was preparing to deliver under the same pon tract. This evidence was excluded, and it is now claimed that the court erred in its exclusion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b198-7\"><em>Lee \u00a7 Kellogg, </em>for the motion :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-8\">The evidence excluded by the court below would have proved a violation of the contract upon which the action was founded, and thereby tended to prove a similar previous violation of said contract.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b198-9\"><em>S.
