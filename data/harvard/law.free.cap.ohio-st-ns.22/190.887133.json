In 1858, Sarah, without the knowledge or consent of Reed, handed the deed to J., and he destroyed it; and thereupon J. executed a will devising one-half of the same tract to Sarah in fee, and the other half to Reed for life, remainder to Ann, auother sister, in fee, and making provision for his other children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-5\">Afterward, J. had born to him two other children \u2014 Isaac and Mary \u2014 and haviug made advancements to some of lessons, died, leaving nine children. The said will was duly admitted to probate; and thereupon Isaac and Mary prosecuted a civil action in the Court of Common Pleas, making Reed and Sarah, and all the other devisees, legatees, and heirs of J., parties defendant therein, to obtain their full and equal shares of J.\u2019s estate. In this action, the Court of Common Pleas, amongst other things, found that J. died seized in fee of the same tract which, in 1857, he had eonvayed to Reed and Sarah; that Reed held under the will a life estate in the undivided half thereof, and that Ann owned the fee of said half, subject to said life estate. And thereupon the court made a final decree for contribution based upon that finding. This decree was rendered in 18G6.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-6\">In 1869, Reed having, after said decree, died intestate, unmarried, and childless, and Sarah having had her half of- the land set off to her in a partition suit, Samuel, John, and others, brothers and sisters of Reed, began a civil action in the Common Pleas against Ann, claiming that Reed had, by virtue of the deed of 1857, died seized in fee of the one-half of said land, and asking for its partition between themselves and his other heirs at law. Besides other defenses, Ann, by a separate answer, pleaded the aforesaid decree of 1866 as an estoppel, averring that Reed was a party to that action, and that the judgment remained in full force and unreversed. To this answer the plaintiffs demurred, and the District Court (the cause pending there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>upon appeal) overruled their demurrer and dismissed their petition. They now ask leave to file a petition in error to-reverse said judgment</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-5\"><em>John F.

If so, then the Probate Court had the jurisdiction of the matter. The legislature could not by law confer a jurisdiction on the Common-Pleas that, by the constitution, was conferred upon another tribunal.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-8\"><em>William C. Okey, </em>on the same side :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-9\">It was not necessary for the court in the action for contribution to determine of what land John McGarry died\u2019 seized; the question in that case was only what did each devisee or legatee take under the will. Hence the decree-in that case does not estop the plaintiffs from setting up their title to the land in controversy. <em>Lents </em>v. <em>Wallace, 17 </em>Penn. 412; <em>Lessee of Lose et al. </em>v. <em>Truman, </em>10 Ohio St. 45, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-10\">\u201c The law of estoppel can not be used but to subserve the cause of justice and right.\u201d <em>Buckingham </em>v. <em>Hanna, 2 </em>Ohio St. 551.

S. Spriggs </em>and <em>J. S. Foreman, </em>contra:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-12\">1. The action pleaded as an estoppel was not \u201c a testamentary matter,\u201d for the reason that the rights of the posthumous children, including their right to bring the suit,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>were based upon the fact: 1. <em>That no provision toas made for them in the will of their father; </em>and, 2. <em>That the statute gave them a right to bring an action to </em>remove, <em>as it were, the cloud which the will threw upon their title to their proper shares in the estate of their father. </em>These posthumous heirs took nothing under the will; but took by descent under a statutory provision, in its nature supplementary to the statutes of descent and distribution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-5\">The statute giving to the Common Pleas jurisdiction in such actions will not be held unconstitutional unless it is <em>clearly </em>so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-6\">2. In the contribution suit, the <em>first </em>duty of the court was to ascertain how much would each of the posthumous children have been entitled to if there had been no will; that could only be determined by finding what was -the value of the entire estate of the testator, and no value could be fixed until it was known of <em>xohat </em>it consisted. Therefore it was necessary for the court, in the action for contribution, to find what estate, if any, John McGarry held at his death in the land in controversy. See secs. 41, 42, Wills Act, S. &amp; C. 1623. We insist that the record of that suit is a complete bar. <em>Hites </em>v. <em>Irvine's Adm\u2019rs, </em>13 Ohio St. 283; <em>Babcock &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>John G.

Notwithstanding section 8, article 4, of the constitution of Ohio provides that the Probate Court shall have jurisdiction in probate and testamentary matters, the Court of Common Pleas of the proper county, under the existing laws, has jurisdiction of a civil action brought to determine and enforce the right to contribution given by section 41 of the wills act (S. &amp; C. 1023) to a child born after the execution of the will of its pare lit.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">2.
