The mortgagee of the undivided half of a vessel, registered and enrolled at the port of Buffalo, instituted a suit in the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga county, in this state, against the mortgagors and the subsequent mortgagees, to obtain a foreclosure of his mortgage. The personal appearance of the defendants was effected to the suit, and by the final decree it was ordered that, unless they paid the plaintiff his mortgaged debt within a time specified, the mortgaged property should be sold by a master as upon execution. <em>Held, </em>that to enable the officer to make a valid sale under an order issued in pursuance of the decree, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>was not necessary that the vessel should he present, or under his control, at the time and place of sale.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b631-5\">3. Courts of equity, in ordering a sale of property, follow the rules regulating sales on execution, when they are applicable.

This sale is alleged to be void, for the reason that the propellers were not present at the time and place of sale. But if not thus void, it is charged to be fraudulent by reason of certain collusive arrangements alleged to have been entered into by Worthington with Merchant, and one Ensign to whom Worthington subsequently sold the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-10\">The petition prays for an account, and for general-relief against Worthington.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-11\">The City Bauk, in its answer, makes substantially the same averments against Worthington, and prays for similar relief in regard to its mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-12\">As to all the allegations affecting Worthington\u2019s title acquired by the master\u2019s sale, he joined issue. On the final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>trial, in the District Court, at the September term, 1866, the' issues were found in favor of Worthington, and the suit against him was dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-5\">There was no motion for a new trial. But a bill of exceptions was taken, which, after setting forth all the evi.1 denee, contains the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-6\">\u201cAnd thereupon the testimony on both sides having closed, the plaintiffs and said defendants, the City Bank of Cleveland and Charles Marsden, asked the court to hold and decide, as matters of law, that the judicial sale so made by said Abbey, as master commissioner, under said order of said Court of Common Pleas, of the one-half of said propellers, was absolutely void by reason of the absence of said, propellers from the place of sale atthe time such sal\u00e9is claimed to have been made. And likewise to hold and decide that such sale was void by reason of the alleged arrangement1 for the resale, by said Worthington to said Ensign, of said, half of said propellers. But said court refused so to hold and decide, but, on the contrary, did hold and decide\u2014 <em>\u201cFirst. </em>That said sale, so made by said Abbey, master-commissioner as aforesaid, was a legal and valid judicial sale, notwithstanding the absence from the place of such sale at the time the same was made, of the said propellers, as;. in said pleadings alleged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-7\">\u201c <em>Second. </em>That an arrangement for the resale of said half of said propellers, by said Worthington (in case he should bid in the same) to said Ensign, upon the terms disclosed1, by said testimony, in which the court found there was no fraud, if made, did not vitiate said sale.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-8\">In regard to the sale in question, the bill of exceptions,., among other things, shows the following facts: That on March 4, 1857, Silas Merchant and Charles Marsden were the owners of one-half of the propellers Racine and Pitts-burg, and one-half of their boats, apparel, etc.; that said propellers were enrolled and licensed at the port of Buffalo, in the State of New York, and in the enrollment Charles-Ensign is made the managing owner of said propellers, and on said 4th day of March, 1857, Silas Merchant and Charles<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Marsden made and delivered to Luther Moses a mortgage-on their half of said property to secure the sum of \u00a711,500,. evidenced hy sundry promissory notes, which notes and mortgage were subsequently assigned to Worthington.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-5\">That afterward, and on August 17, 1858, said Charles; Marsden and Silas Merchant, being indebted to the plaintiffs,. Means, Clark <em>&amp; </em>Co., made and executed a second mortgage-on the same property, to secure to said plaintiffs an indebtedness in the sum of \u00a710,433.36; and on February 5, 1869,. said Marsden and Merchant made and executed a third mortgage on said property, to secure an indebtedness to the City Bank of Cleveland, in the sum of $13,880. These' mortgages were duly recorded at the port of Buffalo.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-6\">On July 30, 1859, Woi'thington\u2019s mortgage having become absolute, he filed bis petition in the Court of Common-Pleas of Cuyahoga county for its foreclosure. To this petition the mortgagors and mortgagees, and Ensign, the-owner of the other undivided half of the propellers, were-made parties and duly served with process.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-7\">The mortgagors severally answered, setting up their respective mortgages, and asking that the proceeds of the-sale of the mortgaged property might be distributed to the-parties according to their respective priorities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-8\">On June 25, 1860, the cause was heard on the report of the master to whom the cause had been referred. The final decree, after adjusting other matters, proceeds as follows:.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-9\">\u201cAnd the court further find that Merchant and Mars-den duly executed a mortgage on one-half of the propellers-Racine and Pittsburg, and upon one-half of their respective-, masts, bowsprits, sails, boats, anchors, cables, and upon one-half of their respective necessaries and appurtenances thereunto belonging, and that said mortgage was given to secure-the payment of said sum of $13,042.32, and that the same is the first lien upon said mortgaged property; the court therefore order, adjudge, and .decree, that unless the said Merchant and Marsden, or the subsequent mortgagees,.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_E8\">The court, on the trial, found the purchase of Worthington at the sale by the master commissioner to have been made in good faith, and there was evidence in the case to warrant that finding. The requisite steps not having been taken in the court below, by motion for a new trial, to authorize this court to review the finding as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>weight of evidence, our inquiries are limited to errors of law arising on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The only error of this character here relied on, consists of the supposed invalidity of the sale by the master.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">It is contended for the plaintiff in error, that the sale was void by reason of the absence of the propellers at the-time the sale was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">In support of this proposition, cases were cited to show that a sale of personal property under execution is void,, unless the property is identified and open to the inspection of bidders, so that they may form an estimate of its value-</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">It is also contended that as the vessels were not within the jurisdiction of the court, the latter had no power to-order the sale; or, if the court had such power, it did not undertake to exercise it, and that the decree only authorized the master to sell in case he could get possession of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">Construing the order of the court with reference to the\u2019 subject matter, and in the light of the pleadings, it was the-manifest understanding of both the court and the parties, that the vessels were not expected to be present at the sale-It appeared from the mortgages which it was the object of the suit to foreclose, that the vessels had been duly enrolled at the port of Buffalo,'and that they were in the possessions of Charles Ensign, the owner of the other undivided half, who had been constituted the managing owner. No provision had been made during the pendency of the suit forgetting possession of the vessels by order on the parties or otherwise, if such a thing were practicable. Nor was any such provision contained in the final decree. The master was not ordered to obtain possession before proceeding to execute the order of sale; and the issuing of the order was made contingent only upon the non-payment of the amount found due the plaintiff by the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">It is true that, by the order of sale, the master was commanded to sell the mortgaged property as upon execution\u2019 at law, and to apply the proceeds of sale to the payment of' the demands specified. But this was not intended to make-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>\u25a0the execution of the power of sale contingent upon the unere chance of his getting possession of the vessels. Full power was intended to be vested in the master to make the sale, notwithstanding the absence of the vessels; but, in executing the power, he was required, in all other respects, to conform to the law regulating the sale of similar property upon ordinary execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">In so far as the sale is supposed to be impeachable on \u25a0the ground of a want of power in the court to sell the vessels, because they were beyond the territorial jurisdiction \u25a0of the court, the objection rests on a misconception of the remedy sought, and of the nature of the jurisdiction called into exercise by the case. The plaintiff, Worthington, was mortgagee, whose mortgage had become absolute. The defendants were the subsequent mortgagees, and the mortgagors, the appearance of all of whom had been duly \u2022 effected to the suit. The jurisdiction of the court, therefore, over the parties was complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The object of the suit was to foreclose the equity of re\u00abdemption held by the defendants against the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage. This could as well be done, on their failure to redeem within the specified time, by ordering a sale through <em>,&amp; </em>master, as by compelling a release or cutting off the ^equity by absolute decree. The nature of the suit was not that of a proceeding <em>in rem, </em>but <em>in personam; </em>aud the court, ;as a court of equity, had full authority acting upon the parties, to deal and adjudicate in respect to the rights of the parties in the property, without regard to where the property itself was located, as the ends of justice might re-squire. 2 Spence\u2019s Equitable Jurisdiction, etc., 6, 7; <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>17 How. 332; <em>Portartington </em>v. <em>Soulby, </em>2 Mylne &amp; K. 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">It may also be remarked, that the subsequent mortgagees .are the only parties here seeking to impeach the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">Courts of equity, it is true, in ordering a sale of property follow the rules regulating sales by ordinary execution, \u25a0where they are applicable. But where the subject with \u25a0\u25a0.which the court is dealing, is such that these rules can not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>be applied without defeating the ends of justice, the same necessity out of which the system of equitable remedies originated, requires such rules to be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
