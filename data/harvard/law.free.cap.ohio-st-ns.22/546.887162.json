Had the commissioners authority to direct the work-in question to be done ? We think the case at bar is within the rule established in <em>State, ex rel. Cooper, </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>19 Ohio, 116, and <em>Comm\u2019rs </em>v. <em>Hutchins, 11 </em>Ohio, 368. The expenditure in question is directly warranted and required by section 1, act of March 25,1851. S. &amp; 0.1282. See also the-act of April 2, 1859, 2 S. &amp; O. 1282, and the act of March 19, 1850, S. &amp; O. 555.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-8\">Even in the absence of direct statutory authority, the-commissioners possess the power in question, as a necessary consequence of their relations to the public. The act of March 9, 1866, S. <em>&amp; </em>S. <em>86, </em>proceeds upon the hypothesis that the power exists. <em>State, ex rel. Mills, </em>v. <em>Comm\u2019rs, </em>20 Ohio St. 425; <em>Shanklin et al. </em>v. <em>Comm\u2019rs, </em>21 Ohio St. 583.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-9\">\u201c <em>Any </em>public records \u201d may be transcribed under the acts of 'April 17, 1857, and April 2, 1859. S. &amp; O. 1282. The-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>limitation of compensation to ten cents per hundred words, \u25a0applies only to that kind of transcribing in which such computation was practicable, leaving the price for copying maps and plats without limit. As the act of March 26, 1863, (S. &amp; S. 657), applies to the transcribing deeds, etc., in the recorder\u2019s office, the acts of 1857 and 1859 can not apply to that class of records.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-5\">II. Was it necessary to advertise, etc., under the act of March 9,1866? S. &amp; S. 86.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-6\">1. This act does not extend to the transcribing of records, under the act of March 25, 1851, S. &amp; C. 1282, which is to He done by the auditor or recorder.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-7\">2. This work is not within the scope and purview of the .act, no more than the employment of legal counsel for the \u2022commissioners. It is the appointment of a competent man to do skilled labor. How could such work be let to the \u2022\u201c lowest responsible bidder ? \u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-8\">3. As they could, at any moment, have dismissed the relator, the contract was by the sheet only, and the estimated \u25a0expense was not $500. There was no <em>agreement </em>to allow him to do <em>all </em>the replatting, nor more than one sheet.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-9\">4. If within the law, it is within the first proviso or exception \u2014 being the purchase of articles necessary to the .auditor\u2019s office, in the discharge of the duties of his office. .Note the recital in the resolution of the commissioners.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b557-10\"><em>C.

Unless it appears from the affidavit that the relator has a legal claim against the county, the auditor can not be \u25a0compelled to draw his warrant, by mandamus, though the commissioners have allowed it, because the relator has not shown a clear legal and equitable right.

It is based on a contract of the relator with the commissioners of the county, and the claim has been allowed by them: still, if it appears that the ground of the claim is invalid, and that the relator has no legal right to enforce payment, the writ must be refused for a mandamus can not be awarded in the absence of a clear right in the relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">The claim is based on a contract with the commissioners for \u201cthe recopying of the plats of the county\u201d for use in the auditor\u2019s office, and the validity of the contract is questioned. The board of county commissioner\u2019s can exercise only such powers as are conferred upon them by law. Ve find no statute expressly empowering them to make the contract, nor do we think the power to make it can be inferred from the acts of 1851, 1857, and 1859 (S. &amp; C. 1282), from which it is claimed in argument. These acts relate ta the transcribing of county records, for their preservation and use in the offices to which they belong; and the persons employed to do it are to be compensated at a fixed rate by the hundred words. They are not broad enough to authorize a contract for the reconstruction of a set of county plats from the records of the several county offices and surveys, which are not matters of record in the office for which-these plats are made, and which are not susceptible of being paid for by the hundred words, at the rate fixed in these statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>\"We need not determine whether the power to make the contract in question can be implied from the statutes imposing certain duties on the county auditor, for, if it exists, we are, in this case, confronted with another difficulty, in the amount of the expenditure contemplated by the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"A7Pd\">The proposal of the relator, accepted by the commissioners, constituted the contract. From that it appears that, at the rate stipulated, \u201ceach book\u201d of the work contemplated would cost from ten to fifteen hundred dollars. The contract was broad enough to embrace the whole work; nor is it necessarily limited by the fact that it was to be paid for as fast as finished and delivered. Moreover, the case shows that the amount of the work contracted for \u25a0exceeded twenty-eight hundred and twenty-three dollars; but how much more does not appear, nor is it material, \u25a0since it clearly appears that the expenditure contemplated by the contract exceeded five hundred dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The second section of the act relating to the duties of \u25a0county commissioners, as amended in 1866 (S. &amp; S. 86), provides :</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">\u201c That the county commissioners of any county shall not make, suffer, or cause to be made, any purchase or contract for any outlay of money for or on behalf of their county, the estimated value or expenses of which shall exceed five humlred dollars, without first causing twenty days\u2019 notice io be given in one or more newspapers of general circulation in the county that proposals will be received <em>for the performance of any job or work, </em>or for furnishing any goods, wares, merchandise, or materials for said county; and the said county commissioners shall make, or cause to be made, \u25a0such purchase or contract with the lowest responsible bidder, upon such person or persons giving bond to the county, with security, to be approved by the county commissioners, that the work will be faithfully performed, and the goods, wares, merchandise, or materials will be honestly delivered \u25a0according to <em>contract.....Provided, </em>that this section \u25a0shall not be construed to extend to the purchase of any ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>tides necessary to any of the county officers in the discharge of the duties of their offices, except stationery and printing : <em>And provided farther, </em>that the said commissioners may, nevertheless, by a unanimous vote, enter upon the minutes of their proceedings, and stating the grounds thereof, dispense rvitli the operation of this section in eases of urgent necessity, when the estimated expenses or outlay \u25a0does not exceed one thousand dollars: <em>Provided further, </em>that all contracts or purchases entered into in crmtraven\u2022tion of the provisions of this section shall, against the \u2022county, be utterly null and void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">There is nothing in the character of the work to be contracted for tbat excludes it from the operation of this section of the statute. If the \u201c lowest responsible bidder \u201d .should not be possessed of the skill requisite to perform the work in a suitable and acceptable manner, be would be under the necessity, as in other cases, of employing those who have the capacity to do the work in a manner that will secure a faithful performance of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Nor can the contract be regarded as the \u201c purchase\u201d of \u201c articles \u201d within the meaning of the first proviso of the -.section. On the contrary, it was a contract for work to be \u25a0done. It is, moreover, apparent from the second proviso, .authorizing the commissioners to suspend the operation of the section, in case of urgent necessity, when the outlay \u2022contemplated does not exceed one thousand dollars, that, when the sum to be expended exceeds that amount, and \u2022such necessity does not exist, the case must be due clearly within the meaning of the first proviso, to be thereby exempted from the operation of tbe section. A less strict -construction of tbe proviso would open the way to tbe \u25a0evils provided against by the section. The obvious policy of the section is, to prevent the public treasury from being plundered by favoritism, rings, and frauds; and' it ought not to be so construed as to defeat its purpose by a judicial repeal of its salutary provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">If it be conceded, theu, that tbe commissioners had the .power to make the contract in question at all (which we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>do not decide), it could only be done in accordance with the provisions of this section, as it contemplated an outlay of more than five hundred dollars. The statute was disregarded, and, by its express provisions, the contract was, therefore, void as against the county. The right of the relator to payment out of the county treasury, founded solely on the contract, therefore fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">\n<em>Mandamus refused.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
