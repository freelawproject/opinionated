Judgment was taken against Bierce by default. Schryver set up as a defense that he signed the note in blank, with the figures \u201c$600\u201d written in the \u2022\u25a0usual place on the margin of the paper, indicating and limiting the amount for which the note was to be filled up, and delivered the same to Bierce, who subsequently, and before filling up and delivering it to Hawkes, fraudulently, and with the knowledge of Hawkes, altered these .\u2022figures from $600 to $650. Issue was taken on the truth of this defense, and tried to a jury; and, on the trial, evidence \"was given tending to show the truth of the defense, \u2022and that, at the time of receiving the note, Hawkes had reason to believe or suspect, Rom the appearance of the note itself, that its amount had been so altered. The court was thereupon asked by Schryver to charge the jury, that, \u25a0if they should find that the figures \u201c $600 \u201d were so written in the margin of the note for the purpose of limiting its amount, and were so altered by Bierce before filling up and \u2022'delivery of the note, and without Schryver\u2019s knowledge or \u2022consent, and should also find that at the time of the delivery of the note to Hawkes, he was aware that Schryver .signed the note as surety for Bierce, then Schryver was not liable on the note. The court refused to give this instruc\u25a0tion, but of its own accord, and without further request, instructed the jury, that \u201cthe figures on the margin of the note were not a necessary part of the note,\u201d but that if Hawkes <em>\u201cknew, </em>or had reason to <em>believe\u201d </em>at the time he received the note, either from an inspection of the paper or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>otherwise, that the note was filled up with a larger sum. than that agreed upon by Schryver and Bierce, the plaintiff can not recover against Schryver. This charge, and the refusal to charge as asked, were excepted to by Schryver, and a verdict and judgment were rendered' against him. Shryver prosecuted his petition in error in the District Court, where the judgment was affirmed, and he now seeks to reverse both judgments by his petition in error here, the only ground of reversal relied upon being, that the court erred in its charge to the jury, and in refusing the instruction asked.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b318-5\"><em>R. A. Harrison, </em>for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-6\">The court erred in its charge to the jury and its refusal-to charge, as shown by the bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-7\">Marginal figures over a blank signature limit the authority of the holder to fill with a note or bill for that amount,, and by the law-merchant and usage constitute letters of credit to that amount only. <em>Norwich Bank </em>v. <em>Hyde, </em>13 Conn. 279; 2 Parsons\u2019 Bills and Notes, 12.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-8\">By such usage, and the common understanding of men in regard to negotiable and commercial paper, this is as effective and intelligible a limitation, and as pointedly apprises the taker of the paper of such limitation, as if the' instruction had been written out in full on the paper, or the note had been filled up. It is not only evidence of such limitation between the principal and surety, but also-<em>notice thereof to the creditor.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-9\">If the signature is wholly in blank, the surety authorizes- and justifies the creditor in believing the authority of the principal to be without limit as to the amount, time of payment, rate of interest, place of payment, or person to whom payable, etc. And it is the surety\u2019s fault, if the principal violates his private instructions. But the surety may limit the principal in some of these terms, and leave him full discretion in the others. By the marginal figures he has-limited the amount, and left the other terms without limit.. <em>Agawam Bank </em>v. <em>Sears, </em>4 Gray, 95.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>The maker of a promissory note altered its date without the knowledge or consent of the surety thereto, after execution, but before delivery: <em>Held, </em>that the surety was discharged by the alteration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-4\"><em>Britton </em>v. <em>Dierker, </em>46 Mo. 591; <em>Waterman </em>v. <em>Vase, </em>43 Me. 511; <em>Wood </em>v.

Simply because it'is the payee who has reposed confidence in the integrity of the principal, in believing the-paper to be genuine and unaltered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-7\">Why does not the reason apply with the same force to-the restriction by marginal figures? The payee can only be imposed upon by a fraudulent, and, perhaps, criminal-alteration. He reposes confidence that the principal is not. guilty of this. <em>If he doubts, he should inquire. </em>By not inquiring he takes that risk.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-8\">But it is urged that the surety was guilty of negligence,, and should therefore bear the loss.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-9\">It will be observed that the. fraud in this case was not perpetrated by filling a blank; but by <em>altering what was already written. </em>The use of numerals in the margin or body of a note is not negligence because more easily altered so as not to excite suspicion than the numbers written out in full.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-10\">The question involved in this case is one of general interest, and, as far as our search extends, has never been <em>decided </em>in any reported ease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-11\">In the case of <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>The State, </em>15 Ohio St. 455, the-question was <em>presented, </em>whether or not the marginal figures in a bank note were part of the note? Welch, J., in delivering the opinion of the court in that case, said, after fully discussing the question, \u201c Were the marginal figures part of the note?</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-12\">\u201c I am not therefore prepared to say, that an alteration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>of a bank note, within the meaning of the statute, may not be effected, in a proper case, by merely altering the marginal figures of the note; as where the words have been innocently obliterated, thus rendering a fraud practicable by that means alone.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-5\">The instruction given was actually wrong, because Iiawkes may have had sufficient knowledge or information to have put him upon inquiry as to the existence of the fact, and yet he may not have had sufficient knowledge or information upon which to found a belief of the truth or existence of the fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-6\">The rule for which I contend, is that the purchaser or holder who takes a negotiable security under suspicious circumstances, or without due caution or inquiry, is, by that single fact, deprived of the character of a <em>bona fide </em>holder without, notice, although he gave value for the instrument. <em>Gill </em>v. <em>Cubitt, </em>3 Barn. &amp; C. 466; <em>Beckworth </em>v. <em>Correll, </em>3 Bing. 44; <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Peacock, </em>8 Bing. 406; <em>Strange </em>v. <em>Wigney, </em>6 Bing. 677; <em>Down </em>v. <em>Halling, </em>4 B. <em>&amp; </em>C. 330; <em>Hatch </em>v. <em>Searles, </em>31 Eng.

This case was decided in 1870.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-7\">The following <em>Ohio </em>cases seem to recognize the doctrine of the preceding cases as the true doctrine. <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Avery, </em>15 Ohio St. 308; <em>Gano &amp; Thomas </em>v. <em>Samuel, </em>14 Ohio, 603; <em>McKesson v.

Y. 354.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-8\">In the case of <em>Pringle </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>5 Sandf. 156, this question was examined with great ability and learning. It contains a full review of the English and American authorities. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>It was cited and approved in the case of <em>Roth &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Calvin, Allen &amp; Co., </em>32 Vt. 135, which is also a reviewing case. In view of these cases, an argument upon the question would be a work of supererogation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-5\">But many recent cases disapprove of this doctrine on the ground of its alleged interference with the free currency .and circulation of negotiable securities, transferable by indorsement or by delivery, during the time they have to run. These eases hold, that mere uegLigence, however gross, not amounting to willful and fraudulent blindness, and abstinence from inquiry, will not amount to <em>malafides, </em>or notice, although it may be one of the evidences of it. <em>Crook </em>v. <em>Jades, </em>5 B. &amp; Ad. 909; <em>Goodman </em>v.

It required the \u25a0court to state to the jury, as law, that the note was void if Bierce tilled it up contrary to his authority, whether Hawkes knew of this secret instrument or not. The judge properly refused so to instruct the jury, and the defendant asked nothing further. He contented himself with excepting to the instructions actually given in general terms, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>specifying his objections. lie did not ask the judge to be more full and explicit, nor to give a definition of the word <em>notice. </em>No doubt the learned judge would have done so cheerfully and lucidly, if requested. This opportunity was not afforded the court, and neither the judge nor the plaintiff\u2019s counsel ever heard of the objection now urged until this petition in error was filed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-5\">I now understand the defendants\u2019 counsel to object to the charge because the judge did not instruct the jury that the appearance of the paper put the plaintiff upon inquiry or something of that kind. This is insisting that the court should have given a definition of the term <em>notice; </em>for information which makes it the duty of a party to inquire, <em>is notice </em>of all facts which might be thereby ascertained after a reasonable time for making the inquiry.

Y. 249; 6 Barb. 78.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-6\">It will be noticed that the exception to the charge of the court is an exception to the whole charge in general terms. If the charge as given is correct, then the exception is not well taken, even though the court omitted to charge upon some points in the case. 20 Barb. 346; 2 Selden, 233;. 1 Kernan, 416; 2 Wal. (U. S.) 329. The charge was undoubtedly correct so far as it went.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-7\">Pigures in the margin of a note or bill are only as an-index for convenience of reference, or a kind of abridged statement of the contents; but they form no controlling or essential part of the instrument, and therefore an alteration of them does not vitiate it. Parsons on B. &amp; N. 546; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 R. I. 399; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Emigrant I. S. Bank et al., </em>98 Mass. 12; <em>Reiley </em>v. <em>Dickens, </em>19 Ill. 29.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-8\">The court will no doubt bear in mind that the present ease preseuts a question as to the making of a note, and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>as to its alteration after it had been made. The alteration of a note already made is forgery; but the alteration of paper not yet discounted or delivered, is only a violation of authority or of a trust. It seems that if an agent, in filling up a blank note, exceeds his authority, and a third person receives the note with knowledge that the authority was limited and has been transcended, the note will not be void <em>in toto, </em>but <em>only for the excess </em>beyond the sum which was authorized. It is not a case of forgery, but a breach of trust. It is a case where an agent has not pursued his authority. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Blaisdall, </em>1 S. &amp; M. 11; <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Fisk, </em>10 S. &amp; M. 590; 1 Cromp. &amp; Jer.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ao3\">Did the court err, either in refusing to-charge as requested, or in the instructions which it gave? We are of opinion that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">The charge requested is based upon the theory that the alteration of the marginal figures, and filling up the blauk with a note corresponding to the alteration, is a forgery of the note. No ease is cited in support of this theory, and it seems to be well settled by authorities that such is uot the-law. Without the figures the blank signature was an authority to fill up with any sum, and the office of the figures was merely to limit the authority and to convey notice to parties interested of the fact of limitation. They were no part of the note, for there was no note of which they could form any part. The paper was a mere power of attorney,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>with private instructions given in such form as to be conspicuous, and not easily suppressed. It is the business of the principal to give notice to parties dealing with the agent of the fact of private instructions or limitations upon his authority. He must do so at his own risk, and if he adopts means to that end which prove ineffectual through the fault of his agent, the principal, and not the stranger, who has dealt with the agent in good faith, must suffer the loss. We think, therefore, that the court did not err in refusing to charge the jury that the fact of alteration would, of itself, and necessarily, discharge the surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Nor do we see on what ground it can be maintained that the court erred in the charge which it gave. The court \u25a0charged the jury that if the plaintiff received the note with knowledge, or with reason to believe that the alteration had been made, he could not recover. This charge was voluntarily given by the court, and it is admitted to be good law so far as it goes. The objection is that the charge did not go farther, and inform the jury that the plaintiff\u2019 could not recover if he had reason to <em>suspect </em>the alteration, or evidence to put him on <em>inquiry. </em>An obvious answer to this objection is, that the court were not requested so to charge. Eor aught that we can know, indeed, the court may so have charged, for the bill of exceptions does not purport to set forth all\u2019 of the charge. The questions, therefore, mainly \u25a0argued by counsel do not arise in. the ease. These questions are: 1. Whether there is in law any difference in such cases between \u201c reason to believe \u201d and evidence sufficient to put a party on inquiry; and, 2. Whether, if there is any such distinction, the latter is sufficient to defeat the right of a party failing to make the inquiry. These questions do not arise in the case, because there is nothing to show that the attention of the court was called to them, or if it was, to show what was said upon the subject by the court. The charge was good law so far as it went, and we think it was not calculated to mislead the jury, and that, under a general exception to the charge, without specially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>calling the attention of the court to the matter at the time,, the plaintiff has no just ground to complain of the alleged omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
