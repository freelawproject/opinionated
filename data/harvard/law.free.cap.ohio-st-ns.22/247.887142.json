The court thereupon instructed the jury, among other things, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-5\">\u201cIf the jury find from the evidence that the natural flow of the water was from and off the land of defendant, and into and upon the land of plaintiff, and that said flow has been obstructed by an elevation on plaintiff\u2019s land, which caused it to flow off in a different direction over the land of defendant, which elevation was made by the ordinary cultivation of plaintiff\u2019s land, the defendant had a right peaceably to enter upon the land of plaintiff, and remove the obstruction by digging down said elevation to a level with the natural surface of the earth, unless said elevation had existed, so as to prevent the flow of the water from defendant\u2019s land into and upon the land of the plaintiff, continuously from year to year for a period of twenty-one years prior to the injury complained of, in which latter case the defendant would have no right to enter upon the land of the plaintiff for the purpose of removing said obstruction.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-6\">The defendant excepted to this charge, and asked the court to charge the j ury: \u201c That plaintiff could not gain a right by prescription to keep up and maintain said elevatiou, unless the jury are satisfied from the evidence that said elevation had existed for twenty-one years, and had for that period obstructed the flow of the waters from defendant\u2019s land in such a manner a3 to <em>injure </em>the defendant.\u201d This instruction the court refused to give, and the defendant excepted to the order of refusal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-7\">A verdict having been found for the plaintiff (Clifton), and judgment entered thereon, Tootle prosecuted his petition in error in the District Court, where the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>was affirmed, and. he now seeks to reverse the judgment of the District Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b257-5\"><em>L. T. Neal, </em>and <em>Vanmeter ^ Yaple, </em>for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-6\">1. To constitute an adverse enjoyment of an incorporeal hereditament, the act of enjoyment must be of such a character as to afford ground for an action by the other party against whom the claim is made. 2 Greenl. Ev. 482, par. <em>539a </em>(Redfield\u2019s ed.), also note 2; <em>Pierre </em>v. <em>Fernald, </em>13 Shepley, 436; Ang. on Water-courses, 6 ed. 384, par. 219a, 219b, 219c, note 4; <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Lamson, </em>2 Allen, 275, 288, 289; <em>Holsman </em>v. <em>Burning Spring Bleaching Co., </em>1 McCarter (N. J.), 335; <em>Crosby </em>v. <em>Bessey, </em>49 Maine, 539; Washb. Easements and Servitudes, 140, sec. 49, 2 ed., marg. p. 100, also 128, marg. p. 90.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-7\">2. ' No action will lie against a party for an act lawful in itself and done upon his own premises, unless that act produces some <em>actual, substantial </em>injury to another; an injury which will give the other a right of action. <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>5 Ohio, 321; <em>McElroy </em>v. <em>Goble, </em>6 Ohio St. 187; <em>Columbus Gaslight and Coke Co. </em>v. <em>Freeland, </em>12 Ohio St. 400.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-8\">We may claim, then, upon authority that the time at which a person <em>begins </em>to acquire a prescriptive right to an easement or servitude, is the time at which his acts of enjoyment become such as give to the party, against <em>lohom the claim is made, </em>a right of action. There was no servitude upon the land of the defendant below, and no easement in the land of the plaintiff, until there was something enjoyed by plaintiff that occasioned injury to defendant. A servitude is defined (Washb. Easements and Servitudes, 5) to be \u201ca right whereby one thing is subject to another thing, . . . for use or convenience, contrary to common right.\u201d There was no burden imposed upon the land of the defendant below by the elevation, until its existence injured him. The injury to defendant <em>was the only </em>burden. And this is the substance of charge asked for by defendant below.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>The whole subject is.fully considered by-Bronson, J., in <em>Parker &amp; Edgarton </em>v. <em>Foote, </em>19 Wend. 809.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b258-5\"><em>Thaddeus A.,Minshall, </em>for defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-6\">Before considering the question of law that is presented by the bill of exceptions, we ask the court to consider the nature of the charge asked by the defendant. How would the phraseology, \u201cin such a manner as to <em>injure </em>the defendant,\u201d have been understood by the jury? A jury can not be supposed acquainted with the <em>ideal </em>injury the law presumes to flow from the simple invasion of a man\u2019s rights, and for which it awards nominal damages, though no actual damages are in fact sustained. The charge must, therefore, be construed as it would have been understood by the jury; that is, as tantamount to <em>actual, </em>or <em>substantial, </em>or <em>material </em>injury to the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-7\">What, then, was the substance of the charge? It recognized the right of the defendant to enter upon the premises of Clifton any time within twenty-one years from the time the natural flow of the water was diverted, as claimed by him, and to remove the obstructions by digging down the elevation; but denied him the right to do so after the elevation had so continued with his permission to divert the natural flow for more than twenty-one years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-8\">If the natural flow of the water was- from the premises of Tootle to aud upou the premises of Clifton, then the former had originally a natural easement, as it is termed by some authors, incident to his premises, in the premises of the latter, growing out of the relative situation of the two tracts. Washb. on Easements, 19; <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>16 Ohio St. 342.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-9\">The general rule being that every invasion of a private right, whether of-person or of property, is an injury for which an action may be maintained to recover damages; for every injury imports a damage; and the law, wherein there has been an invasion of a <em>private right, </em>will, in accordance with Us favorite maxim, <em>ubi jus, ibi remedium, </em>give an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>action for the assertion of this right; though the damages awarded may only be nominal, and that the continuance of the thing complained of may'not ripen into an adverse right by lapse of time. The maxim, <em>damnum absque injuria, </em>has no application to such cases, as it applies to the instances only in which damages are incurred from some act which the law <em>deems no injury. </em>There being no invasion of a right, there can be no legal injury, and consequently no damage. Eor a like reason, the maxim, <em>de minimis non curat lex, </em>has no application where there has been an invasion of a private right, for it is the right which the law regards more than the recompense which it undertakes to make; hence the many instances in which nominal damages only are awarded in order to maintain the right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-5\">These views are fully sustained by authority. <em>Ashby </em>v. <em>White, </em>1 Smith\u2019s Lead. Cas. 105; <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Denman, </em>2 Cro. 478; also, notes in Smith\u2019s Lead. Cas. 360, 364, 368, 370; <em>Pryce </em>v. <em>Belcher, </em>3 C. B. 58; 4 C. B. 866; <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Prentice, </em>1 C. B. 828; <em>Story </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>4 Ohio, 376; 1 Hil. Torts, 74, par. 6, and notes <em>a </em>and b; 1 Sedg. Dam. 45-47, and notes; Washb. on Easm. 680 (229 marg.) and notes; <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Portland, </em>3 Sumn. 189. Also see cases cited in 1 Sedg. on Dam. 45, note 2; also the <em>Tunbridge Wells Dippers, </em>2 Wils. 414 (a. d. 1769); <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Watting, </em>2 Blk. 1233; Washb. on Easm. 659; Ib. 295 (2 ed., top paging); <em>Northam </em>v. Hurley, 72 Eng. Com. Law, 663.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-6\">The fact that the elevations were caused by the ordinary cultivation of Clifton\u2019s land, could make no difference; for C. was bound, in the ordinary cultivation of his land, to observe the legal duty imposed by the maxim, <em>sic utere tuo, ut alienum non laedas.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-7\">Thus Washburn says : \u201c It is not necessary to show that the act, which forms the <em>basis of the prescription, </em>did any damage to the party against whom it is claimed, provided it was an invasion of his right.\u201d Washb. on Easm., marg. 90, par. 30, 31; <em>Starke\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>5 Ohio, 456.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-8\">But it is claimed that <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>5 Ohio, 321, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number><em>McElroy </em>v. Goble, 6 Ohio St. 187, establish a different rule in this state; and that no action can be maintained in Ohio, where there is not actual damage; and consequently that a prescriptive right to an easement can not be claimed where the subject of the easement causes no actual damages to the owner of the servient tenement. But we contend that these cases in no way infringe the integrity of the general rule, governing the maintenance of an action, upon the infringement of a private right. They are cases resting upon special circumstances, and must be confined within the limits of the ground upon which they are placed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-5\">The decision in both of these cases is placed upon the ground that streams of water are intended for the use and comfort of man, and are, to some extent, <em>publici juris; </em>and that it would be unreasonable and contrary to the universal sense of mankind, to debar every riparian proprietor from the application of the water to domestic, agricultural, and manufacturing purposes, provided the water is so used and applied as to work no <em>material </em>injury or annoyance to a neighbor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-6\">There is, between the defense set up by the defendant in his answer and the question presented by his bill of exceptions, a most glaring inconsistency. The defense was, that in the exercise of the private right to abate a <em>nuisance </em>to his property, he, Tootle, entered on the lands of Clifton and cut the ditches; but when it appeared that what ho complained of as a nuisance had continued for thirty or forty years, he then called on the opposite party to show, what he in his defense had affirmed. Tu other words, he would be heard to say that, for the purpose of his defense in entering to abate them, the embankments worked injury to his premises; but for the purpose of defeating the easement claimed by Clifton, he would be heard to say, that they did not work injury to his premises.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b260-7\">Welch, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ap4\">It is not denied that the period of prescription, in cases of easements and incorporeal rights is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>twenty-one years in Ohio; and it is admitted that the period begins to run when a right of action accrues. The single question argued is, whether, in a case like the present, as hypothetically put by the court in its charge, there is a right of action. In other words, the question is, whether the erection of an embankment upon one\u2019s own lane], whereby the surface water accumulating on the land of another is prevented from flowing off in its natural courses, and caused to flow off in a different direction over his land, is an act for which the latter may sustain an action, without showing any actual injury or damage. We answer the question in the affirmative. The act is wrongful. It is an invasion of the plaintiff\u2019s right \u2014 the right to manage his own farm according to his own notions of fitness and enjoyment, and therefore the law presumes a damage, although it be merely nominal or ideal. To aver <em>the fact </em>of the wrongful structure, and its effect in preventing the natural flow of the water, is in law to aver that the owner of the land so affected thereby was <em>injured. </em>This is the general law applicable to cases of nuisance. Wherever one\u2019s right is actually invaded, he has his remedy, irrespective of the amount or actuality of the damage. The cases of <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>5 Ohio, 320; <em>McElroy </em>v. <em>Goble, </em>6 Ohio St. 187, and <em>Columbus Gaslight and Coke Co. </em>v. <em>Freeland, </em>12 Id. 392, cited by counsel, are exceptional cases, standing on peculiar grounds. The two former are cases of the deepening of waters in streams by mill-dams, and are expressly put by the court upon the ground that the streams, for special reasons stated, are to be considered in some respects <em>publici juris. </em>The latter case, and other like cases, of nuisance by corrupting the air, or water in running streams, also stand ou peculiar grounds. Every one has a <em>right, </em>to a certain <em>extent or degree, </em>to corrupt these elements. As a matter of necessity, some rule of measurement must be adopted, whereby it can be determined when that <em>right </em>has been exceeded, and the act becomes <em>wrongful. </em>The rule adopted by the law is, that when it becomes <em>actually injurious, </em>or is of a nature necessarily calculated to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>produce <em>actual injury, </em>it is wrongful. It is a rule of necessity, and does not exist outside of that class of cases. No such necessity exists in a case like the present. Every act of preventing the water flowing from another\u2019s land in its natural channels, and causing it to flow over his land, without his consent, is au invasion of his rights, and therefore actionable. I have the right to send the smoke of my chimney into the common air, or to throw the <em>debris </em>from my place of business into the running stream, provided no one is <em>actually annoyed or damaged </em>thereby, but I have <em>no right to </em>pen up the water on another\u2019s farm, and then plead that I have done him a benefit instead of an injury. I can not be allowed thus to manage both farms according to <em>my </em>notions of profit and enjoyment, in disregard of the wishes of the owner. The act of flooding my neighbor\u2019s farm, by penning up the waters upon its surface, is wrongful <em>per se, </em>and in its inception, and not wrongful merely because it affects him in a particular manner, or to a certain extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">But even if we admit the law to be as claimed by the plaintiff in error, I can not see on what ground we can reverse this judgment. If it be necessary, in order to maintain an action in such a case, to aver and show some actual injury, then no valid defense was set up by him in the original case, and the judgment was rightfully rendered against him. By his answer he admits the abatement of the nuisance, and seeks to justify the act on the simple ground that the obstruction prevented the flow of the water, without alleging any <em>injury </em>or <em>damage </em>as the consequence. He will surely not claim that, if there was no right of action, there was any right to abate the nuisance. Therefore, if he was right in his assumption of the law, in his motion to instruct the jury, the plaintiff below was entitled to a judgment irrespective of any verdict the jury might render. There never was any right of action for the obstruction, and therefore could'he no right to abate the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed. .</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
