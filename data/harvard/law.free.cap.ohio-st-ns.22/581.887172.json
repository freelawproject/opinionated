Marsh, </em>for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-9\">1. The refusal to continue the case was an abuse of the discretion of the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-10\">2. The challenge of jurors because of opinions formed by them should have been sustained. The statute (S. &amp; C. 1197) is in derogation of common-law rights. No challenge should be overruled unless the facts be established according to the letter of this statute. The evidence did not-make it \u201c appear \u201d that the opinions \u201c were not formed in whole or in part from conversation with witnesses.\u201d Examined in the light of <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>The State, </em>16 Ohio St. 329, the ruling of the Common Pleas was erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-11\">3. The act of March 3, 1860, S. &amp; C. 1197, deprived Blackburn of a common-law right. See <em>Fouts </em>v. <em>The State, </em>7 Ohio St. 471; <em>Work </em>v. <em>The State, </em>2 Ohio St. 296.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-12\">4. The court erred in charging the jury that \u201cif they were satisfied that a witness had knowingly stated as true what he knew to be false \u2014 a material matter \u2014 the jury were bound to discard his whole evidence.\u201d See <em>Mead </em>v. <em>McGraw, </em>19 Ohio St. 55. Upon what is shown in this record, this court can not assume that this charge was \u201ca mere abstract proposition.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b590-13\"><em>F. B. Pond, </em>Attorney-General for the State:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-14\">1. The court has no jurisdiction of this case. The writ of error was not applied for until more than three years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>from the judgment. Sec. 199 Criminal Code, 66 Ohio L. 817; sec. 528 Civil Code, S. &amp; C. 1106 ; S. &amp; C. 1187, sec. 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-5\">2. A motion for a continuance is addressed to the sound discretion of the court, and generally an order overruling such motion can not be reviewed on error. <em>Loeffner </em>v. <em>The </em>State, 10 Ohio St. 598; <em>Holt </em>v. <em>The State, </em>11 Ohio St. 691.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-6\">3. The common law as to crimes and offenses, and the modes of procedure in criminal eases, was never in <em>force </em>in Ohio. All this must be matter for legislative enactment in this state. <em>Winn </em>v. <em>The State, </em>10 Ohio, 345. The act of March 3, 1860, S. &amp; C. 1197, provided a reasonable rule for determining the competency of a juror.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-7\">4. It must appear that some evidence was given tending to prove a state of case, in which the charge complained of would be material, before the judgment can be reversed for error in the charge to the jury. <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>The State, </em>1 Ohio St. 72, 73.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b591-8\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"A7V\">Under section .199 of the code of criminal procedure, the time for allowing writs of error in criminal cases not punishable with death is not limited to three years from the rendition of the judgment, as in civil cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">Other questions, arising upon assignments of error in this case, were disposed of under the authority of the following decisions: <em>Loeffner </em>v. <em>The State, </em>10 Ohio St. 598; <em>Holt </em>v. <em>The State, </em>11 Ohio St. 691; <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>The State, </em>16 Ohio St. 329; and <em>Mead </em>v. <em>McGraw, </em>19 Ohio St. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for new trial.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
