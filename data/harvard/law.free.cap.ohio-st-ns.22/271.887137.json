The original petition avers the congenital imbecility of the plaintiff\u2019s ward; his want of capacity to consent; his ownership of certain described lands; the appointment, in 1861, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>of the plaintiff' as his guardian ; his pretended marriage-in October, 1866, with the defendant, Jetmore, without the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge, and the fraudulent conspiracy of the defendants in procuring said marriage ceremony to be performed, with a view to securing some interest in, or support from, sai d imb\u00e9cil e\u2019s estate. Prayer, that said marriage be declared a nullity, and that defendants be restrained from asserting such interest, or deriving such support.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-5\">The- defendants severally interpose general demurrers.

Were it regarded as a\" religious sacrament, and were we controlled by the canonical law of the Catholic Church, this might not be the ease; but it is otherwise in Ohio.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-6\">On the same principle, error lies to an inferior tribunal to reverse a <em>void </em>judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-7\">[The reporter failed to find either name or brief of counsel for defendant in error.]</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b281-8\">West, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAm\">Marriage is a contract relation founded in the mutual consent of the parties; on which account consenting capacity is essential to its consummation. Consequently the want of such capacity, in either party, renders the relation meretricious, not matrimonial. Such is the immemorial and universal judgment of civilized society. 1 Bl. Com. 439; 2 Rent\u2019s Com. 40, 41. Hence, the marriage of parties, either of whom lacks the capacity to consent, is ineffectual and void <em>ab initio. </em>This disposes of the first and fundamental proposition suggested by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Congenital, or other mental i-mbecility, is not among the statutory causes of divorce. These causes generally import a pre-existing valid contract, or a contract voidable only; which, when they or some of them supervene, will, for such cause, be judicially avoided. But this record does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>not present a case for judicial nullification and avoidance under the statute, the pretended marriage being a nullity and void already. Does there, then, exist any necessity for judicially declaring such nullity, and will a court of equity, in the exei\u2019cise of its ordinary powers, entertain jurisdiction to do it?</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Social order and public decency demand that the parties to a meretricious relation, in which the forms of marriage, apparently legal, seem to bind them, should be judicially relieved therefrom. This alone is sufficient cause for the interference of whatever tribunal possesses the adequate powers. But the succession of property and the legitimacy of inheritance, which the law regards with peculiar jealousy, furnish a no less controlling motive for such interference. The want of consenting capacity, resulting from causes other than infancy, which is generally declared and the period thereof fixed by statute, is determinable in every instance by the testimony of witnesses only. Therefore, while the parties are <em>in esse, </em>and the witnesses accessible, it is of the greatest importance that every cloud which might obscure the succession or involve the inheritance, should be removed, rather than remain to foster future and consuming litigation. To this end a court of equity, in the exercise of its ordinary powers, will entertain jurisdiction, at the suit of the imbecile\u2019s guardian, to declare his marriage a nullity, as it does to order the surrender and cancellation of a forged or otherwise void instrument. The propriety of such jurisdiction . is fully recognized by Chancellor Kent in <em>Wightman </em>v. <em>Wightman, </em>4 Johns. Ch. 343, and by the Supreme Court of North Carolina, in <em>Crump </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>3 Ired. Eq. 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">As to the defendant Jetmore, the judgment of the Common Pleas on her demurrer will be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings. But the defendant Spencer, not being a necessary or proper party, the ruling of the Common Pleas, as to him, will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The decree of nullity will fully determine the right of the guardian to the absolute and exclusive control of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>imbecile\u2019s person and estate. The extraordinary remedy, by injunction, is therefore unnecessary, and the prayer for it may be properly omitted or refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
