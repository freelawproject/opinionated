Wallace, </em>for the plaintiff'in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-14\">I. Did the Court of Common Pleas err in charging the jury, \u201cThat the agents and servants of the railroad company, in running trains on the road, were bound to use <em>ordinary </em>care to <em>save </em>animals trespassing on its track, and that if the said servants and agents in charge of the train might, in the exercise of <em>ordinary </em>care, <em>have discovered </em>the plaintiff\u2019s horses (though they were trespassing upon defendant\u2019s railroad track or roadway), in time to have prevented their destruction, it was their legal duty to do so?\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Pierce on Railways lays down the rule as follows (pp. 322, 332):</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-5\">\u201cIn the absence of a legal obligation to fence its-track, the exemption of the company from liability for injuries to cattle straying upon it, except where the injury was wantonly perpetrated, has been maintained on <em>well </em>defined principles of law. It is by law invested with the right to the exclusive occupation of the land within the limits of its location, except in certain cases where it crosses-public or private ways; it is clothed with the power to operate a railroad as a common carrier within those limits,, according to the usage of railroads. Speed is the distinguishing characteristic of this method of transportation, which it is desirable and lawful to maintain in the highest degree consistent with the public safety. Upon what principle can it be required to abate that speed in favor of a party who <em>wrongfully </em>causes or <em>allows </em>his <em>cattle </em>to pass' upon the track ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-6\">\u201cIf a trespasser place his cotton, or other combustible property, wdthin the limits of the railroad line, he can not demand that the company shall cease the emission of sparks from the engine, or stop the train to extinguish the fire. What greater right can a <em>trespasser </em>assert for the protection of his cattle than for that of any other property?' He has brought the injury upon himself, not only by his own negligence, but by a positive <em>wrongful act of trespass;- </em>and according to general principles of the common law, he is <em>without remedy </em>under such circumstances. The obligation which the common law imposes on a party to exercise ordinary care in the use of his property to prevent injury to-that of another, <em>defines the relations of parties </em>both of whom are <em>exercising </em>a right, and has no just application to cases where one is a <em>trespasser </em>on the property of another.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-7\">\u201cIf it be admitted that the company, on which no obligation to fence its road rests, is not responsible for damages to-cattle comingthereon from the adjoining land, provided it exercises ordinary care to avoid injury, it deserves consideration, whether the running of its trains on its own road or track <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>\u2022.at the usual rate of speed, without halting before obstructions (other than <em>human beings) </em>unlawfully placed, upon it, <em>does not fulfill the requirements of ordinary care </em>as against such wrong-doer.\u201d See also <em>Railroad </em>v. <em>Rehman, </em>13 Wright (Penn.), 101; 5 Am. Law Reg. 49, which is on all fours with the case at bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-5\">Will it be claimed that a different rule prevails in Ohio? The case of <em>Kerwhacker </em>v. <em>C. C. &amp; C. R. R. Co., </em>3 Ohio St. 172, decides two principles:</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-6\">1. That the owner of cattle, etc., in allowing them to \u25a0run at large on the range of uniuclosed lands, is <em>not chargeable with an unlawful act. The cattle are not trespassers. The -owner is not liable in trespass.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-8\">2. That the owner being guilty of no wrong in allowing his cattle to run at large, there is no proximate contributory negligence on his part, which precludes him from recovering for the loss of his cattle killed by the railroad -company from the want of ordinary care, after they were -discovered by the persons in charge of the train.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-9\">It is true that Judge Bartley proceeds to discuss the \u25a0question in what cases the plaintiff', though a wrong-doer, may recover,and announces some <em>\u201c </em>obiter\u201d that might seem to controvert our position. But the facts in the case at \u25a0bar are such that his remarks do not apply here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-10\">In <em>Central Ohio R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>13 Ohio St. 69, the court say: \u201cThere was no contributory negligence on the part of plaintiff in the Kerwhacker case; if there was, he could not recover.\u201d 1 Handy, 193.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-11\">But neither the case of Kerwhacker, nor the case of <em>Cranston &amp; Tolmer </em>v. <em>C. H. &amp; D. R. R. Co., </em>1 Handy, 193, is similar to ours. In those eases the plaintiffs\u2019 negligence was too remote.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-12\">The distinction between the Kerwhacker case and the one at bar is made perfectly manifest by the following from Judge Ranuey\u2019s opinion, in <em>C. H. &amp; D. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Waterson and Kirk, </em>4 Ohio St. 432 : \u201c The owners of stock, running at large and straying upon a railroad track, are guilty of <em>mo </em>trespass, of no wrong, and are in no fault; and there is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>therefore, no room for the application of the doctrine which determines when a party in the wrong may nevertheless recover.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-5\">In our case, Smith\u2019s horses were trespassing on the railroad at the time they were killed. They were breachy,. broke down a good staked and ridered fence, and Smith was in every sense a trespasser and liable to the company as such. 28 Ind. 244.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-6\">Our case stands as if the common law of England was&lt; in force, requiring owners to keep up their stock, and it had been running at large, and got upon the track by their own act of trespass. See 4 Ohio St. 433, bottom; also, <em>Alger </em>v. <em>Miss. R. R. Co., </em>10 Iowa, 270, 271, which makes-the distinction we claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-7\">The reason given in the ease cited from 4 Ohio St., why the owner could not recover, is that \u201cby <em>his failure to make the fence, he could not, after the breach of his contract, </em>suffer' his <em>animals to go upon the track without being liable for their trespass. In such case he would be a wrong-doer and not entitled to demand, the same, degree of care as though he did not occupy that position. </em>In such case nothing short of <em>gross* </em>negligence would charge them.\u201d See pp. 434, 435.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-8\">That case is parallel to ours. The only difference is in the mode of establishing the trespass. The one was produced by a breach of the contract; the other by a breach of the close.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-9\">Intimately connected with this question, and forming an-important element in it, is the consideration that the-plaintiff in this case <em>knew </em>his horses to be breachy and unruly. See 3 Ohio St. 183, as to the duty of the owner in-such case; also, Pierce on Railways, 325, note 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-10\">II. The court below erred in the instructions given to the jury as to what would constitute contributory negligence in the plaintiff, and also in the instructions :</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-11\">\u201c That if the plaintiff\u2019s horses were breachy, and he knew them to be so, and although they had, by their breach!ness escaped over the-fence and came upon the defendants\u2019 railroad track, and were trespassers thereon at the time they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>were killed ; yet if <em>he </em>took ordinary and reasonable care to-keep bis horses from the track, having in view their breachy character, the defendant was liable if they were killed from the want of ordinary care and diligence on the part of its servants. The test is not (nor is it the rule) if the <em>plaintiff knew, </em>or <em>might reasonably </em>believe; but did he exercise <em>such-care </em>as prudent persons are accustomed to use under the-circumstances?\u201d C<em>. C. &amp; C. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>8 Ohio St 581.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-5\">If the occupancy of the track by the horses was unlawful, the intention or effort of the plaintiff can not make the-occupancy <em>lawful, </em>and unless it could so make it lawful, the owner is bound to restrain them at his peril. <em>The Railroad </em>v. <em>Rehman, </em>13 Wright (Penn.), 101; 5 Amer. Law Reg. 49-51; 7 Amer. Law Reg. 457; 21 Vt. 129; 25 Vt. 150 ; 6 Wharton (Penn.), 311.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-6\">In case of <em>Railroad </em>v. <em>Skinner, </em>19' Penn. St., the same-question was presented, and decided as we claim it. The question is not, \u201cDid the company use ordinary care to <em>discover </em>the trespassers-?\u201d but, \u201c Did its servants use ordinary care under all the circumstances to avoid the injury, after the animals <em>were </em>discovered on the track ?\u201d <em>Vandergrift </em>v. <em>Redike, </em>2 N. J. (Zab.) 185; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Syracuse and Utica R. R., </em>11 Barb. 112; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Michigan Central </em>Railway, 2 Mich. 250; <em>Lafayette and 2nd. R. R. </em>v. <em>Sleviner, </em>6 Porter (Ind.), 141; 12 Eng. Law and Eq. 520; 5 Greenl. 356; 29 Maine, 282, 307; 19 Johns. 385; 5 Denio, 55. Affirmed,, see 4 N. Y. 349. It will not d.o to say that if the party took ordinary care to prevent a trespass, he is not responsible for the trespass committed. No difference if he did take such care, he is nevertheless a trespasser. The charge, therefore,, given was erroneous. See Pierce, 325-327.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-7\">III. The <em>third </em>question is : Did the court err in charging the jury as follows?</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-8\">\u201cIt is claimed by the defendant\u2019s counsel, <em>that off the crossings of the railroad the servants of the company have a right to presume that there are no trespassers on the roadway </em>\u00ed <em>that they are not bound to look out for trespassers, except for the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number><em>safety of passengers or property in their </em>charge.\u201d It is also claimed by defendant, that inasmuch as the road at the place where the plaintiff\u2019s horses got on the track and were killed, was fenced, on that account the defendant\u2019s servants in charge of the train were not bound to look out for trespassing animals. \u201c Upon this question I can only charge you this, that if the road was fenced at the place where the horses got on and were killed, and <em>this was known </em>to the defendant\u2019s employes, you have a right to look to that circum \u25a0stance as reflecting upon, and in determining whether the employes exercised <em>ordinary </em>care in the management of the train. But if they might, in the exercise of ordinary care, have <em>discovered </em>the animals, although they were trespassers \u25a0on the roadway, other than at a crossing, in time to have prevented their destruction, it was their <em>legal </em>duty to do so. And if from <em>such want </em>of ordinary care they were <em>not discovered </em>in time to prevent their destruction, the defendant is liable to the plaintiff for their loss.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-5\">' The statement by the court of the legal proposition \u2022claimed by the defendant, was equivalent to an express request to so instruct them as to the law, and the court should have charged fully the law on the subject, or not \u00abbarged at all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-6\">1. The charge of the court amounts to a denial of the proposition; or,</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-7\">2. To such a modification of it as destroyed its force, and prevented the jury from giving us the benefit of it; or',</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-8\">3. The charge as given misled the jury, and had qualifi\u25a0catious attached which were erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-9\">Are the employes bound to look out for trespassers at sail? Are they bound to look out upon a fenced road? \u201c Are they to suppose or presume that the adjoining landowners have breachy and unruly animals, that will break down the fences and endanger their lives by trespassing on the track?\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-10\">The first question is clearly answered in an article on the liability of railroad companies for negligence, in 7 American Law Reg. 450, June No. 1868; Redfield on Railways, 361.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>The second question is substantially the same as the first, \u25a0with the additional element that the road was fenced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-5\">This proposition, \u201c that off the crossing, the company\u2019s servants have a right to presume that there are no trespassers,\u201d is the predicate of the next one, \u201cthat the employes are not bound to look out for trespassers, except for the \u2022safety of passengers, etc., and not for the safety of the trespassers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-6\">They are both dependent to some extent upon one another, and in this case admitted proposition : \u201c That at all -other places than the crossings, the company is entitled to the <em>exclusive possession </em>of the <em>roadway.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-7\">Every man (railroad employes included) has the right to presume that no person will do an unlawful act: that no person will be guilty of a trespass that will imperil human life and property of great value. Having the right so to \u2022presume, he is not bound to <em>use ordinary care </em>to <em>discover </em>\u25a0trespassers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-8\">\u201c The utmost that could be required of him is, <em>after </em>the trespassers have been discovered, then to do his legal' \u2022duty (whether that be to use ordinary care or not), and if they discharge that duty the company is not liable, although the animals may be destroyed.\u201d Redfield on Railways, \u2022361, sec. 165; Pierce on Railroads, 334-336.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-9\">\u25a0The rule, as we claim it, is recognized by the Supreme \u201cCourt in the case of <em>G. O. R. R. Go. </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>13 'Ohio St. 703.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-10\">IY. <em>The fourth </em>question is : Did the court err in permitting the following question to be asked of John Millikan, put by the counsel for the plaintiff, he being their witness, viz : \u201c If a loaded train of ten or twelve cars is running at the rate of twelve or fifteen miles per hour between stations, and two brakesmen are all that are on and allowed to the train, and both of them are in the passenger car at the rear of the train, what sort of a position is that for them to be in, in order to have the proper use and benefit of the brakes, .in case of sudden danger or emergency requiring the train <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>to be stopped or its speed checked ?\u201d And in refusing to&gt; rule out the answer which said witness gave to said question, viz : <em>\u201cIt is not the proper place?\u201d </em>If we are correct, in the proposition that the employes of the road were to presume that there were no trespassers upon the roadway, and were not bound to look out for trespassers, and the obligation for care (whether ordinary or light) devolved upon them <em>after </em>the discovery of the animals, and <em>not to discover </em>them, then the plaintiff had no right to inquire into the position of the brakeman on the road, nor whether it was-a reasonable or proper position or use of them. The reasoning of the case in 13 Ohio State, 71, applies to this-question. The evidence shows the train was running-forward, and not backward. This is a mixed question of law and fact. It assumes that the witness knows and may instruct the jury as to what is a <em>proper use, </em>etc., in the-ease. What was a proper use, and whether the defendantshacl, or could have, the <em>proper </em>use of the brakes, was a. question for the jury to decide upon the proof, and under the law as given them by the court. It was not proper to-submit this question to the opinion of witnesses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-5\">But conceding he had that right of inquiry and that the-question is proper, is not the answer clearly incompetent <em>t </em>The purport of the <em>answer </em>was, that in the <em>opinion </em>of the-witness the defendant was guilty of negligeuce in that respect. The witness, if permitted to answer the question at all, should have stated the effect of the position of the-brakemen; how, or in what manner, and in what particular, the brakemen could, or could not, have the full power or control of the brakes, etc., so as to have left it for the-jury to say whether their position was a proper one- or not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-6\">It might just as well have been asked, \u201c Assuming the brakeman to have been in the position stated, was that ordinary care ?\u201d and he had answered, \u201c <em>it was ordinary-negligence.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-7\">In conclusion, we repeat the language of Gibson, J., in 19 Penn. 298: \u201c It is a high and holy charge of th&amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>courts to hold the owners of cattle to their duty, and not permit them to imperil human life by their negligence, nor to recover from the railroad company for cattle killed under such circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b243-5\"><em>JR. A. Harrison, </em>for the defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-6\">The only questions made in this cause, which I deem it necessary to argue at much length, arise upon the charge of the court, and the refusal of the court to direct the jury as the defendant below requested.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-7\">The following is the charge as to the points referred to:</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-8\">\u201c The defendant\u2019s servants in this case were not bound to use extraordinary care or extraordinary means to save the plaintiff\u2019s horses. But they were bound to use what, in that peculiar business, is ordinary care and diligence; and if the loss of the horses was the result of a want of that ordinary care and diligence, the defendant is liable. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-9\">\u201c The defendant had the right to the free and unobstructed use of its railroad track. And <em>the </em>paramount <em>duty of the employes is the protection of the passengers and property in the train, and the train itself.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-10\">\u201c But this being their paramount duty, they are bound to use ordinary care and diligence, so as not <em>unnecessarily </em>to injure the property of others.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-11\">\u201cUnder the circumstances of the case, could and would reasonably prudent men, skilled in that kind of business, keeping in view, <em>as their paramount duty, </em>the protection and safety of the train, its passengers, and the property on and about it, intrusted to their care, in the exercise of ordinary care, have stopped the train and saved the horses? If so, and the defendant\u2019s servants did not so act, the defendant is liable in this case; otherwise the defendant is not liable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-12\">\u201c In considering the paramount duty of the employes in the proper management of the train for the safety of passengers and property of its train, you have a right to determine whether they have other duties to periorm. It is claimed the engineer had other duties than watching the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>'track to perform \u2014 which were necessary for the safety of the passengers and property of the train \u2014 such as gauging his steam, watching time-table, regulating his supply.o\u00ed water, examining his machinery, watching for the station-signal, etc. If such were the case, he had a lawful right to perform these duties, and was not bound to neglect them to save the plaintiff\u2019s horses, nor bound to watch the track while performing these duties. They were only bound, under the circumstances of the case, to use ordinary care .and diligence to save the horses \u2014 the safety of the passengers and property of the train being their paramount duty; and <em>if the jury find, from the evidence, </em>that the persons in charge of the engine were attending to the duties of the train approaching the station at the time \u2019of the accident, these duties were paramount to watching the track for trespassing animals; and if the horses were not, on that account, discovered in time to save them by using ordiuary means to stop the train, the defendant is not liable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-5\">\u201cIt is claimed by the defendant\u2019s counsel, that off the crossings of the railroad the servants of the railroad company have a right to presume that there are no trespassers \u2022on the roadway; that they are not bound to look out for trespassers except for the safety of passengers or property in charge. It is also claimed that inasmuch as the road at the place whore the plaintiff\u2019s horses got on the track and were killed was fenced, on that account the defendant\u2019s servants in charge of the train were not bound to look out for trespassing stock. Upon this question I only can charge you this: That if the railroad was fenced at the place where the horses got on and were killed, and this was known to the defendant\u2019s employes, you have a right to look to that circumstance as-reflecting upon and in determining whether the employes exercised ordinary care in the management of the train. But if they might, in the exercise of ordinary care, have discovered the animals, although they were trespassers on the roadway, other than at a crossing, in time to have prevented their destruction, it was their duty to do so; and if from such want of ordiuary care, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>were not discovered in time to prevent their destruction,., the defendant is liable for their loss to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-5\">\u201c If the plaintiff\u2019s horses were breachy and he knew it,, but he was so indifferent to their safety as to turn them into an insufficient inclosure, from which he knew, <em>or-would reasonably have </em>believed, that they would <em>or might </em>get on the defendant\u2019s track, and they did so get on the track,., the defendant is not liable, unless its agents and servants-either willfully killed them, or killed them on account and. by reason of such gross neglect as amounted to wantouness. But if plaintiff'took ordinary and reasonable care to keep his horses from the track, having in view their breachy character (if they were breachy), notwithstanding which they casually got out of the inclosure and on the track, and .were-trespassers thereon when killed, the defendant is liable if they were killed on account of the want of ordinary care-an d diligence as I have defined those terms to you, although the horses had by breachiness escaped over the-, fence and on to the defendant\u2019s railroad track. And in determining whether the plaintiff' was or-was not guilty of the negligence attributed to him, you may look, among' other circumstances, to the fact whether the horses had-been kept in that inclosure, without their escaping, for any length of time previous to the night on which they were \u25a0 killed.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-6\">The counsel for the company thereupon requested the - court to give the jury the following instruction, viz:\u201cThat if the jury find that the plaintiff\u2019s horses werebreaehy, and broke down the fence where they were pasturing adjoining the defendant\u2019s road, and during the-night, about half-past one o\u2019clock\", were killed by defendant\u2019s train while they were trespassing on defendant\u2019s track,. the company is not liable except the company\u2019s servants were guilty of gross negligence; that under such circumstances the defendant was exempt from using ordinary care \u25a0 to save the animals.\u201d Which instruction the court refuse 1 to give.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-7\">Properly viewed, the instructions were at least as favor\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>able to the company as they could have been without disregarding the doctrines well settled by the uniform current of judicial decisions, except on two points.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-5\">One of these points is, that the mere fact that the plaintiff\u2019s horses were trespassing on the track of the defendant\u2019s road when they were killed, did not prevent the plaintiff from recovering for the injury he sustained by their loss, if they were killed through the negligence of the agents of the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-6\">The other point is, that it was the duty of the employes of the company in charge of the locomotive which was run against the horses and killed them, to have <em>seen </em>and <em>saved </em>the horses, provided they could have done so by the exercise of ordinary care and diligence, and with proper regard for the safety and protection of the persons and property in their charge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-7\">And the general inquiry submitted to the jury for determination was precisely what this court have held to be the only proper inquiry in such cases. <em>C.

The court found, in that case, that the proof showed the plaintiff had made use of one side of the company\u2019s fence along the roadway for an inclosure, in which the stock was penned, and through which they had broken and got upon the track; but they were of the opinion that, such act of carelessness, on the part of the plaintiff, will, not lesson the defendant\u2019s liability, <em>where the exercise of ordinary care and skill upon its part would have prevented the'injury.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-5\">In <em>Cranston &amp; Folmer </em>v. <em>C.

If the-mere fact of the property being wrongfully on the land of the defendants gave no right to kill and destroy, and such, an act would have been wrongful-on the part of the defendants, is it not a duty always incumbent to take care-that no injury be done to the property of others?</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-7\">When cattle are killed through the negligence of the-railroad company <em>in the management of their train, </em>the owner is <em>not </em>precluded from the right to recover damages by the-fact that <em>the cattle were trespassers on the railroad. </em>To produce that result the owner must have been guilty of actual negligence, not of a mere technical wrong. <em>Isbul </em>v. <em>N.

The act of March 25, 1859, providing for inclosing railroads by fences and cattle-guards (S. &amp; C. 331), which was in force when the horses of the defendant in error were killed, made the plaintiff' in error liable for the damages resulting from the killing of the horses by the carelessness or negligence of the company, in the management of the train of cars which killed the horses. The provision of the statute is this: \u201c Such company shall be liable for all damages which may result to' horses, cattle, or other domestic animals, by reason of the want or insufficiency of such fences, road crossing, or cattle-guards, <em>or </em>5z/any <em>carelessness or negligence of such company, party, or agent or agents thereof.\u201d </em>In a note to this provision, J udge Swan states what was the ruling in the ease of the <em>C. H. &amp; D. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Waterson &amp; Kirk, </em>4 Ohio St. 424, before the passage of this act. The opinion of the learned annotator evidently is, that the statute abrogated or modified the rule adopted in that case. The amendment of the act in 1871 (Ohio Laws, 78), does not affect the operation of the original act, upon the rights and liabilities of the parties. The amendatory act contains precisely the same provision,as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>the liability of railroad companies for injury to animals, as the original act did.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-5\"><em>Second. </em>Was it the duty of the agents of the company in charge of the locomotive which was run against the horses and killed them, to <em>have seen </em>and <em>saved </em>the horses, provided they could have done so by the exercise of ordinary care, skill, and diligence, and with proper regard for the safety and protection of the persons and \"property i-n their charge?</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-6\">The charge of the court that such was the duty of the agents of the company is fully sustained by the very recent case of <em>S. &amp; N. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Wainscott, </em>3 Bush, 149. The syllabus is as below:</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-7\">\u201cThe railroad company is not responsible for the value of a mule which passed through a gap in the fence near the railway, jumped on the track, only about fifty yards ahead of the locomotive, and was killed by an inevitable collision, there being no proof of negligence, unskillfulness, defective machinery, or recklessness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-8\">\u201c Had the mule been on the railroad track far enough ahead to enable the engineer, by proper means, to stop the locomotive before it reached the animal,, or to have enabled him to retard the train\u2019s progress until the mule could have '\u25a0been driven out of all danger of collision, <em>it was his duty to </em>see <em>and </em>save the mule, and, for failing to do so, the railroad company would have been responsible for its value.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-9\">\u201c If a cow on a railroad track <em>can he seen </em>some distance ahead of the conductor, and, by the ordinary means, he could get her off unhurt, the company is responsible in damages for an injury arising from his- failure to use those means.\u201d <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Sacramento R.

The witness was interrogated as an expert.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-6\">The form of the interrogatory was correct. The facts upon which the opinion of an expert is asked should be put to him hypothetically. <em>Woodbery </em>v. <em>Obear, </em>7 Gray, 467, 471.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-7\">The question put to the witness presented a hypothetical case, and was answered as such. It did not make the witness a judge of the facts assumed as the basis of the question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-8\">The other testimony in the case showed of how many cars the train was made up, at what rate the train was running when, it collided with the horses, and where the brakemen were at that time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-9\">Can there be any doubt that a man of Millikan\u2019s knowledge and experience in the running and management of trains, may testify at what place on a train a brakeman can use the brakes promptly and efficiently when the safety of persons and properly on the train required it to be stopped or its speed checked as soon as \"practicable ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-10\">In <em>Rust </em>v. <em>Eckler, </em>41 N. Y. 428, it was held, that in an action to recover damages for breach of warranty, in the sale of a quantity of cheese, where the defendant claims that the cheese was injured by storage in an improper place by the plaintiff\u2019s agent, it is admissible to ask such agent, who was shown to have had experience in dealing in and handling cheese, whether <em>\u201c </em>he saw anything in the condition of the cellar, or its surroundings (where the cheese was stored by him), that rendered it an improper and unlit place to put it.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b251-11\">\"White, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Axk\">The plaintiff below, Richard Smith, sues the defendant below, the Cincinnati and Zanesville Railroad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Company, to recover the value of two horses alleged to have been killed through the negligence of the servants of the defendant in operating oue of its trains. The inclosure of the plaintiff' adjoined the railroad of the defendant; and from this inclosure, on the night on which the horses were killed, they escaped onto the railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">On the trial, questions arose as to the breachy character of the horses, and as to the insufficiency of the fence separating the inclosure from the railroad. The defendant claimed that considering the character of the horses, and the character of the fence, the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, and therefore could not recover. But these questions were properly submitted to the jury, who must have found that the plaintiff was not guilty of the negligence imputed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The whole charge is set out in the bill of exceptions. Considering its several parts in connection, and giving to the whole a fair construction, we deem it necessary only to notice two particulars, in which it is objected to.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">These are: 1. Whether the fact that the horses were trespassing on the track excused the servants of the defendant from the exercise of ordinary care; and, 2. Whether that fact, and the additional one that the road was fenced, excused the engineer, as respects the owner of stray animals, from looking ahead to see whether such animals were on the track or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">In regard to the first of these particulars, it is contended, on behalf of the railroad company, that, as the horses were trespassing on the railroad, the company was exempt from using ordinary care to save them, and that it was only liable for what is called gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">The court instructed the jury that the defendant had the right to the free and unobstructed use of its railroad track, and that the paramount duty of its employes was the protection of the passengers and property in the train, and the train itself. But this being their paramount duty, they were bound to use ordinary care and diligence so as not <em>unnecessarily </em>to injure the property of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>We think the charge stated the law correctly. We see no good reason, in principle, why a party, so far as may be consistent with the full enjoyment of his own rights, ought not to use ordinary care so as not unnecessarily to injure the property of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">It is true, the rule contended for by the counsel of the plaintiff in error, is sustained by a number of authorities. But the later and better considered eases are to the contrary. <em>Illinois Central R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Middlesworth, </em>46 Ill. 494; <em>Bemis </em>v. <em>Conn., etc., R. R., </em>42 Vt. 375; <em>Isbul </em>v. <em>N. Y. R. R. Co., </em>27 Conn. 393; Redfield\u2019s Amer. Railway Cases, 355, 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The rule contended for has \"never been adopted in this state. It is, moreover, as respects railroad companies, inconsistent with our statute law on the subject. S. &amp; C. 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The facts in the case of the <em>C. H. &amp; D. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Waterson &amp; Kirk, </em>4 Ohio St. 424, cited and relied upon by the \u00ab counsel of the plaintiff in error, were different from those in the case now before us, and we do not regard the rule \u2014there laid down, as to the liability of the company in that case, as applicable to this.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">From what ha3 been said of the charge in the first particular named, it would seem to follow that it is unobjectionable as respects the second. If it was the duty of the servants of the company, so far as was consistent with their other and paramount duties, to use ordinary care to avoid injuring animals on the track, they were, of course, bound to adopt the ordinary precautions to discover danger, as well as to avoid its consequences after it became known.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">The fact that the road was fenced, at the place of collision with the horses, was a circumstance to be considered in connection with the other circumstances of the case, in determining whether the engineer was guilty of negligence in not looking ahead and discovering the danger in time to avoid it. The fact that the road was fenced rendered it less probable that wandering animals would be on the track; but it can not be said that the engineer, as a matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>of law, by reason of the fences, was wholly excused from keeping a lookout ahead of the train.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">If the servants of the company, in charge of the train, having due regard to their duties for the safety of the persons and property in their charge, could, by the exercise of ordinary care, have seen and saved the horses, we think they were bound to have done so. <em>Bemis </em>v. <em>Conn., etc., R. R., supra, </em>381; <em>Louis. and Nash. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Wainscott, </em>3 Bush, 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">John Millikan was called as a witness by the plaintiff below and was interrogated as an expert. He had been, prior to being called as a witness, in the employment of the defendant, several years, in different capacities, from brakeman to conductor of a passenger train; he was engineer on the day freight, and well acquainted with the defendant\u2019s road at the place where the horses were killed. After testifying as to the number of brakemen usually on the trains run by him on defendant\u2019s road, and in regard to the number of brakemen required on a train of ten or twelve cars, and their proper positions respectively, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked him the following question:</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">If a loaded train of ten or twelve cars is running at the rate of twelve or fifteen miles per hour between stations, and two brakemen are all that are on and allowed to the train, and both of them are in the passenger car at the rear end of the train, what sort of a position is that for them to be in, in order to have the proper use and benefit of the brakes in case of sudden danger, or emergency, requiring the train to be stopped or its speed checked ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">The answer was : \u201c It is not the proper place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">We see no objection to this evidence, nor any substantial objection to the form of the question. What is a proper and what an improper place for the brakemen on the train, may be shown by a witness skilled in the business. The evidence tended to prove the state of fact assumed, in the question. If the jury should find the facts to be as they were assumed, the testimony of an expert might be used to show that the brakemen, under the state of fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>were not in the proper place for the prompt and efficient discharge of their duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">In regard to the claim that the verdict is against the evidence, it is only necessary to say, we find no sufficient ground to warrant our interfering with the action of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
