The state gave evidence tending to prove the alleged felonious assault, and that the prisoner had consummated the crime by actual penetration and <em>emission, </em>but there was also evidence tending to prove the absence of emission.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-11\">The prisoner\u2019s counsel asked the court to charge the jury, that if they found that Mary Donnelly, at the time of the transaction, was under eighteen years of age, they should acquit the prisoner on the ground that Mary was a \u201c child,\u201d and therefore improperly described in the indictment as a \u201c woman.\u201d The court refused this instruction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>and charged that she was properly described as a woman, if, at the date of the transaction, she had arrived at the age of puberty, although not eighteen years old.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-5\">The prisoner\u2019s counsel also asked the court to charge the jury, that if they did not find the fact of <em>emission, </em>as well <em>as </em>penetration, they must acquit the prisoner. This instruction the court also refused, charging the jury that emission was not necessary in order to constitute the crime of rape.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-6\">To both these charges the counsel for the prisoner excepted, and they now ask this court to reverse the judgment, on the ground that the court below erred in giving them, and in refusing the instructions asked.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-7\">Other errors are assigned upon the record, but the view taken of the case by the court renders their notice and consideration unnecessary.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-8\"><em>Conover \u00a7 Craighead, </em>for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-9\">I.

The court erred in refusing to charge that penetration and emission are both essential to the crime of rape in Ohio; and in charging that penetration alone was sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-7\">\u201c To constitute carnal knowledge, there must be both penetration and emission; both these are necessary elements in the crime of rape. Hence, before an infant has arrived at the age of puberty, or before, by the physical laws of human nature, he can emit seed, he is incapable of committing the crime of rape. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>The State, </em>14 Ohio, 226.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-8\">The question as to emission being essential to rape, was <em>directly </em>and <em>necessarily </em>involved in said ease. If the defendant was too young to emit seed, he was incapable of committing rape. Why ? Because emission was essential to the crime.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-9\">The evidence in the case at bar tended to show that the parties were separated <em>lefore </em>completing the act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-10\">We admit that the common law rule upon this point has been changed in England by recent statutes, but claim that it remains in Ohio as laid down in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>The State.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-11\">III.

The circumstances, as detailed by the prosecutrix herself, cast doubt upon her statement that the act was committed forcibly and against her will; and this .doubt is strengthened by the testimony of the two surgeons, and by the variance between her statements made immediately after the occurrence and those made by her on the witness stand at the trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-13\">It is dangerous, and contrary to the policy of our law, to allow a conviction upon the unsupported testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>of the female involved.

The defendant below, being upon the stand as a witness on his own behalf, should not have been compelled to testify as to his having been arrested for assault and battery, the record disclosing an arrest merely (no prosecution, no imprisonment), and a discharge by order of the prosecuting attorney.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-6\">3. The affidavit of Mrs. Kendall, in connection with the record, showing due diligence on the part of the defendant and his counsel, made a case entitling the defendant to another trial upon the ground of newly-discovered evidence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b113-7\"><em>JEJ.

Y. 265; Roscoe Crim.

D. 704, Infants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-6\">The statutes fixing the age of majority in males and females, and those defining the offense of rape upon certain females, are not statutes in <em>pari </em>materia, so as to be thus construed together, and thereby arrive at the sense, claimed by counsel for Blackburn, that <em>female, </em>as used in the former act, is synonymous with <em>woman </em>as used in the crimes act.

Is emission necessary to constitute rape ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-13\">The proposition that, in Ohio, both penetration and emission are necessary to constitute rape, is taken from the argument of Read, J., in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>State, </em>11 Ohio, 222.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>This point was not before the court in that case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-5\">The question was upon the rule of evidence, which, prior to 9 Geo. IY (1828), had prevailed in England, as stated in <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Edershaw, </em>3 C. &amp; P. 396, to the effect that:</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-6\">\u201c A boy under the age of fourteen years can not be convicted of assault with intent to commit a rape, and if the jury found the fact that the accused was under fourteen years of age, no evidence was admissible to show that, in fact, he was capable of consummating this offense.\u201d 8 C. &amp; P. 736; 9 C. <em>&amp; </em>P. 118; Fisher\u2019s Digest C. L. 480.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-7\">Instead of the English rule prohibiting such testimony, the court held that the presumption of incapacity to commit the crime of rape might be rebutted,by proof of puberty. 11 Ohio, 222, 227.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-8\">By statute of 9 Geo.

Although it shall appear from the evidence, beyond all possibility of doubt, that the party accused was disturbed immediately after penetration, and before any further completion of the offense, as Blackburn claims to have been by Webb, yet the conviction was proper upon the authority of <em>Reg. </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>9 C. <em>&amp; </em>P. 31.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-10\">We think the court below stated the rule correctly.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADy\">In the popular and most common use of the words, the female ceases to be a \u201c child,\u201d and becomes a \u201c woman,\u201d at the age of puberty, and this seems to be in accordance with the primary or leading definitions of the terms by lexicographers. That meaning of the words is, moreover, peculiarly appropriate in a statute for the punishment of this crime \u2014 a crime against the person and sexual purity of the female. The very nature of the subject suggests at once that it is the physiological and genital development of the female, and not her mental condition, that should determine the period of her womanhood. Sexually and physically, she may be, and generally is, a woman years before she becomes a woman <em>sui juris, </em>according to the law which fixes the age of her majority. We think the court gave the jury the true rule of law on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">With respect to the question involved in the latter branch of the charge, namely, whether <em>emission </em>is a necessary ingredient in the crime, there is more serious ground for doubt. The current of English authorities seems to be that, at common law, it was held to be a necessary ingredient. In this country, it must be admitted that the decisions are strongly in the other direction. In England, in New York, and. perhaps in other states, statutes have been passed eliminating this element from the criinei No such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>statute has ever been enacted in Ohio, although the case of <em>Williams </em>v. <em>The State, </em>14 Ohio, 222, in which the court seem to hold that emission is a necessary element in the crime, has stood before the country, as the apparent law of Ohio on the subject, for many years. Under these circumstances, although, were it a new question, we would stronglyinclineto a contrary decision, we do not feel at liberty to depart from the doctrine laid down in that case. The remedy, if any is needed, we think should be left with the legislature. The necessity of a statute modifying the common law in regard to what constitutes the crime has been, in a great measure, relieved, in Ohio, by the act punishing the crime of assault with intent to commit a rape, in which, of course, the element in question is not necessary. While the maximum punishment for this latter crime is less than that for the crime of rape, the minimum punishment is in both cases the same. We are of opinion that there was error in the latter branch of the charge, and that, for this reason, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
