A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AtD\">Defendant Bertha M. O\u2019Donnell appeals from a judgment entered on two jury verdicts rendered against her \u2014 one for $2,500 in favor of plaintiffs Kenneth A. Melveney and Natalie Melveney, and the other for $8,000 in favor of defendant Eranklin D. Sogorka. The factual situation as disclosed by the proofs may be briefly summarized.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Defendants John and Beatrice McCrane owned a one-family house at 610 Park Avenue in Paterson. On July 13, 1970 they gave O\u2019Donnell, a real estate broker, a six months\u2019 exclusive agency for the sale of the property at $49,900, the stipulated commission being 6% of the total sales price. The property remained on the market for over a year and by July 26, 1971 the asking price had been reduced to $40,000. The agency continued in effect and on November 19, 1971 Sogorka saw a \u201cEor Sale\u201d sign at the premises, telephoned O\u2019Donnell and was shown the property on November 21. On November 23, he called O\u2019Donnell, offered $37,000 for the house and sent her \u201ca binder check for $100.\u201d O\u2019Donnell transmitted the offer to the McCranes<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> whom she had known all her life and who were then at their summer home in Sea Girt. The McCranes approved the offer. A proposed \u201cpurchase contract\u201d was sent to Sogorka on November 26. On or about November 28 the Melveneys saw a \u201cEor Sale\u201d sign at the premises, became interested in the property, offered to buy it for $40,000 on November 29, and the next day gave O\u2019Donnell a deposit of $500. O\u2019Donnell then informed the McCranes of the Melveneys\u2019 offer and was told to contact Sogorka \u201cand give him a chance to increase * * * or withdraw\u201d his offer. O\u2019Donnell contacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Sogorka who, although \u201cvery resentful,\u201d increased his offer to $41,000. O\u2019Donnell notified the McCranes of the new offer and was told to inform the Melveneys of it. After she did this O\u2019Donnell received a telephone call from Mrs. MeLveney\u2019s father, Joseph L. Eerraro, a lawyer, who asked for, and was given, the McCrane telephone number in Sea Girt. He called, was told by Mrs. McCrane that she wanted $43,000 for the house, and offered that amount to her. He wanted to buy the house for the Melveneys. He then called O\u2019Donnell and told her of his conversation with Mrs. McCrane. He also called the attorney for the McCranes regarding the proposed purchase. Mrs. McCrane then informed O\u2019Donnell directly of the $43,000 offer and instructed her to talk to Sogorka \u201cand give him a further chance to increase his offer if he wants to. If he doesn\u2019t want to, that\u2019s all right.\u201d O\u2019Donnell informed Sogorka of the situation. The next morning, December 1, 1971, Sogorka, having obtained the McCrane Sea Girt number from O\u2019Donnell, called and spoke with Mrs. McCrane. She acknowledged that the $43,000 offer had been made and that he \u201cshould deal solely with Miss O\u2019Donnell.\u201d He testified that he \u201ccalled Miss O\u2019Donnell back and told her that in view of the offer of $43,000,\u201d he \u201cwould then offer $45,000.\u201d On December 2 O\u2019Donnell returned to the Melveneys their $500 deposit. A contract for the purchase of the property by Sogorka for $45,000 was prepared and signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The Melveneys then started suit against the McCranes and O\u2019Donnell in the Chancery Division. They sought, among other things, specific performance of their alleged agreement to purchase the property and damages for the alleged breach of, and tortious interference with, that agreement. Sogorka\u2019s motion to be joined as a party to the action was granted. His answer to the amended complaint which the Melveneys filed included a counterclaim for damages against the Melveneys and a crossclaim for indemnification against the McCranes and O\u2019Donnell. Motions for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>judgment dismissing the complaint were made by Sogorka, the MeCranes and O\u2019Donnell. The motions by Sogorka and the MeCranes were granted. O\u2019Donnell\u2019s motion was denied. The Melveneys\u2019 complaint against Sogorka<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was dismissed and the <em>Us pendens </em>which they had filed against the property was vacated. Their complaint against the MeCranes was also dismissed. The remaining issues, <em>'i. e., </em>those between (1) the Melveneys and O\u2019Donnell, (2) Sogorka and O\u2019Donnell, and (3) Sogorka and the Melveneys on Sogorka\u2019s counterclaim were transferred to the Law Division. Sogorka\u2019s crossclaim against the MeCranes was dismissed by stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">At trial O\u2019Donnell moved for an involuntary dismissal at the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case. The motion was denied. The trial judge submitted to the jury: (1) the claims of the Melveneys against O\u2019Donnell for (a) tortious \u201cinterference with a prospective economic advantage\u201d and (b) tortious \u201cinterference with an existing contractual relationship\u201d; (2) the claim of Sogorka against O\u2019Donnell for tortious \u201cinterference with an existing contractual relationship,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (3) the claim of Sogorka against the Melveneys for \u201cmalicious prosecution\u201d (in starting the action and filing a <em>Us pendens </em>against the property). The jury found (1) in favor of the Melveneys and against O\u2019Donnell for $2,500, (2) in favor of Sogorka and against O\u2019Donnell for $8,000, and (3) in favor of the Melveneys and against Sogorka \u201cno cause for action\u201d (on the counterclaim).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">On this appeal Miss O\u2019Donnell contends that (1) \u201cSogorka did not assert an affirmative claim against\u201d her; (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>\u201can agent cannot be held liable to third parties for tortious interference with his principals existing or prospective contracts\u201d; (3) the \u201crespondents failed to sustain their burden of proof\u201d; (4) she \u201cwas deprived of a fair trial as a result of numerous trial errors,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>(a) \u201cevidence of the amount of\u201d her \u201cbrokerage commission should not have been excluded\u201d; (b) \u201cthe court erroneously stated to the jury that the $43,000 Ferraro offer was not made on behalf of plaintiffs [the Melveneys]\u201d; (c) \u201cthe continued reversal of the trial order prejudiced\u201d her \u201crights\u201d; (d) \u201cthe accumulation of trial errors was significant and prejudicial,\u201d and (e) \u201cthe vaudeville atmosphere in which the trial was conducted mandates reversal\u201d; (5) \u201cthe charge to the jury was improper, incomplete and prejudicial,\u201d and (6) \u201cthe sanctions<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> imposed upon counsel were unduly harsh.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">From our review of the record we are entirely satisfied that Miss O\u2019Donnell was not, as a matter of law, liable in damages to either the Melveneys or Sogorka. Their claims against her should not have been submitted to the jury. The evidence of her activities in regard to the property is abundantly clear and in all essentials undisputed. It bespeaks only an agency relationship between her and her principals, the Me Cranes, throughout which she kept them fully informed and, following their instructions, secured for them a purchaser for their property at the highest price obtainable through vigorous competitive bidding.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">\u201cBecause of the specialized service the real estate broker offers in acting as an agent for his client there arises a fiduciary relationship between them; * * *.\u201d <em>Reese v. Harper, </em>8 <em>Utah </em>2d 119, 329 P. 2d 410, 412 (Sup. Ct. 1958). And see, <em>Silverman v. Bresnahan, </em>35 <em>N. J. Super. </em>390, 395 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>(App. Div. 1955). As a -fiduciary the broker \u201cis required to exercise fidelity, good faith and primary devotion to the interests of his principal.\u201d <em>Ellsworth Dobbs, Inc. v. Johnson, </em>50 <em>N. J. </em>528, 553 (1967).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-4\">Unless otherwise agreed, an agent employed to buy or to sell is subject to a duty to the principal, within the limits set by the principal\u2019s directions, to be loyal to the principal\u2019s interests and to use reasonable care to obtain terms which best satisfy the manifested purposes of the principal. [2 <em>Restatement, Agency </em>2d, \u00a7 424' at 287 (1958)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">See also, Annotation, \u201cLiability of real-estate broker to principal for negligence in carrying out agenejq\u201d 94 <em>A. L. B. </em>2d 468, \u00a7 6 at 47LA76.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">In the circumstances it was Miss O\u2019Donnell\u2019s \u201cduty to obtain the terms most advantageous to the principal,\u201d the McCranes. 2 <em>Restatement, Agency </em>2d, \u00a7 424, comment (b) at 287 (1958). She was required to transmit to the McCranes each of the more favorable offers as they were submitted to her. See Annotation, \u201cLiability of Teal-estate broker or agent to principal for concealing or failing to disclose offer,\u201d 7 <em>A. L. B. </em>3d 693, \u00a7 3 at 696-699. All of her negotiations with the Melveneys and all of her negotiations with Sogorka were directed toward fulfillment of these duties. She cannot be penalized for doing what she was obligated to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The charges of \u201cmalicious interference\u201d made by the Melveneys and Sogorka against O\u2019Donnell find no support in the proofs. Here the broker\u2019s prime purpose was to foster lawful competition.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">The gravamen of a cause of action for malicious interference is conditioned upon the wanton, malicious and unjustifiable acts of others. Where, however, a loss occurs by reason of lawful competition, however sharp, the loss is one for which the law affords no redress. <em>Louis Kamm, Inc. v. Flink, </em>113 <em>N. J. L. </em>582 (E. &amp; A. 1934); <em>Louis Schlesinger Co. v. Rice, </em>4 <em>N. J. </em>169 (1950); <em>George F. Hewson Co. v. Hopper, </em>130 <em>N. J. L. </em>525 (E. &amp; A. 1943). <em>[Kurtz v. Oremland, </em>24 <em>N. J. Super. </em>235, 240 (Ch. Div. 1952), opinion by Judge (later Justice) Haneman]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>See also, <em>Kurtz v. Oremland, </em>33 <em>N. J. Super. </em>443, 459-461 (Ch. Div. 1954), aff'd 16 <em>N. J. </em>454 (1954). And see, <em>McCann v. Biss, </em>65 <em>N. J. </em>301, 310 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">From our examination of the proofs adduced by the parties we conclude that the loss, if any, which the Melveneys suffered and the loss, if any, which Sogorka suffered were occasioned solely as the result of legitimate competition. See <em>George F. Hewson Co. v. Hopper, </em>130 <em>N. J. L. 525 </em>(E. &amp; A. 1943). We note, particularly, that in the course of their competitive bidding for the property both the Melveneys and Sogorka discussed their respective positions with Mrs. MeCrane \u2014\u2022 Sogorka directly and the Melveneys through Mrs. Melveney\u2019s father.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The clear inference is that they understood that their continued negotiations with O\u2019Donnell were fully sanctioned by the McCranes.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">In light of our disposition of this appeal on what we consider to be the main issue in the case, we find no occasion for discussing any of the additional points suggested by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">This court previously denied a motion by the Melveneys to suppress the reply brief for O\u2019Donnell to the answering brief filed for the Melveneys. In denying that motion the court stated that \u201cThe issue of the propriety of including in the reply brief Eules 23(c) and (e) of the N. J. Eeal Estate Commission is deferred until final disposition of this appeal.\u201d Eeference in the reply brief to these rules, see <em>JV. J. A. C. </em>If :5-1.23(c) and (e), was entirely proper. The Commission is a state administrative agency empowered to \u201cpromulgate necessary rules and regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>lations.\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>45:15-6. As pointed out in <em>Rutgers Council v. N. J. Bd. of Higher Ed., </em>126 <em>N. J. Super. </em>53 (App Div. 1973);</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\">It is generally recognized that, within their allotted sphere, rules and regulations of a state administrative agency, duly promulgated under properly delegated powers, have the force and effect of law. <em>State v. Atlantic City Electric Co., </em>23 <em>N. J. </em>259, 270 (1957). It may reasonably be inferred from this principle that rules have a binding effect on all persons subject to them. They must be obeyed, [at 63]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">See also, <em>Hamilton v. N. J. Real Estate Comm'n, </em>117 <em>N. J. Super. </em>345 (App. Div. 1971). We find no special need to refer to the rules quoted in the reply brief for O\u2019Donnell. We note, however, that they accord with the basic principles governing the fiduciary relationship between a licensee (real estate broker) and his client which we have set forth in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Accordingly, the judgment under review is reversed and the matter is remanded to the trial court for the entry of judgment in favor of defendant Bertha M. O\u2019Donnell and against plaintiffs Kenneth A. Melveney and Natalie Melveney and defendant Eranklin D. Sogorka.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Her dealings were with Mrs. McCrane because Mr. McCrane \u201cwas failing rapidly in health, and he couldn\u2019t talk at that time.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b482-6\">As against Sogorka the amended complaint sought, in brief: a determination that the Melveneys had an interest in and claim to the property superior to that, if any, of Sogorka; the cancellation of record of a contract for the sale of the premises, dated December 29, 1971, allegedly filed by Sogorka and damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b483-7\">lTor failure to file a trial brief with the court prior to commencement of trial as required by the pretrial order, the court required counsel for O\u2019Donnell to pay the sum of $300 to the County Clerk. The record before us fails to disclose any appeal from that determination. That matter is, accordingly, not properly before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b485-8\">,In a \u201cCertified Statement\u201d of July 28, 1972, Mr. Melveney states in part: \u201cOn or about November 30, 1971, while visiting my father-in-law\u2019s house, Joseph Ferrarro, Mrs. O\u2019Donnell contacted us [him and his wife] and informed us that the subject premises were to be sold to another party, defendants Sogorka. Whereupon, Mr. Ferraro immediately contacted defendants MeCrane and worked out an agreement by which we were to purchase the subject premises for $43,000.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
