A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AMq\">A jury found defendant Paul Sands guilty of second degree murder and defendant Frank Sheldriek guilty of first degree murder in connection with the death of one William White. Each was also found guilty of the illegal possession of a firearm, and Sheldrick, additionally, was convicted of assault with an offensive weapon and threatening the life of another. Both appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>The State\u2019s proofs indicated that there had been some trouble between decedent and defendants, apparently because they believed he had \u201cratted\u201d on them to the police. During the night of August 6/7, 1973 defendants were in the Vesuvius Bar in West Yew York, a tavern operated by decedent\u2019s father-in-law. They went into the back room of the tavern, where they began to play pool with decedent. Mrs. White observed Sheldrick remove from his pocket a sawed-off shotgun, which he pointed at her. When she remonstrated, he broke open the weapon and removed the shell. Sands took three shells from his pocket and placed them on the table. Sheldrick then inserted one of those shells into the shotgun. Shortly thereafter, while she was at the cash register, Mrs. White saw defendant draw a gun, aim it at her husband, and fire. Decedent leaped into the air and fell to the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Police officers on routine patrol in the area heard a gunshot and observed smoke coming from the inside of the bar. A man, later identified as defendant Sands, emerged from the premises. The police saw him throw a weapon into a nearby alley. They placed him under arrest and then entered the tavern, where they apprehended Sheldrick as he was leaving the room with a sawed-off shotgun in his hand. Decedent\u2019s body lay on the floor. A subsequent autopsy revealed that death had resulted from a gunshot wound of the lower abdomen which had ruptured vital blood vessels, the intestines and the bladder.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Defendants argue, initially, that the trial judge, over objection, erroneously permitted the decedent\u2019s wife to testify to what he said to her moments after the fatal wound was inflicted. They contend that the statements were made \u201cafter an opportunity to deliberate and fabricate and was interspersed with other statements indicating a lack of nervous excitement.\u201d We find no merit in these assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Mrs. White\u2019s testimony was heard by the trial judge in a preliminary inquiry outside the presence of the jury, pursuant to <em>Evid. B. </em>8(1). She said that when she heard the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>shot she ran over to her husband and asked, \u201cBilly, are you all right?\u201d He replied, \u201cGet them out of here. Just get him out of here.\u201d He then requested her to call for an ambulance. She further testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">Q. And after he said that [the request for the ambulance] did he make any other statement? A. Yes. He told me, he said his, he said his ass felt on fire and he said give me a drink of beer before I die.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">Q. And prior to bis saying that did he indicate anything else as to what had happened? A. He had said he shot me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">Q. And after he said be shot me? A. He said it twice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">Q. He said he shot me twice. A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-9\">Q. And this was seconds after the shot had gone off or after you heard the shot? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">The trial judge found, with support in the proofs, that the declarant was under the stress of a nervous excitement due to the wound, that the statement was uttered in reasonable proximity to his being shot, and that there was no opportunity for him to deliberate or fabricate. He correctly ruled that the testimony was admissible. See <em>Bvid. R. </em>63 (4) (b). The fact that the statements may have been made in response to inquiry \u201c[did not] remove its spontaneous nature within the contemplation of the doctrine [of <em>res gestae].\u201d State v. </em>Simmons, <em>52 N. J. </em>538, 542 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">Defendants next contend that \u201ccertain actions of the assistant prosecutor were so prejudicial as to preclude a fair trial.\u201d They complain that when the trial judge gave the jury a supplemental charge on the defense of misadventure, the assistant prosecutor expressed his displeasure by \u201cmaking all kinds of gyrations and faces.\u201d The trial judge remarked, in response to counsel\u2019s objection, that \u201cthere were gestures and postures and expressions on your [the assistant prosecutor\u2019s] face of dissent * * * which were obvious to me and which must have been obvious to the jury,\u201d but he did not consider that the conduct detracted from the force of the charge. However, the jury was not given a curative instruction and none was requested. Such an instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>would have been appropriate, but defendants do not argue that the omission was error. While we have no doubt that the assistant prosecutor\u2019s conduct was improper, we are convinced that the infraction did not substantially prejudice defendants\u2019 right to a fair trial. <em>State v. Bucanis, </em>26 <em>N. J. </em>45, 56 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">We reach a like result with respect to defendants\u2019 objection to a remark made by the assistant prosecutor during his interrogation of decedent\u2019s wife, and to the trial judge\u2019s denial of their motion for a mistrial. Specifically, the words were, \u201cI wonder,\u201d indicating disbelief in the testimony. The trial judge immediately and forcefully instructed the jury to disregard the comment. It was clearly uncalled for, but whatever harm might have resulted was completely dissipated by the strongly worded curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\"> A contention separately advanced by defendant Sheldrick is that the trial judge erred in permitting testimony regarding his prior criminal convictions. We observe parenthetically that his brief fails to indicate that the point is raised for the first time on appeal. See <em>R. </em>2:6-2(a). Eurthermore, while he states that the judge erred \u201cin not granting the defendant\u2019s motion to limit the discussion of the defendant, Sheldrick\u2019s prior convictions,\u201d we cannot locate such motion in the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">In any case, the argument is specious. When Sheldrick took the stand and testified in his own behalf, the assistant prosecutor properly cross-examined him on his prior convictions for the purpose of affecting his credibility. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A :81-12. Moreover, the convictions were first elicited by defense counsel on his direct examination. We are urged to declare unconstitutional the statute permitting such inquiry by the prosecution. Defendant says that the \u201ctime has come for the New Jersey Supreme Court to reconsider its position in the case of <em>State v. Hawthorne </em>[49 <em>N. J. </em>130 (1967)].\u201d We suggest that those arguments should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>addressed to that court, not to us. See <em>State v. Steffanelli, </em>133 <em>N. J. Super. </em>512, 514 (App. Div. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Defendant Sands complains that because the assistant prosecutor commented on Sheldrick\u2019s testimony while summing up, this \u201chigh-lighted\u201d the fact that he did not testify. The contention is frivolous. We have carefully reviewed the summation and find nothing prejudicial therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Another assignment of error is that the trial judge failed to submit to the jury the issue of manslaughter, as requested. The proofs in this case did not warrant such charge. <em>Cf. State v. Gosser, </em>50 <em>N. J. </em>438, 453-454 (1967), <em>cert. </em>den. 390 <em>U. S. </em>1035, 88 <em>S. Ct. </em>1434, 20 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 295 (1968); <em>State v. Trantino, </em>44 <em>N. J. </em>358, 370 (1965), <em>cert. </em>den. 382 <em>U. S. </em>993, 86 <em>S. Ct. </em>573, 15 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 479 (1966). Sheldrick testified that the decedent had aimed his own gun at him and that the gun accidentally discharged as Sheldrick attempted to push the barrel of the weapon towards the floor. Thus, the defense asserted was death by misadventure. The trial judge fully instructed the jury on the principles of law pertaining to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\"> We turn now to the argument advanced by defendant Sheldrick that the trial judge\u2019s refusal to accept pleas of <em>non vult </em>resulted in his \u201csuffering additional consecutive sentences.\u201d The contention is that the trial judge would not accept the pleas unless defendants admitted their guilt factually, which they were not willing to do. Defendant misconstrues what actually occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">At the opening of the trial, with the acquiescence of the assistant prosecutor, Sheldrick\u2019s attorney announced to the court <em>in camera, </em>but on the record, that a plea bargain had been discussed whereby defendants would plead <em>non vult </em>to murder and the remaining charges would be dismissed. He said, further, that, although they had been advised against entering such plea, defendants had indicated a desire \u201cto accept that plea,\u201d mainly because \u201cit appeared the State\u2019s ease is too strong.\u201d He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>* <em>* * </em>We then discussed with the defendants his [sic] various rights and he understood them all. Each defendant then, we said, there would come a time in the proceedings in attempting to plead guilty where the Judge would ask him tell me what happened on that particular night and I asked him what he would tell and he said that he would tell the same thing that he had previously told Mr. De Ger\u00f3nimo and I. I <em>said to him, that in my opinion that would not satisfy a factual basis, </em>that the Court could accept a guilty on that in this State. It was required a man, if he wants to plead guilty, he must also admit facts that will justify a guilty plea. Regardless of the State\u2019s file, <em>he indicated to me he intended to maintain his story before the Court in this proceeding in a similar manner. </em>* <em>* </em>* The purpose of all these statements is to put on the record that this has been mentioned by the defendants; its been offered to the Court, <em>but in our opinion there is no factual basis presently being given by the defendants that would justify to support them. </em>[Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Sands\u2019 attorney concurred in the statement of his colleague and confirmed that his client could not offer a factual basis for the plea. He requested that Sands be permitted \u201cto enter a plea of guilty and stand mute as to answering any questions tendered by the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">It appears that defendants were then brought into chambers and the discussion continued in their presence after the court reporter read back for their benefit what had transpired up to that point. Each defendant indicated through counsel that he understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The trial judge remarked that under the rules a defendant could not \u201cmerely come in and say I offer the Court a plea of guilty and say nothing more.\u201d The court, he said, was required to interrogate the defendant personally, and \u201cmay interrogate others in his discretion * * * where he thinks the defendant may be pleading guilty to avoid a trial and possibly other complications that might arise from the trial where he may feel himself innocent * * He would not permit a defendant to plead guilty and then remain mute. A plea of <em>non vult </em>to the murder charge, he said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">* * * must be accompanied by a statement by them to me of facts which I would propose to compare with the evidence that the prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>eutor is about to offer, if I thought it necessary. Pacts which would constitute the commission by them of the crime of murder. If it did not measure up to the crime of murder I would be obliged, of course, to decline to accept a plea of guilty. 1 would reject it. Now, both of you gentlemen who are experienced criminal lawyers in this Court and others, have assured me its your professional opinion that <em>the facts as told to you, T&gt;y your clients toould not measure up to the standard of the crime of murder. </em>Therefore, if these facts were told from you by the defendant [sic] I would reject their plea. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The trial judge concluded by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">Therefore, on your representation, gentlemen, that professionally judging the matter you feel that the statements that your clients would give to me would not adequately support <em>non vult </em>plea as a factual basis, I\u2019m just going to say that I don\u2019t believe we should enter into any futile plea proceedings here. * * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">We should at the outset express our disapproval of the <em>in camera </em>conference that took place here. It seems to us that the offering of a plea of <em>non vult </em>or guilty, as the case may be, is a determination that a defendant must make himself after consultation with his attorney. If, despite contrary legal advice, he persists in his desire to offer the plea, he should be accorded the opportunity to do so. <em>Cf. State v. Piracci, </em>14 <em>N. J. Super. </em>319, 323 (App. Div. 1951). Of course, the judge in his discretion need not accept the plea, and may not accept it without complying with the requirements of <em>B. </em>3:9-2. But we deem inappropriate the manner in which the matter was presented in this case, particularly since it placed the trial judge in the position of giving, in effect, advisory or anticipatory opinions on the problems raised. The better practice, we think, would have been for the trial judge simply to have left it to defendants to decide whether to offer the <em>non vult </em>pleas and, if and when they did, to accept or reject them after making the requisite inquiries.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">However, we perceive no prejudice to defendants from what transpired here, since it is clear that the pleas should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>not have been accepted in any case. Obviously, Sands could not be permitted to plead and then remain mute. As for defendants\u2019 admitting their guilt, we see no need to consider the correctness of defendants\u2019 concept that the trial judge could not require them to disclose facts evidencing their guilt of the offenses charged before accepting the plea, and that it is sufficient if the factual basis therefor appears by inquiry of others. Counsels\u2019 representation to the court, in the presence of and without contradiction by defendants, was that the facts related to them by defendants would not provide the necessary factual basis for the plea. It thus appears beyond question that both defendants wished to plead <em>non vult </em>while still maintaining their innocence of the charges. This they cannot do. <em>Cf. State v. </em>Reali, 26 <em>N. J. </em>222, 224 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">The judgments of conviction are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
