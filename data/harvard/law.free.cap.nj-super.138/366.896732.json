Subsequently, in 1946, plaintiff and defendant were married. In 1972, while the parties were still married, defendant\u2019s mother died. In May 1974 plaintiff and defendant were divorced.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">The issue raised on appeal is whether the death of defendant\u2019s mother in 1972 resulted in the \u201clegal and beneficial acquisition\u201d of property by defendant during marriage so as to subject the subsequently obtained property to equitable distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">The trial judge found for defendant since he concluded that defendant acquired his entire interest in the realty in 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-14\">We affirm the judgment of the Chancery Division substantially for the reasons set forth in Judge Heckman\u2019s opinion, 132 <em>N.
