The result depends on the interpretation given an earlier judgment for divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">In 1970 plaintiff Edna Phillips was granted a divorce from defendant George Phillips. She was awarded, among other things,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">* * an equitable lien in her favor against the defendant and against any and all interest the defendant may have in [the marital home] in the sum of \u00a75,555.33 for moneys spent for improvements and preservation of said property and also for payment made on the mortgage, interest, taxes and insurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">In 1972 the trial judge in the original divorce action modified the 1970 order, reducing the amount of plaintiff\u2019s equitable lien to $3,000. At that time the judge explained to her, \u201cYou have a lien of $3,000 above your one-half.\u201d Earlier in the proceedings he had stated, \u201cI do feel she is entitled to [an] equitable lien above her one-half interest. * * * [S]he has made improvements in the property. She has paid the taxes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>In July 1974 the marital home was sold, yielding proceeds of approximately $20,000. Plaintiff and defendant disagreed over the proper manner in which the fund was to he distributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Plaintiff contended below that the proceeds should be first divided equally and the $3,000 lien then satisfied from defendant\u2019s share. Under that interpretation plaintiff would realize a total sum of $13,000 and defendant a sum of $7,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Defendant wanted the lien satisfied \u201coff the top,\u201d and the remainder divided equally. Under defendant\u2019s interpretation plaintiff would realize $11,500 and defendant $8,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Inexplicably, this matter was heard by a judge other than the judge who entered the original order. The second judge concluded that defendant\u2019s interpretation of the original order was the correct one. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">It is axiomatic that liens on a particular property should be satisfied prior to any distribution of the proceeds to the property owner or owners. See <em>In re Hoffman, </em>63 <em>N. J. </em>60 (1973); 51 <em>Am. Jur. </em>2d, <em>Liens, </em>\u00a7 66 at 194. In the usual case, it makes little difference to the title holders whether the lien is satisfied \u201coff the top\u201d following a sale, or on a pro rata basis from the property owners\u2019 respective shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">In this ease, however, the order of satisfaction and distribution is of some moment in that one of the property owners is also a lien creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">Conceptually, it makes no sense for a property owner to impress his or her own property with a lien. In fact, such a lien may be viewed as a non-entity. See, <em>e. g., Gould v. Day, </em>94 <em>U. S. </em>405, 413, 24 L. Ed. 232 (1877); 51 <em>Am. Jur. </em>2d, <em>Liens, </em>\u00a7 13 at 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">In the course of the 1972 modification proceedings, the wife\u2019s undisputed testimony was that she had spent a total of some $4,000 for repairs and improvements. The trial judge also concluded that she was entitled \u25a0\u2014\u25a0 over and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>above her repair expenditures \u2014 to credits for tax expenditures and shelter costs attributable to the couple\u2019s daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">It is apparent that the trial judge in the 1972 proceedings found that the wife had expended some $6,000 for repairs, improvements, taxes and other house-related items. He next concluded that the parties had benefitted equally from the expenditures. The $6,000 figure was thus halved. If the order here appealed were allowed to stand, it would produce the inequitable result of halving the wife\u2019s share for a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In the original 1970 order the court specifically stated that the lien was in the wife\u2019s favor \u201cagainst the <em>defendant </em>and against any and all interest the <em>defendant </em>may have\u201d in the marital home (emphasis supplied). During the 1972 proceedings the court twice stated that the wife\u2019s $3,000 lien was \u201cabove her one-half interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The proper interpretation of the 1972 order is that the proceeds from the sale of the house are first to be divided equally between the parties and the $3,000 lien then satisfied from the husband\u2019s share.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
