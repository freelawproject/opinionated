The indictment charges the burglary properly until it reaches that part charging the intent, and it proceeds then to charge the intent as follows: \u201cAnd the said burglarious entry was then and there so as aforesaid, then and there made with the intent to steal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">The indictment for burglary must allege the particular felony intended to be committed, and such felony must be described with all its statutory ingredients. A general charge that the entry was with the intent to commit a felony, or that it was with the intent to commit any named felony, without describing that felony by setting forth its constituent elements, is insufficient. (State vs. Portwood, 29 Texas, 47; State vs. Williams, 41 Texas, 98; Wilburn vs. State, 41 Texas, 237; White vs. State, 1 Ct. App., 211.)</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">The form prescribed for this offense by the act of twenty-sixth March, 1881 (General Laws Seventeenth Legislature, p. 62), we hold to be insufficient, and not such an indictment as the Constitution of the State contemplates. For our views <em>in extenso </em>upon this question, see case of Al. Williams vs. The State, decided at present term. (See Texas Law Reporter, p. 222.) The judgment is re versed and canse dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
