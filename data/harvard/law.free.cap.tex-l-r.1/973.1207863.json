The - power to approve such bonds might have been conferred upon any other named officer, without reference to what other power such officer possessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">For the error of the court beloAV in the matter referred to, the judgment must be reversed, and judgment will here be entered, that the appellees take nothing by their writ of garnishment, and that the appellant recover of them the costs of this court, and of the court below; the judgment riiovo rendered not to prejudice the right of appellees to claim as other creditors in the- distribution of the trust estate, and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
