D.,6044).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Upon the last trial there was evidence tending to show that the warrants had been- presented to the treasurer of the county for registration prior to the institution of the suit, and that, that officer declined to take any action in reference to them, without \u25a0directions from the county court.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The evidence was conflicting upon this question, and the finding of the judge who tried the cause will not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">It further appears, that the warrants sued upon were issued under an order of the County Court, for San Patricio County, after a full settlement with the contractor, and that pri\u00f3r to the institution of this action the warrants had been presented to the County Court for allowance, and that the court had refused action \u25a0thereon. Dnder these facts we are of the opinion, that the defendant in error was authorized to bring suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">It is claimed that, the County Court had no power to issu\u00ab interest-bearing warrants. We are of the opinion that this proposition cannot be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">The County Court bad power to provide court houses, jails, -and all necessary public buildings, and to allow and settle all \u25a0county accounts, and direct their payment in such manner and at \u25a0 such times as may suit the public interest. (P. D., 1229.)</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">This power, thus expressly given, would seem broad enough to \u25a0authorize the County Court to contract to pay interest upon its indebtedness, incurred in an improvement it was expressly \u25a0authorized to make. (Douglass v. Virginia City, 5 Nevada, 150.)</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">In the case of Ashe v. Harris county, 55 Tex. 52, it was held that county warrants which did not upon their face provide for the payment of interest, did not bear interest from their date, but tne warrants now in question expressly provide for the payment of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">On the former appeal it was held that the warrants sued upon \u2022were not to be classed as negotiable instruments, and upon the last trial an inquiry was made, as to whether the contractor was entitled to the sum for which the warrants were drawn, with in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>terest thereon, and the finding of the court which gave a less sum seems equitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">No question is made as to whether the action should have been brought upon the warrants or upon the original cause of action out of which thej grew, and upon this question it is not necessary to express any opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">There being no error in this judgment, it is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
