C. Bep., 184, cited and adopted: When several carriers unite to complete a line of transportation, and receive goods for freight and give a through bill of lading, each carrier is the agent of all the others to accomplish the carriage and delivery of the goods, and is liable for any damage to them, on whatever part of the line the damage is received.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-10\">This suit was filed in the County Court of Dallas county, October 17, 1881, by appellee to recover of appellant the value of a trunk and its contents alleged to have been lost by appellant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-11\">The petition alleged, in substance, that appellant was an incorporated company, and a common carrier of passengers, baggage, etc., on its line; that on December 20, 1880, appellee bought of appellant\u2019s agent, at Memphis, Tenn., through tickets, for himself and family, to Dallas, Texas, and at same time delivered his baggage to said agent to be checked and transported to Dallas; that said agent so checked the baggage, and appellee and his family came through on said tickets over defendant\u2019s line, and reached Dallas about December 26, 1880, and then, and repeatedly thereof ter, called on defendant\u2019s agent there for his baggage, but failed to get one of his trunks and contents, so shipped; the trunk contained the property of plaintiff\u2019s wife and clothing of their minor children, viz: (then follows a list of the articles); that said trunk and contents were lost or stolen while in defendant\u2019s possession, to plaintiff\u2019s damage three hundred dollars, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Defendant plead general denial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-4\">The case was tried without a jury, and the court requested to find its conclusions of fact separately.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-5\">The court filed its conclusions of fact, and on these gave judgment for plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-6\">Defendant\u2019s motion for new trial being denied, it gave notice of appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-7\">Appeal bond filed December 29, 1881.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-8\">Assignments of error filed same day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-9\">The court\u2019s conclusions, in substance, were, that plaintiff bought coupon tickets for himself and family, about December 22,1880, at Hopkinskille, Kentucky, to Dallas, Texas, with which they came to Dallas via Memphis, Tennessee; that, at Memphis, the agent of the Memphis and Little Rock Railroad checked for plaintiff seven trunks to Dallas, said checks being stamped thus: Memphis \u2014 Dallas, Texas, via M. <em>&amp; </em>L. R., C. &amp; F., T. <em>&amp; </em>P., which indicated the different railways over which the baggage would come, the letters T. <em>&amp; </em>P. indicating defendant\u2019s railway; that plaintiff, at defendant\u2019s depot at Texarkana, defendant\u2019s eastern terminus, demanded of defendant\u2019s baggage master to see his baggage; that said mas-' ter refused, saying it was his own business to see after the baggage, the railroad company being responsible therefor; plaintiff never saw his baggage after leaving Memphis until he reached Dallas, and, on arriving there, he received six trunks; that the seventh trunk was never delivered to him; that plaintiff and family were immigrants; that the contents of said trunk were of the value claimed; and \u201cthe court finds,, under the above facts, that the law is with plaintiff, and that he is entitled to a judgment for the value of said baggage, with damages thereon at eight per cent per annum from January 1, 1881, the value herein as charged in plaintiff\u2019s petition, to-wit, two hundred and ten dollars, and in addition thereto, eight per cent, as damages, from January 1,1881.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-10\">Appeal from Dallas county.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AuFp\">Delaney, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADW\">Opinion by Although there are several assignments of error, there is but question in the record, and that is whether appellant is responsible for the value of the baggage lost at some place, not ascertained, between Memphis ana Dallas.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">Ko question is made as to the authority of the agent at Memphis to check the baggage through to Dallas on the roads\u2019 of the several companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>The delivery of the cheeks constituted a contract, and that contract must have imposed upon one or all these companies certain duties and liabilities in the premises; and the matter for us to determine is the character of that contract, and of the duties which it imposedv</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">Counsel for appellant present their view of the whole case in a single proposition, as follows: \u201cWhen a person purchases a through ticket over several railroads, and procures a corresponding check for his baggage, and the baggage is afterwards lost, the company on whose road it is lost is responsible therefor; but, the evidence must show that it came to the hands of the company charged with the loss, and that it was lost by it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">If this proposition be correct, the delivery at Memphis of the check for the trunk which was afterwards lost constituted three distinct contracts, each one of which was unlike the other two. The contract between appellee and the first company was an unconditional agreement that the company should carry the trunk to Little Rock, or to the end of its line. The contract with the second company was conditional. That company agreed to convey the trunk, if delivered to it by the first. The third contract, that between appellee and appellant, had two conditions. There are two provisos between it and responsibility: that it would be responsible, provided the first company delivered the trunk to the second, and the second to the third. As the number of the connecting lines increases, the <em>responsibility </em>diminishes, and with the diminshed responsibility, it is natural that there should be a dimininution of the care, and attention necessary to the safe transportation of baggage. There was nothing conditional about the payment of the fare; that was made certain by being exacted in advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">While we cannot assent to the proposition of appellant\u2019s counsel, we admit that it is sustained by high authority. (See Thompson on Carriers of Passengers, p. 434; 61 New York, 538; 52 Ill., 81.) Other authorities, however, equally eminent, take the opposite view. In the case of McCormick vs. The Hudson River Railway, 4 E. D. Smith, p. 181, a case almost exactly like the present, the last company was held responsible for the loss of a trunk, for which it had given its check at Buffalo long before the trunk reached its road. And there was no proof that the trunk ever came to the hands of the company, except that at Buffalo plaintiff received the company\u2019s check for the trunk and other baggage, and the additional fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>that the company delivered the other baggage, but failed to deliver the trunk. The court considered this sufficient proof that the company had received the trunk. (See also Hart vs. Railway Co., 4 Selden, 37.) In our opinion, the check which was delivered to appellee at Memphis was the check of appellant as well as of the other companies. The contract was appellant\u2019s contract, and it was bound by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">To establish any other rule would, in our opinion, amount to a denial of all remedy in the great majority of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">In the ease of Harp vs. The Grand Era (1 Woods\u2019 C. C. Rep., 184), the rule is laid down that when several carriers unite to complete a line of transportation, and'receive goods for freight and give a through bill of lading, each carrier is the agent of all the others to accomplish the carriage and delivery of the goods, and is liable for any damage to them, on whatever part of the line the damage is received.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Our opinion is that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
