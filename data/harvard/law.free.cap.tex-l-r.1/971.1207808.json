That Eubanks &lt;\u00e9 Co'., recovered a judgment against appellants in jus ico court February 18, 1879, and that.execution had .issued upon that judgment and levied upon the land, and this suit was to preven-' the .sale, etc..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b863-9\">Appellants answered by general denial and specially, that the land was not the homestead of appellee, and was not protected from forced sale, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b863-10\">The case ivas tried before the court, motion to dissolve the injunction was overruled, and judgment was rendered perpetuating the injunction and for costs, etc., from which .this appeal was taken. The assigned errors relied on and not waived are:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b863-11\">1. The court erred in holding that J. D. Landram, a widower ivas entitled to homestead exemption after the \u25a0 death of his wife and only child.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b863-12\"><em>%. </em>The.court erred in decreeing the property in contro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>vcrsy the homestead of plaintiff, ho having acquired title to the property after the death of his widow and child.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"A86S\">Watts, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Neither of the propositions asserted by appellants can bo maintained as sound. The constitution provides that the-homestead \u201cshall not be portioned among the heirs of the deceased during the lifetime of the surviving husband or wife, or so long as the survivor may elect to use or occupy the same as a-homestead.\u201d In other words .he constitution protects the surviving husband or wife in their right to the homestead, whether as against the heirs of the deceased or the creditors of the survivor, so long as such survivor occupies the homestead as such. And this exemption docs not depend upon the title being in die survivor at the time of the death of the other marital pariner. Whether the title to the property be vested in the' community, or be the sep\u00e1rale property of ibe deceased or the survivor, is imma!erial, so long as (he. survivor continues to occupy the homestead as such, it is neither subject to execution, nor parti don among the heirs of the deceased marital pariner. In this case it is not denied but that appellee has continued to occupy the land as his homestead ever since the death of liis wife. As to who lives with him upon the property as-part of the family, is a matter of no consequence soever, so long as ue occupies the properly, whether wbh or without other relatives being with him, it is exempt from forced sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">Upon the death of the wife as a matter of inheritance, <em>a </em>life estate to a one-third interest hi the properly vested in appellee, and all the remaining title vested in the infant,, and upon the death of the infant the title to the entire tract was vested in appellee by inheritance. The fact that descent was in this way cast upon appellee, would not disrobe the property of its homestead character, and thereby subject it to forced sale. It can never be justly charged against the statutes of descent and distribution that their operation is to work a forfeiture of constitutional rights as against those who are intended to be benciitted byr them. The authorities cited by appellaiii have no application to the-questions involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">We conclude liiat the judgment ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">Adopted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
