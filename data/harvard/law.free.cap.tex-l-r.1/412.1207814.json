Henriette Boehme, who bad been appointed temporary administratrix of the estate, who, it seems, the clerk had attempted to remove, and who, it also appears, bad ceased to act as such, was also made a party defendant, but no particular recovery was sought or obtained. The case, as made, is, in substance, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-8\">Appellee held a large claim against the estate of Victor Boehme, secured by a lien upon a certain factory or mill owned by the estate. In April, 1875, Henriette Boehme made application to the clerk of the district court, in vacation, to be appointed permanent administratrix of the estate. H. Ludwig contested the application, and the matter was adjourned to the next term of the court, and Henriette Boehme was appointed and qualified as temporary administratrix. The court was not held at the time fixed by law, and. the clerk, notwithstanding the pending contest, made an order appointing appellant permanent administrator of the estate, who gave-bond and took the oath as such. He thereupon took charge of the factory, or mill, and commenced to operate the same. The plaintiff claimed that the attempted appointment of appellant was without authority of law and invalid, and that appellant was a trespasser, operating the mill in such a way as to greatly endanger it from fire; and that if not restrained, he would waste the property and convert the revenues to his own use, and destroy plaintiff\u2019s security.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-9\">The defendant answered, hut owing to the fact that there is no-assignment of errors in the record, it is not necessary to give the substance of the answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-10\">The cause came on for trial February 9, 1876, and resulted in a judgment in favor of the appellee, perpetually enjoining appellant; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>from interfering -with, the estate. From that 'judgment this appeal was taken, but no errors were assigned.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Aii\">Watts, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Opinion by Owing to the fact that there is no as~ signment of errors in the record, the only thing for determination is as to whether there is any such error shown by the record as goes to the foundation of the plaintiff\u2019s action. (Chevalier v. Whitaker, 8 Texas, 204; Ray v. Bremond, 22 Texas, 626; R. G. R. R. Co. v. Scanlan, 44 Texas, 649.)</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Under the probate law then in force, the clerk of the district court was authorized and empowered to appoint, in vacation, permanent as well as temporary administrators. And a temporary administrator, when appointed, continued to act as such until the appointment and qualification of a permanent administrator. In the event a contest arose before the clerk with respect to the appointment of a permanent administrator, the law, <em>ipso facto, </em>suspended his j&gt;ower to act in the matter, and continued it over to be determined by the court. (General Laws 1873, pages 108 and 109.)</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">When the contest arose between Boehme and Ludwig, as to the permanent administratorship of the estate of Victor Boehme, deceased, the clerk therefore had no power or authority over the matter, and the attempted appointment by him of the appellant as such permanent administrator, pending, that contest, was without authority of law, and conferred upon the appellant no right or authority to manage, control or interfere with the property of the -estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">By the allegations in the petition, it is shown that appellee has a large claim against the estate, secured by liens upon the mill property belonging to the same; that appellant had, without authority nf the law, entered upon and taken posesession of said mill property, and was operating it in such a way as to greatly endanger its destruction by fire, and would waste the property, and convert the revenues arising from it to his own use; and that in this way, by the wrongful and unauthorized acts of appellent, the security of appellee was in great danger of being destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Ordinarily, where there is an administrator of an estate, the creditor will not be allowed to intermeddle with the matter, by injunction \u25a0or otherwise, to protect the estate from waste or destruction, for the law imposes that duty upon the administrator, and a failure to discharge his duty in this respect renders him liable upon his official bond. But here it appears from the allegations in the petition that the temporary administratrix had virtually abandoned the es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>tate, and was acquiescing in the unauthorized and wrongful use of the same by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">Besides, the district court bad original jurisdiction over the estate, and it had the power, and the law imposed upon it the duty, of protecting the estate, at least until a permanent administrator had been appointed and qualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">In our opinion, a good cause of action is shown by the allegations in the petition, and that there is no such error made manifest by the record as would require a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">We conclude that the judgment ought to he affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Report of Commissioners of Appeals examined, their opinion adopted and the judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"AbC\">Gould, O.
