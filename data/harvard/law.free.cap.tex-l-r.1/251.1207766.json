Davis, a female.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">This indictment does not allege a single <em>act </em>which enters into and composes one of the elements of rape. An indictment is a written statement of a grand jury accusing a person therein named of some act or omission punished by law. Subjecting the indictment in this case to the above definition, it evidently follows that it is no indictment at all. But we are not disposed to enlarge. See the case of Williams vs. The State, decided at this term. (June number Texas Law Reporter, page 222.) The judgment is reversed and prosecution dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
