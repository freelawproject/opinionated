(Retired Specially Assigned), J.</author>\n<p id=\"b511-14\">Appellant, Gary James Smith, was indicted in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland, and charged with the murder of Michael McQueen and use of a handgun in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>commission of a felony. Following a twelve-day jury trial, appellant was convicted of second-degree depraved heart murder and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. Appellant was sentenced to <em>SO </em>years for second-degree depraved heart murder, to be followed by a consecutive sentence of 20 years for use of a handgun, with 15 years of that latter sentence suspended, followed by five years supervised probation upon release. Appellant timely appealed and presents the following seven questions for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">1. Where suicide versus homicide was at issue, did the trial court err in refusing to admit evidence of the decedent\u2019s state of mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">2. Did the trial court err in giving the jury a voluntary intoxication instruction, an affirmative defense, that was not generated by the evidence and was not asserted by the defense at trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\">3. Did the trial court err in admitting the hearsay statement of Michael McQueen that \u201cGary is not right in the head\u201d as relevant for purposes of establishing motive?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">4. Did the trial court err in refusing to allow the defense to question the State\u2019s expert about prior cases for bias and prior inconsistent statements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-9\">5. Did the trial court err in permitting the improper rebuttal expert testimony of Dr. Jonathan Arden?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-10\">6. Did the trial court err in not granting a mistrial when the prosecution improperly commented on sentencing during rebuttal argument to the jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-11\">7. Did the trial court abuse its discretion by repeatedly questioning State and defense witnesses in a manner which appeared to support the State\u2019s theory of the case, thereby depriving Appellant of his right to a fair and impartial trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">For the following reasons, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\">BACKGBOUND</p>\n<p id=\"b512-14\">Michael McQueen died of a contact gunshot wound to the head in the early morning hours of September 26, 2006. His roommate, Gary Smith, the appellant, was the only one present at the time of the shooting. Appellant and McQueen had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>been roommates for about three weeks prior to the shooting. Both had served as U.S. Army Rangers and had been deployed several times together in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">On the night of September 25, 2006, at around 5:30 p.m. or 6:00 p.m., appellant and McQueen smoked some marijuana in their apartment, had dinner, and drank a couple beers. After that, they went to the VFW post in Gaithersburg, where, over the course of two or three hours, they drank mixed drinks and played pool. After leaving the YFW at 11:00 p.m., McQueen and appellant went to the Village Caf\u00e9, where they stayed between a half hour and an hour, and left without finishing their beers.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">When he was interviewed by police during the early morning hours of September 26, 2006, appellant gave police at least three versions of what happened next. According to the testimony of Detective James Drewry, of the Montgomery County Department of Police, in the first version, appellant dropped McQueen off at their apartment, then traveled to his mother\u2019s house to pick up clean socks. Appellant returned to the apartment at around 12:30 a.m., found the door unlocked, and called out, \u201cDid you\u00bb pack that bong again asshole.\u201d Appellant found McQueen \u201csitting half-way on his chair. I tried to take him back up and put him back up on the chair. Because I thought he was drunk at first. Just kind of slumped. But then I saw the blood on the floor, and then I thought maybe he knocked over his beer, and then I knew it was blood. I ran back downstairs and grabbed my phone from the car. Called 9-1-1.\u201d Appellant ran back upstairs, touched McQueen\u2019s hand and neck to see if he had a pulse, but felt none. Appellant thought it was possible that the blood on his person got there when he checked on McQueen.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">While appellant admitted that he owned a .45 caliber pistol, a .9 mm rifle, and an AK47, he indicated that these weapons were stored at his mother\u2019s house. McQueen used to own a .9 mm pistol, but that pistol had been sold. Thus, according to appellant\u2019s first version, while there may have been loose ammunition in his car on the night in question, there were no guns either in the house or in his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Also in this first version of events, appellant gave police information concerning other possible suspects. Appellant informed police that McQueen had a history of arguing with some \u201cHispanic Mexican\u201d guys who lived in the community. Appellant also indicated that they normally purchased their marijuana from a person named \u201cP.J.\u201d, but appellant did not believe P.J. was involved. The marijuana they smoked earlier that night was from a different dealer, an African-American male that drove a beige Jaguar. Appellant also told police that McQueen was in Florida for two weeks prior to the shooting, and that \u201che must have done something really bad to have someone drive all the way up there and want to kill him. And Mike wouldn\u2019t do anything like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Later during his interview with Detective Drewry, appellant told a second version of events. In this version, appellant informed police that there was, in fact, a gun in the apartment when he discovered McQueen. Appellant maintained that he dropped McQueen off while he went to his mother\u2019s house to pick up his clean laundry. When appellant came home, \u201cMike was dead. The gun was in his hand. It was a .38. I didn\u2019t know if he was playing around with it or what. I got so scared when I found him lying there dead that I took the gun and I threw it away. And I called the cops and I called an ambulance.\u201d The gun was appellant\u2019s own Smith &amp; Wesson .38 special that he kept under the kitchen counter, a location known both to appellant and McQueen.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Believing that his fingerprints were on the weapon, appellant took the gun and drove to nearby Lake Needwood. He removed the bullets out of the gun, and then threw the gun and the bullets into the lake. Appellant maintained that McQueen\u2019s blood got on him when he checked on McQueen and when he put the gun in his pocket. After he disposed of the gun, appellant drove back to the apartment and then called 9-1-1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>When asked why he lied in his first version, appellant stated: \u201cI just came home and my friend\u2019s fucking dead and he\u2019s got a big hole in his head and it\u2019s like, how hard would it be for me to, you know, shoot you and put the gun in your hand and then, you know, it\u2019s, I was just so scared.\u201d Appellant stated it was his \u201cresponsibility and it was my fault. I shouldn\u2019t have left it there.\u201d Although appellant initially denied that McQueen committed suicide, he later told police that McQueen \u201ckilled himself.\u201d Finally, in this second version, appellant swore that he was not present when the shooting occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Appellant gave a version of events toward the end of his September 26, 2006 interview with Detective Drewry. In this final version, appellant finally admitted he was inside the apartment when the shooting occurred. Appellant stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC-\">\u201cWhen I went to my mother\u2019s house I put the .38 inside the laundry basket, and when I took it into the house I just put it in my pocket and took it upstairs. I put it on the floor.,[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] I was like, you see this one, right, Mike? He goes \u201cYeah.\u201d I said \u201cOkay. Watch out. It\u2019s loaded.\u201d I went into the back bathroom. I was going number two. I came out and as I was walking out in the hallway I was about inside the room and I heard the bang.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Appellant \u201csaw the blood coming out of [the victim\u2019s] head,\u201d and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">I absolutely went ballistic. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I didn\u2019t know to call 9-1-1. I didn\u2019t know whether to grab him and pick him up. I didn\u2019t know whether to throw him in [the] car. I didn\u2019t know what to do. And you train for this [in] combat, when your buddy gets shot in combat, you know what to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Appellant then decided to dispose of the gun. After returning to the apartment, appellant maintained that he still did not know what to do. Appellant contemplated retrieving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>the gun, or putting another gun in McQueen\u2019s hands, but realized the ballistics evidence \u201cwon\u2019t match up.\u201d At that point, appellant finally decided to call 9-1-1, stating: \u201cI knew the longer I waited the more suspicious it would look, so I called 9-1-1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">In addition to these different accounts surrounding the shooting, at some point during his interview with police, appellant told Detective Drewry that he shot a twelve-year-old boy wearing grenades on a vest, as well as the boy\u2019s mother, while he was deployed in Iraq. Appellant also told the detective:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">I tried to tell my best friend, I said, I told him I shot a 12-year-old boy and I saw the look on his face when he, that look right there, like if you shot a 12-year-old boy, you\u2019re a monster. You know, I told him. He gave me that look and I saw it. He lost so much respect for me when I told him that. And, people don\u2019t understand that. People don\u2019t understand, even if it was a grown man, that, that catastrophic, the things that go on up here every single day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">In addition, after returning from overseas, appellant sought treatment at Walter Reed Hospital for depression, but was turned away because he was not active Army at the time. Appellant stated: \u201cThey told me I had to leave, you can\u2019t talk. You try to talk to people and no one ever understands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Appellant swore that McQueen \u201ckilled himself.\u201d Appellant surmised that \u201c[m]aybe [McQueen] saw something he didn\u2019t like overseas. Maybe his girl broke his heart. Some things are harder to explain than others. Guys like me and Mike, we\u2019re supposed to be these big tough killers, we can\u2019t let a woman hurt us. You know that.\u201d When asked whether McQueen appeared as if there was something \u201cgoing on that he just couldn\u2019t deal with,\u201d appellant replied, \u201c[a] little bit. But, I didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know. I never saw him, I don\u2019t know what would make him do it.\u201d After completing his statement, appellant assisted the police in recovering the gun from Lake Needwood.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Officers from the Gaithersburg Police Department and the Montgomery County Police responded to the scene at around 1:00 a.m. following the 9-1-1 dispatch. Appellant was outside the apartment building on his knees crying hysterically, vomiting, and repeatedly yelling, \u201cHe\u2019s dead. He\u2019s dead.\u201d Appellant had a considerable amount of blood on his hands, face, shirt, and shoes. The parties would later stipulate that appellant\u2019s undershirt, tennis shoes, jeans, and t-shirt all tested positive for the presence of blood DNA from McQueen, and negative for blood DNA from appellant. DNA swabbed from appellant\u2019s left palm and chin contained a combination of McQueen\u2019s blood DNA, and appellant\u2019s non-blood DNA. The swab from appellant\u2019s cheek and neck tested positive for McQueen\u2019s DNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">After obtaining a search warrant at around 2:22 a.m., forensics specialist Kimberly Clements processed the crime scene and took photographs of the blood spatter on the carpet and surrounding area. A portion of the carpet containing blood spatter was cut out and recovered. Blood was found on a door handle, and bloody footprints were found in the hallway near the rear bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">There was drug paraphernalia in McQueen\u2019s lap, next to his left hand. McQueen\u2019s right arm was dangling down with his hand on the floor next to a beer bottle, a ceramic pipe, and a bong. The latter two items tested positive for marijuana and marijuana residue. There was also a remote control under McQueen\u2019s right hand and one of two televisions in the room was turned on.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Clements also recovered a gun locking cable from the living room area. Clements testified that the \u201ccable is intended to go through the gun chamber and lock so the gun cannot be fired loaded or fired accidentally.\u201d A second gun locking cable, as well as a bag containing ammunition, were recovered from a rear bedroom. Another forensic specialist, Grant Lee, processed appellant\u2019s car and recovered \u201cthree rifle magazines, a pistol magazine, 12 gauge shotgun round, two live 7.62 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>rounds, a box of 22 ammunition and one live .38 round\u201d from the driver\u2019s side front door pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Gunshot residue (\u201cGSR\u201d) samples were taken from both appellant\u2019s and McQueen\u2019s hands. The State\u2019s GSR expert testified that the hands of both appellant and McQueen tested positive and there were more particles on McQueen\u2019s hands than on appellant\u2019s. After explaining that \u201cparticles would remain on the hands until the time of collection unless it were handled or moved around,\u201d the expert opined that, given the approximately 40 to 45 minutes between the time of the incident and the collection of the residue from appellant, \u201cthere was ample opportunity for the cause of particle loss.\u201d The GSR expert could not conclude who the shooter was based on his analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">A suspected projectile or portion of a bullet, as well as copper fragments from a bullet jacket, were collected during McQueen\u2019s autopsy. A firearms expert examined these items, as well as the .38 revolver recovered from Lake Needwood. While the bullet fragments recovered from McQueen were consistent with having been fired from a similar firearm, the expert could not conclude that the fragments actually were fired from the .38 revolver recovered in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Dr. Carol Allan, the State\u2019s forensic pathologist who conducted McQueen\u2019s autopsy, testified that McQueen sustained a \u201cvery severe\u201d contact gunshot wound to the right side of the head. The path of the wound was right to left, and very slightly front to back. Dr. Allan also testified that McQueen had a blood alcohol level of somewhere between .13 and .20.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">As noted, the cause of death in this case was a gunshot wound to the head. Dr. Allan then addressed the manner of death, noting that Maryland recognizes five manners of death, including: natural; accident; suicide or self-inflicted; homicide, and undetermined. Dr. Allan concluded that, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, the manner of death in this case was homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">Dr. Allan based her conclusion on the circumstances surrounding McQueen\u2019s death, including that there was no blow-back, soot or blood spatter on McQueen\u2019s right hand or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>forearm; the gunshot residue on McQueen\u2019s hands did not display a specific pattern indicating that he was holding a gun; there was no gun found at the scene of the shooting; and, there was no evidence on the carpet below McQueen\u2019s right hand that a gun had been dropped. In fact, Dr. Allan noted that \u201cthe thing that was in the ideal positioning for being in the right hand was, actually, a TV remote.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Dr. Allan also based her conclusion on the fact that the reporting individual, appellant, had a number of versions of how events unfolded; these versions were not adequately explained by the blood spatter evidence; there was no indication that McQueen was known to act impulsively or in a risk-taking manner while either intoxicated or sober; there was no evidence that McQueen was suicidal or otherwise depressed; and, there was no indication that McQueen could not obtain a gun earlier, if he wanted to commit suicide. Finally, Dr. Allan agreed that although she reviewed reports from other experts involved in this case, those reports did not lead her to change her conclusion that the manner of death was homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Several other experts testified at trial. Dr. William Vos-burgh, the State\u2019s expert in the field of blood stain pattern analysis and interpretation, identified two areas on the carpeting that were of particular importance in this case. One was a \u201cv\u201d shaped void in the blood stain pattern. Vosburgh was of the opinion that this void was caused by an \u201cintervening object being [there] for some period of time during maximum blood pressure.\u201d Vosburgh believed that the intervening object was appellant\u2019s right shoe. The other area of interest was another void caused by \u201ca hand that [was] in the way at that moment getting blood cast upon it, and a spray of blood going between the [fingers].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Dr. Vosburgh also was aware that appellant claimed that he touched the wound to attempt to stop the bleeding, but there was no evidence of any imprint or indication that the wound was touched or moved after the shot was fired. On cross-examination, Dr. Vosburgh agreed that his preliminary assessment was that the contact gunshot wound to the victim\u2019s head was not self-inflicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>In contrast to Dr. Vosburgh\u2019s opinions, Herbert MacDonnell and Barton Epstein testified as defense experts in blood stain pattern analysis and interpretation. Both experts were of the opinion that the \u201cv\u201d shaped void pattern on the carpet could not have been made by appellant\u2019s sneaker because the void was \u201cv\u201d shaped, while the sneaker was rounded and would have left a void in a similar shape.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Further, Professor MacDonnell testified that there was not enough blood on the sneaker to account for the amount of blood visible on the stain in the carpet. It was his opinion that the blood on appellant\u2019s sneaker was caused when the sneaker \u201ccame into contact with something that was bloody.\u201d Mr. Epstein agreed that, at some point, appellant\u2019s pants and shoes \u201cwere underneath the dripping blood of McQueen,\u201d but it was unclear when or where that occurred. However, appellant\u2019s pants and shoes only needed to be under the source of blood for \u201ca very short time, meaning a second or less,\u201d to have resulted in the stains.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Both defense experts examined the rug and found a left handprint, which they concluded was not a void caused by a hand being on the carpet at the time of the initial bleeding, but rather, was made by blood being transferred from a bloody palm onto the rug. Both experts also disagreed with Dr. Vosburgh\u2019s opinion that this stain was caused by a spray or mist of blood going between the fingers because, as Professor MacDonnell testified, there was \u201cjust too much blood for a mist or a spattered blood from impact to do that.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Professor MacDonnell was also of the opinion that the pattern of the blood stains and the presence of tissue on McQueen\u2019s right arm indicated that McQueen\u2019s arm was upright, above shoulder height at the moment of impact.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mac-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Donnell explained that the initial stain on the arm was \u201cfrom right to left and then eventually running down by gravity.\u201d Professor MacDonnell also concluded that McQueen\u2019s head was upright at the time the wound was sustained. Therefore, MacDonnell explained that \u201cin my opinion the arm would have to have been up in this position, up above the shoulder.\u201d The defense\u2019s other expert, Mr. Epstein, agreed that the victim\u2019s head was upright at the time of the shooting, but was unable to determine whether McQueen\u2019s arm was up or down.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Dr. Vincent Di Maio also testified for the defense as an expert in forensic pathology. After reviewing the autopsy report and other evidence, he concluded that McQueen died \u201cas the result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound; that this case is a suicide.\u201d Dr. Di Maio observed that the contact wound was to McQueen\u2019s right temple, the most common area for self-inflicted wounds, noting that contact wounds appear in 97.9 percent of such cases. He also indicated that the gun appeared to have been held at an angle considered normal when someone puts a gun to his own head. Dr. Di Maio also based his conclusion on the fact that there was a \u201ctremendous amount\u201d of gunshot residue on McQueen\u2019s hands; McQueen had at least a .13 blood alcohol level; that there was \u201can alleged history of depression or separation;\u201d there was no evidence of a struggle; and, that \u201cthere doesn\u2019t seem to be any motive for it to be a homicide.\u201d He concluded his direct examination by testifying: \u201cI don\u2019t doubt it\u2019s a suicide.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">In addition to the various investigators and experts, both parties called other witnesses to testify regarding their observations of McQueen and appellant. McQueen and appellant were good friends, and, according to appellant\u2019s statement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>best friends. No one testified to any conflict between the two, especially on the night of the incident. However, Ronnie McKay did testify that McQueen told him he did not want to live with appellant, \u201c[bjecause he said, you know, Gary is not right in the head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">McQueen\u2019s former girlfriend, Shaieyann Williams, testified that McQueen broke up with her sometime before the summer of 2006, but the break-up was a mutual understanding and that, afterwards, they continued to remain friends. McQueen did not seem depressed from his experience in the military, and seemed happy to end that career and to move forward with his plans to go to college.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">McQueen\u2019s friend and former fellow Ranger, Justin Jones, testified that he and McQueen were deployed together in Afghanistan, where McQueen was an intelligence analyst. According to Jones, McQueen spent most of his time at a central base location. After returning to the United States, Jones confirmed that McQueen was excited to leave the military and go on to college.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">While McQueen was visiting Jones in North Carolina, McQueen became romantically involved with Tina Warner. On or around September 8, 2006, McQueen told Jones that he thought Warner might be pregnant, but that concern ultimately turned out to be unfounded. Jones also testified that McQueen told him about being arrested for \u201ca DUI in Atlanta\u201d over that summer, but that McQueen \u201cwas pretty calm about it,\u201d and acted as if it were \u201c[n]o big deal.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Rosemary Smith, appellant\u2019s mother, testified that she knew McQueen, and that she had seen McQueen handling her .38 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>revolver. On some occasion, Smith let McQueen borrow the gun and take it to a shooting range. Smith claimed that McQueen told her that he was not ready to go to college; he wanted to get a job; and, that he was still having difficulty with the break up with Shaieyann Williams. McQueen also smoked and drank a lot while he was in her presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Finally, there was a significant amount of testimony concerning appellant\u2019s deployments overseas and his experience in the Rangers. Notably, Teru Hayashi, appellant\u2019s direct line supervisor in Iraq, testified that, on one occasion, while he was travelling in a Humvee with appellant, appellant left his loaded M-4 rifle, set to the fire position, in an unsafe position inside the vehicle. The loaded M-4 rifle was pointed at the driver of the Humvee.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">On another occasion back in the United States, Ian Sutherland, a fellow Ranger, attended a barbecue at appellant\u2019s home. During that party, appellant sat down next to Sutherland on the couch and began loading an automatic pistol with .9 millimeter hollow point ammunition while the barrel of the pistol was pointed at Sutherland\u2019s leg. Sutherland gestured for appellant to \u201cpay attention\u201d to what he was doing and both of the men then moved away.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Sutherland also testified that he had been deployed with appellant in Afghanistan, and that, based on his experience, he was of the opinion that appellant was \u201c[ljess than honest\u201d and would embellish the truth and tell \u201cmixed stories.\u201d William Ryan, a Chief Warrant Officer and Intelligence Analyst in the Army, knew appellant while they were stationed together at Fort Benning, Georgia. In that community, appellant had a reputation for telling tales and was known to lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">We shall include additional facts in the following discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">Appellant first contends the trial court erred in not admitting evidence of McQueen\u2019s state of mind, stating that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>trial court refused to permit testimonial evidence of the decedent\u2019s statements to a police officer after he had been arrested for a DWI a mere month-and-half before his death, which was critical to Appellant\u2019s theory of defense.\u201d The State responds that the trial court properly exercised its discretion and that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We conclude that the trial court neither erred nor abused its discretion. Moreover, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Towards the end of Justin Jones\u2019s testimony, the State inquired if defense counsel intended to call Officer John Hegger, of the Acworth City Police Department in Georgia, concerning McQueen\u2019s prior arrest for driving while intoxicated. Defense counsel indicated that was his intention, and proffered that, during that arrest, McQueen told the officer: \u201cI saw a lot of bad stuff over there,\u201d and \u201cthis is the last thing I need on top of all the other shit, or all the other stuff, bad stuff going on in my life.\u201d The court questioned the relevance of the statements, noting at one point that the arrest occurred one month prior to the shooting. Defense counsel maintained that the statements went to the victim\u2019s state of mind. After counsel directed the court\u2019s attention to <em>Case v. State, </em>118 Md.App. 279, 702 A.2d 777 (1997), the court agreed that evidence of the victim\u2019s state of mind may be \u201cconsequential,\u201d but that \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you go back into infinity and come up with some comment that a person made in a set of circumstances that standing alone are traumatic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">After further discussion, and after the parties unsuccessfully attempted to contact the police officer from Georgia, the State recalled Justin Jones to the stand. Jones informed the jury that McQueen had been arrested for a DUI in Atlanta about a month before he died, and that \u201che didn\u2019t really care too much about it.\u201d Further, \u201cany given night at Ranger Regiment any of us could have gotten a DUI for drinking and driving. It just so happened that he got it, you know.\u201d McQueen was \u201cpretty calm about it,\u201d and that it was \u201c[n]o big deal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>The next day, during a break in Detective Drewry\u2019s testimony about appellant\u2019s statement, defense counsel returned to this issue, contending that, based on out-of-state authorities, a suicidal testimony may be shown where \u201cdeath may have been produced by the deceased or there is not positive and direct proof of homicide.\u201d Defense counsel agreed there were no Maryland cases on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The State responded that it had spoken to Officer Hegger, and that McQueen\u2019s case was a \u201cstereotypical DUI, DWI arrest, swerving and all that,\u201d and that, while they were \u201cwaiting around for 20 minutes for the intox machine to get working or whatever you got to do, and one statement he says is, \u2018This is the last thing I need in my life.\u2019 \u201d The State argued that such a statement under such circumstances \u201cdoesn\u2019t make it signs of suicide in any way whatsoever.\u201d Further, \u201c[fit\u2019s a statement any person would make after a DWI.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">After hearing further argument, the court specifically considered <em>Robinson v. State, </em>66 Md.App. 246, 503 A.2d 725, <em>cert. denied, </em>306 Md. 289, 508 A.2d 489 (1986), and concluded that the proffered evidence was inadmissible. The trial court found that McQueen\u2019s statement to the Georgia police officer was \u201cvery remote. It\u2019s 30 days ago before the incident.\u201d The trial court ruled that the statements were neither relevant nor trustworthy evidence of McQueen\u2019s state of mind, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a7v-dedup-0\">Being placed under arrest and charged with an offense of DUI or, quite frankly, being placed under arrest and charged with anything, I think it\u2019s a reasonable inference that that in itself is traumatic, let alone what else might be going on in an individual\u2019s life. And to suggest that a person\u2019s reaction to being arrested somehow is indicative of their suicidal thoughts is strained, strains our credulity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Several trial days later, defense counsel asked the court to reconsider its ruling. Counsel called Officer John Hegger outside the presence of the jury. Although he could not remember the exact date of the stop, Officer Hegger stopped McQueen in early August 2006 on suspicion of driving while impaired by alcohol. After McQueen failed a number of field <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>sobriety tests, he was placed under arrest, and transported to the police station. There, McQueen asked \u201cif there\u2019s anything he could do to get out of this,\u201d and Officer Hegger informed him there was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">While they waited approximately twenty minutes for a breath testing machine to warm up, McQueen appeared depressed, put his hands down on his head, and said \u201cthis is the last thing I need in my life right now, on top of all the other, excuse my wording, other shit going on in my life.\u201d McQueen also spoke about Iraq and Afghanistan, claiming that he had been shot while overseas. Although McQueen attempted to show Officer Hegger where he was wounded, Officer Hegger did not see any such wound. McQueen then took the breath test, and the test was positive for alcohol in the amount of approximately twice the legal limit in Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">After Officer Hegger was excused, the trial court again ruled that this testimony was remote and not relevant. The court stated: \u201cIt won\u2019t be helpful at all, that it was a traumatic experience, that I think it\u2019s a reasonable, I think I can take a reasonable inference, nobody likes getting arrested for DWI.\u201d The court further stated that the fact that \u201ca person would say, I don\u2019t want this, can I get out of it, I\u2019ve got a lot going on in my life,\u201d after being arrested under such circumstances, was not relevant to prove that that person committed suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">It is ordinarily within the sound discretion of the trial court to determine the admissibility of evidence. <em>See Sifrit v. State, </em>383 Md. 116, 128, 857 A.2d 88 (2004); <em>Conyers v. State, </em>354 Md. 132, 176, 729 A.2d 910, <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 910, 120 S.Ct. 258, 145 L.Ed.2d 216 (1999); <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 5-104(a) (stating the \u201c[p]reliminary questions concerning ... the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court\u201d). Thus, a trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling should not be disturbed absent error or a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Conyers, </em>354 Md. at 176, 729 A.2d 910. Reversal is only required if \u201cthe evidence is plainly inadmissible under a specific rule or principle of law or there is a clear showing of an abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>of discretion.\u201d <em>Merzbacher v. State, </em>346 Md. 391, 405, 697 A.2d 432 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">Appellant primarily relies on <em>Case, supra, </em>118 Md.App. 279, 702 A.2d 777. There, Case conceded on appeal that the evidence was sufficient to show that he broke into his former girlfriend\u2019s home and \u201ccaused her death by shooting her in the head with a handgun he had stolen from his cousin the day before.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 282, 702 A.2d 777. Case raised several issues on appeal, including a claim that the court erred in admitting evidence that the victim made statements indicating that she feared Case. <em>Id. </em>at 283, 702 A.2d 777. We disagreed, observing that the defense theory was that the victim invited Case to her home and that the gun went off by accident. <em>Id. </em>Under these circumstances, we concluded that \u201cthe victim\u2019s state of mind was of significant consequence to the issue of whether she had invited appellant into her home and had voluntarily positioned herself close enough to him that she would become the victim of an accidental shooting.\u201d <em>Case, </em>118 Md.App. at 284, 702 A.2d 777 (citing Maryland Rule 5-401).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Appellant seeks to expand the holding of <em>Case </em>to instances where the \u201cissue is suicide or homicide.\u201d Notwithstanding the distinction that there was no dispute in <em>Case </em>that the appellant there was the shooter, we need not decide whether <em>Case </em>should be expanded because we agree with the trial court that the evidence was too remote and was not reliable circumstantial evidence of McQueen\u2019s state of mind at the time of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The trial court based its decision on <em>Robinson, </em>66 Md.App. 246, 503 A.2d 725, and we agree that case is instructive. In that case, the appellant shot the victim on September 3, 1984. <em>Id. </em>at 248, 503 A.2d 725. After the State introduced evidence from an owner of a gun shop that the appellant bought a gun on August 4, 1984, the defense sought to elicit whether appellant told the gun shop owner why she bought the gun. <em>Id. </em>at 252, 503 A.2d 725. The trial court sustained the State\u2019s objections to these questions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>On appeal, we considered whether the evidence should have been admitted under the common law \u201cstate of mind\u201d exception to the rule against hearsay. <em>Id. </em>at 256, 503 A.2d 725.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We explained that this exception \u201cembraces two subspecies: 1) a declaration of present mental or emotional state to show a state of mind or emotion in issue, and 2) a declaration of intention offered to show subsequent acts of [the] declarant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 257, 503 A.2d 725.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">We then observed that the mental state at issue in <em>Robinson </em>was whether the gun was fired accidentally or was fired with a malicious intent. <em>Id. </em>The trial court excluded the evidence about whether appellant told the gun shop owner why she purchased the gun a month before the shooting on the grounds of: (1) lack of relevance due to remoteness; and, (2) lack of trustworthiness. <em>Id. </em>We agreed that the evidence was properly excluded under either of those rationales. <em>Id. </em>at 257-58, 503 A.2d 725. On the issue of remoteness, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqc-dedup-0\">Since, however, the duration of states of mind or emotion varies with the particular attitudes or feelings at issue and with the cause, it is reasonable to require as a condition of invoking the continuity notion that the declaration mirror a state of mind which, in light of all the circumstances including proximity in time, has some probability of being the same condition existing at the material time. Where there is room for doubt, the matter should be left to the discretion of the trial judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 258, 503 A.2d 725 (citation omitted); <em>see also Purviance v. State, </em>185 Md. 189, 198, 44 A.2d 474 (1945) (\u201cThe question of excluding evidence because of remoteness rests largely in the sound discretion of the trial judge\u201d). <em>Cf. McCray v. State, </em>305 Md. 126, 140-141, 501 A.2d 856 (1985) (\u201c[E]vidence of declarations of a plan, design or intention presently entertained by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>the declarant is, subject to the usual limitations as to remoteness in time and apparent sincerity common to all declarations of mental state, admissible when offered as evidence that the design was carried out by acts or omissions of the declarant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">As in <em>Robinson, </em>McQueen\u2019s statement in early August 2006 as to his state of mind did not go directly to show anything about his state of mind on September 26, 2006, the night he sustained a gunshot wound to his head. Moreover, even if there were \u201croom for doubt,\u201d we are persuaded that the matter was appropriately left to the discretion of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Additionally, as in <em>Robinson, </em>there still \u201cloom[s] the insurmountable evidentiary hurdle of untrustworthiness.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>66 Md.App. at 260, 503 A.2d 725. As we stated, \u201cwith respect to this and any other spontaneous declaration, there must be assurances of reliability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, \u201csuch declarations, \u2018must appear to have been made in a natural manner and not under circumstances of suspicion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Here, the trial court specifically addressed the trustworthiness of the statements when it stated: \u201cI find there\u2019s just not one scintilla of evidence to suggest that the reaction to being arrested for a serious charge and comments made during that process was somehow related to any notions of suicide.\u201d We discern neither error nor abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s ruling, and we concur that the statements were too remote and untrustworthy to the fact sought to be proved, <em>i.e., </em>that McQueen committed suicide because he was somehow distraught, in whole or in part, about the prior arrest for driving under the influence or while intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Further, we agree that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in this case. In criminal cases, \u201cerror is harmless if a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict.\u201d <em>State v. Blackwell, </em>408 Md. 677, 698, 971 A.2d 296 (2009) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number><em>also Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976) (error will be harmless when reviewing court, upon independent review, is able to declare a belief beyond a reasonable doubt that there is no reasonable possibility that the error contributed to the verdict); <em>Clark v. State, </em>140 Md.App. 540, 565, 781 A.2d 913 (2001) (error for appellate purposes \u201cmay not be predicated upon a ruling that admits or excludes evidence unless the party is prejudiced by the ruling\u201d (citing Md. Rule 5-103(a))), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 Md. 527, 796 A.2d 695 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Initially, we note that the State contends that the omission of Officer Hegger\u2019s testimony was harmless because several witnesses testified that McQueen was not distraught or upset about the prior arrest in Georgia. That there was contradictory evidence of the decedent\u2019s good state of mind does not render omission of Officer Hegger\u2019s testimony harmless. Instead, any error was harmless because there was ample other evidence which permitted the jury to consider whether McQueen\u2019s death was, in fact, a suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">As appellant\u2019s counsel notes elsewhere in his brief, the blood spatter evidence was \u201cpivotal in this case.\u201d One of the defense experts, Professor MacDonnell, opined that McQueen\u2019s right arm was upright and above shoulder level at the moment of impact. The jury could rationally consider whether McQueen was holding the gun at that point based on this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Another defense expert, Dr. Di Maio, clearly testified that McQueen died \u201cas the result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound; that this case is a suicide.\u201d Even Dr. Allan conceded that contact gunshot wounds are common in suicides, and many people will not leave notes or announce to family members that they are considering suicide. There was also little evidence suggesting a conflict between McQueen and appellant, especially on the night in question. Finally, the jury heard, through appellant\u2019s statement, that it was appellant\u2019s opinion that McQueen \u201ckilled himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Thus, there was a sufficient basis for the jury to determine whether McQueen died at his own hands or at the hands of appellant. Indeed, we note that during jury selection, the jury was asked if they, or a family member, had ever attempted suicide, and twenty-one prospective jury members responded affirmatively to the question. The defense theory was clear, and exclusion of the evidence that the victim had been arrested for drunk driving one month before the shooting was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Appellant next contends that the court erred in propounding an instruction on voluntary intoxication, over defense objection, because it was not generated by the evidence. Appellee counters that the instruction was generated and that it was not error for the court to give the instruction over appellant\u2019s objection. While we agree with appellant that the instruction was not generated by the evidence, we also hold that the instructional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">At the conclusion of all the evidence, the State requested the court to give the pattern voluntary intoxication instruction. The State argued that a State\u2019s witness, Lara Budeit, had testified that appellant was drunk when he called her at 11:30 p.m. on the night in question. Appellant\u2019s trial counsel objected, stating: \u201cWe\u2019re not asking for that.\u201d After the State responded, the court observed that there was no direct evidence that appellant was intoxicated, only that \u201caccording to that witness, but that\u2019s not evidence that he was drunk. That\u2019s evidence that that witness believed he was drunk.\u201d However, after noting the quantity of alcohol consumed, as well as the smoking of marijuana, the court ruled that there was \u201ca reasonable inference ... that a person was intoxicated...\"</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Appellant\u2019s defense counsel maintained that he was not asserting voluntary intoxication as a defense and that it was inappropriate to give the instruction over defense objection. Counsel directed the court to <em>Hardaway v. State, </em>317 Md. 160, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>562 A.2d 1234 (1989), a case where the Court of Appeals reversed because the trial court, over defense objection, instructed the jury that the defendant had a constitutional right not to testify and that no adverse inference should be drawn from the defendant\u2019s election of that right. The trial court in this case observed that <em>Hardaway </em>concerned a constitutional right, and that defense counsel was comparing \u201capples and hand grenades.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The State responded that <em>Evans v. State, </em>28 Md.App. 640, 722, 349 A.2d 300 (1975), supported its position that the voluntary intoxication instruction could be given over defense objection. In that case, this Court recognized that, ordinarily, \u201cthe defendant is obliged to start matters off by putting in some evidence of his defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 723, 349 A.2d 300. However, this Court also acknowledged that the prosecution could present evidence of an affirmative defense, and that, in such an instance, \u201cthe matter of defense is properly an issue though the defendant himself produces nothing further to support it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The prosecutor further analogized to <em>Hook v. State, </em>315 Md. 25, 553 A.2d 233 (1989), also a murder case concerning the defense of voluntary intoxication, where the Court of Appeals held it was error to permit the State to <em>not pros </em>a lesser included offense over defense objection. <em>Id. </em>at 42-44, 553 A.2d 233. The court accepted the analogy, stating that \u201c[n]o one can suggest that the evidence in this case doesn\u2019t generate that instruction,\u201d and therefore, the instruction was appropriate and would be given to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">In response, defense counsel contended that depraved heart murder and involuntary manslaughter were not lesser included offenses and that it would be inappropriate to give those instructions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The prosecutor responded that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to decide whether appellant acted with reckless disregard for human life in this case by putting a gun to the victim\u2019s head and pulling the trigger.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Thereafter, in addition to instructing the jury as to first degree murder, second degree specific intent murder and second degree murder with intent to commit serious bodily harm, the court gave the pattern instructions for second degree depraved heart murder and involuntary manslaughter \u2014 grossly negligent act. <em>See </em>Maryland State Bar Ass\u2019n, <em>Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions </em>4:17.8(A), (B), at 258-59 (2006) (\u201cMPJI-Cr\u201d). The court also gave an instruction on voluntary intoxication that substantially mirrored the pattern instruction for Voluntary Intoxication/Specific Intent.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Maryland Rule 4-325(c) requires that a trial court \u201cgive a requested instruction that correctly states the applicable law and that has not been fairly covered in other instructions.\u201d <em>General v. State, </em>367 Md. 475, 485, 789 A.2d 102 (2002). Pursuant to the Rule, a requested instruction must be given \u201c \u2018when the following three-part test has been met: (1) the instruction is a correct statement of law; (2) the instruction is applicable to the facts of the case; and (3) the content of the instruction was not fairly covered elsewhere in instructions actually given.\u2019 \u201d <em>LaPin v. State, </em>188 Md.App. 57, 69, 981 A.2d 34 (2009) (quoting <em>Dickey v. State, </em>404 Md. 187, 197-98, 946 A.2d 444 (2008)). As this Court has stated, \u201c[tjhis rule \u2018has been interpreted to require that a requested instruction be given only where there is evidence in the record to support it.\u2019\u201d <em>Flores v. State, </em>120 Md.App. 171, 193, 706 A.2d 628 (1998) (quoting <em>Hof v. State, </em>337 Md. 581, 612, 655 A.2d 370 (1995)); <em>accord Dishman v. State, </em>352 Md. 279, 292, 721 A.2d 699 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The issue is whether there was sufficient evidence to generate a voluntary intoxication instruction. It is well settled law in Maryland that \u201c[vjoluntary intoxication, although it will never be allowed to negate a general criminal intent, may, if sufficient, be found to have eroded a specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>intent.\u201d <em>Wieland v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 1, 32, 643 A.2d 446 (1994). The degree of intoxication required to negate specific intent, however, is substantial. <em>Shell v. State, </em>307 Md. 46, 61, 512 A.2d 358 (1986). In <em>State v. Gover, </em>267 Md. 602, 298 A.2d 378 (1973), the Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-4\">[Vjoluntary drunkenness can be a defense to a specific intent crime, but the degree of intoxication which must be demonstrated to exonerate a defendant is great. Evidence of drunkenness which falls short of a proven incapacity in the accused to form the intent necessary to constitute the crime merely establishes that the mind was affected by drink so that he more readily gave way to some violent passion and does not rebut the presumption that a man intends the natural consequences of his act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 607-08, 298 A.2d 378; <em>see also Lewis v. State, </em>79 Md.App. 1, 12-13, 555 A.2d 509 (\u201c[T]he single fact that one has consumed what some may consider to be an inordinate amount of alcohol, standing alone, with no evidence as to the effect of that alcohol on the defendant, would not permit a jury reasonably to conclude that he had lost control of his mental faculties to such an extent as to render him unable to form the intent to murder or to maim\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>316 Md. 549, 560 A.2d 1118 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">In his brief to this Court, appellant cites several cases where courts in this State have addressed whether a trial court\u2019s decision <em>not </em>to give a voluntary intoxication instruction constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>See Lewis, </em>79 Md.App. at 8, 555 A.2d 509 (holding that trial court did not err in not giving a voluntary intoxication instruction); <em>Mock v. State, </em>2 Md.App. 771, 775, 237 A.2d 811 (1968) (upholding trial court\u2019s decision not to give a voluntary intoxication instruction); <em>see also State v. Gover, </em>267 Md. at 608, 298 A.2d 378 (affirming this Court\u2019s decision to remand for a new trial where, in a court trial, the court did not consider whether defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication negated the mens rea necessary to support the conviction). However, neither party has cited a controlling case concerning whether the giving of a voluntary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>intoxication instruction over defense objection amounts to reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">We have found a number of out-of-state cases where courts have held that it was not reversible error to give a voluntary intoxication instruction over defense objection where there was some evidence of intoxication. <em>See People v. Loden, </em>27 Ill.App.3d 761, 327 N.E.2d 58, 61 (1975) (concluding court did not err in giving intoxication instruction over defense objection because some evidence of defendant\u2019s intoxication had been introduced in an exculpatory manner); <em>State v.

State, </em>724 N.E.2d 592, 595 (Ind.2000) (holding, in a case where defense expert opined that defendant was suffering a mental disorder caused by cocaine intoxication at the time of the crime, that trial court erred in giving a specific voluntary intoxication instruction over defense objection, but the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">In addition to these cases, our research has led us to one case where the court found reversible error where there was an absence of sufficient evidence of intoxication, and the instruction was given over defense objection. <em>See State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number><em>Woods, </em>249 Neb. 138, 542 N.W.2d 410, 416 (1996) (reversing where trial court gave intoxication instruction over defense objection, because defendant made no attempt to rely on voluntary intoxication as a defense, where the evidence did not support a finding of intoxication, and where the instruction could have materially influenced the jury to reject defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">As he did in the trial court, appellant primarily relies on <em>Hardaway v. State, </em>317 Md. 160, 562 A.2d 1234 (1989). In <em>Hardaway, </em>defense counsel requested that the trial court not instruct the jury that Hardaway had a right not to testify and that no adverse inference should be drawn from his failure to testify. <em>Id. </em>at 161, 562 A.2d 1234. On appeal, Hardaway maintained that the instruction \u201cmay inadvertently harm a defendant by calling to the jury\u2019s attention the defendant\u2019s election not to testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163, 562 A.2d 1234. The State responded that the instruction could not be improper because it benefits the defendant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The Court of Appeals agreed with Hardaway and held that giving the instruction, over defense objection, amounted to reversible error. <em>Id. </em>at 169, 562 A.2d 1234. Recognizing that the instruction is a constitutional right of the defendant, the Court reasoned: \u201cSince the instruction is a right of the defendant, for his benefit, but because the beneficial effect of the instruction may be uncertain in some circumstances, it follows that the decision whether the instruction is given should lie with the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167, 562 A.2d 1234.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The Court of Appeals subsequently distinguished <em>Hardaway </em>in <em>Carter v. State, </em>366 Md. 574, 785 A.2d 348 (2001). In <em>Carter, </em>the Court ultimately reversed because: (a) the trial court abused its discretion in denying several motions for mistrial based on two instances during trial when the jury heard unsolicited other crimes evidence; and, (b) when the prosecutor referred to prejudicial facts not in evidence during closing argument. <em>Carter, </em>366 Md. at 590-92, 785 A.2d 348. While those were the bases for the Court\u2019s reversal, the Court also considered whether the trial court erred in giving caution<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>ary instructions following the unsolicited other crimes evidence, over defense objection. <em>Id. </em>at 582, 785 A.2d 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The petitioner maintained that \u201cthe defense should have an absolute right to refuse a curative instruction that carries the potential for highlighting the prejudicial information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On this issue, the Court disagreed with petitioner. <em>Id. </em>at 586-88, 785 A.2d 348. Concluding that <em>Hardaway, supra, </em>was distinguishable because that case involved the defendant\u2019s constitutional right against self-incrimination, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">In contrast, a defendant\u2019s right not to have evidence of prior bad acts admitted in evidence is derived from statute, evidentiary rules, and the common law. Unlike the situation in <em>Hardaway, </em>a defendant does not have an absolute right to a curative instruction regarding the inappropriate admission of prejudicial evidence. Correspondingly, a defendant does not have an absolute right to waive, reject, or veto the court\u2019s decision to give such an instruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-7\"><em>Carter, </em>366 Md. at 587, 785 A.2d 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Further, the Court observed that \u201ca curative instruction is not always for the sole benefit of the defendant. The public has an interest in the conduct of \u2018fair trials designed to end in just judgments,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c[j]ury instructions guide deliberations of the jury and benefit the State and the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Moreover, after stating that the curative instruction was designed to \u201cguide the jury in its receipt of the evidence,\u201d the Court also stated: \u201cWe are not dealing here with the waiver of a constitutional protection, but rather with the exercise of the trial court\u2019s duty to all participants in the criminal justice system-the defendant, the State, and the jury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">As the Court of Appeals did in <em>Carter, </em>we conclude that <em>Hardaway </em>is distinguishable from the instant case. Indeed, the Supreme Court has ruled that a voluntary intoxication defense is not a fundamental right protected by federal due process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-10\">In sum, not every widespread experiment with a procedural rule favorable to criminal defendants establishes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>fundamental principle of justice. Although the rule allowing a jury to consider evidence of a defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication where relevant to <em>mens rea </em>has gained considerable acceptance, it is of too recent vintage, and has not received sufficiently uniform and permanent allegiance, to qualify as fundamental, especially since it displaces a lengthy commonlaw tradition which remains supported by valid justifications today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-5\"><em>Montana v. Egelhoff, </em>518 U.S. 37, 51, 116 S.Ct. 2013, 135 L.Ed.2d 361 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Therefore, we conclude that whether the instruction was requested by the defense or the State is not determinative. As is settled with claims of instructional error, the issue is simply whether the instruction was an accurate statement of law and was generated by the evidence actually admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">In this case, there is no dispute concerning the instruction\u2019s accuracy. Instead, appellant\u2019s claim concerns whether the instruction was generated. Based on our review, we are persuaded that the evidence of intoxication does not rise nearly to the level necessary to generate a voluntary intoxication instruction. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">To be sure, there was evidence that appellant consumed a good deal of alcohol over the course of the evening. Starting at around 5:30 or 6:00 p.m., appellant drank a couple of beers and smoked some marijuana at home in the early evening prior to going to the VFW, where he drank five or six mixed drinks over a two to three hour period. After that, he drank one beer at the Village Caf\u00e9 before returning home between 11:30 p.m. and midnight. While the consumption of approximately nine alcoholic beverages over an approximately six hour span may seem like an inordinate amount of alcohol, that in itself, \u201cwith no evidence as to the effect of that alcohol on the defendant, would not permit a jury reasonably to conclude that he had lost control of his mental faculties to such an extent as to render him unable to form the intent to murder or to maim.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>79 Md.App. at 12-13, 555 A.2d 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Further, there was no clear evidence of the effect of the alcohol on the appellant or that appellant was intoxicated. Carl Davis, who saw appellant at the VFW, testified that he talked with and played pool with appellant and that appellant seemed to be having a good time. He did not testify that appellant seemed drunk. Likewise, Lynsay Dodd, who was working at the Village Caf\u00e9, testified that she saw appellant there, but she did not testify that appellant seemed drunk. Furthermore, Officer Gregg Knott, of the Montgomery County Police, testified that he did not detect a strong odor of alcohol on appellant\u2019s person when he transported him to the police station at around 2:30 a.m. At the police station, when asked how he felt, appellant replied that he felt \u201c[s]ober as I\u2019ve ever fucking been.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">The State\u2019s request for the voluntary intoxication instruction rested primarily on the testimony of Lara Budeit. At around 11:40 p.m. the evening of the shooting, appellant called Lara Budeit, a friend from high school. Budeit testified that when she picked up the phone, she believed appellant was \u201cdrunk dialing\u201d her. Budeit explained that \u201c[djrunk dialing is something you do when you\u2019re drunk and you call somebody you haven\u2019t talked to in a long time.\u201d During the phone conversation, appellant seemed upset, and both appellant and Budeit \u201cagreed that people suck.\u201d Budeit did not know what upset appellant, and, when asked whether he appeared intoxicated, Budeit responded, \u201cI, he repeated himself a couple times. He told me how great of a friend I was and he repeated that like five or six times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Appellant may also have called Deborah Hale at around 11:00 p.m. on the night in question. While Hale recalled telling the prosecutor and a detective during an interview that appellant had called her \u201cdrunk\u201d on a number of occasions, Hale could not remember if that occurred on September 25, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">This evidence was not sufficient to support the voluntary intoxication instruction in this case. Indeed, Budeit never specifically testified that appellant was intoxicated, responding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>only that he repeated himself and told her how great a friend she was. Additionally, while appellant had been \u201cdrunk\u201d when he called Hale on several occasions, Hale was not sure if appellant was drunk when he called her on the night in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Hence, even assuming an inference could be drawn that appellant was intoxicated, suffice it to say that no reasonable juror could infer from their testimony that appellant \u201cwas so intoxicated that he was robbed of his mental faculties or that he did not appreciate what he was doing.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>79 Md.App. at 8, 555 A.2d 509. Accordingly, the voluntary intoxication instruction was not generated by the evidence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Having concluded that the trial court erred in giving the instruction, we turn to whether that error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Hedgpeth v. Pulido, </em>555 U.S. 57, 129 S.Ct. 530, 532, 172 L.Ed.2d 388 (2008) (per curiam) (\u201charmless-error analysis applies to instructional errors so long as the error at issue does not categorically \u2018vitiate <em>all </em>the jury\u2019s findings\u2019 \u201d) (emphasis in original, citation omitted); <em>see also Alston v. State, </em>414 Md. 92, 107-08, 994 A.2d 896 (2010) (restating the standard for whether an error in a criminal case may be harmless); <em>Martin v. State, </em>165 Md.App. 189, 204, 885 A.2d 839 (2005) (concluding that even failure to instruct on an offense does not constitute structural error and any error is subject to harmless error review), <em>cert. denied, </em>391 Md. 115, 892 A.2d 478 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">As we have indicated, we agree with appellant\u2019s suggestion that the evidence in this case did not generate a voluntary intoxication instruction. Implicit in this conclusion is that appellant was <em>not </em>so intoxicated that he could <em>not </em>form a specific intent to commit the charged crimes, including the first degree murder count. Given this, it is questionable how the voluntary intoxication instruction prejudiced the defense. As a matter of fact, appellant was acquitted of first degree murder, second degree specific intent murder, and second degree murder with intent to inflict serious bodily harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Moreover, the instruction did not state that the jury <em>must </em>find appellant guilty of depraved heart murder based on the appellant\u2019s intoxication. Instead, the jury simply was instructed that they \u201cshould <em>consider </em>depraved heart murder.\u201d (emphasis added). That charge was properly submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Looking to the indictment, the first count charged appellant with the murder of McQueen, using the short form authorized by Md.Code (2002, 2010 Supp.), \u00a7 2-208 of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d). Charging appellant under that statutory form was sufficient to also charge appellant with second degree murder. <em>See Dishman, </em>352 Md. at 289-90, 721 A.2d 699 (reaffirming that a short form indictment \u201calleging first degree murder also charges second degree murder and manslaughter\u201d) (emphasis omitted); <em>see also Blackwell v. State, </em>278 Md. 466, 476, 365 A.2d 545 (1976) (\u201cIn first degree murder indictments filed pursuant to this provision, it is well settled that murder in the second degree and manslaughter are lesser included offenses\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 918, 97 S.Ct. 2183, 53 L.Ed.2d 229 (1977); <em>State v. Evans, </em>278 Md. 197, 199 n. 1, 362 A.2d 629 (1976) (\u201cUnder such an indictment the accused could be found guilty of the lesser offenses of murder in the second degree and manslaughter\u201d); <em>McMillan v. State, </em>181 Md.App. 298, 351, 956 A.2d 716 (\u201c[Appellant\u2019s indictment, which conformed in every relevant way with the statutory form specified in C.L. \u00a7 2-208, invested the circuit court with jurisdiction to try him for murder of any variety\u2014 including felony-murder\u201d), <em>cert. granted, </em>406 Md. 744, 962 A.2d 370 (2008).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Appellant\u2019s position appears to be that he wanted the jury to decide simply whether McQueen died of a homicide or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>a suicide, \"without any consideration of whether appellant\u2019s voluntary intoxication negated his mental state to some degree. Appellant, in effect, wanted the jury to make an \u201call or nothing\u201d choice. But, it is clear that a trial court may instruct on an uncharged lesser offense, even over defense objection. <em>See Hagans v. State, </em>316 Md. 429, 455, 559 A.2d 792 (1989) (holding that convictions on uncharged lesser included offenses were proper, where prosecutor agreed with trial court\u2019s decision to instruct the jury on those offenses over defense counsel\u2019s objection); <em>see also Smith v. State, </em>412 Md. 150, 170, 985 A.2d 1204 (2009) (stating that the decision to submit an uncharged lesser included offense \u201cpresents an important choice for <em>both </em>parties: whether to submit an uncharged lesser included offense to the jury or hope that the jury will choose the desired result when it has an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 choice\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 638, 646, 602 A.2d 255 (1992) (\u201cthe trial judge, <em>on the request of either party, </em>must (1) properly instruct the jury on a lesser included offense fairly raised by the evidence; and (2) permit the jury to return a verdict on that offense\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">When the State asked the court to instruct the jury on depraved heart murder, the trial court could charge the jury to consider that offense, even over defense objection. Thus, to the extent appellant was concerned about the possibility of a compromise verdict, that possibility existed regardless of the voluntary intoxication instruction. Accordingly, we are not persuaded that appellant was prejudiced by the voluntary intoxication instruction under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Furthermore, we are convinced that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict in this case. As the Court of Appeals has recognized \u201c[d]epraved heart murder does not require an intent to kill.\u201d <em>Dishman, </em>352 Md. at 298, 721 A.2d 699. Instead, \u201c[d]epraved heart murder requires that the \u2018defendant ... commit an act imminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved and malignant heart regardless of human life and fatally bent on mischief.... He is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>indifferent as to whether death results, or he may even hope that it will not result.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Here, on September 25, 2006, starting at around 5:30 or 6:00 p.m., appellant and McQueen began socializing together, and that included smoking marijuana as well as drinking alcoholic beverages, up until at least 11:00 p.m. Appellant gave three different versions of the ensuing events to the police. In the first version, he denied being in the apartment when McQueen was shot, and denied that there was a gun in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">In the second version, appellant maintained that he was not present at the time of the shooting, but admitted that his own .38 Smith and Wesson handgun was on the floor near McQueen\u2019s hands when appellant discovered him. Upon finding McQueen dead, appellant left the apartment and threw the gun and the bullets in Lake Needwood. It was only after he disposed of the gun in this manner that appellant finally called 9-1-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">In appellant\u2019s third version, he finally admitted that he was, in fact, inside the apartment at the time of the shooting. According to this version, appellant took out the loaded .38 handgun, and placed it within reach of McQueen before appellant went to the bathroom. While he was in the bathroom, appellant heard the gunshot and then emerged to find McQueen bleeding from a gunshot wound to the head. Not knowing what to do, appellant first decided to dispose of the gun. After he returned from the lake, and after contemplating putting a different gun in McQueen\u2019s hands, appellant finally called 9-1-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">When police arrived at around 1:00 a.m. on September 26, 2006, appellant was found outside the apartment, crying and yelling, \u201cHe\u2019s dead. He\u2019s dead.\u201d Appellant had a considerable amount of blood on his hands, face, shirt, and shoes, and the parties agreed that this blood tested positive for the presence of blood DNA from McQueen.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">A significant amount of ammunition was recovered from appellant\u2019s car. Additionally, both appellant\u2019s and McQueen\u2019s hands tested positive for gunshot residue. The State\u2019s foren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>sic pathologist, Dr. Allan, concluded that, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, the manner of death in this case was homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">While there was a considerable amount of expert testimony in this case, the jury could have chosen to believe the State\u2019s blood spatter expert, Dr. William Vosburgh, who concluded that appellant\u2019s shoe created a void at the top of a blood stain on the carpet. Dr. Vosburgh also opined that appellant\u2019s hand produced a void on the carpet \u201cthat [was] in the way at that moment getting blood cast upon it, and a spray of blood going between the [fingers].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Further, the jury heard appellant\u2019s statement that he told his \u201cbest friend,\u201d presumably McQueen, he shot a twelve-year-old boy in Iraq, and that McQueen recoiled from that revelation. The jury also learned that appellant had sought treatment at Walter Reed Hospital because he was \u201cdepressed and disillusioned,\u201d but was turned away because he was not active in the Army at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">There was also evidence before the jury about incidents where appellant had been careless with firearms, including accounts that appellant: (1) left a loaded M-4 rifle in an unsafe position while on patrol in a Humvee in Iraq; and, (2) sat down next to a fellow Ranger at a party at appellant\u2019s home and began loading an automatic pistol while that pistol was pointed at his friend\u2019s leg. In addition, this same fellow Ranger thought appellant was \u201c[l]ess than honest\u201d and was known to embellish the truth. And, according to a Chief Warrant Officer stationed with appellant at Fort Benning, Georgia, appellant had a reputation for telling tales and was known to lie. Considering all this, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to have convicted appellant of the second-degree depraved heart murder of McQueen.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Finally, we address appellant\u2019s contention that he was denied his due process right to present a defense because the voluntary intoxication instruction undermined his theory of the case that the victim\u2019s wounds were self-inflicted. We have been unable to find, nor have we been directed to, any place in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>the record where defense counsel raised this specific constitutional due process claim now being asserted on appeal. Accordingly, we conclude these grounds are not preserved for our review. See Md. Rule 8-131(a) (\u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court .... \u201d); <em>see also Robinson v. State, </em>404 Md. 208, 217-18, 946 A.2d 456 (2008) (declining to consider appellant\u2019s constitutional issue, raised for the first time on appeal); <em>Klauenberg v. State, </em>355 Md. 528, 541, 735 A.2d 1061 (1999) (observing that, when specific grounds are given for an objection, the objecting party may not raise other grounds on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Moreover, even if preserved, we again note that a voluntary intoxication defense is not a fundamental right protected by federal due process. <em>See Montana v. Egelhoff, </em>518 U.S. at 51, 116 S.Ct. 2013. Additionally, while the State did refer during closing argument to the fact that appellant had been drinking on the night of the shooting, we note that defense counsel also relied on the drinking and marijuana use to explain his reactions after McQueen was shot. Counsel argued that appellant was \u201cthinking, oh my God, I have marijuana here; it\u2019s my mother\u2019s gun. I brought the gun into the house. I didn\u2019t protect my friend; we were drunk. Or at least Michael was drunk. I just joined the reserves. They\u2019re not going to believe me. There\u2019s no witnesses.\u201d Defense counsel then continued that appellant just reacted, but that \u201che reacts in a terribly unfortunate way ...\u201d Based on this, we are not convinced that giving a voluntary intoxication instruction over defense objection fundamentally denied appellant his due process right to a fair trial or his right to present a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Appellant next challenges the court\u2019s decision to admit McQueen\u2019s statement to Ronnie McKay that \u201cGary is not right in the head\u201d on the grounds that it was hearsay. Appellant also asserts that the court erred in allowing evidence of this statement during the redirect examination of Dr. Allan.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>The State disputes appellant\u2019s contention that the statement was admitted during Dr. Allan\u2019s testimony, and that, in any event, the prosecutor\u2019s question about the statement was a proper response to evidence introduced by the defense during cross-examination. The State further responds that the trial court properly exercised its discretion because the statement was not admitted for its truth, but instead was admissible to rebut appellant\u2019s claims that there were no problems between himself and McQueen.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">In reply, appellant agrees that, when Ronnie McKay initially testified to the statement, it was not offered for its truth. However, appellant maintains that the State\u2019s questioning of Dr. Allan was prejudicial because the purpose of the question \u201cwas to associate the statement with the alleged motive of Appellant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">We begin where the parties apparently agree, that is, whether the statement McQueen made to McKay constituted nonhearsay. During appellant\u2019s opening statement, appellant\u2019s counsel suggested that McQueen and appellant were \u201cgood friends,\u201d were \u201cloyal Army ranger buddies,\u201d \u201cprotected each other,\u201d \u201cnever, never had a fight, let alone an argument\u201d and that \u201cGary Smith would never hurt Mike.\u201d This theme continued throughout opening statement, and was also repeated during closing argument when counsel referred to the victim as appellant\u2019s \u201cRanger buddy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">During trial, Ronnie McKay testified that he spoke with McQueen the day he died and that, during that conversation, McQueen told him \u201che can\u2019t live there no more. The apartment he lived in. Because he said, you know, Gary is not right in the head.\u201d The court admitted this testimony, over defense objection, because defense counsel had argued in opening statement that \u201cthere was no evidence of a problem\u201d between appellant and McQueen.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Hearsay is defined as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Md. Rule 5-801(c). \u201cIf the declaration is not a statement, or if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>it is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, it is not hearsay and it will not be excluded under the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>Parker v. State, </em>408 Md. 428, 436, 970 A.2d 320 (2009) (citation omitted); <em>see also Conyers, </em>354 Md. at 158, 729 A.2d 910 (\u201cAn out-of-court statement is admissible if it is not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted or if it falls within one of the recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule\u201d). We agree that the statement was not admitted for its truth, but instead was relevant to appellant\u2019s claims that there were no problems between appellant and McQueen.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Turning to whether the court erred by again admitting evidence of this statement during the redirect examination of Dr. Allan, we begin by observing that, on cross-examination, Dr. Allan was asked if she received any information in this case \u201cthat there was any motive on the part of Mr. Smith to kill his friend.\u201d Dr. Allan agreed that she had not received any such information.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Thereafter, during redirect examination, the State began to ask Dr. Allan whether she knew about McKay\u2019s statement. The court overruled defense counsel\u2019s objection to this question, noting that the issue of motive was raised by the defense. Dr. Allan then testified that she was not aware of McQueen informing McKay that \u201cthe day of this incident, within 24 hours, that the defendant was messed up in the head and that he, Michael McQueen, had to get out of that place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">We conclude that the issue was properly left to the trial court\u2019s discretion. As the Court of Appeals has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad6\">\u201cAny competent evidence which explains, or is a direct reply to, or a contradiction of, material evidence introduced by the accused may be produced by the prosecution in rebuttal.\u201d <em>Lane v. State, </em>226 Md. 81, 90, 172 A.2d 400 (1961) (emphasis added). It is equally well settled that the State\u2019s case-in-chief may include \u201crebuttal\u201d evidence to which the defense has \u201copened the door,\u201d either during opening statement, or through cross-examination of a State\u2019s witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-8\"><em>Johnson v. State, </em>408 Md. 204, 226, 969 A.2d 262 (2009); <em>see also State v. Booze, </em>334 Md. 64, 70, 637 A.2d 1214 (1994) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>(stating that rebuttal evidence is admissible where it \u201cexplains, or is a direct reply to, or a contradiction of, any new matter that has been brought into the case by the accused\u201d); <em>Hyman v. State, </em>158 Md.App. 618, 631, 857 A.2d 1166 (\u201cRebuttal evidence is within a trial court\u2019s sound discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal unless there is an abuse of discretion\u201d (citing <em>Booze, </em>334 Md. at 68, 637 A.2d 1214)), <em>cert. denied, </em>384 Md. 449, 863 A.2d 998 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">By asking Dr. Allan about motive during cross-examination, the door was opened for the State to ascertain whether Dr. Allan knew of McQueen\u2019s statement to McKay. As the evidence was properly admissible, there also was no error when the State commented on this evidence during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Finally on this issue, appellant also contends that the court erred in not permitting him to issue a body attachment for McKay when he failed to appear as a defense witness during the defense\u2019s case. The decision whether to issue a body attachment is clearly a matter of discretion. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4-267(b) (stating that \u201c... the court <em>may </em>order the issuance of a body attachment of a witness ...\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>see also Cross v. State, </em>144 Md.App. 77, 94, 796 A.2d 145 (concluding trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that witnesses were unavailable, and stating that it was not surprising that State was reluctant to incarcerate witnesses under Md. Rule 4-267(a), because \u201cincarcerating witnesses should be done only when absolutely necessary\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>369 Md. 180, 798 A.2d 552 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">We have reviewed the record and the arguments of counsel and we conclude there was neither error nor abuse of discretion in this instance. We note that appellant\u2019s counsel conceded that he was in possession of McKay\u2019s statement when McKay was subjected to cross-examination. Further, the court found that defense counsel did not comply with the time requirements for filing a subpoena to secure McKay\u2019s attendance as a defense witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Additionally, considering that defense counsel wanted to explore what McKay thought McQueen meant by the statement that \u201cGary is not right in the head,\u201d we agree -with the trial court\u2019s assessment that the evidence called for speculation. We are also persuaded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by sustaining an objection when defense counsel later attempted to elicit similar evidence concerning what McKay thought McQueen meant through another witness, Detective Reilly.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Appellant next contends that the trial court erred in limiting his cross-examination of the State\u2019s blood stain expert, Dr. Vosburgh, by precluding inquiry about Dr. Vosburgh\u2019s prior testimony in a number of unrelated cases, because that prior testimony tended to establish bias, as well as inconsistent statements. The State disagrees. We hold that the trial court properly exercised its discretion on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Prior to trial, appellant filed a motion in limine to permit cross-examination of Dr. Vosburgh concerning his expert testimony in <em>State v. Albert Givens, </em>K-1992-02270, in Anne Arun-del County. During a hearing on that motion, defense counsel proffered that Dr. Vosburgh performed a presumptive blood test on the alleged murder weapon in <em>Givens, </em>and that test came back negative. Five days later, Dr. Vosburgh again tested the alleged weapon and this test came back positive. At Givens\u2019 first trial, Dr. Vosburgh only testified concerning the positive result. The negative result was not disclosed to the defense until shortly before Givens\u2019s retrial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The motions court accepted the proffer, but found that this failed to establish that Dr. Vosburgh purposefully concealed potentially exculpatory evidence. The court also noted that the information may not have come into evidence in the first trial simply because defense counsel there may not have asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Dr. Vosburgh about other tests he performed on the alleged murder weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">During this same motions hearing, appellant\u2019s counsel also wanted to ask Dr. Vosburgh about his testimony in another Anne Arundel County murder trial, <em>State v. Scotland Williams, </em>02K980000675. According to counsel\u2019s proffer, in that case, Dr. Vosburgh testified \u201cto a reasonable degree of certainty that by looking at certain cells you can tell the race of the cell.\u201d This evidence was excluded from the retrial in the <em>Williams </em>case because the trial court there ruled there was no basis for Dr. Vosburgh\u2019s opinion. Appellant\u2019s counsel in this case then argued that he should be able to cross-examine Dr. Vosburgh on this other case as it tended to establish bias. The court ultimately denied the motions, but ruled that these issues could be addressed again during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">During trial, Dr. Vosburgh testified concerning his experience, training and education, including his expertise in the field of blood stain pattern analysis. Defense counsel then extensively examined Dr. Vosburgh through voir dire of the proffered field. During a bench conference, defense counsel reminded the court that he wanted to be able to question Dr. Vosburgh about these other cases, and the court indicated it could be brought up later after the expert was accepted. Dr. Vosburgh was accepted as an expert in the analysis of blood stain patterns.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">At the conclusion of Dr. Vosburgh\u2019s direct examination, and after the jury was excused, defense counsel renewed his motion to be permitted to inquire about Dr. Vosburgh\u2019s prior testimony in the <em>Givens </em>case. As clarified by the trial court, defense counsel wanted to examine Dr. Vosburgh on the fact that he did not disclose arguably exculpatory information to the prosecutor in Givens\u2019s first murder trial, <em>ie., </em>that one of two blood tests on the murder weapon came back negative. Defense counsel maintained that he should be permitted to question Dr. Vosburgh about the <em>Givens </em>case as it went to the issue of bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>The State responded by suggesting that Dr. Vosburgh\u2019s examinations in the <em>Givens </em>case were akin to not finding a fingerprint on a car bumper, then going back and finding a positive fingerprint on the steering wheel. Summarizing the State\u2019s argument, the fact that Dr. Vosburgh did not disclose that the first test of the murder weapon was negative, but did disclose that a subsequent test was a weak positive, was not exculpatory. The trial court denied defense counsel\u2019s request to examine Dr. Vosburgh about the <em>Givens </em>case, and rejected defense counsel\u2019s apparent suggestion that Dr. Vosburgh was being somehow \u201cdeceptive or deceitful\u201d in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Defense counsel also raised Dr. Vosburgh\u2019s opinion in the <em>Scotland Williams </em>case that he could tell a person\u2019s race from epithelial cells recovered from the crime scene. Defense counsel wanted to explore Dr. Vosburgh\u2019s testimony at these two trials because this established a \u201cdereliction of the duty,\u201d which went \u201cbeyond the boundaries of accepted expert opinion,\u201d and which established \u201ca pattern or partiality to the prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The trial court disagreed, noting that even if an expert\u2019s opinion was unreliable, that did not establish that the expert would be biased in all other cases. After further argument, the court sustained the State\u2019s objection and ruled that it would not permit \u201cthis kind of a collateral attack on an expert witness or any other kind of witness and it\u2019s outside the scope of his direct examination clearly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Defense counsel then asked to be able to question Dr. Vosburgh about his testimony in <em>State v. Lucas, </em>held in Montgomery County, where Dr. Vosburgh gave a detailed reenactment of the crime scene.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Noting that Dr. Vosburgh agreed that it was not the best practice to do such reenactments, and that the prosecution in the <em>Lucas </em>case declined to offer that reenactment into evidence, defense counsel contended that he had established that Dr. Vosburgh has a \u201cpropensi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>ty to go beyond the boundaries of accepted practice in his field demonstrating a partiality to the State ...\u201d The court again disagreed, finding that there was no such pattern, and ruled that defense counsel could not cross-examine Dr. Vosburgh about the <em>Lucas </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Initially, we address appellant\u2019s contention that the court erred in Mmiting his cross-examination because Dr. Vosburgh\u2019s testimony in the other cases established that he was biased in favor of the State. \u201cCross-examination is a right guaranteed by the common law.\u201d <em>Myer v. State, </em>403 Md. 463, 476, 943 A.2d 615 (2008). Additionally, \u201c[t]he constitutional right of confrontation includes the right to cross-examine a witness about matters which affect the witness\u2019s bias, interest or motive to testify falsely.\u201d <em>Marshall v. State, </em>346 Md. 186, 192, 695 A.2d 184 (1997) (citation omitted); <em>accord Martinez v. State, </em>416 Md. 418, 428, 7 A.3d 56 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The Court of Appeals has stated that \u201c[t]he scope of cross-examination lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Pantazes v. State, </em>376 Md. 661, 681, 831 A.2d 432 (2003) (citations omitted). Discretion is exercised by balancing \u201cthe probative value of an inquiry against the unfair prejudice that might inure to the witness. Otherwise, the inquiry can reduce itself to a discussion of collateral matters which will obscure the issue and lead to the fact finder\u2019s confusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Cox, </em>298 Md. 173, 178, 468 A.2d 319 (1983)); <em>see also Smith v. State, </em>371 Md. 496, 504, 810 A.2d 449 (2002) (explaining that evidence of bias is always relevant and a proper subject of impeachment, but that these propositions are subject to Maryland Rules 5-402 and 5-403).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Additionally, \u201can expert witness may be questioned on cross-examination about compensation received for testifying, as well as about the expert\u2019s history of employment as an expert witness, in order to reveal bias or interest in the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Goldberg v. Boone, </em>396 Md. 94, 116, 912 A.2d 698 (2006); <em>see also Scott v. State, </em>310 Md. 277, 294, 529 A.2d 340 (1987) (\u201cEvidence tending to show that an expert witness has frequently testified or otherwise been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>involved in litigation for one party directly relates to the weight a jury may give the testimony.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Here, Dr. Vosburgh was testifying to blood stains and blood spatter in connection with determining whether McQueen was a victim of a homicide or whether his death was a suicide. According to defense counsel\u2019s proffers, in <em>Givens, </em>the issue concerned Dr. Vosburgh\u2019s providing a positive result on an item of evidence, thus, arguably inculpating the defendant, but failing to disclose a negative result on that same item of evidence. While there is little doubt that this constituted a discovery violation in the <em>Givens </em>case, considering there was no suggestion that this omission was purposeful or intentional, this is insufficient to show that Dr. Vosburgh was biased in favor of one side or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">As for the <em>Williams </em>case, again according to the proffer, Dr. Vosburgh apparently gave an opinion that he could determine the race of an individual based on an examination of epithelial cells recovered from the crime scene. Even assuming, arguendo, that this opinion may be of questionable reliability, again we fail to see how this opinion establishes a bias in favor of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Finally, as for the <em>Lucas </em>case, that case involved a detailed reenactment of the crime scene, a reenactment that was not offered into evidence by the prosecution. That an expert tends to perform reenactments in the course of his work does not demonstrate bias.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">While appellant certainly could show that Dr. Vosburgh was biased in favor of one party or other, appellant\u2019s attempts to establish that Dr. Vosburgh was biased in favor of the State simply because of his conclusions and methodology from other unrelated cases falls short. As the Court of Appeals has explained: \u201cA judge must allow a defendant wide latitude to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>cross-examine a witness as to bias or prejudices, but the questioning must not be allowed to stray into collateral matters which would obscure the trial issues and lead to the factfinder\u2019s confusion.\u201d <em>Smallwood v. State, </em>320 Md. 300, 307-308, 577 A.2d 356 (1990) (citations omitted); <em>accord Martinez, supra, </em>416 Md. at 428, 7 A.3d 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">In addition to challenging the court\u2019s ruling on the grounds of bias, appellant also contends that Dr. Vosburgh\u2019s testimony in another case was inconsistent with his testimony at appellant\u2019s trial. During Dr. Vosburgh\u2019s cross-examination, defense counsel asked him to name a case in which he had seen blood emerging from a contact wound to the right or left temple, and Dr. Vosburgh replied that he saw that in the <em>Pantazes </em>case, where the final of three shots \u201cwas to the right temple and there was back spatter and blow back that occurred onto a mirror to the right of the victim in the final position in this case.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Later during cross-examination, defense counsel began to ask whether the <em>Pantazes </em>case also involved a contact wound. The State\u2019s objection was sustained, and, at the ensuing bench conference, defense counsel proffered that Dr. Vosburgh had testified in <em>Pantazes </em>that \u201cblood vaporizes upon a shot and create[s] a mist.\u201d Counsel also proffered that Dr. Vosburgh testified in that case that blood exits from the head in a starburst type pattern with a contact wound. The State responded that this was outside the scope and the testimony from that trial was \u201ccompletely out of context.\u201d The trial court agreed and sustained the State\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Appellant maintains on appeal that the court erred because this proffered evidence was inconsistent with Dr. Vosburgh\u2019s trial testimony here, specifically that \u201c[a]t maximum blood pressure from the wound, blood will eject the greatest distance away. At this greatest distance, this is only in the first moments after the shot is fired.\u201d We also observe that Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Vosburgh testified in this case that the projected blood \u201cwould come out immediately following as the wound has been created, blood pressure is present inside the head. It would immediately follow the exit of the gases from the wound tract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The State responds that there was no inconsistency because \u201c[b]oth of these statements may be true at the same time.\u201d Further, the State suggests that \u201cscientific evidence in the form of blood spatter is never going to be identical in two unrelated cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">This Court has stated that, \u201c[ujnder Rule 5-616(a)(1), \u2018the credibility of a witness may be attacked through questions asked of the witness, including questions that are directed at ... proving under Rule 5-613 that the witness has made statements that are inconsistent with the witness\u2019s present testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fields v. State, </em>168 Md.App. 22, 39-40, 895 A.2d 339, <em>aff'd, </em>395 Md. 758, 912 A.2d 637 (2006); <em>see also Hill v. Wilson, </em>134 Md.App. 472, 478-81, 760 A.2d 294 (2000) (upholding trial court\u2019s decision to permit impeachment of an expert witness with prior statements made in lectures and written documents).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">While resolving whether the testimony was inconsistent may have been left to the fact finder, we recognize that \u201cfp lrelimi-nary questions concerning ... the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court.\u201d Md. Rule 5-104(a); <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 5-611(a) (\u201cThe court shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to (1) make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment\u201d). In any event, we are persuaded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting cross-examination in this instance. <em>See Jackson v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 679, 725-26, 884 A.2d 694 (2005) (stating that, even where an appellate court might disagree with a ruling, the appellate court \u201cwill not presume to substitute its judgment for that of the trial court except in the rare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>case in which the trial judge has literally abused his discretion\u201d), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>390 Md. 501, 889 A.2d 418 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Finally, we are satisfied that the jury had sufficient evidence from which to assess any alleged bias or inconsistencies that may have affected Dr. Vosburgh\u2019s credibility. During voir dire of the witness, the jury learned extensive information about Dr. Vosburgh\u2019s experience, training and education, including his expertise in the field of blood stain pattern analysis. The jury heard that Dr. Vosburgh was currently Director of the Consolidated Forensic Laboratory for the District of Columbia. Prior to this, Dr. Vosburgh was employed as a forensic dentist with the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System at Dover Air Force Base, for two and a half years. And prior to that, Dr. Vosburgh had been employed by other government agencies, including as Director of the Forensic Division in the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department, where he was employed for six years, and as a forensic chemist employed for ten years by Anne Arundel County. The jury also learned, through examination by defense counsel, that Dr. Vosburgh had never testified in court with respect to blood stain pattern analysis for the defense. Through this voir dire, the jury could determine whether Dr. Vosburgh was biased in favor of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">In addition to questions concerning Dr. Vosburgh\u2019s expertise and professional background, during trial, Dr. Vosburgh was subject to extensive cross-examination about his conclusions in this case, including, but not limited to: questioning the experiments he performed; having him demonstrate precisely how he believed McQueen was shot; and, asking him to review photographs of the crime scene. He was also asked whether he formed his opinion after speaking with Detective Sean Reilly of the Montgomery County Police; if there was evidence of blood on appellant\u2019s right hand; if he knew of a certain study concerning over 100 cases of self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the head; whether the projected blood from the gunshot would have been on the hand of a person located in a certain position near the victim; and, whether there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>should have been more blood on the appellant\u2019s pants when the blood was projected from the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Dr. Vosburgh was also questioned about his conclusions concerning the stains in the carpet, including whether the patterns actually were formed by the presence of a hand. Dr. Vosburgh agreed that he did not examine the blood stained carpet before he provided his original report, and that he did not visit the crime scene. Finally, Dr. Vosburgh admitted that he did initially intend to submit an invoice for his work in this case, at the hourly rate of $250. However, he decided not to submit an invoice because of the difficulty of separating the time he worked on this case from other work he performed for the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">In addition to this direct impeachment of Dr. Vosburgh\u2019s opinions, it is more than clear that the defense experts disagreed with Dr. Vosburgh\u2019s conclusions in this case. Both defense experts were of the opinion that the \u201cv\u201d shaped void pattern that Dr. Vosburgh attributed to appellant\u2019s sneaker being on the carpet at the time of the initial bleeding could not have been made by appellant\u2019s sneaker because the void was \u201cv\u201d shaped, while the sneaker was rounded and would have left a void in a similar shape. Both defense experts examined the handprint on the rug and concluded that this was not a void caused by a hand being on the carpet at the time of the initial bleeding, as was Dr. Vosburgh\u2019s opinion, but rather, was made by blood being transferred from a bloody palm onto the rug. In sum, the jury had more than sufficient information to assess Dr. Vosburgh\u2019s credibility and his opinions, even without evidence concerning his testimony in several unrelated trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Appellant next asserts that he did not have notice of the substance of the opinions of a State\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Jonathan Arden, and that the trial court erred in permitting Dr. Arden to testify in rebuttal. The State responds that the record establishes that appellant had notice the State would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>call Dr. Arden, and that Dr. Arden\u2019s opinion was not in writing, but was based on a review of the transcript of Dr. Di Maio\u2019s testimony in this case. We conclude that, even if there were a discovery violation, the violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, the trial court properly exercised its discretion in permitting the rebuttal testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Appellant was notified prior to trial that the State might call Dr. Jonathan Arden as \u201can expert in forensic pathology in rebuttal.\u201d On the last day the jury heard evidence, defense counsel objected on the grounds that he had not received notice of the substance of Dr. Arden\u2019s testimony. After ascertaining that the State did not have a written opinion from Dr. Arden, the objection was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Thereafter, Dr. Arden testified to his qualifications as an expert. While renewing his objection at the end of this voir dire, defense counsel conceded that he was informed that Dr. Arden would testify this case was a homicide. Dr. Arden was accepted as an expert in forensic pathology.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Dr. Arden then testified that he reviewed a transcript of Dr. Di Maio\u2019s testimony from this case, as well as reports from the other experts. Dr. Arden did not have an opinion whether this case was a suicide, but he did have several opinions concerning Dr. Di Maio\u2019s findings. In sum, Dr. Arden opined that he thought Dr. Di Maio erred by not considering some of the blood spatter and blood transfer evidence in this case, and that he did not adequately consider the staged crime scene, <em>ie., </em>the fact that the gun was removed from the scene by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Thereafter, when Dr. Arden began to explain the source of his disagreement with Dr. Di Maio about the blood spatter evidence, defense counsel objected, asserting that they were not permitted to go into enough detail with Dr. Di Maio about the blood spatter evidence. The State disagreed with defense counsel\u2019s claim that Dr. Di Maio did not testify concerning the blood evidence in this case and argued that Dr. Arden\u2019s testimony was proper rebuttal. The court then reminded defense counsel of Dr. Di Maio\u2019s testimony concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>wound to the victim, his determination that the wound was self-inflicted, and agreed that Dr. Arden\u2019s testimony was a proper subject for rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">After the bench conference, Dr. Arden testified that he concluded that Dr. Di Maio did not correctly incorporate the blood pattern analysis into his determination that this was a self-inflicted wound. More specifically, Dr. Arden thought that it was critical to consider the blood stains on appellant\u2019s pant leg and shoe in determining where appellant was located at the time of the shooting, and that it was Dr. Arden\u2019s understanding that Dr. Di Maio did not consider these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Arden covered a variety of areas, including, but not limited to, when and how the blood in the \u201cv\u201d shaped void would have been deposited on the carpet. On rebuttal, Dr. Arden concluded that the amount of blood spatter on appellant\u2019s clothing and shoes was \u201cinconsistent with walking through that dripping for one second.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Initially, we consider appellant\u2019s claim that, although he had notice that Dr. Arden would testify, he was not informed of the substance of any oral reports Dr. Arden would provide at trial. Appellant primarily relies on <em>Hutchins v. State, </em>339 Md. 466, 663 A.2d 1281 (1995) and former Maryland Rule 4-263(b)(4), which requires the State to provide the defense with written reports made by experts consulted by the State, as well as the substance of their oral reports and conclusions. In the Court of Appeals\u2019s <em>Hutchins </em>opinion, although agreeing with this Court\u2019s finding in <em>Hutchins v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 640, 650, 647 A.2d 1271 (1994), that the State was required to disclose reports of experts which it had consulted, the Court of Appeals disagreed with this Court\u2019s finding that the failure was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Hutchins, </em>339 Md. at 480, 663 A.2d 1281.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>this Court\u2019s explanation of the provisions of Md. Rule 4-263(b)(4) remains instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">Rule 4-263(b)(4) is based on the recognition that the prosecutor is not always able to determine what is exculpatory or what is material to the defense. It avoids trial by ambush. If an agent of the State has consulted an expert, the defendant is entitled to disclosure of that expert\u2019s <em>conclusion.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">This disclosure obligation is easy to satisfy. It relieves the State of any obligation to determine what conclusions are exculpatory or material to the defense. It is limited to disclosure of \u201cany ... oral or written reports by (the expert) ... not the sum and substance of the (the expert\u2019s) proposed trial testimony.\u201d Moreover, it is applicable only to <em>conclusions </em>of experts who have actually been \u201cconsulted.\u201d A consultation involves a request by the State that the expert perform some task in order to reach a <em>conclusion.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"asp-dedup-0\"><em>Hutchins, </em>101 Md.App. at 649, 647 A.2d 1271 (citations omitted, emphasis added); <em>accord Canela v. State, </em>193 Md.App. 259, 311-12, 997 A.2d 793 (2010), <em>cert. granted, </em>416 Md. 272, 6 A.3d 904, No. 342, Sept. Term, 2010 (Oct. 20, 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Here, prior to calling Dr. Arden, the State simply informed the court and defense that Dr. Arden would be a rebuttal witness and that the State had not been provided with his opinions as of yet. On appeal, appellant contends that, \u201c[presumably, the State did not call Dr. Arden as a witness without having any idea as to what he would say.\u201d We do not disagree with this assertion. Therefore, at least at this point, we agree that the State violated Md. Rule 4 \u2014 263(b)(4) by not informing defense counsel of Dr. Arden\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">That, however, does not end our inquiry because even discovery violations may constitute harmless error. <em>See Williams v. State, </em>364 Md. 160, 169, 771 A.2d 1082 (2001) (\u201cIf the trial judge erred because the State did in fact violate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>discovery rule, we consider the prejudice to the defendant in evaluating whether such error was harmless\u201d); <em>see also Hutchinson v. State, </em>406 Md. 219, 227-228, 958 A.2d 284 (2008) (applying harmless error standard to a discovery violation and concluding that the error was not harmless); <em>Thanos v. State, </em>330 Md. 77, 96-97, 622 A.2d 727 (1993) (assuming that there were discovery violations which \u201cin fact surprised\u201d appellant, any violation was harmless in light of confession to murder and independent corroboration).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Appellant\u2019s primary complaint as to Dr. Arden\u2019s testimony concerns his opinions regarding the blood spatter evidence. However, immediately prior to such testimony, the State informed defense counsel that \u201cDr. Di Maio made a finding based upon the blood spatter. He\u2019s going to rebut his finding and also the blood spatter people ... \u201d. At this point, defense counsel explicitly knew the subject of Dr. Arden\u2019s testimony, and by implication, Dr. Arden\u2019s conclusion. Further, it is doubtful, given the circumstances of this case, that defense counsel was surprised by the proffered testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Indeed, this is not a case where blood spatter evidence suddenly was sprung on appellant on the last day of this two week trial. Clearly, this case was a battle of experts, both for the State and the defense, and defense counsel demonstrated a command of the subject matter throughout this long and hard-fought trial. As this Court has stated, \u201c[ajssuming that they should have been discovered pretrial, the appellant yearns for a sanction which is excessive.\u201d <em>Ross v. State, </em>78 Md.App. 275, 286, 552 A.2d 1345, <em>cert. denied, </em>316 Md. 365, 558 A.2d 1207 (1989); <em>see also Thomas v. State, </em>397 Md. 557, 572, 919 A.2d 49 (2007) (\u201cExclusion of evidence for a discovery violation is not a favored sanction and is one of the most drastic measures that can be imposed\u201d). The purpose of discovery is \u201cto prevent a defendant from being surprised. Its intention is to give a defendant the necessary time to prepare a full and adequate defense.\u201d <em>Ross, </em>78 Md.App. at 286, 552 A.2d 1345. It is unlikely that defense counsel was surprised by Dr. Arden\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>As for appellant\u2019s remaining contention that Dr. Arden\u2019s testimony was improper rebuttal, we are not persuaded. Appellant\u2019s claim is based on the prosecutor\u2019s question of Dr. Arden: \u201cDo you have an opinion as to Dr. Di Maio\u2019s failure to incorporate the blood pattern analysis correctly into his determination?\u201d Appellant asserts this was improper because \u201cDr. Di Maio was not permitted to testify as to how the blood spatter evidence factored into his opinion.\u201d Further, appellant contends that, when Dr. Di Maio attempted to discuss his findings with regard to the blood spatter evidence, the State\u2019s objection was sustained and the testimony was stricken from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">While the court did sustain an objection to some of Dr. Di Maio\u2019s testimony, Dr. Di Maio, in fact, offered a significant amount of testimony concerning blood spatter in this case. During Dr. Di Maio\u2019s direct examination, he was asked whether the analysis of \u201chow fast blood comes out of the head after a gunshot wound\u201d is the province of a forensic pathologist, his area of expertise, or of a blood spatter expert. Dr. Di Maio replied this was forensic pathology because the study of wound ballistics is usually performed by physicians. Dr. Di Maio then testified to the manner in which a contact gunshot wound creates pressure as the bullet enters the body, and how, as a result of that pressure and energy, \u201cblood and tissue then tends to be ejected out of the entrance hole ...\u201d He continued that, considering the wound in this case, \u201cthe blood and tissue comes out at random. It does not come out in a homogenous way.\u201d Further, the blood \u201cdoes not come out in an arc. It comes out purely by chance.\u201d Additionally, Dr. Di Maio commented that, \u201c[i]n this case, there\u2019s even more chance, because you don\u2019t have a round hole. You have an irregular hole, which means that there is even greater inconsistency in how the blood and the tissue is ejected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Dr. Di Maio also was asked about the absence of blood on McQueen\u2019s right hand, and indicated that did not matter \u201cbecause the majority of the times in contact wounds you do not get blood blown back on the hand.\u201d He further indicated blood was not present in approximately two-thirds of cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>under such circumstances. Dr. Di Maio also was permitted to testify, over the State\u2019s objection, that if someone touched the wound even briefly, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t see any evidence.\u201d Further, \u201cjust putting your fingers in there, you\u2019re not going to see imprints because there\u2019s blood in the hair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">In the final analysis, while the State did not disclose Dr. Arden\u2019s conclusion prior to that witness taking the stand, given that the subject matter concerning that conclusion was proffered before Dr. Arden offered any testimony on the subject, and given that blood spatter evidence was a significant portion of both the State\u2019s and the defense\u2019s case, any discovery violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, as the defense expert did offer testimony concerning blood spatter, Dr. Arden\u2019s testimony was proper rebuttal evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Appellant next asserts that the court erred in not granting a mistrial in response to certain argument by the prosecutor during closing argument. The State disagrees and contends that, even if improper, a mistrial would have been an extreme sanction that was not warranted in this instance. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">Towards the end of the State\u2019s rebuttal closing argument, the State suggested \u201cYou don\u2019t have to psychoanalyze Gary Smith. That\u2019s not on your verdict sheet. You don\u2019t have to ask the whys. I even told you in opening, most of these cases, they raise more questions than they answer. But that\u2019s not going to be on your verdict sheet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">The prosecutor continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-10\">It\u2019s been 18 months since Michael McQueen was buried. This defendant shot him. It\u2019s time for justice. Healing begins when justice occurs. And the only just verdict in this case, the only proper verdict in this case is to hold that person responsible for the physical evidence shows, no matter what experts you want to believe, that he was right there when he was shot. What your common sense and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>understanding shows that you don\u2019t stage a scene, you don\u2019t throw away a gun, you don\u2019t lie and lie and lie and lie to the police, unless you\u2019re guilty as sin. Leave the whys to Judge Johnson in the sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">At this point, defense counsel objected, and the objection was overruled. The State then concluded by asking the jury to return a verdict of guilty in this case. At a bench conference after these remarks, defense counsel moved for a mistrial and that motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The Court of Appeals has consistently stated that counsel is afforded considerable leeway in closing argument, and that regulation of closing arguments falls within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>See Mitchell v. State, </em>408 Md. 368, 380, 969 A.2d 989 (2009) (\u201cGenerally, counsel has the right to make any comment or argument that is warranted by the evidence proved or inferences therefrom\u201d) (quoting <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 412, 326 A.2d 707 (1974)). Although arguments must be limited to the issues in the case on trial, the evidence, and any reasonable inferences, counsel is allowed \u201cliberal freedom of speech.\u201d <em>Wilhelm, </em>272 Md. at 413, 326 A.2d 707. Improper closing argument remarks will only warrant reversal if they \u201cactually misled the jury or were likely to have misled or influenced the jury to the prejudice of the accused.\u201d <em>Spain v. State, </em>386 Md. 145, 158, 872 A.2d 25 (2005) (quoting <em>Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 431, 722 A.2d 887 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Even assuming that the prosecutor\u2019s singular statement during rebuttal was improper, we conclude it was not so prejudicial as to warrant the extreme remedy of a mistrial. Appellant primarily relies on <em>Fryson v. State, </em>17 Md.App. 320, 301 A.2d 211 (1973). In that case, the appellant was convicted of attempted robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon. <em>Id. </em>at 321, 301 A.2d 211. During closing argument, the prosecutor informed the jury during rebuttal closing argument that, \u201cif the appellant was found guilty, he would \u2018be put on probation,\u2019 and that the trial court has access to \u2018plenty of parole officers, and social workers and things like that.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>at 323, 301 A.2d 211. We stated that \u201c[sjuch remarks on the part of the prosecutor are highly prejudicial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 324, 301 A.2d 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In reaching this conclusion, we relied on <em>Shoemaker v. State, </em>228 Md. 462, 180 A.2d 682 (1962), wherein the Court of Appeals wrote that \u201cstatements with regard to parole in the context in which they were made here, we think, exceeded the limits of permissible comment by the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Fryson, </em>17 Md.App. at 324, 301 A.2d 211 (quoting <em>Shoemaker, </em>228 Md. at 468, 180 A.2d 682). Further, we noted that the Court of Appeals indicated that \u201c[rjeferences by a prosecutor to the right of appeal, the possibility of executive clemency and parole of a defendant,\u201d had been considered by many other jurisdictions and that the \u201cweight of authority are against the propriety of such arguments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we concluded that, \u201c[ujnder the circumstances of this case, the sustaining of an objection to the egregious remarks, standing alone, fell short of curing the deleterious effect that the ill-considered comments may have had on the jury.\u201d <em>Fryson, </em>17 Md.App. at 326, 301 A.2d 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\"><em>Fryson </em>is distinguishable from this case because, although the prosecutor herein stated \u201c[ljeave the whys to Judge Johnson in the sentencing,\u201d that remark was not akin to a promise to the jury that the defendant would be \u201cput on probation\u201d or given a particular lenient sentence in exchange for a guilty verdict. Likewise, we conclude that appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Johnson v. State, </em>325 Md. 511, 601 A.2d 1093 (1992), is similarly misplaced. There, the prosecutor informed the jury that, even if they found Johnson guilty, that was not the end of the legal process, because Johnson would have access to the appellate courts of this State, and possibly, the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>Johnson, </em>325 Md. at 513, 601 A.2d 1093. Those remarks were clearly improper as it was an \u201cattempt to put the responsibilities of the jurors on some other body.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 518, 601 A.2d 1093.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Moreover, under certain circumstances, a prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument responding to comments made by the defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>during its closing must be placed in context and may be entirely appropriate. <em>See Degren, </em>352 Md. at 431-32, 722 A.2d 887 (concluding that, while prosecutor\u2019s comments were \u201cunprofessional and injudicious,\u201d reversal was not required under the circumstances). Here, while most of the defense\u2019s closing argument focused on the scientific evidence in this case, defense counsel also attempted to explain why appellant gave the different version of events and \u201cwhy he did what he did with respect to the lake.\u201d Counsel stated: \u201cIs there any doubt in anybody\u2019s mind that Gary Smith is a paranoid individual? Okay? Let\u2019s say crazy paranoid. But he\u2019s a little paranoid.\u201d Counsel then reminded the jury about appellant\u2019s service overseas, then about the circumstances surrounding the crime scene, including the presence of marijuana and beer bottles, and that appellant reacted in \u201ca terribly unfortunate way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Thus, asking the jury to consider \u201cwhy\u201d appellant acted as he did was suggested by defense counsel during closing argument. The prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument suggesting that the jury need not consider the reasons why appellant may have shot McQueen in this case did not amount to reversible error. Thus, the trial court properly denied the motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Finally, appellant asserts that the trial court\u2019s questioning of Dr. Allan and Dr. MaeDonnell reinforced the State\u2019s theory of the case and denied him his right to a fair and impartial trial. The State responds that the limited questions of these two witnesses was merely an attempt \u201cto clarify arguably confusing testimony in a long and complicated case.\u201d Further, considering that the jury was instructed concerning inferences to be drawn from the court\u2019s questions, the State maintains that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">It is well settled that a judge may question witnesses during trial. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-614(b) (\u201cThe court may interro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>gate any witness. In jury trials the court\u2019s questioning must be cautiously guarded so as not to comment on the evidence or convey the court\u2019s opinion of the witness\u2019s credibility\u201d); <em>see also Diggs v. State, </em>409 Md. 260, 292, 973 A.2d 796 (2009) (\u201c[WJhile we agree with the court below that a judge presiding over a jury trial has the right to interrogate witnesses in an effort to clarify the issues, we stress that he should exercise this right sparingly\u201d) (citation omitted). This Court has stated that \u201c[t]he principal justification for a trial judge to inject himself or herself into the questioning of a witness is to clarify issues in the case.\u201d <em>Smith v. State, </em>182 Md.App. 444, 480, 957 A.2d 1139 (2008) In addition, \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s intervention may be particularly helpful in instances where relevant evidence has not been adduced by counsel or the evidence adduced is unclear or confusing.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>182 Md.App. at 481, 957 A.2d 1139.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Appellant\u2019s first allegation is that the court erred in asking Dr. Allan about the gunshot residue in this case. The court asked Dr. Allan, assuming that someone other than McQueen was in the room at the time of the shooting and then was tested hours later, whether those facts would affect the reliability of the GSR test. After Dr. Allan replied in the affirmative, defense counsel objected, but stated that he had no further questions based on the court\u2019s question.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">This question was a clarification of matters already before the jury. Dr. Allan had provided testimony about GSR during direct examination, including that testing of McQueen was done at the scene and, because the body had not been moved, there was no risk of contamination. Dr. Allan was also questioned about the GSR during cross-examination, where she explained that the fact that gunshot residue may be on a \u201cliving individual,\u201d presumably appellant, did not influence her opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Next, appellant takes issue with several questions the trial court asked of the defense expert, Professor MacDonnell. During Professor MacDonnell\u2019s voir dire, he testified that he had been accepted as an expert in blood stain pattern analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>in fourteen cases where the issue was whether the death was accident, suicide, or homicide. At the conclusion of his testimony, the trial court asked how many of those cases involved a situation where the gun was not found at the scene. Mac-Donnell could not recall but agreed that normally, in the case of suicide, \u201cthe gun is not going to go very far away, unless someone else moves it.\u201d The court then asked whether the presence of the gun would affect his opinion, and MacDonnell replied that \u201c[i]t would support it, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Appellant contends that these questions \u201cfocused the jury\u2019s attention on the fact that the gun was missing from the scene ...\u201d However, as the State points out, this was never an issue in this case, because it is clear that appellant admitted to removing the gun himself, throwing it in a nearby lake, and then helped police recover the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The second series of questions that appellant takes issue with concerns questions asked by defense counsel about appellant\u2019s attempt to \u201cblot the flow of the blood on the left side of the head for a short period of time\u201d, whether MacDonnell expected blood flow from the victim\u2019s head to \u201cdrop as a result of the hand blocking the flow of the blood,\u201d to which he replied, in part: \u201cIf someone blocks that, it\u2019s going to instantly cut the, coat the hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Thereafter, the court asked: \u201cIf the wound is blocked by a hand, I believe you said that it would cause the hand to be covered with blood, because an arterial wound is gushing. Is that accurate?\u201d MacDonnell agreed, stating \u201c[ijnstantly, yes.\u201d The court then asked: \u201cDoes it follow, a fortiori, that if there\u2019s something in the hand, that object would be covered with blood?\u201d After MacDonnell agreed with that question, the court then asked, over objection, \u201cif a gun was in somebody\u2019s hand, and it was a gushing arterial wound, is your opinion that it would be \u2014 that the gun and the hand could be ... covered with blood?\u201d Again, Professor MacDonnell agreed that, in that scenario, the gun and the hand would be covered with blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Appellant contends that this series of questions \u201cappeared to favor the State in an area that was hotly contested by both sides, the significance of a lack of blood spatter on the back of the decedent\u2019s hands.\u201d We disagree. Based on our review of the entire record, and given the actual context of the court\u2019s questions, we conclude the question did not concern the lack of blood spatter on McQueen\u2019s hands. This is especially true given Professor MacDonnell\u2019s testimony that blood stains were on McQueen\u2019s right arm, indicating to him that McQueen\u2019s arm was up above his shoulder at the moment of impact. Instead, the court\u2019s questions addressed appellant\u2019s claim that there was blood on his hands because, at some point, he touched McQueen\u2019s head and neck, and may have attempted to block the flow of blood from the wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">It is not clear how these questions were prejudicial to appellant. There does not appear to have been any evidence concerning the presence of blood on the gun. Given that appellant disposed of the gun in a lake for a period of time, we presume that both parties determined further testing of the outside of the gun would have been fruitless. The court\u2019s questions did not convey a partiality in favor of the State\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Finally, appellant contends that the trial court improperly interrupted his cross-examination of Dr. Allan when she was called in rebuttal. The State responds that this issue was not preserved and is without merit in any event. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Dr. Allan was called as part of the State\u2019s rebuttal, testifying that she had reviewed Dr. Di Maio\u2019s testimony in this case, which included testimony concerning a case study of approximately 1,702 or 1,704 suicides in San Antonio, Texas. It was her opinion that this study was not useful in this case because the study did not differentiate between gunshot wounds sustained in suicides as opposed to those found in homicide cases. Dr. Allan also discounted Dr. Di Maio\u2019s reliance on statistics because the study did not differentiate based on demographics such as race.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Dr. Allan also noted that one of the other studies relied on by Dr. Di Maio, involving the number of times blood spatter would appear on the back of a suicide victim\u2019s hand, only involved a small percentage of cases using a .38 caliber revolver, as was used in this case. Dr. Allan testified that there were nine cases in that particular study involving a .38 revolver, and in only four of those did the results come back positive for blood spatter.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Dr. Allan about the study involving blood spatter on the back of the hands of suicide victims. Defense counsel asked if that study concluded that 33 percent of cases of self-inflicted wounds from revolvers had blood spatter on the back of the victim\u2019s shooting hand. Dr. Allan agreed that was the correct figure for revolvers, and that, in cases where a pistol was used, the statistic was 35 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">At this point, the State objected that this was irrelevant. The court agreed, and asked to look at the study. After clarifying that the study found that, in 33 out of 103 gunshot suicides, blood spatter was detectable by the naked eye on the back of the suicide victim\u2019s hand, the court stated that this was \u201cdifferent from saying whether it\u2019s present or not present.\u201d After defense counsel indicated he would move on, the court stated, \u201c[i]f we\u2019re going to quote these things, we need to do it accurately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">By agreeing to \u201cmove on,\u201d we concur that defense counsel acquiesced to the court\u2019s ruling. <em>See Grandison v. State, </em>305 Md. 685, 765, 506 A.2d 580 (\u201cBy dropping the subject and never again raising it, [appellant] waived his right to appellate review\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 873, 107 S.Ct. 38, 93 L.Ed.2d 174 (1986); <em>see also Whittington v. State, </em>147 Md.App. 496, 537, 809 A.2d 721 (2002) (holding that, where defense counsel did not dispute trial court\u2019s ruling limitation on expert testimony, the issue was not preserved), <em>cert. denied, </em>373 Md. 408, 818 A.2d 1107, <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 851, 124 S.Ct. 136, 157 L.Ed.2d 92 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Moreover, we are not persuaded that the court\u2019s request to look at the study and quote from it conveyed a bias in favor of the State, or that it somehow suggested that defense counsel was being intentionally misleading. There is always a danger that a jury may be heavily influenced by statistics and we discern no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s statements here. <em>See, e.g., Wilson v. State, </em>370 Md. 191, 202, 803 A.2d 1034 (2002) (\u201cStatistics are inherently flexible, and thus there are usually multiple correct statistics that can be used to describe the same set of data\u201d). For the most part, the court\u2019s questions were simply clarification of issues already before the jury. Moreover, given our review of the entire record, there was no demonstrated partiality of the court favoring one side or the other, and appellant was fully afforded his right to a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b514-7\">.
