The Supreme Court announced its decision in <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. _, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 on March 31, 2010. The holding was that if a defense attorney fails to advise a non-citizen client about deportation as a possible consequence of a guilty plea, such failure could represent ineffective assistance of counsel and could invalidate the guilty plea. The taste test now before us asks us to assess the vintage of that holding. Will it or will it not date back to invalidate a guilty plea entered on June 1,1999?</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The Guilty Plea</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">In the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County on June 1, 1999, the appellant, Lincoln Miller, tendered a plea of guilty to the charge of possessing 448 grams of cocaine with the intent to distribute. At no time during the offering of the plea was the appellant advised on the record by the court or by counsel about any possibly adverse immigration consequences that might result from that plea. Accepting the plea, which was otherwise voluntary and knowledgeable in every respect, Judge Richard H. Sothoron, Jr. sentenced the appellant to five years of imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The appellant did not appeal that sentence, which the appellant finished serving on June 1, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Subsequent Events</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">Following his release from prison in Maryland, the appellant, who is now 58 years of age, returned to New York State and resumed residence with his wife of 24 years. The appellant is a native of Belize. He had been accorded Lawful Permanent Resident status in the United States in 1981. For all intents and purposes, the appellant\u2019s travails in Maryland were ancient history when, in the spring of 2008, he paid a visit to his native Belize. Upon his return to the United States on May 27, 2008, however, he was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at the Miami International Airport. On September 29, 2008, deportation proceedings against him were begun, based on the 1999 conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>in Prince George\u2019s County. The removal proceedings are being held in abeyance, pending the resolution of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Coram Nobis</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">On June 18, 2009, the appellant filed a Petition for a Writ of Error Coram Nobis in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. He alleged that \u201chis guilty plea had not been tendered knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently, in light of the facts that: (1) he was not advised of the immigration consequences attendant to his plea, and (2) he was not advised, prior to acceptance of his plea, that by pleading guilty he was foregoing his right to direct appeal, and was thus limited to filing an application for leave to appeal, on four limited grounds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">On August 21, 2009, a hearing was held on the coram nobis petition before Judge Maureen Lamasney. The appellant was the only witness to testify. On October 5, 2009, Judge Lamas-ney filed an Opinion and Order denying the coram nobis petition. The critical part of Judge Lamasney\u2019s opinion reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-8\">It is clear from the record that the Plea Court did not inform the petitioner of either possible immigration consequences or the right to a direct automatic appeal to the Court of Special Appeals if convicted after a trial. However, <em>\u201cconsequences of the plea\u201d has been interpreted to mean \u201cdirect\u201d consequences. A consequence is considered direct only if \u201cthe result represents a definite, immediate and largely automatic effect on the range of the defendant\u2019s punishment\u201d, Cuthrell v. Director of Patuxent </em>475 F.2d 1364 (4th Cir.1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">\n<em>Padilla v. Kentucky</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">The appellant now appeals from that denial, claiming that <em>Padilla v. Kentucky </em>has, <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>rendered Judge Lamasney\u2019s rationale untenable. Judge Lamasney\u2019s decision was based upon the well-settled Maryland (and, indeed, national) law that a guilty plea may not be attacked on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>ground that the defendant had not been advised with respect to the collateral consequences (as opposed to direct consequences) of the conviction to which he was pleading guilty. <em>Cuthrell v. Director of Patuxent, </em>475 F.2d 1364 (1973), the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on which Judge Lamasney relied, well reflected the prevailing national law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-5\">The law is clear that <em>a valid plea of guilty requires that the defendant be made aware of all \u201cthe direct consequences of his plea.\u201d </em>By the same token, it is equally well settled that, before pleading, <em>the defendant need not be advised of all collateral consequences of his plea, </em>or, as one Court has phrased it, of all \u201cpossible ancillary or consequential results which are peculiar to the individual and which may flow from a conviction of a plea of guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">475 F.2d at 1365-66 (emphasis supplied). There is no question but that deportation is a collateral consequence of a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">The appellant is correct that automatically rejecting a defendant\u2019s claim on the basis of the collateral consequence\u2014 direct consequence distinction is no longer proper. In that regard, the Supreme Court majority opinion was clear.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-8\">The collateral [consequence] versus direct [consequence] distinction is ... ill-suited to evaluating a <em>Strickland </em>claim concerning the specific risk of deportation. We conclude that <em>advice regarding deportation is not categorically removed from the ambit of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Strickland </em>applies to Padilla\u2019s claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">_ U.S. at _, 130 S.Ct. at 1482, 176 L.Ed.2d at 294 (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>The dispositive question for us, however, is whether that Supreme Court decision of March 21, 2010, has any applicability to the appellant\u2019s guilty plea of June 1,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">Retroactivity Versus Prospectivity</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The most articulate local statement on retroactive versus prospective application of an arguably new legal ruling is that by Judge Harrell (now on the Court of Appeals) for this Court in <em>Warrick v. State, </em>108 Md.App. 108, 113, 671 A.2d 51, <em>cert. denied, </em>342 Md. 507, 677 A.2d 583 (1996):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">The general rule of retroactivity <em>vel non </em>can be stated <em>simply </em>\u2014 if <em>the subject case merely applies settled precedents to new facts, the case is given retroactive effect, </em>for the case is viewed as not changing the law in any material way. On the other hand, <em>if the subject case creates a new rule that is a \u201cclear break\u201d with the past, retrospective application is inappropriate. </em>The Supreme Court has said that <em>a \u201cclear break\u201d exists where the new rule </em>\u201cexplicitly overruled a past precedent of this Court, or disapproved a practice this Court had arguably sanctioned in prior cases, or <em>overruled a longstanding practice that lower courts had uniformly approved.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">The limited extent to which even a \u201cnew\u201d legal ruling will be given a partially retroactive effect is that even a \u201cnew\u201d ruling will apply to all other cases that are not yet final, in the sense that they are still on direct appeal. In <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 304-05, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989), Justice O\u2019Connor stated that even \u201ca new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">In <em>Griffith v. Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 322-23, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987), Justice Blackmun wrote for the Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-10\">[A]fter we have decided a new rule in the case selected, the integrity of judicial review requires that we apply that rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>to all similar cases pending on direct review. Justice Harlan observed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-4\">\u201cIf we do not resolve all cases before us on direct review in light of our best understanding of governing constitutional principles, it is difficult to see why we should so adjudicate any case at all.... In truth, the Court\u2019s assertion of power to disregard current law in adjudicating cases before us that have not already run the full course of appellate review, is quite simply an assertion that our constitutional function is not one of adjudication but in effect of legislation.\u201d <em>Mackey v. United States, </em>401 U.S. [667], at 679, 91 S.Ct. 1160, 23 [28] L.Ed.2d 404 [(1971)] (opinion concurring in judgments).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6D\">As a practical matter, of course, we cannot hear each case pending on direct review and apply the new rule. But we fulfill our judicial responsibility by instructing the <em>lower courts </em>to <em>apply the new rule retroactively to cases not yet final.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">(Emphasis supplied). <em>See also Potts v. State, </em>300 Md. 567, 581, 479 A.2d 1335 (1984) (\u201cAs a general rule, <em>a change in law will be given effect while a case is on direct review.\u201d) </em>(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">This Case Was Not On Direct Review</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">This variety of quasi-retroactivity would clearly not apply to the appellant\u2019s June 1, 1999 guilty plea. The case was final and beyond any possibility for direct review as of July 1, 1999, the end of the 30-day window -within which an appeal or application for leave to appeal from the June 1, 1999 judgment of guilty might have been filed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When <em>Padilla v. Kentucky </em>was decided, almost eleven years later, the appellant\u2019s case was indisputably not on direct review.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>For cases which are no longer on direct review but only on collateral review, such as this one and such as our recently decided case of <em>State v. Denisyuk, </em>191 Md.App. 408, 991 A.2d 1275, <em>cert. granted, </em>415 Md. 38, 997 A.2d 789 (2010),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> newly announced legal principles would not apply. In <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. at 310, 109 S.Ct. 1060, the Supreme Court was clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-5\">[W]e now adopt Justice Harlan\u2019s view of retroactivity for cases on collateral review.... <em>[N]ew constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be applicable to those cases which have become final before the new rules are announced.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">(Emphasis supplied). <em>See also Allen v. Hardy, </em>478 U.S. 255, 257-58, 106 S.Ct. 2878, 92 L.Ed.2d 199 (1986) (\u201cWe conclude that our decision in <em>Batson [v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986)] should not be applied retroactively on collateral review of convictions that became final before our opinion was announced.\u201d); <em>Solem v. Stumes, </em>465 U.S. 638, 650, 104 S.Ct. 1338, 79 L.Ed.2d 579 (1984) (\u201cAt a minimum, nonretroactivity means that a decision is not to be applied in collateral review of final convictions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">In <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. at 309-10, 109 S.Ct. 1060, Justice O\u2019Connor explained some of the reasons for not giving full retroactive effect to decisions that effectively work a change in the law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-8\"><em>Application of constitutional rules not in existence at the time a conviction became final seriously undermines the principle of finality </em>which is essential to the operation of our criminal justice system....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number><em>The \u201ccosts imposed, </em>upon the State[s] <em>by retroactive application </em>of new rules of constitutional law on habeas corpus ... <em>generally far outweigh the benefits of this application.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADL\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">What Is New Law?</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">It was also in <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. at 301, 109 S.Ct. 1060, that the Supreme Court gave us the most manageable statement yet provided as to what constitutes a new application of the law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-7\">It is admittedly often difficult to determine when a case announces a new rule, and we do not attempt to define the spectrum of what may or may not constitute a new rule for retroactivity purposes. In general, however, <em>a case announces a new rule when it breaks new ground </em>or imposes a new obligation on the States or the Federal Government. To put it differently, <em>a case announces a new rule if the result was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant\u2019s conviction became final.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\"><em>Padilla v. Kentucky </em>As New Law</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">Applying that definition from <em>Teague v. Lane </em>to the holding of <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>it is clear that the <em>Padilla </em>holding \u201cwas not dictated by precedent existing\u201d on June 1, or July 1, 1999, \u201cat the time the [appellant\u2019s] conviction became final.\u201d In Judge Harrell\u2019s words in <em>Warrick v. State, </em>108 Md.App. at 113, 671 A.2d 51, the <em>Padilla v. Kentucky </em>holding \u201coverruled a longstanding practice that lower courts had uniformly approved.\u201d <em>See Griffith v. Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. at 325, 107 S.Ct. 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">What <em>Padilla v. Kentucky </em>ultimately held was by no means foreordained by what had gone before. For decades, the universally applied law, federal and state, had been that a guilty plea would not be invalidated by the failure of the court or of the defense attorney to advise the defendant about a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>collateral consequence of the plea.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although acknowledging that deportation is a collateral consequence of a conviction, the Supreme Court said only that it had never before relied on such a distinction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-5\">We, however, have never applied a distinction between direct and collateral consequences to define the scope of constitutionally \u201creasonable professional assistance\u201d required under <em>Strickland.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">_ U.S. at_, 130 S.Ct. at 1481, 176 L.Ed.2d at 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Significantly, the majority opinion never said that it had ever declined to rely on such a distinction. It said simply that it had never ruled on the issue one way or the other and was, therefore, completely free to go either way. That by no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>means implies that the Court\u2019s ultimate decision was one \u201cdictated by precedent.\u201d It was simply not prohibited by its own precedent, and that is a different thing. The Supreme Court, moreover, never suggested that the caselaw around the country had not overwhelmingly relied on the distinction between direct and collateral consequences. The Supreme Court, indeed, cited no support in the caselaw, federal or state, for its ultimate holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The Internal Wording of <em>Padilla v. Kentucky</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">At the very outset of the opinion, the Court acknowledged, _ U.S. at_, 130 S.Ct. at 1478, 176 L.Ed.2d at 290, that it was responding to a dramatically changing situation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A28\"><em>The landscape </em>of federal immigration law <em>has changed dramatically </em>over the last 90 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">The opinion then proceeded to chronicle significant changes in immigration law and policy that had occurred in 1917, 1922, 1952, and 1996 and from those changes concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-10\"><em>These changes </em>to our immigration law <em>have dramatically raised the stakes </em>of a non-citizen\u2019s criminal conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">_ U.S. at _, 130 S.Ct. at 1480, 176 L.Ed.2d at 292 (emphasis supplied). The implication was unmistakable that the law providing some relief to non-citizens, far from remaining static, would have to change to meet the changing needs of changing times, to wit, the \u201cdramatic raising of] the stakes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AIb\">The Solicitor General, as amicus curiae, had urged that notice be taken only of affirmative misadvice about deportation and not of non-advice. The Supreme Court declined to buy that argument, but did acknowledge, _ U.S. at _, 130 S.Ct. at 1483-84, 176 L.Ed.2d at 296, that the Solicitor General\u2019s position \u201chas support among the lower courts,\u201d citing four federal circuits and two state courts. <em>United States v. Couto, </em>311 F.3d 179, 188 (2d Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Kwan, </em>407 F.3d 1005 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Sparks v. Sowders, </em>852 F.2d 882 (6th Cir.1988); <em>United States v. Russell, </em>686 F.2d 35 (D.C.Cir. 1982); <em>State v. Rojas-Martinez, </em>125 P.3d 930, 935 (Utah <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>2005); <em>In re Resendiz, 25 </em>Cal.4th 230, 105 Cal.Rptr.2d 431, 19 P.3d 1171 (2001). No case was cited opposing that view. The Supreme Court was not following a well-trodden path.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Although the Supreme Court cautioned that \u201cwe must be especially careful about recognizing new grounds for attacking the validity of guilty pleas,\u201d _ U.S. at_, 130 S.Ct. at 1485, 176 L.Ed.2d at 298, it then explained why it felt justified in doing so. The subject matter of that careful balancing, however, was expressly that of \u201crecognizing <em>new grounds </em>for attacking the validity of guilty pleas.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">The only remote allusion the Supreme Court made to any previous thinking by it about the subject at all, _ U.S. at _, 130 S.Ct. at 1483, 176 L.Ed.2d at 295, was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-10\">We too have previously recognized that \u201cpreserving the client\u2019s right to remain in the United States may be more important to the client than any potential jail sentence.\u201d <em>Immigration and Naturalization Service v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 323, 121 S.Ct. 2268 [2271], 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">Ironically, even if a harbinger of change could be spotted back in <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>it would avail the appellant in this case absolutely nothing. That earliest conceivable antecedent rumbling was filed on June 25, 2001. Even as of that first fleeting hint of something \u201cblowin\u2019 in the wind,\u201d the time had already long since lapsed for any direct review of the appellant\u2019s guilty plea of June 1, 1999. The appellant\u2019s guilty plea had already been final for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-12\">Another sure-fire tip-off that the Supreme Court was preparing to change the law was its amassing, _ U.S. at_, 130 S.Ct. at 1482, 176 L.Ed.2d at 294-95, of \u201cprevailing professional norms [to] support the view that counsel must advise her client regarding the risk of deportation.\u201d The Court cited a host of professional ethical standards and academic authorities. That is a classic argumentative technique when making a case not for recognizing what the law already is but in building persuasive support for what the law, in the Court\u2019s judgment, ought to be. The Supreme Court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>unquestionably justifying the change it was about to make. That, by definition, is making new law. That much is clear from within the four corners of the majority opinion itself.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Our search internally for Freudian clues as to what <em>Padilla v. Kentucky </em>thought about itself, however, is very secondary. What ultimately matters is not whether the Supreme Court majority subjectively thought it was changing the law, but whether, as an objectively measured fact, it did change the law. The Supreme Court majority never expressly addressed the subject of change and had no occasion to do so. It is for us to examine what the law, state and federal, in Maryland and nationwide, was prior to March 31, 2010; to examine what the law became after March 31, 2010; and by that comparison to determine whether the law was, indeed, changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Justice Alito\u2019s Concurrence</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The concurring opinion in <em>Padilla v. Kentucky </em>was more introspective than was the majority opinion. Justice Alito filed a concurring opinion that was joined by Chief Justice Roberts. He concurred in the decision that Padilla\u2019s guilty plea must be invalidated on the limited ground that Padilla\u2019s lawyer had affirmatively given him bad and inaccurate advice about deportation. He did not agree with the majority opinion that the mere lack of any advice would suffice to invalidate a guilty plea.

The Maryland Bible on the critical distinction between a direct consequence of a conviction and a collateral consequence was the opinion of Judge Raker for the Court of Appeals in <em>Yoswick v.

There are, moreover, reliable tools and techniques that enable us to determine what that law was. On the issue now before us, it is unreasonable, therefore, to say that the Supreme Court in <em>Padilla v. Kentucky </em>did nothing but apply predictable and well-settled law, when the monolith of preexisting law had, unanimously and consistently, stood for the exact opposite. To have applied the law in what could be characterized as a predictable manner would have been to go with the unremitting flow, not against it. Maryland, for its part, can hardly characterize <em>Padilla v. Kentucky\u2019s </em>holding as predictable, in that our own caselaw had been, for 35 years, steadfastly predicting the diametric oppo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>site. <em>Padilla v. Kentucky </em>announced new law. Accordingly, it will not apply retroactively to a case, such as the one now before us, long beyond direct review before it was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">A Postscript Contention</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">As a secondary contention, the appellant argues that the failure of Judge Sothoron to have advised him, before he accepted the appellant\u2019s plea of guilty, that the appellant would have only a right to file an application for leave to appeal rather than an unfettered right to appeal from his conviction rendered his guilty plea involuntary. Although we would see no merit in the contention even if its timeliness were not an issue, it is the flagrant untimeliness of the claim that we find dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">The appellant relies upon dicta in <em>Durbin v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 442, 468 A.2d 145 (1983). There was no holding in <em>Durbin </em>to support the appellant\u2019s position. Indeed, Judge William Adkins made it expressly clear that the Court was not making a dispositive holding.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\">As <em>to Durbin\u2019s final contention, </em>that she was not informed she would not have a right to appeal from the judgment imposed following her guilty plea, <em>we have found no authority one way or another as to whether advice as to this particular consequence of a guilty plea is a prerequisite to effective acceptance of the plea....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-9\">But <em>whether a guilty plea must be stricken in the absence of such advise we need not now decide.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">56 Md.App. at 448-49, 468 A.2d 145 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-11\">Judge Adkins\u2019s dicta by way of cautionary advice to trial judges, on the other hand, was soothing music to the appellant\u2019s ears.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-12\"><em>[Tfhe better practice would certainly be to advise the defendant that a right to appeal no longer exists in these </em>circumstances.... The non-availability of that former statutory right, and its replacement by the discretionary application for leave to appeal is a consequence of a guilty plea of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>which we think a defendant should be informed when deciding whether to plead guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">56 Md.App. at 448-49, 468 A.2d 145 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Even with respect to the untimely merits, the appellant would not prevail. In the first place, we would not invalidate an eleven-year-old guilty plea because the trial judge had failed to follow what we recommended, in dicta, to be \u201cthe better practice.\u201d The passing grade is not A+.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">A second failure of the appellant\u2019s case on the merits would be the total absence of any proffer as to what appellate issue he might have raised on a direct appeal that he could not have attempted to raise by application for leave to appeal. It is not enough to allege that a trial judge failed to recite punctiliously every jot and tittle of his assigned catechism. There must at least be some suggestion as to what difference it made.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">On the merits, the ultimate issue would be the voluntariness of the 1999 guilty plea. At the coram nobis hearing at which this contention was raised, the appellant was the only witness to take the stand. At no time did he come remotely close to testifying that if he had known that he had only a right to apply for leave to appeal rather than an unfettered right to appeal, he would never have entered the guilty plea. Even if such a notion might seem outlandish, the appellant could have raised it, but did not. His, of course, was the burden of proof and he never suggested what prejudice he suffered as a result of his imperfect knowledge. Without some prejudice, there is no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">All of these flaws with respect to the merits of the contention pale, however, in the presence of the overarching question of why was this challenge to a guilty plea still before the court eleven years after the guilty plea had been accepted. With respect to the appellant\u2019s first contention, a March 31, 2010 holding by the Supreme Court of the United States on a constitutional issue is at least a plausibly efficacious time machine to carry us back to the guilty plea proceeding of June 1, 1999. With respect to the appellant\u2019s second contention, by gaping contrast, some December 7, 1983 dicta by the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Special Appeals on a sub-constitutional issue is not an efficacious time traveler at all. That bird won\u2019t fly.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Even when <em>Skok v. State, </em>361 Md. 52, 760 A.2d 647 (2000), opened the forum of coram nobis to the special case of deportation, it stressed that the opening was very narrow and jealously guarded.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-6\"><em>This expanded scope of coram nobis </em>to challenge criminal convictions <em>is, </em>however, <em>subject to several important qualifications </em>which are set forth in <em>United States v. Morgan </em>and the cases applying <em>Morgan. </em>Thus, <em>the grounds for challenging the criminal conviction must be of a constitutional, jurisdictional or fundamental character.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">361 Md. at 78, 760 A.2d 647 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">Advice with respect to various modalities of possible appellate review is neither jurisdictional nor of a fundamental character. Such advice is, most assuredly, not constitutional. See <em>Cubbage v. State, </em>304 Md. 237, 241, 498 A.2d 632 (1985) (\u201cIn Maryland, the right to appeal a criminal conviction is statutory, not constitutional.\u201d); <em>Evitts v.

And your request is to be made in 90 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-8\">THE DEFENDANT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">During the 30-day window in which to apply for leave to appeal, between June 1, 1999 and July 1, 1999, the appellant, of course, had no reason to anticipate the <em>Padilla v. Kentucky </em>decision that was eleven years in the future. The appellant, by contrast, had reason to be fully aware of <em>Durbin v. State </em>dicta, which had been on the books for 16 years. Notwithstanding that presumptive knowledge, the appellant did not petition for leave to appeal on the basis of that dicta. Nor at any time during the next five years, while the appellant was serving his sentence, did the appellant petition for post-conviction relief under the Maryland Post-Conviction Procedure Act. Any complaint based on <em>Durbin v. State </em>was conclusively waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">In <em>Holmes v. State, </em>401 Md. 429, 932 A.2d 698 (2007), Judge Battaglia was very clear with respect to the foreclosing effect of a failure to apply for leave to appeal on a subsequent coram nobis claim.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-11\">We hold that <em>if an individual who pleads guilty, </em>having been informed of his right to file an application for leave to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>appeal from his conviction and sentence, <em>does not file such an application for leave to appeal, a rebuttable presumption arises that he has waived the right to challenge his conviction in a subsequent coram nobis proceeding. Because Thomas did not rebut the presumption of waiver, </em>nor demonstrate \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d to excuse his failure to file an application for leave to appeal, <em>his right to challenge his conviction </em>and sentence <em>through a writ of error coram nobis petition was waived.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The appellant in this case has alleged no \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d to excuse his failure to file an application for leave to appeal the acceptance of his guilty plea. In effect, the appellant simply sought to piggy-back his <em>Durbin v. State </em>contention on his <em>Padilla v. Kentucky </em>contention. Each contention, however, is subject to different qualifying rules. The <em>Padilla v. Kentucky </em>contention at least made it onto the field. The <em>Durbin v. State </em>contention never even belonged in the ballpark.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b670-11\">. <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>incidentally, did not decide that the failure of his attorney to advise Padilla about the possibility of deportation constituted the ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). It decided only that the failure so to advise represented a failure to satisfy the performance prong of <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>two-pronged test. The case was remanded to Kentucky for consideration of whether the prejudice prong had or had not also been violated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b672-8\">. In <em>Griffith v. Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. at 321 n. 6, 107 S.Ct. 708, the Supreme Court defined a \"final conviction\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-9\">By \"final,\u201d we mean a case in which a judgment of conviction has been rendered, the availability of appeal exhausted, and the time for a petition for certiorari elapsed or a petition for certiorari finally denied.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b673-9\">. The State appeal to this Court in <em>State v. Denisyuk </em>was from a collateral postconviction ruling and was not a direct appeal from the trial itself. The case was not on direct review and <em>Padilla v. Kentucky </em>would thus not apply to it, if <em>Padilla v. Kentucky </em>was, indeed, making new law rather than simply applying well-settled law. See <em>Griffith v. Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. at 321-22, 107 S.Ct. 708 (\u201c[RJetroactivity analysis for convictions that have become final must be different from the analysis for convictions that are not final at the time the new decision is issued.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b675-8\">. In <em>State v. Denisyuk, </em>191 Md.App. at 443-44, 991 A.2d 1275, this Court listed examples of the types of consequence that will qualify as \u201ccollateral\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">What makes certain costs of a criminal conviction collateral? Let us count the ways. Or, at least, some of them as illustrative of the larger phenomenon. If following a conviction for drunken driving, the Motor Vehicle Administration should suspend or revoke one\u2019s driving privileges, that's a collateral consequence. If following a felony conviction, one may no longer vote or hold public office, that's a collateral consequence. If following a conviction, one may face enhanced sentences for future crimes, that's a collateral consequence. If following a conviction, one is found guilty of a violation of probation for some earlier offense, that\u2019s also a collateral consequence. If one is not eligible for parole or only for delayed parole, that\u2019s a collateral consequence. A prohibition on the right to bear firearms is a collateral consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">If following a conviction for a sexual offense, one is required to register as a sex offender, that\u2019s a collateral consequence.... If following a conviction for child abuse, one is barred from employment as a teacher or a pediatrician or a scoutmaster, that too is a collateral consequence. If one\u2019s passport is lifted and one may not travel abroad, that's a collateral consequence. If following a guilty plea to bribery, one is forced to resign the Vice Presidency of the United States, that\u2019s a collateral consequence. If following a hypothetical plea to covering up a \u201cthird-rate burglary,\u201d one could be impeached as President of the United States, even that would be a collateral consequence. And, of course, being deported is also a collateral consequence....</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">In each of these instances, it is not the criminal court judge who takes the plea who imposes the consequence. The source of the consequence is some other person or some other arm of government or the operation of some other law. That's what makes it collateral.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b678-5\">. We are not unmindful of the two <em>nisi prius </em>opinions relied on by the appellant, but we find those opinions singularly unpersuasive. <em>People v. Bennett, 28 </em>Misc.3d 575, 903 N.Y.S.2d 696 (2010), is an opinion of the Criminal Court of Bronx County. <em>United States v. Hubenig, </em>2010 WL 2650625, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80179, is an opinion by a magistrate judge of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California. Both opinions concluded that the Supreme Court must have believed that its decision in <em>Padilla </em>would be fully retroactive or it would not have bothered to respond to what it described, _ U.S. at _, 130 S.Ct. at 1484-85, 176 L.Ed.2d at 297, as the \"floodgates\" concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Nowhere in the <em>Padilla </em>decision was there any consideration of the subject of full retroactivity (the application of settled law to a new situation) versus partial retroactivity (to all cases still on direct review). Both possibilities could be metaphorically characterized as \"opening the floodgates\u201d to many cases seeking to take advantage of the change in the law. What the Supreme Court said was simply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-9\">We have given serious consideration to the concerns that the solicitor General, respondent, and <em>amici </em>have stressed regarding the importance of protecting the finality of convictions obtained through guilty pleas. We confronted a similar \"floodgates\u201d concern in <em>Hill </em>[v. <em>Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985)]. <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>in turn, was not a case that even alluded to the issue</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASU\">of full retroactivity versus partial retroactivity. At the page in <em>Hill v. Lockhart </em>referred to by <em>Padilla, Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 58, 106 S.Ct. 366, was discussing \"the fundamental interest in the finality of guilty pleas ... identified in <em>United States v. Timmreck, </em>441 U.S. 780, 99 S.Ct. 2085, 60 L.Ed.2d 634 (1979).\u201d The passage in <em>Timmreck </em>there quoted, 441 U.S. at 784, 99 S.Ct. 2085, was also not concerned with full retroactivity versus partial retroactivity and actually referred to \"new grounds for setting aside guilty pleas.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-10\">Every inroad on the concept of finality undermines confidence in the integrity of our procedure; and, by increasing the volume of judicial work, inevitably delays and impairs the orderly administration of justice. <em>The impact is greatest when new grounds for setting aside guilty pleas are approved </em>because the vast majority of criminal convictions result from such pleas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-12\">Our only point is that an undifferentiated reference to a loaded word such as \"floodgates\u201d cannot be seized upon as an indication that the Supreme Court, otherwise silent on the subject that was not before it, thought that <em>Padilla v. Kentucky </em>would be fully retroactive. Either full retroactivity or partial retroactivity could be rhapsodized by creative advocates as an opening of the floodgates to increased litigation. A response to such creativity could be a response to the threat of a greater flood or to the threat of a lesser flood.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
