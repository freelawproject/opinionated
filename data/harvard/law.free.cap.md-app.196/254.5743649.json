Was the appellant denied a fair trial by the prosecutor\u2019s comments in rebuttal closing argument, where the prosecutor commented on the credibility of the State\u2019s witnesses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-10\">2. Did the trial court err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the cocaine found on appellant\u2019s person because the State did not have probable cause to arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-11\">3. Did the trial court err in admitting expert fingerprint testimony as rebuttal evidence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">For the reasons set forth below, we hold that the prosecutor\u2019s statements in closing argument constituted reversible error. Accordingly, we shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Suppression Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">At approximately 10:45 p.m. on July 30, 2008, Detectives Thomas E. Wilson, III and Isaac Carrington responded to a complaint of narcotics activity at the corner of 20th and Boone Streets in Baltimore City. Detective Wilson, who was accepted as an expert in the \u201cidentification, packaging, and sale of narcotics,\u201d testified that, after patrolling Boone Street for approximately five minutes, he \u201cobserved an unknown black female entering the area.\u201d The woman approached an unknown man and asked: \u201c[I]s any ready out[?]\u201d Detective Wilson testified that \u201cready\u201d was a street term used to refer to crack cocaine. The man directed the woman toward an alley where appellant was standing. The woman approached appellant, spoke briefly to him, and pulled out money. Appellant then reached into his right sock. Based on his training and experience, Detective Wilson believed that a drug transaction was occurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">At that point, and prior to any distribution of drugs, Detectives Wilson and Carrington approached appellant. Detective Wilson testified that Detective Carrington searched appellant and recovered 13 ziploc bags of cocaine from appellant\u2019s right sock.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Detective Carrington then testified. His testimony corroborated that of Detective Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">The State argued that the detectives\u2019 observations, coupled with Detective Wilson\u2019s expertise in the sale of narcotics, provided sufficient probable cause to arrest appellant, and the ensuing search of appellant was proper as a search incident to a lawful arrest. Defense counsel argued that the drugs should be suppressed, attacking the credibility of the detectives\u2019 testimony, stating that the detectives never actually saw any drugs before searching the appellant, and questioning whether the unidentified man or woman actually existed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, finding that the detectives had probable cause to believe that appellant had drugs in his sock. The court noted that the detectives saw the woman ask for \u201cready,\u201d approach appellant and take her currency out of her purse, and appellant then go for his sock. The court stated that \u201c[ujnseen or unknown objects exchanged for currency constitutes probable cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Trial Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">On July 9, 2009, trial began. The State\u2019s first witness was Hondge Pan, a chemist. Mr. Pan testified that he tested the substance seized from appellant in the ziploc bags, and he determined that it was cocaine. During cross-examination, defense counsel inquired as to whether the ziploc bags had been submitted for fingerprint analysis, and Mr. Pan stated that he did not know, that it was \u201cnot my work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Defense counsel pressed Mr. Pan on his knowledge regarding whether drugs were typically dusted for fingerprints. Counsel inquired about the precautions Mr. Pan took to ensure that his fingerprints would not be on the ziploc bags should a fingerprint analysis be conducted after Mr. Pan analyzed the bags\u2019 contents. Appellant\u2019s counsel also inquired whether Mr. Pan had seen items submitted for analysis that had fingerprint dust on them. Mr. Pan stated: \u201cOccasionally. Not much.\u201d He acknowledged that the black powder could be seen by looking at the submission, and he said: \u201cThere\u2019s no black powder in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Detective Wilson testified next, and he was accepted as an expert in the \u201cidentification, packaging and sale of cocaine within Baltimore City.\u201d He testified regarding how cocaine is packaged, explaining that it is packaged in, among other things, ziploc bags. Detective Wilson then explained how a typical narcotics transaction occurs. A drug dealer would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>have the drugs on his or her person or in a stash. A person seeking to buy drugs would approach the drug dealer, engage in a brief conversation, give the dealer money, and the dealer would give the buyer drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Detective Wilson then testified, consistent with his testimony at the suppression hearing, regarding the events of July 30, 2008. He also testified that, based on his training and experience, the quantity of cocaine appellant possessed led him to believe that appellant possessed the drugs for the purposes of selling them.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">On cross-examination, counsel for appellant challenged the veracity of Detective Wilson\u2019s account of events. Counsel asked Detective Wilson about his testimony in another case, where his credibility had been questioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Detective Wilson, you had the uncomfortable experience some years ago, 2003, of being, testifying in front of Andre Davis in Federal Court, the conclusion of which, Judge Andre Davis basically declared that he didn\u2019t believe your testimony ... Judge Davis declared basically, \u201cI find the (unintelligible) of the Affidavit to be a knowing lie. I also find the use of the term \u2018in a covert position\u2019 to be a knowing he. I also find the assertion [that] of the unknown subject fled the area on foot to be a knowing lie. Wilson received an anonymous call, I find Detective Wilson\u2019s testimony in that regard incredible. The government has not established it. It rejected it. I reject that testimony. I do not find it credible. I don\u2019t believe Detective Wilson saw what he claims he saw. I reject that testimony. I don\u2019t find it credible.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">\u201cSpecifically, I find there\u2019s no way that Detective Wilson could have made the observations he claims he made. I\u2019ve assessed the demeanor of Detective Wilson. I\u2019ve listened carefully to his testimony and, indeed, I\u2019ve engaged in pressuring Detective Wilson in an effort not to impeach or undermine the governments [sic] presentation, but to satisfy in my own mind, as the finder of fact in the suppression hearing, how it could be that a narrative so implausible, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>so implausible and incredibly presented might be accepted by the Court. Frankly, I don\u2019t mean this as criticism, but ... the State\u2019s Attorney argument today, shed some light,\u201d dah-dah-dah-dah-dah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">Do you recall the uncomfortable experience?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Detective Wilson testified that he recalled the case, and counsel for appellant continued with this line of questioning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The matter resulted in your being called in front of the [Internal Affairs Division] and disciplined and given five days extra training, did it not? [DETECTIVE WILSON]: It wasn\u2019t extra training. It was one day search and seizure training.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Search and seizure. Court\u2019s indulgence. I stand corrected, five days loss of leave and search and seizure training from neglect of duty, is that fair to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-9\">[DETECTIVE WILSON]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">Defense counsel then questioned Detective Wilson about his failure to gather evidence in this case to corroborate his account of events. He asked Detective Wilson whether he \u201ccould have made this all up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">On redirect, the State asked Detective Wilson to explain the discrepancies in his statements in federal court. With respect to the affidavit that he signed, Detective Wilson explained that he had used incorrect grammar and misspelled words. Additionally, he had stated that an incident occurred in the first week of October, when it actually had occurred on October 9th, and he stated that he took a covert position when he was engaging in on-foot surveillance. Detective Wilson suggested that the \u201cknowing lies\u201d to which Judge Davis referred \u201ccould be characterized as misconceptions, misunderstandings.\u201d Detective Wilson testified that he did not receive any demotion or reassignment as a result of the 2003 case. With respect to the July 30, 2008, incident in this case, Detective Wilson testified that he was telling the truth, and he had not fabricated his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>On re-cross, counsel for appellant again questioned Detective Wilson regarding Judge Davis\u2019 characterization of his affidavit as a \u201cblatant he,\u201d and he questioned whether \u201cgrammatical confusion\u201d would result in Detective Wilson losing five days of pay. Detective Wilson acknowledged that he \u201cdid lose money. I did lose time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The State\u2019s next witness was Detective Isaac Carrington, who was also accepted as an expert in the \u201cidentification, packaging, and the sale of narcotics in Baltimore City.\u201d Detective Carrington\u2019s testimony with respect to the events leading up to appellant\u2019s arrest on July 30, 2008, was consistent with his testimony at the suppression hearing. He also confirmed the chain of custody of the 13 ziploc bags of cocaine recovered from the appellant. The drugs then were admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">On cross-examination, appellant\u2019s counsel questioned Detective Carrington about the unknown male and female, noting that they were not arrested and suggesting that they did not exist. After asking Detective Carrington for details about the unknown woman\u2019s appearance and inquiring as to why he did not take a picture of her, appellant\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cBecause she didn\u2019t exist so you couldn\u2019t stop her if you wanted to[.]\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel also pressed Detective Carrington for more detail about the unknown man\u2019s description, referring to him as the \u201cghost man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Counsel then questioned Detective Carrington about why he did not request that the ziploc bags be checked for fingerprints. Detective Carrington responded that he did not request fingerprints because he had recovered the ziploc bags from appellant\u2019s sock. He subsequently testified that he never requested that drugs be fingerprinted.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">On redirect, the State inquired about the fingerprint analysis protocol for seized narcotics. Detective Carrington responded that he typically did not request a fingerprint analysis for seized narcotics because the drugs are usually recovered directly from the dealer, and to the best of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>knowledge, fingerprints cannot be lifted from the packaging in which narcotics are seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">On recross, appellant\u2019s counsel revisited the issue of fingerprint analysis. Counsel asked Detective Carrington whether he knew that \u201cfingerprints can come off of any surface where a fingerprint oil is left on a smooth surface and preserved by good police work.\u201d Detective Carrington answered affirmatively, and he confirmed that he had never requested to have a fingerprint analysis conducted on vials or ziploc bags.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The State then addressed the issue again, asking Detective Carrington who had told him that fingerprint analysis generally would not be ordered for drugs seized during narcotics arrests. Detective Carrington responded that he had been so advised by his supervisor and other drug units.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The State then alerted the court and the appellant that it intended to call Ms. Sharon Talmadge, a fingerprint expert, to testify. The prosecutor stated that, because appellant \u201cha[d] gone so deeply into the fingerprints,\u201d the State wanted to explain \u201cwhy fingerprints would not be found on these types of items.\u201d Over appellant\u2019s objection, the court ruled that it would permit Ms. Talmadge to testify the next day. The court instructed the appellant to call his witness, who was testifying out of order at appellant\u2019s request because of scheduling constraints.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Appellant called Tabina Clanton, his sole witness, to rebut the detectives\u2019 testimony that they saw a man, who was sitting on the steps of 700 East 20th Street, direct the unknown woman to appellant. Ms. Clanton testified that there were no steps leading to the home of 700 East 20th Street; the steps led to the house next to 700 East 20th Street. After Ms. Clanton\u2019s testimony, the trial recessed for the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>When court reconvened the following day, the State informed the court and appellant that Ms. Elizabeth Pattie would testify instead of Ms. Talmadge. The prosecutor advised that the State was closing its case-in-chief, not having called a fingerprint expert, and that Ms. Pattie would be testifying as a rebuttal witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Ms. Pattie was accepted as an expert in the field of latent prints and examination, and she explained how and why fingerprints are left on different objects. She testified about the likelihood of recovering fingerprints from a ziploc bag filled with cocaine, explaining that \u201cover the years our chances have not been very successful for drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The State called two other rebuttal witnesses, Detective Wilson and Detective Kenneth Ramburg, to testify to the location of the stairs outside 700 and 702 East 20th Street. After the rebuttal witnesses testified, the court instructed the jury and proceeded to closing arguments. The jury found the appellant guilty of possession of cocaine but not guilty of possession with the intent to distribute cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">CLOSING ARGUMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">Appellant\u2019s first contention is that \u201cthe State\u2019s repeated improper vouching of its witnesses\u201d deprived him of a fair trial. He asserts that \u201cthe State attempted to convince the jury that the police officers were credible, honest, and honorable.\u201d Appellant argues that \u201c[t]he credibility of the State\u2019s witnesses was the main issue in [appellant\u2019s] trial,\u201d and \u201c[w]here the jury\u2019s assessment of witness credibility is a critical issue, an error affecting the jury\u2019s ability to assess credibility is highly prejudicial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">The State contends that the trial court \u201ccorrectly denied [appellant\u2019s] motion for a new trial based on remarks in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal closing, where those remarks were in direct response to defense counsel\u2019s repeated insistence that the State\u2019s witnesses were liars who planted evidence on [appellant].\u201d It argues that, \u201c[a]fter throwing open the door on the issue of the officers\u2019 personal integrity and honor,\u201d appellant \u201ccannot now complain that the prosecutor walked through that door in rebuttal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">An attorney has \u201cgreat leeway in presenting closing arguments to the jury.\u201d <em>Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 429, 722 A.2d 887 (1999). The Court of Appeals has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ad-dedup-0\">[I]t is, as a general rule, within the range of legitimate argument for counsel to state and discuss the evidence and all reasonable and legitimate inferences which may be drawn from the facts in evidence; and such comment or argument is afforded a wide range. Counsel is free to use the testimony most favorable to his side of the argument to the jury, and the evidence may be examined, collated, sifted \u25a0 and treated in his own way____Generally, counsel has the right to make any comment or argument that is warranted by the evidence proved or inferences therefrom; the prosecuting attorney is as free to comment legitimately and to speak fully, although harshly, on the accused\u2019s action and conduct if the evidence supports his comments, as is accused\u2019s counsel to comment on the nature of the evidence and the character of witnesses which the prosecution produces.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-8\"><em>Mitchell v. State, </em>408 Md. 368, 380, 969 A.2d 989 (2009) (quoting <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 412, 326 A.2d 707 (1974)). <em>Accord Clarke v. State, </em>97 Md.App. 425, 431, 630 A.2d 252 (1993) (\u201c\u2018[Closing argument is a robust forensic forum wherein its practitioners are afforded a wide range for expression.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Davis v. State, </em>93 Md.App. 89, 124, 611 A.2d 1008 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Despite the leeway afforded to counsel in closing argument, \u201ca defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial must be protected.\u201d <em>Lee v. State, </em>405 Md. 148, 164, 950 A.2d 125 (2008). Although a prosecutor is entitled to \u201c \u2018strike hard blows, he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>not at liberty to strike foul ones.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 7, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985) (quoting <em>Berger v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935)).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The determination whether counsel\u2019s \u201cremarks in closing were improper and prejudicial, or simply a permissible rhetorical flourish, is within the sound discretion of the trial court to decide.\u201d <em>Jones-Harris v. State, </em>179 Md.App. 72, 105, 943 A.2d 1272, <em>cert. denied, </em>405 Md. 64, 949 A.2d 652 (2008). An appellate court generally will not reverse the trial court \u201cunless that court clearly abused the exercise of its discretion and prejudiced the accused.\u201d <em>Degren, </em>352 Md. at 431, 722 A.2d 887.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">As explained in more detail below, analysis of appellant\u2019s contention requires several steps. Initially, we must assess whether the prosecutor\u2019s comments, standing alone, were improper. If so, we assess whether, in light of the argument made by defense counsel, the prosecutor\u2019s comments were a reasonable response pursuant to the \u201copened door\u201d doctrine or the invited response doctrine. If not, we must determine whether reversal is required because, under the totality of the circumstances, the comments were likely to have improperly influenced the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">A. Arguments of Counsel Below</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Appellant\u2019s defense was that the detectives were not credible. In his opening statement, defense counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">Now, I\u2019m going to suggest to you quite frankly that what I believe they are doing is making up two people who don\u2019t exist. There was no woman. There was no man. They [are] coming in here with an excuse pulled out of thin air for why they drove up on somebody, shook them down, maybe found something or maybe not because I wasn\u2019t there. But once you\u2019ve heard the testimony of these two police officers, you\u2019re going to be saying to yourself I can\u2019t believe this, I can\u2019t believe that, where do I draw the line on what to believe[?]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>During closing argument, defense counsel continued with the theme that the officers were not credible, and he repeatedly accused the detectives of lying. Counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">To base anything on, in this case to come up with any kind of conviction you have to be able to stand on Det. Wilson\u2019s script and say I believe it, I believe it. I think, frankly, it\u2019s almost insulting to ask you to believe half of it, let alone the whole thing. It\u2019s just about the most preposterous thing that we\u2019ve spent time listening to in a court of law in Baltimore City in a long time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">He didn\u2019t see anybody, ghost male talking to ghost female. Or maybe they\u2019re just hearing voices since now we know the steps that he\u2019s imagining are, whoa, fifteen more feet away than he ever suspected they were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">[Appellant] just stood up, or he just started walking northbound, or maybe some police ear with two guys in it says there\u2019s nothing going on here, let\u2019s drive up and get that guy over there by that alley. Whoa, buddy, whoa, what\u2019s up? What\u2019s up? Oh, we\u2019re just checking you out. Got anything in your pockets here? What really happened? What really happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">Supposedly, they went into this woman citizen\u2019s, if she exists, pocketbook. Ladies, a police officer is going into your pocketbook and you might not complain? That is what the [citizen contact] form is for. To protect these officers. They didn\u2019t do it because she didn\u2019t exist. The whole thing is just pulled out of thin air. This is most bazaar [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">Ladies and gentlemen, and I don\u2019t, honestly, I don\u2019t do this in mean spirit, but if there was ever a guy who had ample notice, his credibility is suspect. It\u2019s this Ofcr. Wilson. This is a man who was chewed out in almost unheard of fashion by a federal judge five years ago, fined, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>fined in punishment for five days leave, which he tells us is $200 a day. A $1,000 fine. Who among us would have a $1,000 fine from our employer and not, not start dotting every I, crossing every T, minding every P, Q, and every other letter. You just do it because that\u2019s as close as you get to being fired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\">Ladies and gentlemen, there is no explanation for Det. Wilson\u2019s comments. There is no explanation for his false testimony. The only thing you\u2019re going to find in here is line after line of one judge and one attorney excruciatingly agitated. Look up in the index, you don[\u2019t] have to read the whole thing unless you want to, but if you want to, go ahead. Look up in the index. Look under words incredible, incredibly, false, falsities, incorrect, incompetent, lie or lies, implausible, misstated, misstatements, mistake, misunderstand, negligent, perjury, offensive, shocking, worst fumbling, bumbling investigation, blatant, wrong, pretext, non-answer, inexact, in attention, improper, inarguable, inappropriate, insulting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">I take no pleasure out of this. This should be a lesson somebody learned and nobody has to visit it again because we don\u2019t have slap-dash, half-baked, imaginary witnesses and incredible evidence brought before twelve people, citizens, thirteen, pardon, madam. Thirteen people spending three days listening to nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">This is insulting. This is fumbling and bumbling. Not only a five day loss of money, a $1,000 fine, sent back for remedial training. The first thing, smart thing I heard. I\u2019ve been marking my P\u2019s and Q\u2019s or something to that effect after that. Well, well enough. It\u2019s possible that this was just a really bad day in this officer\u2019s life where everything that he\u2019d gotten done right and everything was going smoothly and well and it just, it just, the stars were not aligned, everything was going wrong, (inaudible) maybe there\u2019s reasons and excuses for it. But there\u2019s no reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>and no excuse for a prosecution based on it and there\u2019s no basis for a conviction on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">This [sic] thirteen ziplocks [sic] of cocaine. We know they\u2019re cocaine because of Mr. Pan. We know there\u2019s thirteen because we can count. We don\u2019t have to take anybody\u2019s word. There\u2019s [sic] thirteen. And if you doubt this, ask to see the drugs, have it cut open right here on the counter and lay them out on the counter. There should be thirteen. We haven\u2019t done that, so there might not be. But, there probably are. Let\u2019s assume there\u2019s thirteen. That\u2019s about all we have. And Mr. Sivells got arrested, we don\u2019t doubt that. That\u2019s the detail that brings us here.

Thinner than thin.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">In its rebuttal closing, the State addressed defense counsel\u2019s remarks regarding Detective Wilson\u2019s credibility. The prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-9\">Talking about Det. Wilson. Let\u2019s talk about him for a minute. We\u2019re talking about a long time veteran of the Police Department who came in here and sat here in front of all of you so that you could judge his demeanor, you could judge his behavior, the twelve, thirteen of you. You\u2019re the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>triers of fact in this case. Not something that happened back in 2003, this case, here today. Notice how the defense spoke more about that case than they did their own case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Appellant objected and asked to approach the bench. The court overruled the objection and denied appellant\u2019s request. The State continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">Det. Wilson sat in front of you for almost three hours being torn apart, not once did he get angry. Not once did he loose [sic] his calm, not once did he avoid the question. He answered each question the best that he could. It doesn\u2019t sound like someone that\u2019s ashamed or should be hiding or embarrassed. And he shouldn\u2019t be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">The errors that he committed back in that case, its semantics. October 9, the first week of October strike one.

Come on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">Not everybody is blessed with the same education as Judge Davis and [appellant\u2019s attorney]. He made some mistakes and he admitted to them. That is honorable, to stand here and admit that. But we\u2019re forgetting other people testified. You never once heard the defense bring up Det. Carrington. Shoot he was probably hoping you all would forget about him. Whole other testimony, whole other officer sitting here telling you what happened that night. And not once was his credibility brought at issue, not one time. That\u2019s why, oh, hopefully they\u2019ll forget about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">Would the officers love to have cameras at their disposal and all kinds of high technology? I bet they would because then they wouldn\u2019t have to sit there and take that abuse for several hours. But the fact remains is they\u2019re doing the best they can with what they have to work with and since when was someone\u2019s word not good enough. Especially two veterans who have a lot to loose [sic] by making things up, pensions, credibility, livelihood. Everything to loose [sic] and nothing to gain. Not one thing to gain by it.

The court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The State continued its rebuttal, arguing that the number of ziploc bags recovered from the appellant, 13, indicated an intent to distribute. The prosecution then returned to the topic of the detectives\u2019 credibility, arguing that \u201c[t]hose officers are running towards it when the rest of us are running away from it. What they do is honorable.\u201d The court again overruled the \u201c[objection to vouching,\u201d and the State continued: \u2018You\u2019ve had the ability to judge their demeanor. They are honorable men.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">At that point, the court advised the jury that the prosecutor\u2019s \u201copinion is not evidence in this case. However, [the State] is permitted to draw an inference as to how you should think rather than how she thinks. You may continue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The State continued: \u201cThank you, Your Honor. And two honorable men, doing their jobs, saw Mr. Sivells about to sell a female buyer drugs.\u201d The prosecutor subsequently stated: \u201c[The Detectives] are honorable and they told the truth.\u201d Counsel for appellant objected again, and the court advised the jury: \u201cAgain, the State [is] sounding like its [sic] expressing its own opinion, which its [sic] not permitted to do. Please accept that as an invitation to draw an inference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">After the jury left the courtroom, the court stated: \u201cAll right, [counsel], there was a time in closing argument when you asked to approach the bench. I didn\u2019t think the issue was momentous enough so I didn\u2019t honor your request. Anything you want to say, say it now.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel responded: \u201cI was objecting to vouching, Your Honor and what initially seemed to be some burden shifting. It didn\u2019t go very far.\u201d The court disposed of the burden shifting issue and then read into the record a series of Maryland cases pertaining to vouching in closing arguments. The court then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-9\">Okay. So I made it clear to the jury that what sounded like vouching was just the effort to try to get them to draw a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>particular inference and told them that the petitioners, the prosecutor\u2019s opinion was not relevant and it shouldn\u2019t be inferred, what she said, that she was expressing her own opinion. And then I warned [the State] don\u2019t let it appear to be [State\u2019s] opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">After the verdict, appellant filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the State\u2019s comments during closing argument deprived him of a fair trial. The State argued that no vouching occurred, stating that the prosecutor \u201cspoke in generalities, not in specifics and the State made no statements based on any sort of personal knowledge but rather only made statements based on the evidence ... and opposing counsel\u2019s comments in opposing counsel[\u2019]s closing argument.\u201d The State also argued that the court\u2019s contemporaneous curative instructions rendered any error harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The court denied appellant\u2019s motion, noting that the \u201cvoir dire and the instructions\u201d informed the jury that police officers should not be afforded \u201cgreater credibility than anybody else,\u201d and that it expressly explained to the jury that the State was not permitted to offer its opinion of the officers, but that the State was merely asking them to draw an inference as to the Detectives\u2019 credibility. The court stated that the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cinterjection of her personal opinion of the officer\u2019s credibility was inartful and that she meant to say [the jury] should draw that inference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">B. Prosecutorial Vouching for Credibility</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The first step in our analysis is to determine whether the prosecutor\u2019s statements, standing alone, were improper. The Court of Appeals has made clear that it \u201cinfring[es] on a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial ... when a prosecutor \u2018vouches\u2019 for (or against) the credibility of a witness\u201d in its closing argument. <em>Spain v. State, </em>386 Md. 145, 153, 872 A.2d 25 (2005). <em>Accord Donaldson v. State, </em>416 Md. 467, 489, 7 A.3d 84 (2010). \u201cVouching typically occurs when a prosecutor \u2018places the prestige of the government behind a witness through personal assurances of the witness\u2019s veracity ... or suggests that information not presented to the jury supports the witness\u2019s testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spain, </em>386 Md. at 153, 872 A.2d 25 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>(quoting <em>United States v. Daas, </em>198 F.3d 1167, 1178 (9th Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The United States Supreme Court has explained the problems associated with prosecutorial vouching as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s vouching for the credibility of witnesses and expressing his personal opinion concerning the guilt of the accused pose two dangers: such comments can convey the impression that evidence not presented to the jury, but known to the prosecutor, supports the charges against the defendant and can thus jeopardize the defendant\u2019s right to be tried solely on the basis of the evidence presented to the jury; and the prosecutor\u2019s opinion carries with it the imprimatur of the Government and may induce the jury to trust the Government\u2019s judgment rather than its own view of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-6\"><em>Young, </em>470 U.S. at 18-19, 105 S.Ct. 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The rule against vouching does not preclude a prosecutor from addressing the credibility of witnesses in its closing argument. The credibility of witnesses in a criminal trial often is, as it was in this case, a critical issue for the jury to consider. Thus, as the Court of Appeals has recognized, \u201c \u201cwhere a prosecutor argues that a witness is being truthful based on the testimony given at trial, and does not assure the jury that the credibility of the witness is based on his own personal knowledge, the prosecutor is engaging in proper argument and is not vouching.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spain, </em>386 Md. at 155, 872 A.2d 25 (quoting <em>United States v. Walker, </em>155 F.3d 180, 187 (3rd Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Appellant points to several statements to support his argument that the prosecutor in this case engaged in improper vouching:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-9\">1. The State argued to the jury that the police officers would risk losing their pensions and jobs if they gave false testimony: \u201c[S]ince when was someone\u2019s word not good enough. Especially two veterans who have a lot to loose [sic] by making things up, pensions, credibility, livelihood.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-10\">2. The State argued to the jury that the police officers are \u201chonorable men\u201d because of what they do: \u201cThose officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>are running towards it when the rest of us are running away from it. What they do is honorable.... They are honorable men.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">3. The State argued to the jury that the police officers \u201care honorable and they told the truth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The first of these comments is similar to comments in other cases that the Court of Appeals has found improper. In <em>Spain, </em>the prosecutor argued that the State\u2019s police witness \u201chad a motive to testify truthfully because to testify falsely would expose him to the penalties of perjury and lead to adverse consequences to his career as a police officer.\u201d 386 Md. at 154, 872 A.2d 25. The Court of Appeals held that this argument \u201ctranscended the boundaries of proper argument,\u201d noting that the State had failed to introduce any evidence that the officer would lose benefits for providing perjured testimony. <em>Id. </em>The Court further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">Even if evidence had been admitted from which it could be inferred that a police officer would face serious employment consequences as a result of testifying falsely, we nonetheless would conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comments during closing argument constituted improper vouching because they also implied improperly that the witness\u2019s status as a police officer entitled him to greater credibility in the jury\u2019s eyes than any other category of witness about which the same might have been argued. Although the State is free to highlight the incentive, or lack of incentive, of a witness to testify truthfully, courts consistently have held that it is improper to argue that a police officer may be deemed more credible simply because he or she is a police officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 157, 872 A.2d 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">Similarly, in <em>Donaldson, supra, </em>416 Md. at 490, 7 A.3d 84, the prosecutor argued in rebuttal closing argument that the police detectives would not lie because \u201cthey want to keep their jobs.\u201d The Court of Appeals held that, because there was no evidence supporting the argument that the police might lose their jobs if they lied, the prosecutor\u2019s statement was improper. <em>Id. </em>at 492-93, 7 A.3d 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Here, as in <em>Spain </em>and <em>Donaldson, </em>there was no evidence to support the prosecutor\u2019s statement that the police would lose their pensions or their livelihood if they \u201cmade things up.\u201d Accordingly, this argument was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">In addition to arguing that the police had \u201ca lot to loose [sic] by making things up, pensions, credibility, livelihood,\u201d the prosecutor repeatedly referred to Detectives Wilson and Carrington as \u201chonorable men,\u201d and she specifically asserted that \u201cthey told the truth.\u201d Although a single reference to police work as \u201chonorable\u201d might not be impermissible, the repeated references to the officers as \u201chonorable men,\u201d and the ultimate statement that \u201cthey told the truth,\u201d crossed the line. The prosecutor\u2019s comments were not tied to the evidence in the case. Rather, as the trial court found, the prosecutor was expressing her personal opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the comments were not tied to the evidence presented, the comments violated the rule against vouching and were improper. <em>See United States v. Molina-Guevara, </em>96 F.3d 698, 704-05 (1996) (prosecutor\u2019s statement assuring the jury that its witness \u201c \u2018did not lie to you\u2019 \u201d suggested that the prosecutor \u201cknew more than the jury had heard and that it should be willing to trust the government\u2019s judgment,\u201d and therefore, \u201cviolated our rule against vouching\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">C. Propriety of Prosecutorial Vouching in Response to Defense Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">In <em>Spain, </em>the Court of Appeals suggested that, although prosecutorial vouching was improper standing alone, it might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>be permissible in response to a defense attack on the credibility of a State witness. 386 Md. at 157 n. 7, 872 A.2d 25 (\u201cWe reserve for another day whether comments such as those made in this case would be allowed under the \u2018invited response doctrine\u2019 as a response to a direct and specific attack on a police officer witness\u2019s veracity.\u201d). The State asserts that \u201canother day\u201d is here, and this issue must be resolved in this case. It points to appellant\u2019s recurring theme throughout the trial, including defense counsel\u2019s opening statement, cross-examination, and closing argument, that specifically attacked the detectives\u2019 veracity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The State argues that, based on this defense, the prosecution\u2019s comments in the case were proper pursuant to the \u201cinvited response\u201d doctrine, or alternatively, pursuant to the \u201copened door\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">1. Opened Door Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The State contends that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were proper pursuant to the \u201copened door\u201d doctrine, alleging that the prosecutor was \u201cmeeting] fire with fire\u201d after defense counsel \u201copened the door to the issue of the officers\u2019 honesty and personal integrity\u201d in his \u201cover-the top and improper closing argument.\u201d It argues that the prosecutor properly \u201cresponded to defense counsel\u2019s repeated cry that the officers are liars by countering that they are honorable people who were telling the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Appellant contends that the State\u2019s comments were not permissible under the \u201copened door\u201d doctrine. He argues that the State misstates the scope of the doctrine, and that the State\u2019s interpretation would \u201cresult in the State being able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>engage in impermissible vouching every time a defendant challenges the credibly and veracity of the State\u2019s witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u201cThe \u2018opened door\u2019 doctrine is based on principles of fairness and permits a party to introduce evidence that otherwise might not be admissible in order to respond to certain evidence put forth by opposing counsel.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>408 Md. at 388, 969 A.2d 989. <em>Accord Donaldson, </em>416 Md. at 492-93, 7 A.3d 84. Both this Court and the Court of Appeals have applied this doctrine to closing argument. <em>See, e.g., Mitchell, </em>408 Md. at 388, 969 A.2d 989; <em>Booze v. State, </em>111 Md.App. 208, 224, 681 A.2d 534 (1996), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>347 Md. 51, 698 A.2d 1087 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The opened door doctrine permits the admission of otherwise irrelevant evidence that has become relevant in response to the presentation of the other side\u2019s case. As the Court of Appeals has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">\u201cOpening the door\u201d is a rule of expanded relevancy; it allows the admission of evidence that is competent, but otherwise irrelevant, in order to respond to evidence introduced by the opposing party during its direct examination. Whether the opponent\u2019s evidence was admissible evidence that injected an issue into the case or inadmissible evidence that the court admitted over objection, once the \u201cdoor has been opened\u201d a party must, in fairness, be allowed to respond to that evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-8\"><em>Conyers v. State, </em>345 Md. 525, 545, 693 A.2d 781 (1997) (citations omitted). <em>Accord Mitchell, </em>408 Md. at 388, 969 A.2d 989. <em>See also </em>5 Lynn McLain, Maryland Evidence \u00a7 103:13(c)(i) (describing the opened door doctrine as permitting evidence \u201cthat previously would have been irrelevant, but has become relevant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">The opened door doctrine, however, is limited to \u201c \u2018evidence that is competent, but otherwise irrelevant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grier v. State, </em>351 Md. 241, 260, 718 A.2d 211 (1998) (quoting <em>Conyers, </em>345 Md. at 545, 693 A.2d 781). The doctrine does not permit the admission of evidence that is incompetent, <em>i.e., </em>evidence that is \u201cinadmissible for reasons other than relevan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>cy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261, 718 A.2d 211. Thus, in <em>Grier, </em>evidence of post-arrest silence, which \u2018hvas incompetent, not merely irrelevant;\u201d was not admissible under the \u201copening the door\u201d doctrine. <em>Id. Accord Clark v. State, </em>332 Md. 77, 88 n. 2, 629 A.2d 1239 (1993) (incompetent hearsay evidence inadmissible).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Here, as discussed, <em>supra, </em>the prosecutor\u2019s comments constituted inadmissible vouching. As such, the comments were not merely irrelevant, they were incompetent. Accordingly, the comments were not permissible pursuant to the opened door doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">2. Invited Response Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">We turn next to the State\u2019s argument that the comments were proper pursuant to the \u201cinvited response doctrine.\u201d The Court of Appeals has described the invited response doctrine as involving \u201ca prosecutorial argument ... made in reasonable response to improper attacks by defense counsel.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>405 Md. at 163, 950 A.2d 125 (quoting <em>Spain, </em>386 Md. at 157 n. 7, 872 A.2d 25).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">There are two important points to remember about the invited response doctrine. First, analysis pursuant to this doctrine is appropriate \u201conly when defense counsel first makes an improper argument.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>408 Md. at 382, 969 A.2d 989. <em>Accord Lee, </em>405 Md. at 169, 950 A.2d 125; <em>James v. State, </em>191 Md.App. 233, 259, 991 A.2d 122, <em>cert. denied, </em>415 Md. 338, 1 A.3d 468 (2010). <em>See also Marshall v. State, </em>415 Md. 248, 267, 999 A.2d 1029 (2010) (defense counsel\u2019s argument was \u201cnot improper, or, at the very least, not sufficiently improper to justify the prosecutor\u2019s comments\u201d under the invited response doctrine).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Second, the invited response doctrine does not condone an improper argument by the prosecutor when it is in response to an improper argument by the defense. Rather, it merely provides that, in the context of the arguments as a whole, reversal is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">The United States Supreme Court has made clear that the invited response doctrine \u201cshould not be read as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>suggesting judicial approval or \u2014 encouragement\u2014of response-in-kind that inevitably exacerbates the tensions inherent in the adversary process.\u201d <em>Young, </em>470 U.S. at 12, 105 S.Ct. 1038. <em>Accord Lee, </em>405 Md. at 169, 950 A.2d 125. The Court noted that \u201ctwo improper arguments \u2014 two apparent wrongs \u2014 do not make for a right result.\u201d <em>Young, </em>470 U.S at 11, 105 S.Ct. 1038. The \u201cinvited response\u201d doctrine does not give the prosecutor \u201clicense to make otherwise improper arguments,\u201d but rather, it looks to \u201cwhether the prosecutor\u2019s \u2018invited response,\u2019 taken in context, unfairly prejudiced the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12, 105 S.Ct. 1038. \u201c[I]f the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were \u2018invited,\u2019 and did no more than respond substantially in order to \u2018right the scale,\u2019 such comments would not warrant reversing a conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12-13, 105 S.Ct. 1038. <em>Accord Mitchell, </em>408 Md. at 382, 969 A.2d 989. The \u201c \u2018unfair prejudice flowing from the two arguments may balance each other out, thus obviating the need for a new trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lee, </em>405 Md. at 163-64, 950 A.2d 125 (quoting <em>Spain, </em>386 Md. at 157 n. 7, 872 A.2d 25).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Thus, with respect to the question left open in <em>Spain, </em>whether prosecutorial vouching is permissible under the invited response doctrine if it is in response to a defense attack on the credibility of a State witness, we hold that the answer is no. Prosecutors must recognize that, due to their \u201crole as both advocate and minister of justice,\u201d <em>Walker v. State, </em>373 Md. 360, 394-95, 818 A.2d 1078 (2003), they maintain a unique role in the criminal justice system, and they are held to a higher standard of conduct than other lawyers. They are never <em>justified </em>in engaging in improper vouching, even in response to an improper argument by defense counsel. If, however, in the heat of the trial, the prosecutor does make an improper argument, the invited response doctrine permits the court to consider whether, in context, the prosecutor\u2019s response to the defense impropriety merely balanced the unfair prejudice, such that reversal is not required.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>With this backdrop in mind, we turn to the first inquiry, whether defense counsel made an improper argument that invoked the invited response doctrine. In <em>Mitchell, </em>the Court of Appeals stated that an improper argument includes one that \u201cinvite[s] the jury to draw inferences from information that was not admitted at trial.\u201d 408 Md. at 382, 969 A.2d 989 (quoting <em>Lee, </em>405 Md. at 166, 950 A.2d 125).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">In this case, defense counsel relentlessly attacked the credibility of the officers\u2019 testimony. That, however, is not necessarily improper. The Court of Appeals has made clear that, during opening and closing arguments, \u201cit is common and permissible generally for the prosecutor and defense counsel to comment on, or attack, the credibility of the witnesses presented.\u201d <em>Spain, </em>386 Md. at 154, 872 A.2d 25. The key issue is whether the attack on the credibility of the officers was based on inferences to be drawn from the evidence. <em>See Washington v. State, </em>180 Md.App. 458, 472, 951 A.2d 885 (2008) (argument is not improper if the statements can be construed as comments \u201cfairly deducible from the evidence,\u201d even if \u201c \u2018the inferences discussed are illogical and erroneous\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 412, 326 A.2d 707 (1974)). In <em>United States v. Weatherspoon, </em>410 F.3d 1142, 1148 (9th Cir.2005), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that \u201cattacks on the credibility of a ... witness are legitimate tools of advocacy and do not, standing alone, trigger the \u2018invited response\u2019 rule,\u201d particularly when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>\u201cthe defense attacks were grounded in inferences from the evidence rather than defense counsel\u2019s personal assurances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Here, defense counsel\u2019s comments attacking the credibility of Detectives Wilson and Carrington were, for the most part, based on inferences to be drawn from the evidence presented, or not presented, at trial. Defense counsel\u2019s argument that the jury should not credit the testimony of the detectives had two primary bases: (1) the lack of evidence corroborating their testimony; and (2) the federal court\u2019s finding that Detective Wilson previously had given testimony that was not credible. During cross-examination of the detectives, defense counsel elicited testimony that, in violation of department policy, they failed to complete a citizen contact form after speaking with the unknown man and the unknown woman. Counsel elicited evidence that the detectives did not take any photographs of the individuals, nor were they able to provide a detailed physical description of the man and woman. Counsel argued that the only evidence that the man and woman existed, and that the drug transaction occurred, was the testimony of the detectives, and he asserted that the jury could infer from the absence of corroborative evidence that the detectives did not collect such evidence because it did not exist. Because defense counsel\u2019s comments in this regard had an evidentiary basis, they were not improper. <em>See James, </em>191 Md.App. at 259, 991 A.2d 122 (\u201c\u2018[I]t is within the scope of permissible argument for counsel to draw inferences from the evidence admitted at trial, which includes the ability to comment on the absence of such evidence.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Mitchell, </em>408 Md. at 383-84, 969 A.2d 989).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Defense counsel also suggested that Detective Wilson was not a credible witness based on Judge Davis\u2019 finding in a previous case that the detective\u2019s statements were \u201cincredible.\u201d These comments also were tied to the evidence presented, and they were not improper. The defense comments on the credibility of the officers did not trigger the invited response doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>At oral argument, when pressed regarding what statements made by defense counsel were improper, the State pointed to the following statement in closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">I mean, I\u2019ve seen some lame prosecutions. I\u2019ve seen some thin stuff going to the juries. This is about as thin as it ever gets. Trust me, you won\u2019t come to court and be a juror and see a case this lame again. I sure hope not. Thinner than thin.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">This statement, to the extent that it referred to defense counsel\u2019s experience in other cases, was a reference to facts not in evidence, and it was improper. <em>See State v. Cortez, </em>101 Ariz. 214, 418 P.2d 370, 371 (1966) (defense counsel\u2019s comment, that \u201c \u2018[t]his is probably the weakest case, and maybe the poorest job of police work I have seen in a long time,\u2019 \u201d was improper).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defense counsel\u2019s statement in this regard invoked the invited response doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">As indicated, the invited response doctrine provides that reversal of a defendant\u2019s conviction is not warranted if the prosecutor\u2019s response, although improper, is a \u201creasonable response\u201d to defense counsel\u2019s remarks, <em>Lee, </em>405 Md. at 163, 950 A.2d 125. Such a response is one that does \u201cno more than respond substantially in order to \u2018right the scale.\u2019\u201d <em>Young, </em>470 U.S. at 13, 105 S.Ct. 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Here, when defense counsel referred to cases other than the present case, the prosecutor did not object, nor did she request that the court give the jury a curative instruction. She did not respond to counsel\u2019s statements by advising the jury that its job was to decide the case on the evidence in this case, as opposed to counsel\u2019s assertions comparing this case to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">The objected to comments, that the officers could lose their pensions and their livelihood if they lied, and that these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>honorable officers \u201ctold the truth,\u201d were not a response to defense counsel\u2019s argument that this was one of the lamest prosecutions he had seen. Rather, it was a response to defense counsel\u2019s attacks on the credibility of the officers, and we have already concluded that these credibility attacks were not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s response, vouching for the credibility of the State\u2019s primary witnesses against appellant, was not a reasonable response to an improper defense remark; we cannot say that the comments did no more than \u201cright the scale\u201d after an improper defense comment. The invited response doctrine does not salvage the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">D. Prejudicial Error</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">There is one final step in our analysis. Even though the prosecutor\u2019s comments were improper, and they were not a reasonable response pursuant to the opened door doctrine or the invited response doctrine, reversal is not automatically mandated. Rather, \u201c \u2018reversal is only required where it appears that the remarks of the prosecutor actually misled the jury or were likely to have misled or influenced the jury to the prejudice of the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spain, </em>386 Md. at 158, 872 A.2d 25 (quoting <em>Degren, </em>352 Md. at 430-31, 722 A.2d 887). <em>Accord Donaldson, supra, </em>416 Md. at 496-97, 7 A.3d 84. \u201cIn determining whether an error prejudiced the defendant, that is, whether the error was harmless, \u2018the determinative factor ... has been whether or not the [error], in relation to the totality of the evidence, played a significant role in influencing the rendition of the verdict, to the prejudice of the [defendant].\u2019 \u201d <em>Degren, </em>352 Md. at 432, 722 A.2d 887 (quoting <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 653, 350 A.2d 665 (1976)). To find harmless error, we must be \u201c \u2018able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict.\u2019\u201d <em>Lee, </em>405 Md. at 164, 950 A.2d 125 (quoting <em>Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d 665).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>To assess whether a prosecutor\u2019s improper statements constitute reversible error, we consider various factors, including \u201cthe severity of the remarks, cumulatively, the weight of the evidence against the accused and the measures taken to cure any potential prejudice.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>405 Md. at 174, 950 A.2d 125. <em>Accord Henry v. State, </em>324 Md. 204, 232, 596 A.2d 1024 (1991) (court must assess: \u201c 1) the closeness of the case, 2) the centrality of the issue affected by the error, and 3) the steps taken to mitigate the effects of the error\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>Collins v. State, </em>318 Md. 269, 280, 568 A.2d 1 (1990)), <em>cert. denied, </em>503 U.S. 972, 112 S.Ct. 1590, 118 L.Ed.2d 307 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">An important factor in assessing the prejudicial effect of improper statements is the strength of the State\u2019s case against the defendant. If the State has a strong case, the likelihood that an improper comment will influence the jury\u2019s verdict is reduced. <em>See Young, </em>470 U.S. at 19-20, 105 S.Ct. 1038 (although prosecutor\u2019s comments during rebuttal closing argument expressing his personal opinion about the credibility of a witness was improper, it did not prejudice the defendant because overwhelming evidence of guilt \u201celiminates any lingering doubt that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks unfairly prejudiced the jury\u2019s deliberations\u201d); <em>Wilhelm, </em>272 Md. at 427, 326 A.2d 707 (\u201cAnother \u2018important and significant factor\u2019 where prejudicial remarks might have been made is whether or not the judgment of conviction was \u2018substantially swayed by the error,\u2019 or where the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt was \u2018overwhelming.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Here, the State\u2019s case against appellant primarily involved the testimony of Detectives Wilson and Carrington. They were the only witnesses to testify regarding the observations of what appeared to be a drug transaction and the recovery of 13 ziploc bags of cocaine on appellant\u2019s person. There was no confession by appellant, nor any fingerprints, photographs, or other circumstantial evidence to corroborate the detective\u2019s testimony regarding their observations. Although the detectives\u2019 testimony certainly was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s guilty verdict, it cannot be characterized as overwhelming. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>This factor weighs against a finding that the prosecutor\u2019s comments did not influence the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">In <em>Donaldson, supra, </em>416 Md. at 499-500, 7 A.3d 84, the Court of Appeals came to a similar conclusion. In that case, where Donaldson\u2019s \u201centire defense centered on the detectives\u2019 credibility and the accuracy of their testimony,\u201d and where the evidence was strongly disputed, the Court stated that it could not conclude that the evidence \u201cwas so overwhelming that the prosecutor\u2019s improper statements could not have influenced the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The next factor to consider is the nature of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks. In assessing this factor, we consider whether there was one isolated comment, as opposed to multiple improper comments, and whether the comments related to an issue that was central to a determination of the case or a peripheral issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">In <em>Spain, </em>386 Md. at 159, 872 A.2d 25, for example, in finding that the vouching by the prosecutor was harmless error, the Court of Appeals noted that the prosecution made only one improper comment, \u201can isolated event that did not pervade the entire trial.\u201d In <em>Donaldson, supra, </em>416 Md. at 498, 7 A.3d 84, by contrast, the Court found the prosecutor\u2019s improper vouching to be prejudicial error, noting that the prosecutor made several improper comments \u201cthat played an important role\u201d in closing argument.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Here, as in <em>Donaldson, </em>the prosecutor made several improper comments in an attempt to bolster the credibility of Detectives Wilson and Carrington. These detectives were the sole witnesses to the events giving rise to appellant\u2019s conviction. The credibility, or lack thereof, of these witnesses was the critical issue in this case, and it was the centerpiece of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>appellant\u2019s defense. The importance of the issue, and the repeated improper remarks, weigh against a finding of harmless error. <em>See Weatherspoon, </em>410 F.3d at 1151 (where \u201cthe case ... was not particularly strong and depended in large measure on witness credibility,\u201d improper vouching by the prosecutor \u201cpresents] a strong possibility of prejudicial effect\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">The final factor to consider is whether the trial court gave any curative instructions. Here, the court did attempt to minimize the prejudice from the prosecutor\u2019s comments. On two occasions, the court told the jury that the prosecutor was not permitted to express her opinion. When the prosecutor first stated that the detectives were \u201chonorable men,\u201d the trial judge instructed the jurors that the prosecutor\u2019s opinion was \u201cnot evidence in this case,\u201d stating that the prosecutor was merely \u201cpermitted to draw an inference as to how you should think rather than how she thinks.\u201d When the prosecutor again stated that the detectives were honorable and \u201ctold the truth,\u201d the court instructed the jury: \u201cAgain, the State is sounding like its [sic] expressing its own opinion, which its [sic] not permitted to do. Please accept that as an invitation to draw an inference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Moreover, in its initial jury instructions, the court instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">You are the sole judge of whether a witness should be believed. In making this decision you may apply your own common sense and everyday experiences. In determining whether a witness should be believed, you should carefully judge all of the testimony and evidence and the circumstances under which the witness testified. You should consider such factors as (1) the witness behavior on the stand and manner of testifying; (2) did the witness appear to be telling the truth; (3) the witness opportunity to see or hear things about which testimony was given; (4) the accuracy of the witness\u2019s memory; (5) does the witness have a motive not to tell the truth; (6) does the witness have an interest in the outcome of the case; (7) was the witness\u2019s testimony consistent; (8) was the witness\u2019s testimony sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>ported or contradicted by evidence that you believe; and (9) whether and the extent to which the witness\u2019s testimony in court differed from any statements made by the witness on any previous occasion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">You need not believe any witness, even if the testimony is uncontradicted. You may believe all, part or none of the testimony of any witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">In <em>Spain, </em>386 Md. at 159-60, 872 A.2d 25, where the prosecutor improperly vouched for the credibility of the State\u2019s witness, the Court of Appeals looked to similar curative instructions in finding no reversible error. In that case, the trial court responded to the prosecutor\u2019s argument with an instruction that the prosecutor\u2019s statements were merely argument, and, similar to this case, the court instructed the jurors prior to deliberations that the jurors were the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Id. </em>at 160-61, 872 A.2d 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">In finding that the curative instructions diminished any undue prejudice, the Court weighed the effect of the curative instruction against the other relevant factors. <em>Id. </em>at 161, 872 A.2d 25. The Court noted that there had been only one improper comment by the prosecutor, and it further noted that the potential impact of the comments was limited given that the defense argument was that the police officer had a faulty memory, not that he had lied. <em>Id. </em>The Court held that, given \u201cthe relative lack of severity of the improper remarks, the lack of potential impact of the erroneous argument,\u201d and the curative instruction given by the judge, the erroneous argument \u201cin no way influenced the verdict.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Here, by contrast, after weighing all the factors, we conclude that a new trial is warranted. The prosecutor made not one, but several, improper comments. The comments dealt with the credibility of the detectives, the central issue in the case. Under these circumstances, and given that the primary evidence against appellant was the detectives\u2019 testimony, we cannot say that the curative instructions given by the judge were sufficient to cure the potential prejudice from the improper vouching. We are unable to conclude, beyond a rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>sonable doubt, that the comments did not influence the jury to the defendant\u2019s prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">REMAINING ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Appellant raises two further questions on appeal. Because we are reversing appellant\u2019s convictions, and the issue regarding rebuttal testimony is not likely to recur, we will not address it. Because the issue regarding the suppression of the drugs is likely to arise at a retrial, we will address it for guidance to the parties and the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the drugs found on his person, arguing that the police did not have probable cause to arrest him. The State contends that the trial court \u201ccorrectly denied [appellant\u2019s] motion to suppress cocaine found on his person where the court found the Detectives\u2019 testimony credible and that testimony provided probable cause for arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">The standard of review for a circuit court\u2019s decision on a motion to suppress is well-settled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-10\">\u201cIn reviewing a circuit court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion to suppress evidence, we ordinarily consider only the evidence contained in the record of the suppression hearing. The factual findings of the suppression court and its conclusions regarding the credibility of testimony are accepted unless clearly erroneous. We review the evidence and the inferences that may be reasonably drawn in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. We undertake our own constitutional appraisal of the record by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the present case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-11\"><em>McFarlin v. State, </em>409 Md. 391, 403, 975 A.2d 862 (2009) (quoting <em>Rush v. State, </em>403 Md. 68, 82-83, 939 A.2d 689 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">Here, the suppression court, crediting the testimony of the detectives, stated that there was substantial precedent permitting a finding of probable cause when police officers observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>a cash transaction for an unidentified object, if the surrounding circumstances suggested that the unidentified object was contraband. The court concluded that, given the nature of appellant\u2019s interaction with the unknown woman, and the fact that appellant then reached into his sock, the police had probable cause to arrest appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">This Court recently discussed the concept of probable cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">To determine whether probable cause exists, we consider the totality of the circumstances, in light of the facts found to be credible by the trial judge, factoring in the variables of the information leading to police action, the environment, the police purpose, and the suspect\u2019s conduct. Probable cause exists where the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of the officer at the time of the arrest, or of which the officer has reasonably trustworthy information, are sufficient to warrant a prudent person in believing that the suspect had committed or was committing a criminal offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-6\"><em>Stokeling v. State, </em>189 Md.App. 653, 663, 985 A.2d 175 (2009) (quotations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 Md. 332, 995 A.2d 297 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The testimony in this case supports the suppression court\u2019s finding that there was probable cause to believe that appellant was in possession of a controlled dangerous substance. Detectives Wilson and Carrington responded to the area in response to a complaint of narcotics activity. They observed a woman ask an unknown man if there was \u201cany ready out,\u201d a term that, in their experience, is used to refer to cocaine. The man directed the woman to an alley where appellant was standing. The Detectives observed the woman and appellant talk briefly, whereupon the woman reached into her purse to take out money, while the appellant reached into his sock. Detective Wilson, who was accepted as an expert in the \u201cidentification, packaging and sale of narcotics, specifically cocaine, within Baltimore City,\u201d testified that he believed that a narcotics transaction was about to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>In <em>Williams v. State, 188 </em>Md.App. 78, 981 A.2d 46, <em>cert. denied, </em>411 Md. 742, 985 A.2d 589 (2009), this Court addressed a similar scenario. In that case, a police officer, who testified as an expert in controlled substance transactions, observed Williams hand a small object to another man in exchange for money. <em>Id. </em>at 83, 981 A.2d 46. The officer testified that, \u201cbased on his experience and training, he believed that appellant was the dealer and the other man was the buyer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84, 981 A.2d 46. The transaction occurred in an area described as an \u201c \u2018open air drug market.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93, 981 A.2d 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">This Court rejected the argument that probable cause could not be found because the officer could not identify the objects exchanged. <em>Id. </em>at 95-97, 981 A.2d 46. Judge Hollander, writing for this Court, noted that \u201cmany other jurisdictions that have considered the issue [have] concluded that probable cause may be found even if a trained, experienced police officer is not able to see whether the object transferred by one person to another was contraband.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93, 981 A.2d 46. We held that the officer \u201cdid not need absolute certainty in regard to the objects that were exchanged ... to obtain probable cause,\u201d and that, under the totality of the circumstances, the officer had probable cause to believe he had observed a drug transaction. <em>Id. </em>at 96-97, 981 A.2d 46. <em>Accord Donaldson, </em>416 Md. at 486-87, 7 A.3d 84 (probable cause to arrest based on exchange of unidentified item for money \u201cif the totality of the circumstances supports the conclusion that the exchange involved an unlawful substance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Applying this analysis, the detectives in this case had probable cause to arrest appellant. Detective Wilson, who responded to the area in response to a complaint of narcotics activity, and who was accepted as a drug expert, testified that, based on his experience, he believed that a drug transaction was about to occur. That the police did not wait to observe drugs actually be exchanged is of no moment. The evidence was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that there was probable cause to arrest, which permitted a search of appellant\u2019s person incident to arrest. <em>See Stokeling, </em>189 Md.App. at 671-72, 985 A.2d 175 (once the police had probable cause to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>arrest appellant for drug possession, they were justified in searching his person incident to arrest).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.

By stating that a prosecutor is not justified in responding to a defense attack on the credibility of a State\u2019s witness by vouching for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>credibility of the witness, we are not suggesting that the prosecutor take no action in response to improper defense argument. In <em>United States v.
