But this is such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">At the center of the controversy is a 2007 enactment of the General Assembly creating administrative and judicial remedies for a first-party insured against a property and casualty insurer who fails to act in good faith in denying coverage or declining payment for a covered loss. Chapter 150, <em>Laws of </em>2007.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The law also confers on the parties the right to have \u201cthe case\u201d tried by a jury. CJP \u00a7 3-1701(j). Before filing a \u201ccivil action\u201d for damages under the statute, an insured must file a complaint with the Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA) and obtain a final decision from that agency after a \u201cpaper hearing\u201d or from the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) after a contested case hearing. CJP \u00a7 3-1701(c)(1) and INS \u00a7 27-1001(c)(1) and (d)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> INS \u00a7 27-1001(g)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-9\">If a party receives an adverse decision, the party may appeal a final decision by the Administration or an administrative law judge under this section to a circuit court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>accordance with \u00a7 2-215 of this article and Title 10, Subtitle 2 of the State Government Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">And, subsection (g)(3) goes on to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an appeal to a circuit court under this section shall be heard de novo.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUa\">CJP \u00a7 3-1701 contains no express venue provision and, if that section stood alone, this cause of action would likely be subject to the general venue statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, the statutes referenced in INS \u00a7 27-1001(g)(1) suggest two additional venue possibilities. Venue in the Administrative Procedure Act is governed by Md.Code (1984, 2009 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-222(c) of the State Government Article (SG), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">Unless otherwise required by statute, a petition for judicial review shall be filed with the circuit court for the county where any party resides or has a principal place of business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Finally, INS \u00a7 2-215(c) provides that when a party petitions for judicial review of certain decisions of the Insurance Commissioner, a Baltimore City venue may be proper.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>appellant\u2019s reliance on this provision for her asserted \u201cde novo review\u201d of a MIA decision by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City that is the primary focus of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">On October 6, 2005, appellant, Christina Thompson, was involved in an automobile accident in Millersville in Anne Arundel County. The insurer for the other driver settled with appellant for its policy limit of $20,000. However, appellant also had uninsured/ underinsured motorist coverage with her insurer, appellee, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (\u201cState Farm\u201d). She made a first-party claim with State Farm for $80,000 that was rejected by the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Appellant then filed a complaint with MIA alleging a violation of INS \u00a7 27-1001. On December 3, 2008, after reviewing the records, the Associate Deputy Commissioner, acting on behalf of the Insurance Commissioner, issued a Decision denying and dismissing the complaint. In so doing, MIA, among other things, concluded that State Farm was not obligated to pay appellant\u2019s claim and did not breach a duty to act in good faith. Appellant did not administratively contest MIA\u2019s determination by requesting a de novo contested case hearing at OAH. INS \u00a7 27-1001(f). Thus, the MIA determination became a \u201cfinal decision\u201d under INS \u00a7 27-1001(f)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">On December 30, 2008, appellant filed a Complaint and Election of Jury Trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. In her two-count complaint, appellant asserted that State Farm breached its insurance contract by refusing to offer any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>additional money for her claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, she alleged that State Farm\u2019s \u201cfailure to settle this matter within the policy limits of $100,000 constituted a Failure to Act in Good Faith as set forth in Section 3-1701 of the [CJP] Article and Section 27-1001 of the [INS] Article.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> She demanded a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Appellant did not label her filing a petition for judicial review of the MIA determination, <em>see </em>Md. Rule 7-202(b) and INS \u00a7 2-215(e), but in paragraph 10 (under Count II), she stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">Procedurally, this matter was presented to the Maryland Insurance Administration for adjudication of the Plaintiffs Complaint. Having found no lack of good faith on the part of the Defendant [sic], the Plaintiff files this Complaint seeking a <em>de novo </em>review pursuant to Section 2-215 of the Insurance Article and Title 10, Subtitle 2 of the State Government Article, Annotated Code of Maryland. As such, venue is proper in this jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">She prayed for $100,000 damages under each count plus attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Under Count II, she also sought \u201cpenalties (not exceeding $125,000.00), as allowed by law.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rather than following the Maryland Rules governing notice to and service upon an administrative agency,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>served State Farm in care of the Insurance Commissioner as the insurer\u2019s resident agent, apparently, under INS \u00a7 4-107, CJP \u00a7 6-306 and Md. Rule 2-124(d). MIA did not notify \u201cah parties\u201d of the filing of a petition for judicial review, <em>see </em>Md. Rule 7-202(d) and (e), or transmit the administrative record to a circuit court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Md. Rule 7-206 and INS \u00a7 2-215(g).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Instead, the court record discloses that the agency as resident agent merely forwarded the complaint to State Farm. MIA made no effort to participate or intervene in the litigation; nor does the record disclose any request or demand for the agency\u2019s presence. Appellant did not pray for relief against MIA, such as that authorized by INS \u00a7 2-215(h) or SG \u00a7 10-222(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">On March 30, 2009, State Farm filed a Motion to Dismiss appellant\u2019s complaint, serving it on appellant\u2019s counsel, but not MIA. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 7-204(b).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The insurer contended that appellant did not have a statutory right to a Baltimore City venue under INS \u00a7 2-215 or the APA and that, under the <em>forum non conveniens </em>doctrine, Anne Arundel County was the more appropriate venue for appellant\u2019s action. Appellant opposed the motion, relying on INS \u00a7 2-215, and argued that it would have been an abuse of discretion for a court to disturb a plaintiffs choice of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">On May 29, 2009, the circuit court held a hearing on the motion, which was treated by the court as a motion to trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>fer. After argument, the court rejected the contention that INS \u00a7 2-215 could be applied in this case to permit a Baltimore City forum and concluded that a transfer to Anne Arundel County was warranted. Specifically, the circuit judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-4\">Well, what I have before me, however, is a civil action with an election for jury trial. Now, you may have styled it as a complaint seeking a de novo review, and it will be a de novo hearing, but it was filed as a complaint for a civil action in this case. Now, I understand that deference is to be made to the Plaintiff with regard to his or her choice of forum. However, this is ... now a motion seeking transfer for forum nonconveniens, wherein deciding those motions\u2014 when the Plaintiff chooses outside the forum in which he or she lives, less deference is given to [her] choice of forum if the other considerations that the Court must [examine in deciding] the motion for forum nonconveniens.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Then, he noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">In this case, both the Plaintiff and the other driver ... one lived in Anne Arundel County and the other lived in some other County. I thought they both lived in Anne Arundel County, but neither one of them live here in Baltimore City. The [accident] occurred ... in Anne Arundel County, the medical providers, from what I understand, were in Anne Arundel County or Calvert County, and the accident was investigated by police officers in Anne Arundel County. Now, I understand that the appeal is to be heard de novo, but this appeal is \u2014 it\u2019s styled as a complaint for a civil action, which has no ties to Baltimore City. Although, I can take notice that, I guess, State Farm does have an office here since ... I was insured with State Farm ... But I don\u2019t see the ties to Baltimore City, even reading the statute as you had me read it. The motion for forum non conveniens to transfer in the interest of justice is granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">On June 2, 2009, an order was entered denying the motion to dismiss and granting the motion to transfer. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>QUESTIONS PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Appellant has asked us to address the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">I. Whether the caption or the body of a complaint controls its characterization as a de novo appeal of an Insurance Administration finding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">II. Whether the trial court abused its discretion in transferring a bad faith de novo appeal of an Insurance Administration finding, where the underinsured motorist insurer waived its right to subrogate against the underinsured tortfeasor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">State Farm has phrased the issues in this fashion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">I. Whether the lower court acted properly within its discretion and in the interest of justice in ordering the transfer of the case on the grounds of <em>forum, non conveniens </em>as Thompson had no ties to Baltimore City, regardless of whether the case involved a lack of good faith claim and the insurance carrier waived subrogation against the tortfeasor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">II. Whether an appeal of a decision by the Maryland Insurance Administration requested pursuant to Ann. Md.Code, Insurance, \u00a7 2-215 is a separate and distinct action from a civil action filed pursuant to Ann. Md. Code, Court and Judicial Proceedings, \u00a7 3-1701.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-10\">III. Whether a party who appeals a decision by the Maryland Insurance Administration pursuant to Ann. Md. Code, Insurance, \u00a7 2-215(a) is precluded from seeking a jury trial and conducting discovery as provided for by the Maryland Rules of Civil Procedure, and (b) if the party is an individual, whether she is limited to jurisdiction in the county where she resides.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">For reasons that follow, we affirm the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b252-13\">A. Venue for De Novo Review</p>\n<p id=\"b252-14\">While our review of a decision to transfer an action on <em>forum, non conveniens </em>grounds is governed by an abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>discretion standard, <em>Urquhart v. Simmons, </em>339 Md. 1, 17, 660 A.2d 412 (1995), appellant\u2019s contention that the circuit court erred in not permitting a Baltimore City venue for the de novo review of the MIA decision is a purely legal question that we review, appropriately, de novo. The latter issue is complicated by: 1) the constitutional problems associated with the assertion of a statutory right to de novo judicial review by a jury of an administrative agency determination; 2) the difficulties in reconciling the statutory provision for de novo review, INS \u00a7 27-1001(g), when a plaintiff has taken the \u201cpaper hearing\u201d route to court and the judicial review mechanisms found in INS \u00a7 2-215, SG \u00a7 10-222 and Title 7, Chapter 200 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure; and 3) the fact that appellant has ignored most of the requirements of these provisions. In our view, these complications make it impossible for appellant to get where she wants to go, <em>viz. </em>Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">1. Constitutional Concerns</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">At first glance, appellant\u2019s demand for a Baltimore City jury to review de novo MIA\u2019s rejection of her claim appears to be inconsistent with the Court of Appeals\u2019 landmark decision in <em>Department of Natural Resources v. Linchester Sand &amp; Gravel Corp., </em>274 Md. 211, 334 A.2d 514 (1975). There, the Court invalidated a statute which conferred upon a person denied a wetlands permit and dissatisfied with an administrative adjudication of the matter, a right to de novo judicial review and a jury trial. Such a scheme, the Court held, invaded the powers of the Executive Branch and imposed nonjudicial duties on the Judiciary in violation of the Separation of Powers Clause of Article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. <em>Id. </em>at 225-29, 334 A.2d 514. Specifically, the Court said: \u201cIt was not competent ... for the court to empanel a jury and then in effect instruct it to convert itself into an administrative body \"with authority, as if original, to grant or deny a permit....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228, 334 A.2d 514. It recognized that \u201cin very rare instances,\u201d the Legislature could create administrative agencies whose functions are subject to \u201ca broader scope of judicial review\u201d and pointed to the \u201csingu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>lar [] example\u201d of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission. <em>Id. </em>at 227, 334 A.2d 514. The Court did not question the de novo judicial review mechanism established for workers\u2019 compensation claims because the Commission\u2019s \u201cactivities are in substitution for traditional common law rights and procedures while at the same time it functions to establish a remedy otherwise the subject of a tort action.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Mindful of our obligation, if possible, to construe a statute to avoid a constitutional question, <em>In re Roberto d.B., </em>399 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>267, 283, 923 A.2d 115 (2007), we believe the damage remedy/jury trial right authorized by CJP \u00a7 3-1701 is independent from a true de novo review of the MIA administrative determination, which is more appropriately characterized as a precondition to the civil suit.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This, of course, undercuts appellant\u2019s reliance on INS \u00a7 2-215 (or the APA) as controlling venue in this case. There is textual support for this route to a constitutional statute. Neither INS \u00a7 2-215 nor the APA \u2014 although incorporated by reference in INS \u00a7 27-1001(g)(1) \u2014 contemplates a jury trial for a damage claim. SG \u00a7 10-222(g) expressly prohibits a jury trial in an APA case. In addition, in the 1993 APA revision, the statutory predecessor to INS \u00a7 2-215, was specifically amended to prohibit the taking of additional evidence (outside the administrative record). <em>See </em>n. 13, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, in the words of INS \u00a7 27-1001(g)(1), an insured would not be appealing \u201cin accordance with\u201d these statutes by praying a jury trial. If a plaintiff under CJP \u00a7 3-1701 seeks to present evidence before a jury, he or she is acting under that specific statute and not under the provisions upon which appellant relies. This is \u201cthe case\u201d for which the General Assembly conferred a jury trial right under CJP \u00a7 3-1701(j).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>2. Square Pegs and Round Holes</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">We have already pointed out some of the difficulties in harmonizing appellant\u2019s damage action/de novo appeal with the judicial review provisions in INS \u00a7 2-215, SG 10-222 and the Maryland Rules of Procedure. However, more square pegs and round holes abound in the statute if a plaintiff, like appellant, chooses to go directly to court after a \u201cpaper hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Clearly, appellant was entitled to choose this route and not seek a contested case hearing at OAH. INS \u00a7 27-1001(c) and CJP \u00a7 3 \u2014 1701(c)(1). However, this selection further points out the inapplicability of INS \u00a7 2-215 and SG \u00a7 10-222. Both provisions are triggered in cases where the petitioner seeks judicial review after a more formal, in-person hearing. INS \u00a7 2-215(a)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and SG \u00a7 10-222(a).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Their language would seem to indicate that they do not apply to \u201cpaper hearings.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Moreover, of the eight subsections of INS \u00a7 2-215 arguably relevant to appellant\u2019s action, four reference contested case hearings, subsections (a), (b), (d) and (g), which she did not request, two more speak of a petition for judicial review, subsections (e) and (f), which appellant did not file, and another deals with relief against MIA, subsection (h), which she did not seek. Under these circumstances, appellant\u2019s insistence that the venue provision of subsection (c) nevertheless applies to her case seems far-fetched.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">3. Compliance with the Requirements for a Petition for Judicial Review</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Ultimately, appellant\u2019s contention that her venue choice is tied to filing a petition for judicial review fails because she did not comply with most of the procedural requirements associated with such a filing.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Appellant asserts that the circuit court\u2019s rejection of a Baltimore City venue under INS \u00a7 2-215 was based simply and incorrectly on the captioning, styling and labeling of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>complaint. While we agree that in gauging pleadings, courts \u201care expected to look at the substance of the allegations ... not merely at labels,\u201d <em>Alitalia Linee Aeree Italiane, supra, </em>320 Md. at 195, 577 A.2d 34, much more is found wanting here.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">First, captioning a petition for judicial review in accordance with Md. Rule 7-202 (as INS \u00a7 2-215(e) expressly requires) has a number of domino-type consequences.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> For example, the Clerk of Court will then send the petition to the agency, Md. Rule 7-202(d)(1), and the agency will notify the parties. The time for filing a response to the petition is controlled by the date of such notice. Md. Rule 7-204(c). The time for the agency to transmit the administrative record to the circuit court is triggered by the clerk\u2019s mailing of the petition. Md. Rule 7-206(c); INS \u00a7 2-215(g). The deadline for filing memoranda runs 30 days from the date the clerk sends notice of the filing of the administrative record. Md. Rule 7-207(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Secondly, not only did appellant not caption her pleading as a petition for judicial review, she served it like a civil action against an insurer. There was no compliance with notice and record transmittal requirements. In fact, the only way the Associate Deputy Commissioner\u2019s decision got into the record was as an attachment to State Farm\u2019s motion to dismiss and to appellant\u2019s opposition. No relief was prayed against MIA and no attempt was made to bring the agency into the case. The timing of State Farm\u2019s motion was apparently regarded by all parties as governed by rules applicable in civil actions, not those for judicial review of agency actions. <em>See </em>n. 12, <em>supra. </em>Despite the brief reference to de novo review via INS \u00a7 2-215 in a single paragraph of appellant\u2019s complaint, in our view, she did not file a petition for judicial review under this statute and cannot plausibly claim Baltimore City as a venue under \u00a7 2-215(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Finally, the likely purpose for a Baltimore City venue under INS \u00a7 2 \u2014 215(c) is for the convenience of MIA (or possibly insurers based in the City). Such a purpose is ill-served in a case such as this where MIA is virtually invisible and where its record is not before the court<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and its decision appears to be a nullity once appellant has filed her civil action under CJP \u00a7 3-1701.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">4. If not INS \u00a7 2-215(c), then what statute governs venue?</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">If INS \u00a7 2-215(c) does not dictate a Baltimore City venue, we still must determine what statute governs venue when an insured prays a jury trial under CJP \u00a7 3-170(j). Because the latter statute is an independent remedy and other possible statutory provisions are inapplicable, we believe venue in this case is governed by the general venue statute, CJP \u00a7 6-201. <em>See </em>n. 4, <em>supra. </em>Thus, if Baltimore City is the proper place for appellant\u2019s suit, it would not be because of statutory dictate, but because it is the most convenient forum chosen.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>B. Forum Non Conveniens</p>\n<p id=\"Axn\">1. Legal Standards</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">We review the transfer on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens </em>for an abuse of discretion. The decision whether to transfer an action is \u201cpredominantly fact-driven.\u201d <em>Leung v. Nunes, </em>354 Md. 217, 226, 729 A.2d 956 (1999). The circuit court enjoys wide discretion in determining whether to transfer an action on the grounds of <em>forum non conveniens, </em>and a reviewing court should be reluctant to substitute its judgment for that of the trial court. <em>Wagner v. Wagner, </em>109 Md.App. 1, 52, 674 A.2d 1 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Maryland Rule 2-327(c) provides: \u201cOn motion of any party, the court may transfer any action to any other circuit court where the action might have been brought if the transfer is for the convenience of the parties and witnesses and serves the interests of justice.\u201d In <em>Odenton Dev. Co. v. Lamy, </em>320 Md. 33, 40, 575 A.2d 1235 (1990), the Court of Appeals adopted a balancing test to determine whether transfer to a more convenient venue was warranted. In deciding to transfer a case on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens, </em>a court must weigh in the balance the convenience of the witnesses and those public-interest factors of systemic integrity and fairness that, in addition to private concerns, come under the heading of the interest of justice. <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citations omitted). In <em>Stidham v.

Adventist Healthcare, </em>149 Md.App. 431, 439, 816 A.2d 117 (2003). However, less deference is accorded a plaintiffs choice of forum when she is not a resident of that jurisdiction. <em>Stidham, </em>161 Md.App. at 569, 870 A.2d 1285. The party seeking transfer has the burden of presenting evidence that weighs strongly in its favor. <em>See Nodeen v. Sigurdsson, </em>408 Md. 167, 180, 968 A.2d 1075 (2009) (\u201cAlthough the court generally has wide discretion in deciding whether to grant the motion, it is an abuse of that discretion for the court to disturb a plaintiffs choice of venue when the balance does not weigh strongly in favor of the proponents of the transfer.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">2. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">There is no local interest in burdening a Baltimore City jury with deciding this case. The collision occurred in Anne Arundel County. This is where appellant resides, and according to unchallenged representations of State Farm, this is where the other driver lives.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> State Farm concedes that it does business in Baltimore City, but it does so in a number of subdivisions, including Anne Arundel County. Appellant\u2019s medical providers were located in Anne Arundel or Calvert County. The accident was investigated by the Anne Arundel County police. The insurance contract which appellant asserts has been breached was entered into in Calvert County. The claim was processed at a State Farm office in Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Appellant responds that the convenience of non-City witnesses is not a factor because State Farm has waived subrogation and is precluded from contesting liability for the accident. This contention was not made in the circuit court. But even if it had been made, a jury will still have to decide the issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>damages and the testimony of investigating officers and treating physicians could likely bear on that question. Moreover, any testimony on the key issue in this case \u2014 -whether State Farm acted in good faith in denying appellant\u2019s claim \u2014 will very likely come from witnesses located outside Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Finally, the fact that MIA, located in Baltimore City, rejected appellant\u2019s complaint does not tip the balance in favor of a City forum. She has not named MIA as a party. Nor does she seek review or consideration of MIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">In our view, the circuit court carefully considered appellant\u2019s right to a Baltimore City venue, discounted, of course, by the fact that she does not live there, and appropriately weighed the convenience of witnesses and public interest factors such as the absence of a local interest. The circuit judge did not abuse his discretion in determining that the evidence weighed strongly in favor of transferring appellant\u2019s case to Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">ORDER OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.

Appellant did not challenge the venue motion as untimely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b254-5\">. The impact of <em>Linchester Sand and Gravel </em>on similar de novo judicial review provisions in Maryland statutes (including the insurance laws) was an issue considered by the Commission to Revise the Administrative Procedure Act in 1991-92 and addressed in its substantive statutory revision, Chapter 59, <em>Laws of 1993. </em>The Commission's report noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7v\">The Commission recommends that, except in the unique circumstances of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission and the Health Claims Arbitration Office there should be no further <em>\"de novo </em>\u201d appeals of administrative decisions. One of the changes suggested by the Insurance Division for its statute (and included in the attached draft bill) is the elimination of the provision allowing parties to offer new evidence to the Circuit Court, and purporting to require the Circuit Court to hear cases <em>\"de novo.\u201d </em>We agree completely with this suggestion of the Insurance Division and we note that, in practice, Circuit Court Judges have not applied this provision and have prohibited the introduction of <em>\"de novo </em>\u201d evidence. Indeed, allowing such evidence could very well be a violation of the separation of powers doctrine. <em>See Department of Natural Resources v. Linchester, </em>274 Md. 211, 224-25, 334 A.2d 514 (1975). For these reasons, we further recommend that, except in the very limited circumstances of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission and the Health Claims Arbitration Office, <em>de novo </em>evidence should generally not be allowed to be introduced before a Court reviewing a decision of any State agency. This change would be accomplished by adding Section 32 to Article 1 of the Annotated Code, as proposed in the attached bill.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-6\"><em>See Report of the Commission to Revise the Administrative Procedure Act </em>(Sept. 1, 1992) at p. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The Commission\u2019s solution was to add to the Rules of Interpretation Article a possible \"Humpty-Dumpty definition.\u201d Department of Legislative Services, <em>Maryland Style Manual for Statutory Law </em>(July, 2008) at 27, in which \"de novo\u201d judicial review of agency action meant review upon an administrative record with the limited additional evidence mechanisms specified in SG \u00a7 10-222(f) and (g). <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957, 2005 Repl.Vol.), Article 1, \u00a7 32. The 2007 good faith insurance legislation exempted its de novo appeal from the operation of this statute. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 32(b)(3). Obviously, the 2007 legislation intended, to the extent constitutionally permitted, unfettered de novo review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b255-5\">. This conclusion reflects the views expressed in a March 23, 2007 advice letter from the Attorney General\u2019s Office to the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. This advice letter focused only on the de novo appeal of an insured who possessed a judicial remedy under CJP \u00a7 3-1701 and not on the case of an insurer who received an adverse decision from MIA and for whom judicial review under INS \u00a7 27-1001(g)(1) is its exclusive remedy. Whether de novo judicial review in such a case is permitted under <em>Linchester Sand and Gravel </em>is not presently before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b255-6\">. Md. Rule 7-208(c), which provides that <em>\u2018\u2018[ajdditional </em>evidence in support of or against the agency\u2019s decision is not allowed <em>unless permitted by law,\" </em>also does little to advance appellant\u2019s case. (Emphasis added). This rule does not contemplate the type of de novo review sought by appellant, because it envisions judicial consideration of the agency record, Md. Rule 7-208(b), <em>along with </em>additional in-court evidence, not true or unfettered de novo review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\">. Another reason that the \"civil action\u201d remedy under CJP \u00a7 3-1701 is independent from the petition for judicial review of a MIA decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>under INS \u00a7 27-1001 is found in the limitations tolling provision found in CJP \u00a7 5-118. <em>See </em>n. 2, <em>supra. </em>Because the time period for filing a civil action recognized in CJP \u00a7 3 \u2014 1701(i) and appellant\u2019s breach of contract claim, is usually measured in years rather than the abbreviated 30-day period associated with judicial review of administrative agency action, the implication of CJP \u00a7 5-118 is that CJP \u00a7 3-1701 is governed by a different limitations period than a \"de novo appeal\u201d under INS \u00a7 27-1001. This is another legislative indication that INS \u00a7 2-215(c) has no application here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b256-8\">. The concept of \"paper hearing\u201d is discussed in <em>Alitalia Linee Italiane v. Tornillo, </em>320 Md. 192, 198-99, 577 A.2d 34 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b256-9\">. Section 2-215(a)(1) authorizes judicial review of \"an order resulting from a hearing.\u201d INS \u00a7 2-213(b), among other things, allows a party to appear in person at a hearing and be present while evidence is given. INS \u00a7 2-215 (a)(2) also permits judicial review when the Insurance Commissioner refuses to grant a hearing. The statute is couched in exclusive terms: \"An appeal under this subtitle may be taken <em>only </em>in the above cases.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b256-10\">. Section 10-222(a) of the SG Article authorizes judicial review of a \"final decision in a contested case.\u201d Under SG \u00a7 10-213, a party in such a proceeding has the right to an in-person hearing. In 1993, the APA was amended to include MIA under the contested case provisions \"as specifically provided in the Insurance Article.\u201d SG \u00a7 10-203(a)(3)(iii). Section 10-222 was not one of the provisions incorporated until the 2007 legislation referenced it in INS \u00a7 27 \u2014 1001(g)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b257-8\">. Although mired in some confusion, one possible exception is appellant's filing in the circuit court within 30 days of the Associate Deputy Commissioner\u2019s decision \u2014 the short limitation period typically associated with judicial review of agency action. The confusion arises because a determination resulting from the \u201cpaper hearing\u201d does not become a final MIA decision until the aggrieved party declines to request an administrative hearing before OAH and the party has 30 days to request such a hearing. INS \u00a7 27-1001(f). If we ignore INS \u00a7 2-215\u2019s focus on contested case hearings, subsection (d) would appear to give a party aggrieved by a determination resulting from a \"paper hearing\u201d 30 more days to file a petition for judicial review. The final complication is the language of CJP \u00a7 3-1701(c)(1) that generally \"a party may not file an action under this subtitle before the date of a final decision under \u00a7 27-1001 of the Insurance Article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">In light of this administrative/judicial framework, to avoid the charge of a premature lawsuit and a violation of the latter restriction, it may have been advisable for appellant to have waited until 30 days had elapsed from the date of the Associate Deputy Commissioner\u2019s decision or, if filing suit earlier, to have notified MIA that the insured was not requesting a hearing before OAH. Nevertheless, under CJP \u00a7 5-118, the mere filing of an administrative complaint with MIA preserves the plaintiff's civil action under CJP \u00a7 3-1701 and the abbreviated 30-day waiting period has long since passed. In our view, the timing of appellant\u2019s filing has not jeopardized the viability of her civil action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b258-7\">. The requirements of INS \u00a7 2-215 are read in conjunction with Title 7, subtitle 200 rules. <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. v. Insurance Commissioner, </em>39 Md.App. 547, 553, 387 A.2d 622 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b259-6\">. Even if appellant had opted for a contested case hearing before an ALJ, this would not have enhanced her rationale for a Baltimore City venue because OAH is headquartered in Baltimore County.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b259-7\">. Unlike the law governing workers\u2019 compensation claims, Md.Code (1991, 2008 Repl.Vol.), Labor and Employment Article, \u00a7 9-745(b), the 2007 good faith insurance legislation does not appear to accord weight to the MIA or ALJ decision in a subsequent judicial proceeding. We express no view on whether, in the absence of such a provision, a MIA or an ALJ decision, or the record in such proceedings, would be admissible in court under Md. Rule 5 \u2014 803(b)(A)(iii) (admissibility of \u201cfactual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law,\u201d or would be barred under Maryland case-law.) <em>Compare Mayer v.
