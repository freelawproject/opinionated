(Retired, Specially Assigned).</author>\n<p id=\"b63-13\">This is a petition for judicial review by Malcolm J. Marks, appellant,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the decision by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City affirming the denial of victim\u2019s compensation benefits issued by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. Although appellant presents a variety of questions for our consideration, at issue is whether the Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence based on the record as a whole, is not arbitrary and capricious, and whether it accords with applicable law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-14\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Procedural and Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">This matter involves a claim by Malcolm Marks for victim\u2019s benefits under the Maryland Criminal Injuries Compensation Act (\u201cAct\u201d). Md.Code (2001 &amp; 2008 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 11-801 <em>et seq. </em>of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCrim.Proc.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">On September 17, 2006, appellant was in Northeast Baltimore checking on his mother\u2019s property in the 1100 block of East 20th Street. At about 2:00 a.m., while he was leaving the unoccupied house, appellant was shot several times by Corey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Harrison. Appellant claimed that the assailant approached him and demanded money. Appellant suffered grievous injuries as a result and was hospitalized. He continues to experience the effects of the assault, claiming that his injuries require physical therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">On December 17, 2006, appellant filed a claim for victim\u2019s benefits with the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board (\u201cBoard\u201d). On June 5, and June 26, 2007, the Board issued a \u201cTentative Decision\u201d denying benefits. The decision was affirmed on July 12, 2007, by the Secretary, Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (\u201cSecretary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Appellant filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. A hearing was conducted on February 5, 2008, after which the circuit court issued an Order vacating the Board\u2019s decision and remanding for further proceedings. The circuit court directed the Board to \u201cdetermine whether there exists enough credible and probative evidence to generate the issue that [appellant] engaged in conduct that contributed to the injuries he sustained on the occasion at issue.\u201d The circuit court added that, should the Board \u201cconclude that this issue has been generated, the Board must afford Petitioner a full and fair opportunity at a hearing to prove that he did not contribute to the infliction of his injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">This hearing was conducted on September 24, 2008, and the Board issued a tentative decision on October 24 denying the claim. This denial was affirmed by the Secretary on November 17, 2008. Appellant again sought judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision, and on June 12, 2009, the circuit court upheld the Board\u2019s decision. This petition for judicial review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Appellant testified at the hearing on behalf of his claim, and he also presented the supporting testimony of Karen Marks, Lemuel Watson, and Anthony Ivory. The Board\u2019s witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>were Detective Frank Miller and Board Investigator Anita McKoy.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Appellant recounted that he would visit the neighborhood about two or three times per month to look after his mother\u2019s house. Because his mother mainly resides in New York, appellant would check on her property to \u201csecure the dwelling,\u201d meet with the occasional tenant, and collect rent. On September 17, 2006, at about 9:00 or 10:00 p.m., appellant was at the house to \u201cmake sure all the doors were locked ... [and] all the windows were down.\u201d After going through the house, appellant was preparing to leave. He recounted what next occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">As I went to the front door, I opened the door, she has a security screen door. I locked the front door. And as I was securing the security gate and locking the security gate, it was kind of odd because everybody was yelling. So as I turn around, I see a guy coming across the street. [He] was black, had a red mask on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">At that point when he was coming closer to me, I didn\u2019t recognize him at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">Okay. As he approached me, I acted like I was trying to get back in the house. He says, \u201cDo you know what time it is? Lay down, get on the ground.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">So I turned around and looked at him, and I told him, \u201cI\u2019m not getting on the ground.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-9\">At that time, I lunged off the step but he had a gun. He had a gun in his hand. At that time I lunged up the step. And as I came down off the step, he was on the sidewalk, he shot me in my chin. And me collapsing on him, I grabbed him in a bear hug and secured the gun under my left, left arm. And as I proceeded to slam him on the ground, he\u2014 we both fall to the ground. I gets up. I runs up the steps to try to get back in the house because he had already shot me in the face. He shoots me in the buttocks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-10\">And then I turned back around because I can\u2019t get in the house at this time. I grabs his armpits and we were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>tussling the whole time. The whole time we\u2019re tussling[.] ... He kept shooting just rapidly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">As we were tussling, I pulls the mask that he had, the bandanna that he had on his face completely off, and, like, I sees him. I said \u2014 so he keeps on shooting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">When I took the mask off, I said, I recognized his face.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The assailant finished shooting and ran off, while appellant returned to the house and \u201claid on the bed because I was in shock that I got shot.\u201d A neighbor arrived and appellant was eventually hospitalized.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Appellant had recognized his assailant after he pulled off the mask, and recalled that his name was Corey Harrison. Appellant had known Harrison \u201cthrough the neighborhood,\u201d and cited an incident in the past involving dirt bikes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">I used to drive \u2014 I used to have dirt bikes in my mother\u2019s yard. That\u2019s my mother\u2019s home. And I used to take the kids out Sunday, little kids in the neighborhood on Sunday and take them dirt bike riding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-10\">And one particular incident, the dirt bike come up missing. They broke in the yard and took the dirt bikes. And he said that he did \u2014 his name \u2014 they called him Seed or something, Corey Harrison.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">Appellant denied having any other dealings with Harrison, and had not spoken with him in months. He insisted that there was no \u201cdrug dispute with Corey Harrison[:]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A4\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-12\">Q So I just want to get this straight. So you\u2019re telling us there was no drug dispute with Corey Harrison, the man who shot you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-13\">A Absolutely not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-14\">Q Nothing related to him at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-15\">A Absolutely not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Q Okay. You had just seen him with the dirt bikes and you had seen him around, but there was no dispute over territory?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-4\">A Absolutely not. Absolutely not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The Board then examined Investigator Anita McKoy. McKoy interviewed appellant, and also accessed appellant\u2019s records in the Criminal Justice Information System. She testified without objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">As part of my investigation, I had went to Criminal Justice Information System. On Mr. Marks\u2019 application he had listed that he was robbed and shot and he had listed the offender of Corey Harrison, so I did a CJIS check on both individuals---- Mr. Marks was also listed on CJIS as a drug kingpin and there were multiple distribution charges of handgun and selling around school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">Also, a look at Mr. Harrison\u2019s record, he was known to sell in the area, the vicinity where the shooting of the victim, took place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-10\">A review of the police report indicates the incident as a[n] assault, but according to Mr. Marks\u2019 application in his brief description said, \u201cI was robbed and shot.\u201d And also in my interview with him, he said he had over $1,000 in his wallet. So I think that would have been pertinent information to pass on to the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-11\">[COMMISSIONER ROBERTS:] The designation of drug kingpin, where did that come from?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-12\">A That came from Harford County. I think it was in 1993. He was convicted ... 1/15/93, Harford County, CDS. It was listed as \u2014 charged with drug kingpin and distribution, et cetera, firearm. And transporting a deadly weapon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-13\">Appellant\u2019s counsel argued that these records were not accurate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-14\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: If I may interrupt. Can I \u2014 I want Mr. Marks to talk about his criminal history, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>because he doesn\u2019t have multiple convictions. That\u2019s not correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">After the Board assured counsel that she could examine appellant about the accuracy of his records, the examination returned to the investigator. McKoy then elaborated on discussions with a detective that underscored her suspicions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF\">On 3/30/07 I had a telephone interview with Detective Miller, and Detective Miller had conveyed that Corey \u2014 just want to back up for a minute. Malcolm Marks was shot on 9/17/06 and Corey Harrison was shot six days later, 9/23/06, and he was shot and killed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">The conversation with Detective Miller advised us that this was over drug territory, territory [in] the area of Robb Street and 20th Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">And that Malcolm Marks has the majority of the neighborhood, most of the territory, and Corey Harrison had a smaller part of that area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Appellant was examined further by his attorney about his criminal record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-8\">Q You were, as you told me, ... had a drug-related conviction, so just tell us about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-9\">A 1993 I had a drug conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-10\">Distribution of CDS. The kingpin charge was dropped, and it was dropped. They charged me with a kingpin charge and they dropped it. They ended up giving me distribution with intent in \u20189[3].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-11\">Wearing and carrying] a handgun, that was all in the same case....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-12\">1999, I got locked up also for simple possession. I got a simple possession charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Appellant was also asked about the $1,000 that had been in his possession on the night of the shooting. He explained that he always has cash on hand and that he was working for a \u201ctemp\u201d agency at the time and that Mrs. Marks is also employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Detective Frank Miller testified for the Board. Detective Miller investigated the homicide of Corey Harrison, the alleged assailant in this case. Harrison was shot on September 23, 2006, \u201cwithin 50 feet of where Mr. Marks was shot.\u201d Detective Miller testified that there were suspicions of a relationship between appellant and Harrison:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-5\">Initial indications from the Eastern District said that there may be some relationship to Mr. Marks\u2019 case and my victim, Harrison.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">Q Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">A And I, while investigating that, Mr. Harrison\u2019s case, some detectives from the Eastern District had occasion to interview Mr. Marks on September 25th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">Q Did you have a discussion with those detectives?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-9\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-10\">Q Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-11\">A And that\u2019s Sergeant Maureen R. Jones and Darrilynn Walker, who\u2019s the detective at the Eastern District. They showed Mr. Marks a photographic array. It\u2019s basically six photographs made up of people of similar characteristics and a target. Their target was Corey Harrison, ... my victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-12\">Mr. Marks, his mouth was wired shut. He was \u2014 he would have difficulty communicating, but he made a positive ID of Corey Harrison as the individual shot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-13\">During my investigation, I was concerned that there was a possibility of, hey, you know, okay, this guy is dead, they got a shooting, you know, they\u2019re just going to clear their shooting with my murder victim just because, you know, close proximity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>So I was concerned, and basically about my investigation, so my partner and I went to Johns Hopkins, interviewed Mr. Marks ourselves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-4\">Q Who\u2019s your partner, for the record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">A Brian Kershaw.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">Okay. Continue, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-7\">A Again, Mr. Marks, his mouth was wired, his jaw was wired shut. He could mumble. He couldn\u2019t speak very well, but we had an alphabetic board. We would ask him questions and he could verify yes or no, and he would make hand gestures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">We talked about, what\u2019s this over, and you know, is it over territory? Is it over, you know, you guys, you have something blowing back and forth. And the indication was, it was over territory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-9\">Q What did you understand territory to mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-10\">A Over drug territory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-11\">The ability to sell in that neighbor[hood] and sell, you know, certain drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-12\">His indication to me and how I took the interview was Mr. Marks was the big player, he controlled the larger of the area. Mr. Harrison mainly dealt on Robb Street, but yet he wanted to control the larger area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-13\">Q Meaning Mr. Harrison wanted to control the entire area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-14\">A Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-15\">Right. Mr. Marks even said that after the shooting, someone from the neighborhood came to him and said it was taken care of, meaning that Mr. Harrison had been killed for Mr. Marks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-16\">Mr. Marks indicated he didn\u2019t ask anybody to go do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5\">Q He indicated that to you himself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>A Yes. He didn\u2019t ask anybody to go do it, but it was done and someone had come to the hospital and told him it was done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-4\">Q Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">A I asked him if he was angry at Harrison for shooting him, and he indicated no. It was like this was expected because of the life that they were living. He kind of shrugged his shoulders about it, like, oh, you know, it happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">Q Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">A And that was the only dealing I had with Mr. Marks, just that one day at\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-8\">Q What\u2019s the date of that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-9\">A The date was either \u2014 it was either September 25th or 26th.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">Following this testimony, appellant, on further examination by counsel, insisted that he could not recall any conversation with Detective Miller. He explained that he had not been in any condition to speak and thus any meaningful conversation with Detective Miller would have been impossible. His mouth had been wired shut with a heavy gauge, he had been heavily sedated with morphine, and he was unable to recognize even family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">Detective Miller was recalled to the stand to explain his testimony in view of appellant\u2019s emphatic denials. Detective Miller described appellant when he encountered him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-12\">He\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s in pain, he\u2019s alert, he was awake. His right arm ... was in a sling. His left arm was by his side. He could, he could explain motions. He could grunt and make gestures. He could shake his head. He could respond when asked a question, and it appeared to me that he was responding, you know, openly and honestly because anybody who\u2019s ever dealt with the police department, obviously, if the drug detective walked in there, he\u2019s not going to tell a guy about the drugs. I\u2019m not there about that. I don\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>care about it____ I can\u2019t stop crime if I\u2019m worried about (unintelligible) drugs because nobody will talk to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">So we gained a lot of drug information that\u2019s, you know, that\u2019s just put out there. And he explained that this is\u2014 that\u2019s the neighborhood. He\u2019s been in it all his life. Corey Harrison has been there most of his life, and they occupied the same territory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\">Q When you were getting this information from Mr. Marks, did you ever have any sense that he was incoherent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlE\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\">Q Okay. Did you have any sense that he could not, that he didn\u2019t know what he was talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-9\">A No. No, not at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">On cross-examination by appellant\u2019s counsel, Detective Miller testified that he discovered that appellant was not as \u201cheavily sedated\u201d as he had been led to believe. He recounted that, when he went to the hospital to interview appellant, he asked the nurse whether appellant was able to communicate. Counsel further inquired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] Okay. I just have one more. Just I\u2019m struck on the fact that there\u2019s explicit details in this statement that you, you know, on 3/30/07 that Ms. McKoy put in her claim summary, and I just \u2014 I don\u2019t understand how such detail could have been extracted from somebody who was in the state that he was in, even if he could ... nod or ... make some kind of gesture, it just seems \u2014 I just still don\u2019t understand how you could get those kind of details.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-12\">Like, okay \u2014 go through rival dealers, dispute over territory, majority of the neighborhood. I mean, that\u2019s very specific, and I guess, how were you able to extract that level of detail from him in the state that he was in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-13\">A That\u2019s a closed question, yes or no. Just, you know, is \u2014 does Corey run the neighborhood or do you run the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>neighborhood; is it a dispute over drugs. They were yes or no questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-4\">Q But how were you able to know that he understood the context of the conversation in the first place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">A If he didn\u2019t understand, he wouldn\u2019t answer, and then we\u2019d start over. We would ask a different question to make it a yes or no question. He couldn\u2019t give me, you know, I run the territory because (unintelligible) off of 20th. He couldn\u2019t tell me that because he couldn\u2019t talk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">There were times when we were initially using the, they had a big alphabet board, so they could communicate with, where you\u2019re putting up letters and you would go through A, B, C, to extract a word from him to put into a sentence. And then, you know, as we get, you know, two or three words in there, we start, okay, so is it about drugs, is it about territory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">Q So he actually constructed a word\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">A Yes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\">Q \u2014to identify the fact that he understood what this conversation was about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-10\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-11\">Q He actually said, \u201cYes, drugs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-12\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-13\">Q Okay. Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-14\">Karen Marks, appellant\u2019s spouse, also disputed the detective\u2019s account, and insisted that appellant had been in a coma for 21 days from September 17th, and that he could not even communicate with flash cards. Detective Miller testified in rebuttal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-15\">Well, sir [addressing a Commissioner], he was visited twice on the 25th of September by four detectives, one of which is a supervisor. He was awake and alert on two separate occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-16\">[COMMISSIONER ROBERTS:] And those are a part of your investigative notes, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-17\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Q And the investigative notes of the other detectives, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-4\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">Q Part of that interview included a lineup, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">A Their interview included a lineup, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">Q As you were told.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-8\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-9\">Q And as a result of that, Mr. Harrison was positively identified, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-10\">A Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">Lemuel Watson, a friend of appellant\u2019s family from the neighborhood, confirmed that appellant would come by to check on his mother\u2019s house, and would also visit the neighborhood with his son for bike rides. Mr. Watson had seen Corey Harrison in the neighborhood, but could only recall a single issue between Harrison and appellant, and that involved one of appellant\u2019s bicycles. When asked whether he had heard about appellant being involved in the drug trade, Watson testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-12\">No. Not in any that I know, and all the times that I\u2019ve known him. No, I\u2019d like to say bout that, as far as that goes, I probably go off the point, but, you know, he and I have had a lot of conversations about just being older men now and being responsible and all that....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-13\">But, as far as he and I, you know, we got families, we got wives, we got our children, you know----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-14\">Anthony Ivory was appellant\u2019s next-door neighbor, and had known appellant for some time. He confirmed that appellant would come to the neighborhood to check on his mother\u2019s house. Ivory noted that the house had been broken into at one point. Ivory did not know Corey Harrison, and was not \u201caware of any kind of dispute, drug related or otherwise between Mr. Marks and anyone in the neighborhood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>The Decisions Below</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">On October 24, 2008, the Board issued an amended decision denying the claim. The Board credited the testimony of Detective Miller. It also discounted the appellant\u2019s testimony, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">The claimant stated at the hearing that the incident occurred when he was checking on a house owned by his mother. The claimant gave conflicting stories about whether the house was occupied by tenants or was vacant at the time of the shooting. In addition, during the investigation of the claim, the claimant told Investigator McKoy that he had over $1,000 in cash in his possession at the time of the shooting, yet had been unemployed for several months prior to the shooting and even when employed was working as a warehouse laborer and reported no other source of income.

Appellant presents a variety of arguments to challenge this finding. Appellant urges that the appropriate standard of causation, by which the effect of a victim\u2019s conduct on his injuries is evaluated, is that of \u201cproximate cause,\u201d and he claims that the evidence does not meet this standard. He further avers that the evidence does not show that he was participating in a crime at the time he suffered his injuries, and that any past conduct on his part should not preclude his entitlement to an award. Appellant contends that the Board improperly \u201cbased its denial solely on an alleged \u2018continuing circumstance\u2019 without citing to any specific behavior or conduct that would foreseeably lead to [his] injuries.\u201d Appellant maintains that, regardless of a prior drug-related conviction \u201cfrom approximately ten years ago,\u201d there is \u201cno evidence ... of his re-engagement in any illegal activities.\u201d He adds that the \u201cBoard did not (and could not) point to any specific criminal behavior\u201d in denying an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">In response, the Board contends that appellant has \u201cargue[d] for a cramped interpretation of the statutory term, \u2018contributed,\u2019 \u201d and it rejects appellant\u2019s claim that a victim contributes to his injuries, for purposes of the Act, only if the victim is found to have been involved in criminal activity at the time of injury. The Board contends that \u201cthere is no [statutory] requirement that the contributory conduct consist of a specific act that occurs at the same time and location as the crime during which injuries are inflicted.\u201d The Board does not specifically address appellant\u2019s \u201cproximate cause\u201d argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>\n<em>Statutory Provisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Preliminarily, this petition for judicial review requires us to determine the causation standard by which a victim\u2019s conduct is found to have contributed to the infliction of his injuries. Crim. Proc. \u00a7 11-810 sets forth conditions for an award generally. Crim. Proc. \u00a7 11 \u2014 810(d) addresses a victim\u2019s contributory conduct, and provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">\u00a7 11-810.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">(d)(l)(i) Except as provided under [a provision not relevant to this case], in considering a claim and in determining the amount of an award, the Board shall determine whether the victim\u2019s conduct contributed to the infliction of the victim\u2019s injury, and, if so, reduce the amount of the award or reject the claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">(3) A claimant may not receive an award if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">(i) the victim initiated, consented to, provoked, or unreasonably failed to avoid a physical confrontation with the offender; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\">(ii) the victim was participating in a crime or delinquent act when the injury was inflicted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">While we reserve our holding regarding the Board\u2019s findings of fact for later in this opinion, we shall hold that the standard of proximate causation shall apply where the effect of a victim\u2019s conduct on the infliction of his or her injuries is to be assessed pursuant to Crim.

It is well-settled that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-12\">[i]n statutory interpretation, our primary goal is always to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision, be it statutory, constitutional, or part of the Rules. We begin our analysis by first looking to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>to ensure that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory. If the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions, and our analysis ends. If, however, the language is subject to more than one interpretation, or when the language is not clear when it is part of a larger statutory scheme, it is ambiguous, and we endeavor to resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, and statutory purpose, as well as the structure of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-5\"><em>Friedman v.

Crim. Proc. \u00a7 11-808 sets forth the criteria for a claimant\u2019s eligibility for an award, defining, for example, a \u201cvictim\u201d or eligible \u201cdependant,\u201d extending eligibility to certain Maryland residents who are victims in other states, and explaining \u201cwho may file a claim.\u201d Crim. Proc. \u00a7 11-808(a)(c). A claimant\u2019s eligibility is not unconditional, however, for the Act contains specific provisions that bar entitlement in certain circumstances where the victim\u2019s conduct is responsible in some manner for the infliction of his injuries. Crim. Proc. \u00a7 11-808(a)(2) precludes an award to a \u201cperson who commits the crime or delinquent act that is the basis of a claim, or an accomplice!.]\u201d Crim. Proc. \u00a7 11-810 places additional conditions on a claimant\u2019s eligibility, providing, <em>inter alia, </em>that certain conduct on the part of the victim would disqualify that person from obtaining an award in whole or in part. <em>See </em>Crim. Proc. \u00a7 11-810(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Our concern in this case is with the application of Crim. Proc. \u00a7 11-810(d), which in certain circumstances forecloses entitlement to benefits under the Act because of the victim\u2019s conduct. Specific disqualifying acts are governed by Crim. Proc. \u00a7 11 \u2014 810(d)(3)(i), which, as noted above, provides for a denial of benefits where the victim \u201cinitiated, consented to, provoked, or unreasonably failed to avoid a physical confronta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>tion with the offender.\u201d This section is similar to Crim. Proc. \u00a7 11-808(a)(2). Neither provision, which addresses conduct directly applicable to the commission of the criminal act at the basis of the claim, applies on these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Crim. Proc. \u00a7 11 \u2014 810(d)(3)(ii) forecloses entitlement where the victim \u201cwas participating in a crime or delinquent act when the injury was inflicted.\u201d Citing Crim. Proc. \u00a7 11-810(d)(3)(ii), appellant contends that \u201cthere is no evidence that [he] was participating in a crime.\u201d We need not address appellant\u2019s argument with respect to Crim. Proc. \u00a7 11\u2014 810(d)(3)(ii), because Crim. Proc. \u00a7 11 \u2014 810(d)(1)(i), the pertinent provision here, permits the Board to reject a claim if \u201cthe victim\u2019s conduct contributed to the infliction of the victim\u2019s injury.\u201d This section addresses conduct generally, and it does not specify that such conduct be unlawful. Nor does it define the term \u201ccontributed\u201d or offer guidance as to how a victim\u2019s conduct renders him responsible in the infliction of the injuries so as to bar his entitlement to an award under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\n<em>Proximate Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Appellant maintains that a victim\u2019s conduct must be a proximate cause of his injuries in order for an award to be foreclosed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We agree and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The language of the Act as a whole, the context of its enactment, available legislative history, and Maryland cases that have interpreted provisions of the Act, do not reveal any legislative intent regarding the problem of gauging whether and how a victim\u2019s conduct \u201ccontributed\u201d to the infliction of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>injury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> What is clear, however, is that a victim must be responsible for his or her actions, and where there is some nexus between the victim\u2019s conduct and the \u201ccompensable\u201d injury, the victim/claimant may forfeit an award in whole or in part. The question of whether a victim\u2019s conduct must be a proximate cause of his injuries so as to foreclose an award under the Act appears to be a matter of first impression in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">After reviewing decisions from sister jurisdictions under their respective victim\u2019s compensation statutes, we shall conclude that a victim\u2019s conduct must be a \u201cproximate cause\u201d of his injury before he would be disqualified from an award pursuant to Crim.

More recently, Judge Raker elaborated on the issue of proximate cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">Legal cause and proximate cause has been widely discussed in cases and legal literature and has posed obstacles to recovery for victims for generations.... The principles have been set out, explored, explicated and expanded____It is a basic principle that \u201c[njegligence is not actionable unless it is a proximate cause of the harm alleged.\u201d ... Proximate cause \u201cinvolves a conclusion that someone will be held legally responsible for the consequences of an act or omission.\u201d ... To be a proximate cause for an injury, \u201cthe negligence must be 1) a cause in fact, and 2) a legally cognizable cause.\u201d ... In other words, before liability may be imposed upon an actor, we require a certain relationship between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the plaintiffs injuries. The first step in the analysis to define that relationship is an examination of causation-in-fact to determine who or what caused an action. The second step is a legal analysis to determine who should pay for the harmful consequences of such an action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-8\"><em>Pittway v.

This determination is subject to considerations of fairness or social policy as well as mere causa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>tion. Thus, although an injury might not have occurred \u201cbut for\u201d an antecedent act of the defendant, liability may not be imposed if for example the negligence of one person is merely passive and potential, while the negligence of another is the moving and effective cause of the injury ... or if the injury is so remote in time and space from defendant\u2019s original negligence that another\u2019s negligence intervenes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><em>Peterson v.

If the \u201charmful consequences\u201d of the victim\u2019s conduct are foreseeable, and not attenuated by an intervening action, the conduct is a proximate cause of, and can thus be said to \u201ccontribute\u201d to, the infliction of the victim\u2019s injuries. By assessing a victim\u2019s conduct in terms of responsibility for the foreseeable consequences of his or her conduct, even where a consequence may entail injury to that victim, the application of a proximate cause standard by which that conduct is judged furthers the legislative purpose of compensation for innocent victims of crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Notwithstanding the absence of Maryland authority on this issue, cases from sister jurisdictions have examined the use of causation analyses in determining whether a claimant\u2019s conduct contributed to his injury.

Crime Victims Compensation Board, </em>155 Mich.App. 358, 399 N.W.2d 515 (1986), the Michigan intermediate appellate court reversed the denial of compensation benefits to a claimant who had been shot while present in an unlicensed bar. The victim\u2019s presence in the bar constituted a misdemeanor, and this infraction provided the basis for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>administrative denial of the claim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Michigan intermediate appellate court reversed. The court set forth the conflicting approaches to the causation analysis advanced by the board and the victim and its explanation of its employment of a \u201cproximate cause\u201d test warrants extensive quotation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-4\">We believe ... the narrow scope of coverage of the act ... does not require an interpretation so restrictive as to thwart the legislative intent to aid crime victims. Therefore, in this case, we reject the board\u2019s interpretation of the statutory term \u201ccontributed to the infliction of his injury.\u201d The board, under its interpretation, holds that any time a claimant violates any criminal statute and the violation of the criminal statute is in any way a cause in fact of the claimant\u2019s injury, the claimant has \u201ccontributed to the infliction of his injury.\u201d Such an interpretation would lead, in some situations, to results that would appear to be contrary to the Legislature\u2019s intent to aid certain crime victims who are not blameworthy in causing their injuries. We do not believe that the Legislature, through MCL 18.361(4); MSA 3.372(H)(4), intended to prohibit recovery to a crime victim who was not in any way truly blameworthy for his injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">We also reject the other possible extreme literal interpretation of the term \u201ccontributed to the infliction of his injury\u201d that would require an injured person to have contributed to the actual act of inflicting his injury before being denied recovery. Under this other interpretation, the injured person would have to have helped pull the trigger or thrust the knife which caused his injury in order to allow the board to reduce or deny an award. We do not believe the Legislature intended either extreme result in using the term \u201ccontributed to the infliction of his injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\">Rejecting these somewhat extreme interpretations of the statutory term in question leaves us in a situation where each case in which the claimant has engaged in some possible peripheral criminal conduct that may have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>connected with his injury must be decided in the light of its particular facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-4\">... The determination of whether a victim \u201ccontributed to the infliction of his injury\u201d involves an assessment of the particular factual situation similar to that used in determining whether a defendant\u2019s negligent acts were a proximate cause of a plaintiffs injuries. The test used in determining proximate cause involves assessing the foreseeability that the injury would result from the defendant\u2019s acts. If the injury which resulted from the defendant\u2019s acts is deemed too remote or unforeseeable, the defendant\u2019s acts are not held to be a proximate cause of the injury and the plaintiff cannot recover damages from defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">In applying the general proximate cause type of foreseeability test to the facts of this case, we believe the board erred in finding that the claimant contributed to the infliction of his own injury. His violation of a criminal statute in this case merely involved his knowing presence in an unlicensed bar. The risk of being shot while merely present in an unlicensed bar is too remote and unforeseeable to hold him blameworthy in any way for his injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">Thus, as a matter of judicial policy, we do not choose to treat claimant\u2019s illegal presence in the bar as a \u201cproximate cause\u201d of his injuries, since a gunshot injury was not a reasonably foreseeable risk of his act of entering an unlicensed bar. Therefore, we conclude that he did not \u201ccontribute to the infliction of his injury,\u201d for purposes of the statute, by being present in the unlicensed bar, and the board erred in denying his claim on this basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-7\"><em>McMillan, </em>399 N.W.2d at 518-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">In <em>Evans v. N.C. Dept. of Crime Control, </em>101 N.C.App. 108, 398 S.E.2d 880 (1990), the Court of Appeals of North Carolina held that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-9\">where a claimant\u2019s injuries are a direct result of the criminally injurious conduct of another, the claimant\u2019s own mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>conduct must have been a proximate cause of those injuries in order for the [Crime Victims Compensation] Commission to deny or reduce the claim under the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-4\"><em>Evans, </em>398 S.E.2d at 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The standard set forth in <em>Evans </em>was further applied in <em>McCrimmon v. Crime Victims Compensation Commission, </em>121 N.C.App. 144, 465 S.E.2d 28 (1995). In the latter case, the claimant grabbed a $20 bill from a convenience store customer and started to flee. He was shot by the store proprietor and was paralyzed as a result of the wound. The store owner was charged with assault and the victim charged with larceny. The victim\u2019s claim for compensation was denied by the North Carolina commission and he appealed. He argued that being shot by the store proprietor was not a foreseeable result of his theft of a customer\u2019s money. The commission disagreed, and the North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed. The intermediate appellate court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">However, petitioner maintains that \u201cthe act of Mr. Si-neath was not reasonably foreseeable and therefore, by application of tort principles, [petitioner\u2019s attempt to steal the money] was not contributory misconduct\u201d so as to justify reduction or denial of petitioner\u2019s claim under the statute. We believe petitioner misapprehends the purport of \u201ccontributory misconduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">While \u201ccontributory misconduct\u201d is not defined in the Act, this Court has previously interpreted the phrase. <em>Evans v. N.C. Dept. of Crime Control, </em>101 N.C.App. 108, 118, 398 S.E.2d 880, 885 (1990) ... \u201cMisconduct\u201d is behavior that is \u201cunlawful or ... breaches the standard of conduct acceptable to a reasonable person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">in order for [a] claimant\u2019s misconduct to be contributory [under the Act] it must combine with criminal action on the part of another to become a \u2018real, efficient and proximate cause of the injury.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 117, 398 S.E.2d at 885 (citation omitted). A proximate cause is one which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>in natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by any new and independent cause, produced the plaintiffs injuries, and without which the injuries would not have occurred, and one from which a person of ordinary prudence could have reasonably foreseen that such a result, or consequences of a generally injurious nature, was probable under all facts as they existed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\n<em>Id. ...</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">The test under <em>Evans, </em>therefore, is two-pronged, that is, 1) was there misconduct on the part of petitioner and, if so, 2) was that misconduct a proximate cause of his injury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">Regarding the element of proximate cause, petitioner takes issue with the Commission\u2019s conclusion that \u201cit was reasonably foreseeable to the Petitioner that his illegal acts could result in injury to himself.\u201d However, this Court in <em>Evans </em>pointed out that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-9\">The test of foreseeability as an element of proximate cause does not require that the actor should have been able to foresee the injury in the precise manner in which it actually occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-10\">Therefore, petitioner need not necessarily have been able to foresee that his conduct would lead to his being shot, but only that \u201cconsequences of a generally injurious nature[] [were] probable under all the facts as they existed.\u201d ... Indeed, in certain instances \u201cthe intervention of wrongful conduct may be the very risk\u201d a person creates through his or her own misconduct ... and such intervention accordingly is foreseeable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-11\"><em>McCrimmon v.

State, </em>331 Md. 549, 555, 629 A.2d 633 (1993) (alleged drug turf war that ostensibly provoked shooting); <em>Handy v.

Hershenov, <em>Hostage to the Drug War: The National Purse, the Constitution and the Black Community, </em>24 U.C.Davis L.Rev. 557, 608 &amp; nn. 209-10 (1991) (noting expert agreement that increase in violent crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>attributable to profits from drug trade and \u201cturf wars of drug dealers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">A shooting victim who becomes a casualty in a drug \u201cturf war\u201d because of perceived allegiance to, and participation with, one side of a drug rivalry, may be considered a \u201cfoot soldier\u201d in the internal drug wars over turf and influence. The risks of such participation are foreseeable. Indeed, according to Detective Miller\u2019s testimony, which the Board credited, appellant had indicated that \u201cthis was expected because of the life that they were living. He kind of shrugged his shoulders about it, like, oh, you know, it happened.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">But a claimant\u2019s participation in narcotics dealing would not <em>per se </em>meet the contributory conduct test. Appellant maintains that his conduct was not a proximate cause of his injuries. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Fisher </em>and <em>McMillan, </em>both <em>supra, </em>is misplaced. The administrative tribunal that denied benefits in <em>Fisher v. Kansas Crime Victims Compensation Board </em>failed to determine whether the victim\u2019s conduct in that case contributed to his injury. No causation inquiry had been conducted. Moreover, unlike the case before us, the facts in <em>Fisher </em>were not in dispute. <em>Fisher, </em>124 P.3d at 78. In <em>McMillan, </em>the Michigan court concluded that the victim\u2019s injury was not a reasonably foreseeable risk of his supposed misconduct, and thus was not a proximate cause of his injury. <em>McMillan, </em>399 N.W.2d at 520. Unlike the victim\u2019s conduct in <em>McMillan, </em>the consequences of appellant\u2019s conduct in the ease <em>sub judice </em>were reasonably foreseeable. Again, as pointed out above, Detective Miller testified that appellant anticipated trouble \u201cbecause of the life that they were living.\u201d The Board could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>find that appellant could reasonably foresee the risks that were inherent in running a drug trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Similarly, our decision in <em>Johnson v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, supra, </em>does not preclude the result we reach today. In <em>Johnson, </em>we noted the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">Detective Nevins of the Baltimore City Police Department\u2019s Homicide Unit investigated the incident in which appellant was injured. The Board\u2019s investigator was informed by Detective Nevins that (1) appellant was one of four people injured in this incident, (2) no suspects had been apprehended, (3) appellant was a \u201cknown\u201d drug dealer, (4) the area in which the shooting occurred was the appellant\u2019s \u201cterritory,\u201d and [ (5) ] Detective Nevins believed that the shooting was \u201cdrug related.\u201d Because of the information provided by Detective Nevins, the Board\u2019s investigator recommended that the Board deny appellant\u2019s claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-7\"><em>Johnson, </em>145 Md.App. at 102, 801 A.2d 1092. On the basis of this evidence, the Board concluded that Johnson was not an innocent victim. Johnson had not requested a hearing before the Board, but sought judicial review after the Board\u2019s decision. We reversed the denial of benefits and remanded. After noting the appropriate burden of persuasion, we faulted the Board\u2019s decision, and also the sufficiency of the evidence, which was largely based on unreliable hearsay:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-8\">In the case at bar, the information supplied by Detective Nevins was not sufficient to generate the issue of whether appellant was shot as a result of his participation in criminal conduct. Thus, the Board erred in requiring that appellant bear the burden of persuading the Board that he did not contribute to his injuries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 115, 801 A.2d 1092 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Board\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson </em>was based on largely unsubstantiated and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>unreliable hearsay. Although there was speculation that Johnson had engaged in \u201cdrug dealing,\u201d and that \u201cterritory\u201d was at stake, evidence to support these findings had not been tested at a hearing during which Johnson would confront this speculation directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Unlike <em>Johnson, </em>a hearing was conducted in the case <em>sub judice, </em>and the parties aired the factual issues in dispute. Detective Miller recalled admissions by appellant about dealing in drugs and the occupational hazards of that conduct. Investigator McKoy learned that appellant had a previous record. Both witnesses were subjected to vigorous cross-examination. Although appellant strenuously denied dealing in drugs or engaging in a turf conflict with his assailant, and emphatically denied making any statements at all to the detective, the Board was free to accept or reject his testimony in whole or in part. It is the \u201cagency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence and where inconsistent inferences can be drawn from the same evidence it is for the agency to draw the inferences.\u201d <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Science Applications International Corp., </em>405 Md. 185, 193, 950 A.2d 766 (2008) (citations and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The testimony of Detective Miller adequately fills in the gaps that undermined the sufficiency of the record in <em>Johnson. </em>Given our duty to defer to the findings made and inferences drawn by the Board, provided those determinations are supported by substantial evidence, we must affirm. The suggestion that the Board should not have believed Detective Miller is an argument that is best left to the trier-of-fact. Our task <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>is not to reweigh the record, and a suggestion that we may do so is an argument that is \u201cwasted on an appellate court.\u201d <em>United States v. Hartmann, </em>958 F.2d 774, 780 (7th Cir.1992) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">In summary, we agree that the record must establish an element of causation; the conduct must have been contributory. We also conclude that the causation standard is that of proximate cause. The evidence generated this issue, and the burden shifted to appellant to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that any conduct on his part was not \u201ccontributory\u201d; appellant was required to establish that his conduct was not the proximate cause of his injuries. The Board\u2019s decision to credit the testimony of Detective Miller is supported by substantial evidence, is not irrational, and accords with applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Criminal History Information Disclosure</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Appellant complains that the Board erred by relying on criminal history information (\u201cCHRI\u201d), the disclosure of which is prohibited by federal and state law. In view of this error, appellant asserts that the denial of benefits must be reversed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">A board investigator, Anita McKoy, testified that she queried the CJIS database and determined that appellant had been arrested on previous occasions. This information was apparently derived from appellant\u2019s \u201crap sheet.\u201d The Board noted the fact that appellant had once been arrested and charged as a drug \u201ckingpin,\u201d but had not been convicted of this charge.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">Appellant maintains that the disclosure of CJIS records to an entity such as the Board is unlawful, and that this violation of federal and state laws prohibiting such disclosure was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>prejudicial. The Board maintains that appellant\u2019s challenge to its consideration of his criminal history records information is not before us because he did not object to the use of his criminal record, but instead asserted only that it was not accurate and that the records related to incidents that were too remote.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">We agree that this issue has not been preserved, and that it is not properly before us.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Md. Rule 8-131 (a) provides, in part, that \u201c[ojrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court[.]\u201d The \u201canimating policy behind Rule 8-131(a) is to ensure fairness for the parties involved and to promote orderly judicial administration.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>379 Md. 704, 714, 843 A.2d 778 (2004). Unfair prejudice has resulted when a party seeks review of an issue that could have been addressed by the lower tribunal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">This Rule also \u201capplies to appellate review of administrative proceedings.\u201d <em>Parham v. Department of Labor, </em>189 Md.App. 604, 615, 985 A.2d 147 (2009) (citation omitted). <em>See Beeman v. Department of Health, </em>107 Md.App. 122, 158-59, 666 A.2d 1314 (1995). Indeed, it is settled law in Maryland that a court ordinarily \u201cmay not pass upon issues presented to it for the first time on judicial review and that are not encompassed in the final decision of the administrative agency.\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Shea, supra, </em>415 Md. at 15, 997 A.2d 768 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The application of Rule 8-131(a) in this instance would promote the \u201corderly administration of justice\u201d by preventing the adjudication of appellant\u2019s claim in a piecemeal fashion. <em>See Jones v. State, </em>379 at 715, 843 A.2d 778. Even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>assuming that the board investigator gained unauthorized access to appellant\u2019s arrest and criminal history (CHRI) records via the CJIS, we would not be persuaded to exercise our discretion to review this issue.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>We are mindful that most of the information appellant seeks to protect is, effectively, readily available as public records because many of the same facts are contained in court files. <em>See </em>Md. Rules 16-1001-1011. Such records are available as electronic records subject to retrieval, and \u201c[cjourt records maintained by a court or by another judicial agency are presumed to be open to the public for inspection.\u201d Md. Rule 16-1002(a). Certainly, as Justice Stevens pointed out in the leading case on the confidentiality of \u201crap sheet\u201d arrest records, \u201c[ajlthough much rap-sheet information is a matter of public record, the availability and dissemination of the actual rap sheet to the public is limited.\u201d <em>United States Dept. of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, </em>489 U.S. 749, 753, 109 S.Ct. 1468, 103 L.Ed.2d 774 (1989). Nevertheless, we perceive no basis for the imposition of some manner of \u201cexclusionary rule\u201d for improper or unlawful disclosures of the CHRI, the application of which would entail a reversal of the Board\u2019s decision. Given the penalties that may be imposed in appropriate cases, and the ready availability of alternate sources of nearly identical information, the deterrence rationale for an exclusionary rule in administrative cases such as the one before us is of limited utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">In the appropriate case, information similar to that contained in a person\u2019s \u201crap sheet\u201d may be the subject of judicial notice by a court or \u201cofficial notice\u201d by an administrative tribunal. Maryland Rule 5-201 governs the judicial notice of adjudicative facts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> State Gov\u2019t \u00a7 10-213(h) pertains to offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>cial notice.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> With respect to the readily available court records, this Court has taken judicial notice of official entries in circuit court records. <em>See Stovall v. State, </em>144 Md.App. 711, 717 n. 2, 800 A.2d 31, <em>cert. denied, </em>371 Md. 71, 806 A.2d 681 (2002). <em>See also Swinson v. Lords Landing Village Condo., </em>360 Md. 462, 467, 758 A.2d 1008 (2000) (judicial notice that judgment entered on docket). <em>But cf. Simms v. State, </em>409 Md. 722, 730 n. 8, 976 A.2d 1012 (2009) (Court of Appeals declines to exercise discretion to note adjudicative fact\u2014 transcript not in record); <em>Dashiell v. Meeks, </em>396 Md. 149, 176-77, 913 A.2d 10 (2006) (discretion exercised only in exceptional case).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">It is widely accepted that judicial notice of court records extends to records that are accessed through the Internet. <em>See Doe v. Golden &amp; Walters, PLLC, </em>173 S.W.3d 260, 265 (Ky.Ct.App.2005) (notice of docket entries via Internet PACER account), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1094, 126 S.Ct. 1069, 163 L.Ed.2d 862 (2006). Indeed, Md. Rule 16-1008(a) provides for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>the inspection of a court record \u201cto the same extent that the record would be open to inspection in paper form.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">In the final analysis, appellant\u2019s challenge to the Board\u2019s use of his criminal records information is not before us. Moreover, given the ready availability of arrest information via court records and the fact that there is no exclusionary remedy that would compel a reversal of the Board\u2019s decision, we see no basis to exercise our discretion to entertain this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Remaining Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Appellant\u2019s remaining contentions require little discussion. He points out that the Court\u2019s standard of review is <em>de novo. </em>This assertion is correct, but only to the extent we review the legal determinations by the Board. Our review of findings by the Board are more deferential under the substantial evidence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Appellant contends that a denial of benefits runs contrary to legislative policy. We are mindful that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4m\">it is clear from the statement of legislative policy in CP \u00a7 11-802 that the law is remedial in nature, and remedial statutes are to be liberally construed. The Legislature has recognized and articulated that \u201cthere is a need for government financial assistance for these victims\u201d and that \u201c[t]he policy of the State is that help, care, and support be provided by the State, as a matter of moral responsibility, for these victims.\u201d CP \u00a7 11-802.

Appellant\u2019s insistence on entitlement thus overlooks Section 11-810 of the Act, which places conditions on an award. Thus, as noted above, an award may be reduced, or denied outright, if the victim\u2019s conduct played a role in the infliction of his injuries. <em>See </em>Crim. Proc. \u00a7 11-810(d). Had the General Assembly intended that the mere filing of a claim by a victim, without qualification, would conclusively establish entitlement to an award, it clearly would not have enacted CP \u00a7 11-810.
