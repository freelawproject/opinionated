After a jury trial, appellant was convicted of second degree assault and acquitted of all other charges. The court sentenced appellant to a ten-year prison term with all but three years suspended, and an additional five years supervised probation to commence upon his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">On appeal, appellant contends that the trial court erred in allowing the State to present evidence of threats made by the appellant against the victim and her family to deter the victim from testifying on behalf of the State. Finding no reversible error, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">On September 13, 2008, Ms. Nesmith was driving her boyfriend, appellant, to her friend\u2019s house. According to Ms. Nesmith, appellant had forced her to drive him there because he suspected her of having a relationship with this friend. When Ms. Nesmith expressed that she did not want to go, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>appellant pulled a steak knife out of the glove compartment and told her \u201cyou better take me over there, because you [know] what I\u2019ll do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Ms. Nesmith drove erratically, and nearly struck an oncoming vehicle. The driver of the oncoming vehicle, Robert Conley, noticed that Ms. Nesmith was yelling for help as she drove. Mr. Conley observed Ms. Nesmith\u2019s vehicle stop in the middle of the road, and saw the couple tussling in it. According to Mr. Conley, Ms. Nesmith fell out of the vehicle, and appellant grabbed her and forced her back in. Appellant then drove, and Ms. Nesmith moved to the passenger side. According to Ms. Nesmith, appellant kept her in a choke hold as he drove, and said \u201cyou know what I\u2019m going to do to you now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Mr. Conley called 911. Officer Christopher Browning, who had received an alert for the vehicle, recognized and followed the vehicle as appellant drove. Officer Browning noticed that appellant had his arm around Ms. Nesmith\u2019s neck and was pulling her towards him. When the vehicle stopped at an intersection, Officer Browning arrested appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The case was tried on April 1 and 2, 2009. At trial, the State asked Ms. Nesmith whether appellant had confronted her about testifying. In pertinent part, Ms. Nesmith testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayq\">[Prosecutor] Let me repeat that. Specifically, on February 3rd of [2009], did something happen in that regard? Did you have a conversation with [appellant] about your participation in his prosecution today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-7\">[Witness] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">[Prosecutor] Tell me about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-9\">[Witness] He had came to my house and h \u2014 I was sitting in my bed. He came in my bedroom, threw some court papers on my bed and said, this is not going to happen, I\u2019m not going to go to jail for this and I told you what I was going to do if I was to go to jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-10\">[Prosecutor] You said he said he told you what he was going to do. What did he specifically say he was going to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>[Witness] He said he was going to kill me and my family, and he said if he was to get locked up while he\u2019s in jail he\u2019s going to, he\u2019s going to be sleeping, and he\u2019s going to be thinking about what he\u2019s going to do to me, and when he gets out I best watch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">[Prosecutor] Is that the last conversation you had with [appellant] before this case today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">[Witness] No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">[Prosecutor] When is the last time you had a conversation with [appellant] about this, you coming to court today, telling us what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">[Witness] I think it was like Sunday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">[Prosecutor] Can you tell us what happened last Sunday?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aly\">[Witness] Like four days ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-10\">[Prosecutor] Last Sunday?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-11\">[Witness] Yeah. He asked was I going to court, and I told him no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-12\">[Prosecutor] You told him you weren\u2019t coming to court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aul\">[Witness] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-13\">[Prosecutor] And what did he say when you said you weren\u2019t coming to court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-14\">[Witness] He said, that\u2019s all I need to know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-15\">[Prosecutor] Since that time, did you tell him that you were coming to court or is this a surprise?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-16\">[Witness] Yeah, he said I didn\u2019t tell him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-17\">Officer Browning also took the stand. In pertinent part, he testified as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-18\">[Prosecutor] Mr. Browning, Officer Browning, as I was saying, when you first started talking to Ms. Nesmith initially, what was her reaction to cooperating with your investigation of what happened initially?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-19\">[Witness] She was very hesitant toward cooperating. Another officer was speaking to her while I was placing the defendant under custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>[Prosecutor] I want to talk about her conversation with you, you said, four minutes later?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">[Witness] Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">[Prosecutor] You said she was hesitant. Why do you say she was hesitant? Did she tell you why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">[Witness] She told me that she, you know, after I had talked to her and, you know, tell her I was here to help her and the only way I could help her was to find out what was going on, you know, for my investigation. That\u2019s when she told me she was afraid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">[Prosecutor] What specifically did she say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">[Witness] She was \u2014 told me she was afraid that the defendant was going to hurt \u2014 ... was going to hurt her fami-ly____ She said she was fearful for her family and for herself that the defendant was \u2014 would come back and in retaliation if she spoke to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-11\">[Prosecutor] And after she had this conversation with you, were you able to convince her to tell you what happened that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-12\">[Witness] Yes, I was.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">After the jury found appellant guilty of second degree assault, the circuit court sentenced appellant. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-14\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b322-15\">On appeal, appellant contends that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of appellant\u2019s threats to Ms. Nesmith and her family. Appellant objected in circuit court, and on appeal, he asserts the same grounds. First, he claims that Officer Browning\u2019s testimony was hearsay outside of any recognized exception to the hearsay rule. Next, he argues that both Officer Browning\u2019s testimony and Ms. Nesmith\u2019s testimony constituted inadmissible \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence and caused unfair prejudice to appellant. We reject each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>A. <em>Hearsay</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Appellant argues in passing that Officer Browning\u2019s testimony concerning Ms. Nesmith\u2019s expression of fear that appellant would hurt her or her family constituted inadmissible hearsay. Appellant further contends that the testimony does not fit into any hearsay exception listed in Maryland Rule 5-803. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Officer Browning\u2019s testimony was admissible hearsay under Rule 5 \u2014 803(b)(3), which sets forth a hearsay exception for \u201cThen Existing Mental, Emotional, or Physical Condition.\u201d The exception allows into evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">[Statements] of the declarant\u2019s then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition (such as intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain, and bodily health), offered to prove the declarant\u2019s then existing condition or the declarant\u2019s future action....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Appellant does not challenge the relevancy of the testimony, but we note that Ms. Nesmith\u2019s hesitancy and the reason for the hesitancy, i.e., fear, were relevant because, if believed, the evidence was tied to other evidence of threats by appellant. Threats are admissible because they demonstrate consciousness of guilt. See discussion, <em>infra, part B.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">Generally, appellate decisions have addressed Rule 5-803(b)(3) in the context of whether a hearsay statement was admissible to prove intent. <em>Edery v. Edery, </em>193 Md.App. 215, 234, 996 A.2d 961 (2010). Nevertheless, the exception is not limited to an expression of intent to engage in future conduct. Here, the testimony was admissible to prove the witness\u2019s then existing state of mind, <em>ie., </em>fear, to prove the truth of the stated reason for the fear, <em>ie., </em>a threat by appellant. The testimony was thus properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">B. <em>Admission of Other Crimes and Bad Acts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">Appellant argues that both Officer Browning\u2019s testimony concerning Ms. Nesmith\u2019s fears and Ms. Nesmith\u2019s testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>ny concerning appellant\u2019s threats constituted unduly prejudicial \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The standard by which we must address this issue is narrow. The admission of \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence is vested within the sound discretion of the trial court and we will not overrule the decision of the trial court unless there has been an abuse of discretion. <em>Merzbacher v. State, </em>346 Md. 391, 404, 697 A.2d 432 (1997). Likewise, we may not overturn a trial court\u2019s admission of evidence over objection that the evidence is unduly prejudicial unless the admission constituted an abuse of discretion. <em>Hunt v. State, </em>321 Md. 387, 425, 583 A.2d 218 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">While, generally, evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior bad acts is inadmissible, Maryland Rule 5 \u2014 404(b) recognizes situations in which evidence of prior criminal or wrongful acts may be admitted. Rule 5-404(b) sets forth a non-exhaustive list of special circumstances. <em>Streater v. State, </em>352 Md. 800, 809, 724 A.2d 111 (1999). Rule 5-404(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, common scheme or plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">In Maryland, \u201cconsciousness of guilt is an \u2018other purpose\u2019 that will overcome the presumption of exclusion that is attached to \u2018other crimes\u2019 evidence.\u201d <em>Conyers v. State, </em>345 Md. 525, 554, 693 A.2d 781 (1997) (evidence that defendant murdered a witness admissible as consciousness of guilt in trial of murder charges); <em>see also Jackson v. State, </em>132 Md.App. 467, 483-87, 752 A.2d 1227 (2000) (admitting as evidence of \u201cconsciousness of guilt,\u201d testimony that prior to raping the victim, the defendant told her \u201che had been arrested before\u201d and that after the rape, he asked her \u201chave you figured out what I have been arrested for?\u201d); <em>State v. Edison, </em>318 Md. 541, 547-49, 569 A.2d 657 (1990) (evidence of flight is admissible to show consciousness of guilt).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>The evidence in this case shows that appellant attempted to intimidate Ms. Nesmith from aiding in his prosecution by threatening to kill her and her family. Such witness intimidation shows that appellant was conscious of his guilt with respect to the assault on September 13. Admission of the threats was thus permissible under Rule 5-404(b) and did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">Appellant\u2019s claim that admission of the threats was more prejudicial than probative is equally without merit. In appellant\u2019s view, evidence of the threats carried great weight with the jurors in deciding whether appellant had intimidated her on the day of the charged offense. Appellant argues that this prejudice outweighed any probative value because evidence of the threats was unnecessary \u2014 Ms. Nesmith agreed to testify, and ended up testifying in a manner expected. Her statements were not exculpatory to appellant or internally inconsistent. In other words, appellant argues, Ms. Nesmith\u2019s testimony did not indicate that she had been influenced by the threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The circuit court determined that evidence of attempts to influence a witness \u201cwould be somewhat prejudicial,\u201d but \u201ccertainly more appropriate than prejudicial as to the behavior.\u201d The circuit court balanced the probative and prejudicial value of the evidence, and again, its decision to admit the evidence was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
