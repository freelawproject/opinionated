On March 22, 2004, appellant, Jamal Logan, filed suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against 22 defendants, including appellees, LSP Marketing Corporation and Basilio Lachica (collectively, \u201cLSP\u201d). On March 10, 2005, LSP filed a motion for sanctions, seeking dismissal of the action with prejudice or, in the alternative, exclusion of all but one of Logan\u2019s experts from testifying at trial. On March 29, 2005, Logan filed an opposition to the motion for sanctions, along with a request for a hearing. On April 29, 2005, without holding a hearing, the court denied LSP\u2019s request for dismiss<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>al but granted the motion for sanctions by excluding all but one of Logan\u2019s experts (\u201c2005 Order\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">On May 11, 2005, Logan filed a motion to revise the court\u2019s 2005 Order. On February 8, 2006, without holding a hearing, the court denied Logan\u2019s motion, stating that \u201cno judgment has been entered.\u201d By letter dated March 20, 2006, Logan\u2019s counsel asked the court to revise its 2005 Order. The court responded on March 27, 2006, stating that it \u201cwill take no action in response to the letter as [Logan\u2019s counsel] submitted his concerns in the form of a letter rather than a proper motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The case proceeded to trial on March 29, 2006. As a preliminary matter, Logan moved for reconsideration of the court\u2019s 2005 Order. After hearing from counsel, the court denied Logan\u2019s motion. Thereafter, Logan\u2019s counsel stipulated that Logan \u201ccould not proceed to trial and was unable to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case under the parameters existing as a result of the [court\u2019s 2005 Order].\u201d Logan requested a postponement of trial, which the court denied. One of the defendants then moved for summary judgment. Finding \u201cno dispute as to material fact,\u201d the court granted summary judgment \u201cas to all claims asserted against all Defendants by [ ] Jamal Logan.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"pAc4\">Logan presents the four questions, which we have revised for clarity:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>1) Did the trial court abuse its discretion when it ruled on LSP\u2019s motion for sanctions without a hearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-4\">2) Did the trial court abuse its discretion when it excluded all but one of Logan\u2019s experts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">3) Did the trial court abuse its discretion when it denied, without a hearing, Logan\u2019s motion to revise the 2005 Order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">4) Did the trial court err or abuse its discretion when it denied Logan\u2019s motion to reconsider the 2005 Order and proceeded to grant summary judgment in favor of LSP?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Finding no error or abuse of discretion, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">LSP served Logan interrogatories on July 30, 2004. Interrogatory Number 22 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-10\">Identify all persons whom you expect to call as expert witnesses at trial, and for each such expert state his/her qualifications (including a list of publications written by the expert), the subject matter on which the expert is expected to testify, a summary of the grounds for each opinion, and state the terms of the expert\u2019s compensation; also, attach to your answers copies of all written reports of such experts concerning his/her findings and opinions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">Pursuant to the scheduling order, issued by the court on May 13, 2004, Logan was required to respond to \u201call interrogatory requests concerning the findings and opinions of experts ... no later than 11/06/04.\u201d In addition, all discovery was to be completed \u201cno later than 08/09/05.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">On November 1, 2004, having received no response from Logan, LSP sent a letter to Logan\u2019s counsel asking for \u201cresponses to the Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents as soon as possible.\u201d By letter dated November 12, 2004, LSP informed Logan\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>[T]he findings and opinions of Plaintiffs experts were due on November 6, 2004. I have not yet received this information. Please forward the findings and opinions of any expert you intend to call at the trial of this matter to me at your earliest convenience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-4\">I am now in an untenable position with my clients. If I do not receive Plaintiffs discovery responses and Plaintiffs experts findings and opinions by November 26, 2004, I will have no choice but to file a Motion for Sanctions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">According to LSP, Logan failed to respond. LSP attempted to contact Logan\u2019s counsel by telephone on November 24, 2004, and November 30, 2004. LSP further avers that Logan\u2019s counsel \u201cfailed to respond to these phone calls in any fashion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">On December 3, 2004, LSP filed a \u201cmotion to dismiss and/or compel\u201d Logan\u2019s overdue discovery responses. It is undisputed that, on December 16, 2004, Logan produced answers to LSP\u2019s interrogatories. In response to Interrogatory Number 22, Logan provided a list of 16 potential experts, 10 of whom were located out-of-state, along with their addresses and the subject matter on which each expert was expected to testify. Logan\u2019s answer did not include any of the experts\u2019 qualifications, a list of publications, a summary of the grounds for each opinion, or the terms of compensation. At the end of the paragraph for each expert, Logan stated that a written report \u201cwill be provided when available\u201d or \u201cas soon as it becomes available.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">For example, Logan listed 12 individuals as experts in \u201cpediatric lead poisoning.\u201d For most, if not all, of those individuals, Logan stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-8\">[Name, address], expert in pediatric lead poisoning. [Name] is expected to testify to the extent and permanency of the minor Plaintiffs injuries due to exposure to lead paint. [Name] will also testify to the probable source of the lead exposure. [Name] will also testify that exposure to lead-based paint at all of the defendants\u2019 subject premises, as stated in the Plaintiffs complaint, was a substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>factor in the plaintiffs injuries. A written report will be provided when available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Logan also listed three individuals as experts in \u201cpsychology and neuropsychological evaluations of children,\u201d including Dr. Barry Hurwitz, as well as one \u201cVocational Consultant,\u201d Mark Lieberman. According to Logan\u2019s answer, Lieberman was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8A\">... expected to testify as to the vocational impact and loss of potential earning capacity of lead paint poisoning on the Plaintiff(s). He will base his opinions on a review of the medical records, school records, other expert reports and depositions. In some instances Mr. Lieberman will meet with the Plaintiff(s) and/or family members. We will provide a copy of the report as soon as it becomes available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">On December 20, 2004, Logan filed an opposition to LSP\u2019s motion to dismiss and/or compel, arguing that answers had been provided, thus rendering LSP\u2019s motion moot. On December 28, 2004, LSP filed a reply to Logan\u2019s opposition, wherein it argued that Logan \u201cfailed to provide his experts\u2019 reports and/or expert findings and opinions in answer to ... Interrogatory Number 22 and within the deadline set forth in the Scheduling Order.\u201d Specifically, LSP stated that Logan\u2019s answer to Interrogatory Number 22 failed to state \u201cthe substance of the findings and opinions to which the expert[s] [are] expected to testify, and a summary of the grounds for each opinion.\u201d Thus, LSP sought dismissal of Logan\u2019s complaint or, in the alternative, \u201can Order compelling Plaintiff to provide Defendants with executed Answers to Interrogatories, ... and to provide his experts\u2019 reports and/or the substance of the findings and opinions to which Plaintiffs experts are expected to testify, and a summary of the grounds for each opinion within 10 days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">On February 3, 2005, the court signed an order granting LSP\u2019s motion to compel, requiring Logan to \u201cprovide his experts\u2019 findings and opinions pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-402(f)[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] and/or reports within 20 days (twenty) from the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>on which this Order is signed.\u201d On February 23, 2005, Logan produced revised and supplemental answers to LSP\u2019s interrogatories. In response to Interrogatory Number 22, Logan deleted two of the previously named experts, including Dr. Hurwitz, whom LSP found to be \u201cthe only expert properly designated under Maryland Rule 2-402(f).\u201d Again, Logan provided the subject matter to which each expert would testify, but failed to include the substance of the experts\u2019 findings. For 13 of the 14 experts listed, Logan again stated that a written report \u201cwill be provided when available.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">As noted, on March 10, 2005, LSP filed a motion for sanctions, seeking dismissal of the action with prejudice or, in the alternative, exclusion of all of Logan\u2019s experts, except Dr. Hurwitz. In part, LSP argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-6\">To date, Plaintiff has failed to produce any information on the substance of the findings and opinions to which his fourteen identified experts are expected to testify, and failed to provide a summary of the grounds for each opinion of these other experts, which is in direct violation of the Scheduling Order and [the courtj\u2019s February 3, 2005 Order. Instead of producing the experts\u2019 findings and opinions specific to Jamal Logan, Plaintiffs supplemental expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>designations make the exact same broad reservations on reports and provide the same boilerplate explanations for the opinions and findings of his experts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">On March 29, 2005, Logan filed an opposition to the motion for sanctions, along with a request for a hearing. Logan stated that, contrary to LSP\u2019s allegations, the answers provided \u201cfully comply with the requirements of the Maryland Rules, and do state the \u2018substance of the finding and opinions to which the experts are expected to testify.\u2019 \u201d Logan added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajv\">[N]othing in the Maryland Rules requires that a report be provided if one has not been produced. If defendants want to learn more than disclosed in the designations, all defendants need to do is schedule the depositions of the listed experts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">On April 29, 2005, without holding a hearing, the court denied LSP\u2019s request for dismissal but granted the motion for sanctions by excluding all but one of Logan\u2019s experts. Relying on Maryland Rule 2 \u2014 402(f)(1)(A), the court explained in its order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">... Except as to Dr. Barry Hurwitz, plaintiff has failed to provide \u201cthe substance of the findings and the opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each opinion,\u201d and therefore, plaintiff has failed to comply with his discovery obligations as to each of the other identified experts in Plaintiffs Answer to Defendants\u2019 Interrogatory No. 22 and Plaintiffs Supplemental Answer to Defendants\u2019 Interrogatory No. 22.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-7\">In addition, Plaintiffs answers and supplemental answers to the interrogatories clearly show that the expert testimony that would be provided by each of the experts being excluded pursuant to this order, except Mark Lieberman, would be duplicative of the testimony provided by Dr. Hurwitz, whose designation is being permitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">On May 11, 2005, Logan filed a motion to revise the court\u2019s 2005 Order which was denied. By letter dated March 20, 2006, Logan\u2019s counsel asked the court to revise its 2005 Order, but the court declined to take action. The case proceeded to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>trial on March 29, 2006, at which time Logan, for a third time, requested reconsideration of the court\u2019s 2005 Order. After hearing from counsel, the court denied Logan\u2019s motion based on the procedural posture leading up to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">Logan\u2019s counsel then stated that he could not \u201cpresent a <em>prima facie </em>case\u201d but would be willing to proceed and pick a jury to \u201cprotect [his] client\u2019s interest.\u201d In other words, Logan\u2019s counsel \u201cobjected] to the [e]ourt considering any motion for summary judgment, even though at the same time [was] willing to stipulate that under the current state of the rulings ... [he] cannot make a <em>prima facie </em>case to go forward w[h]ether it be a court trial or a jury trial.\u201d After considering the parties\u2019 arguments, the court ruled, by order dated April 28, 2006, that \u201cpursuant to the stipulations entered into by Counsel for Plaintiff, there exists no dispute as to material fact, and Summary Judgment is appropriate as to all claims asserted against all Defendants by Plaintiff Jamal Logan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">I. Grant of Motion for Sanctions without a Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Logan first argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it ruled on his motion for sanctions without holding a hearing. Relying on Maryland Rule 2-311(f), Logan contends that the court \u201cwas required to hold a hearing ... since the ruling on this motion ultimately adjudicated [his] claims.\u201d Logan\u2019s reliance on Rule 2-311(f), however, is misplaced. As we will explain, the motions court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">Maryland Rule 2 \u2014 311(f), in relevant part, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-9\">(f) <em>Hearing </em>\u2014 Other <em>motions. </em>\u2014 A party desiring a hearing on a motion ... shall request the hearing in the motion or response under the heading \u201cRequest for Hearing.\u201d Except when a rule expressly provides for a hearing, <em>the court shall determine in each case whether a hearing will be held, but the court may not render a decision that is dispositive of a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number><em>claim or defense without a hearing if one was requested </em>as provided in this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">\u201cIn <em>Fowler v. Printers II, Inc., </em>89 Md.App. 448, 598 A.2d 794 (1991), this Court held that Md. Rule 2 \u2014 311(f) requires a trial judge to hold a hearing only if its decision would be dispositive of a claim or defense.\u201d <em>Shelton v. Kirson, </em>119 Md.App. 325, 329, 705 A.2d 25 (1998). Further, we \u201cexplained that the words \u2018claim\u2019 and \u2018defense\u2019 were to be narrowly construed, and \u2018that these terms are [not] to include the arguments made in order to obtain or thwart collateral litigation matters, like those contained in motions for discovery sanctions....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329-30, 705 A.2d 25 (quoting <em>Fowler, </em>89 Md.App. at 485, 598 A.2d 794) (emphasis and additional citations omitted). The Court added: \u201cFor a decision to be deemed dispositive of a claim or defense within the contemplation of Rule 2-311(f), it must actually and formally dispose of the claim or defense. It is not enough to argue that it is the functional equivalent of a dispositive decision or that it lays the inevitable predicate for such a decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330, 705 A.2d 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">This case mirrored <em>Shelton. </em>In <em>Shelton, </em>\u201cthe appellee moved to preclude testimony by the late-named experts because of inexcusable non-compliance with the time limits set for discovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327-38, 705 A.2d 25. The circuit court granted the motion and, in a later proceeding, granted summary judgment in favor of appellee based on the lack of sufficient evidence as a result of the rulings with respect to discovery. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, we affirmed the circuit court\u2019s judgment, and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-8\">The dispositive action in this case was the granting of summary judgment in favor of the appellee____ Earlier discovery rulings have present pertinence only to the extent to which they may have affected the granting of summary judgment. The discovery order precluding the medical experts demonstrably had no such effect. The testimony of the experts, at best, would have established that the minor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>plaintiff suffered from lead poisoning. The absence of any proof in that regard was not the basis for the granting of summary judgment....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 328, 705 A.2d 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Likewise, here, the dispositive action was the granting of summary judgment in favor of LSP. Although the grant of summary judgment may have resulted from earlier discovery rulings, the court did not directly dismiss the case when it granted LSP\u2019s motion for sanctions. As such, the court did not abuse its discretion by ruling on the motion without holding a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Logan compares this case to <em>Karl v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, </em>100 Md.App. 743, 642 A.2d 903 (1994), but that case is distinguishable. In <em>Shelton, </em>we summarized the proceedings in <em>Karl </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-8\">In <em>Karl, </em>the appellee had filed two motions for sanctions against the appellant for failure to respond timely to discovery requests. In the second motion for sanctions, the one at issue on appeal, the appellee sought the sanction of dismissal of the complaint. Despite the appellee\u2019s request for a hearing, the trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss without holding a hearing on the motion. The appellant appealed. This Court, in vacating the trial court\u2019s judgment, focused on the fact that, although the appellee had filed a motion for sanctions, one of the sanctions requested was dismissal of the complaint. As we stated, \u201calthough this motion was initiated under the Discovery Rule, it included a motion to dismiss, which is one, if granted, would be dispositive of the case.\u201d <em>[Karl, supra, </em>100 Md.App.] at 747 [642 A.2d 903] (internal quotes omitted). Thus, under Md. Rule 2-311(f), the trial court erred in not holding a hearing prior to granting the motion to dismiss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-9\"><em>Shelton, supra, </em>119 Md.App. at 330, 705 A.2d 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">In this case, although LSP filed a motion to dismiss, along with its motion for sanctions, the court denied the motion to dismiss. Instead, as LSP notes, the court granted the motion for sanctions and allowed the case to proceed to trial. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>differs from <em>Karl, </em>where the motions court dismissed the case without holding a hearing. <em>See Karl, </em>100 Md.App. at 744-45, 642 A.2d 903. Thus, we conclude that there was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">II. The 2005 Order</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Next, as noted, Logan argues that \u201cthe trial court abused its discretion in ruling that [his] expert designations were inadequate and duplicative, and then striking these experts from testifying at trial.\u201d According to Logan, his answers to LSP\u2019s interrogatories \u201cfully complied with the requirements of Maryland Rule 2-402(f)(1)(A).\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Under former Maryland Rule 2 \u2014 402(f)(1)(A), now codified at Rule 2 \u2014 402(g)(1)(A), \u201c[a] party by interrogatories may require any other party to identify each person ... whom the other party expects to call as an expert witness at trial; ... to state the substance of the findings and the opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each opinion; and to produce any written report made by the expert concerning those findings and opinions.\u201d In <em>Blades v. Woods, </em>107 Md.App. 178, 183, 667 A.2d 917 (1995), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">\u201cOne of the fundamental and principal objectives [of discovery] is to require the disclosure of facts by a party litigant to all of his adversaries ... If all of the parties have knowledge of all of the relevant, pertinent and non-privileged facts, or the knowledge of the existence or whereabouts of such facts, the parties should be able to properly prepare their claims and defenses, thereby advancing the sound and expeditious administration of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">(Quoting <em>Balt. Transit Co. v. Mezzanotti, </em>227 Md. 8, 13, 174 A.2d 768 (1961)) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">More recently, we discussed the Maryland Rules of Discovery in <em>Gallagher Evelius &amp; Jones, LLP v. Joppa Drive-Thru, Inc., </em>195 Md.App. 583, 594-98, 7 A.3d 160 (2010). In that case, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>The discovery scheme initially requires broad and comprehensive disclosures, then \u201cprovid[es] a mechanism for addressing disputes concerning the necessity of complying with a disclosure request and the adequacy of any challenged disclosure,\u201d and, finally, when required, \u201cprescrib[es] sanctions to be imposed when a party fails to comply, either by not responding at all or responding inadequately.\u201d <em>Food Lion, Inc. v. McNeill, </em>393 Md. 715, 733-34 [904 A.2d 464] (2006) (citing Md. Rules 2-402, 2-403, 2-432, 2-433, and 2-504). Sanctions are required to ensure that a noncomplying or defaulting party does not benefit from that party\u2019s noncompliance or default. <em>Id. </em>at 734-35 [904 A.2d 464].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">When there is a claim of failure of discovery, the circuit court has broad discretion to fashion a remedy based on a party\u2019s failure to abide by the rules of discovery. <em>Warehime v. Dell, </em>124 Md.App. 31, 43 [720 A.2d 1196] (1998). In imposing sanctions for discovery failures, a trial court has \u201c \u2018considerable latitude.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Miller v. Talbott, </em>239 Md. 382, 387 [211 A.2d 741] (1965)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">Once a trial court resolves a discovery dispute, our review of that resolution is \u201cquite narrow; appellate courts are reluctant to second-guess the decision of a trial judge to impose sanctions for a failure of discovery. Accordingly, we may not reverse unless we find an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Warehime, </em>124 Md.App. at 44 [720 A.2d 1196].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-7\"><em>Id, </em>at 596-97, 7 A.3d 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">This case is similar to <em>Rodriguez v. Clarke, </em>400 Md. 39, 926 A.2d 736 (2007). In <em>Rodriguez, </em>the respondent failed \u201cto make good-faith efforts to provide access to information about their expert witnesses, ... [and failed] to make good faith attempts to sincerely resolve the discovery dispute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65, 926 A.2d 736. On appeal, the Court of Appeals noted that the respondents provided \u201csparse preliminary expert witness designation\u201d because they did not state \u201cthe substance of [the experts\u2019] findings and opinions, nor a summary of the grounds for each opinion, [they] also did not produce any written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>report made by the experts concerning their findings and opinions, as required by Rule 2-402(f)(1).\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Rodriguez </em>Court also mentioned that \u201c[s]ix of the ten expert witnesses identified by the [respondents] were out-of-state witnesses,\u201d and that their deposition \u201ccan be an onerous and costly process and is one which easily can be obviated through good faith efforts to communicate available deposition dates.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68-69, 926 A.2d 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Similarly, in this case, Logan failed to make good-faith efforts to provide access to information about their expert witnesses. Based on the scheduling order printed by the court on May 13, 2004, Logan was required to respond to \u201call interrogatory requests concerning the findings and opinions of experts ... no later than 11/06/04.\u201d On November 1, 2004, having received no response from Logan, LSP sent a letter to Logan\u2019s counsel asking for \u201cresponses to the Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents as soon as possible.\u201d By letter dated November 12, 2004, LSP informed Logan\u2019s counsel that the information still had not been provided. Logan, however, failed to respond, prompting LSP to call Logan\u2019s counsel on November 24, 2004, and November 30, 2004. After receiving no response, LSP filed a motion to dismiss and/or compel.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">On December 16, 2004, one month and ten days after the court-imposed deadline, Logan produced answers to LSP\u2019s interrogatories. Logan\u2019s answers, however, did not comply with Rule 2-402 because he failed to include the <em>substance </em>of the experts\u2019 findings and opinions, as well as a summary of the <em>grounds </em>for each expert\u2019s opinion. For example, Logan listed Lieberman as an expert who would testify \u201cas to the vocational impact and loss of potential earning capacity of lead paint poisoning on the Plaintiff(s).\u201d Although Logan stated that Lieberman would \u201cbase his opinions on a review of the medical records, school records, other expert reports and depositions,\u201d Logan did not state <em>how </em>Lieberman believed his earning capacity would be affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>In addition, Logan listed 12 individuals, 10 of whom were located out-of-state, as experts in pediatric lead poisoning, who would \u201ctestify to the extent and permanency of the minor Plaintiffs injuries due to exposure to lead paint.\u201d These answers failed to disclose, however, <em>what </em>each expert would opine as to the extent and permanency of the injuries, which might range from 0% to 100%. Logan stated that all 12 experts were expected to \u201ctestify to the probable source of the lead exposure,\u201d but he did not include <em>what </em>each expert would opine the probable source was, and <em>why </em>the expert expressed this belief. Moreover, the experts were to \u201ctestify that exposure to lead-based paint at all of the defendants\u2019 subject premises ... was a substantial factor in the plaintiffs injuries,\u201d yet Logan did not state the <em>reasons </em>for their findings. And, like the respondents in <em>Rodriguez, </em>Logan stated at the end of each expert designation that a written report \u201cwill be provided when available\u201d or \u201cas soon as it becomes available.\u201d Based upon Logan\u2019s \u201cboilerplate\u201d expert designations, it was reasonable for the court to infer that the excluded experts\u2019 testimonies would be duplicative of Dr. Hurwitz\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">For these reasons, we agree with the circuit court that Logan\u2019s answers were inadequate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>stated in <em>Rodriguez, </em>sanctions are warranted where a party provides \u201csparse expert witness designation, elusive answers to interrogatories, and fail[s] to communicate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69-70, 926 A.2d 736. Therefore, we conclude that the court acted properly in imposing sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">III. Denial of Motion to Revise</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Logan next argues that the trial court abused its discretion by not granting his \u201cMotion to Revise Pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-535 or [his] March 20, 2006 letter requesting reconsideration.\u201d Logan contends that he should have been granted a hearing and the court \u201cshould have reconsidered its [2005] Order.\u201d Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">Maryland Rule 2-535 states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-8\">(a) <em>Generally. </em>\u2014 On motion of any party filed within 30 days after <em>entry of judgment, </em>the court may exercise revisory power and control <em>over the judgment </em>and, if the action was tried before the court, may take any action that it could have taken under Rule 2-534....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">(Emphasis added). Rule 2-535, therefore, only applies to judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">In <em>Mullaney v. Aude, </em>126 Md.App. 639, 652, 730 A.2d 759 (1999), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-11\">\u201cLike the imposition of costs, attorney\u2019s fees, and contempt sanctions, <em>the imposition of a </em>... <em>sanction is not a judgment on the merits of an action. </em>Rather, it requires the determination of a collateral issue: whether the attorney has abused the judicial process, and, if so, what sanction would be appropriate. Such a determination may be made after the principal suit has been terminated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">(Quoting <em>Cooter &amp; Gelt v. Hartmarx Corp., </em>496 U.S. 384, 396, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990)) (emphasis added); <em>accord Litty v. Becker, </em>104 Md.App. 370, 375-76, 656 A.2d 365 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>Because the imposition of a sanction is not a judgment, we conclude that the circuit court neither erred nor abused its discretion when it denied Logan\u2019s motion and stated that \u201cno judgment has been entered.\u201d Likewise, the court acted properly when it declined to take action in response to Logan\u2019s letter requesting reconsideration of the 2005 Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">IV. Denial of Motion to Reconsider and Grant of Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Finally, Logan argues that the trial court erred in granting LSP\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Specifically, Logan avers that the ruling should be reversed because the court based its decision on the previous \u201cincorrect ruling striking [his] experts.\u201d Meanwhile, LSP argues that grant of summary judgment was proper because Logan \u201cconceded he could not go forward with his <em>prima facie </em>case.\u201d We agree with LSP.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">When a party moves for summary judgment, the circuit court may grant that motion if it determines that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Md. Rule 2 \u2014 501(f); <em>see also Zurich Am. Ins. Co. v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>196 Md.App. 181, 190, 9 A.3d 80 (2010) (citations omitted). Therefore, when appellate courts review a grant of summary judgment, \u201c \u2018we must make the threshold determination as to whether a genuine dispute of material fact exists, and only where such dispute is absent will we proceed to review determinations of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stachowski v. Sysco Food Servs. of Balt., Inc., </em>402 Md. 506, 515-16, 937 A.2d 195 (2007) (quoting <em>Remsburg v. Montgomery, </em>376 Md. 568, 579, 831 A.2d 18 (2003)). \u201cThe standard applied by th[is] Court is not whether the trial court was clearly erroneous but whether the trial court was legally correct.\u201d <em>Zurich Am. Ins. Co., supra, </em>196 Md.App. at 191, 9 A.3d 80 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">At trial, Logan, for a third time, requested reconsideration of the court\u2019s 2005 Order. After hearing from counsel, the court denied Logan\u2019s motion, based on the procedural posture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>leading up to trial and the sanctions imposed upon Logan. Logan\u2019s counsel then stated that he could not \u201cpresent a <em>prima facie </em>case\u201d but would be willing to proceed and pick a jury to \u201cprotect [his] client\u2019s interest.\u201d Following a lengthy discussion, the court determined that Logan \u201cobjected] to the [c]ourt considering any motion for summary judgment, even though at the same time [was] willing to stipulate that under the current state of the rulings ... [he] cannot make a <em>prima facie </em>case to go forward w[h]ether it be a court trial or a jury trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">As previously explained, the court acted properly in granting LSP\u2019s motion for sanctions. It then follows that the court also acted properly in imposing those sanctions during trial. Because Logan conceded that he could not \u201cpresent a <em>prima facie </em>case,\u201d we conclude that the court did not err in finding that, \u201cpursuant to the stipulations entered into by Counsel for Plaintiff, there exists no dispute as to material fact and Summary Judgment is appropriate as to all claims asserted against all Defendants by Plaintiff Jamal Logan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Thus, for all of the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY IS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b697-9\">. In his brief, Logan presented the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-10\">I. Whether the trial court abused its discretion in ruling on LSP\u2019s dispositive Motion for Sanctions without a hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-11\">II. Whether the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that Appellant\u2019s expert designations were inadequate and duplica-tive, and then striking these experts from testifying at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-12\">III. Whether the trial court abused its discretion when it denied\u2014 for procedural reasons and without a hearing \u2014 Appellant\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration of the Motion for Sanctions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-13\">IV. Whether the trial court erred in accepting the ruling striking Appellant's experts and then granting Appellees' Motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Summary Judgment solely because Appellant\u2019s experts would not be able to testify at trial.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b700-8\">. This Rule is now codified at Maryland Rule 2-402(g), and states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"azx-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>(g) <em>Trial preparation </em>\u2014 Experts.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-8\">(1) <em>Expected to be called at trial.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-9\">(A) <em>Generally. </em>\u2014 A party by interrogatories may require any other party to identify each person, other than a party, whom the other party expects to call as an expert witness at trial; to state the subject matter on which the expert is expected to testify; to state the substance of the findings and the opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each opinion; and to produce any written report made by the expert concerning those findings and opinions. A party also may take the deposition of the expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-10\">(B) <em>Additional disclosure with respect to experts retained in anticipation of litigation or for </em>trial.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-11\">In addition to the discovery permitted under subsection (g)(1)(A) of this Rule, a party by interrogatories may require the other party to summarize the qualifications of a person expected to be called as an expert witness at trial and whose findings and opinions were acquired or obtained in anticipation of litigation or for trial, to produce any available list of publications written by that expert, and to state the terms of the expert\u2019s compensation.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b709-5\">. This case is unlike <em>Maddox v. Stone, </em>174 Md.App. 489, 499, 921 A.2d 912 (2007) (holding that, where there has been \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the deadlines in a scheduling order, it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to exclude the witness). In <em>Maddox, </em>by the time the circuit court ruled that the plaintiff could not call a certain expert witness for the sole reason that the witness was not disclosed within the deadline set forth in a scheduling order, the plaintiff had provided opposing counsel with a full written report disclosing the opinions of the expert, and, after the report containing the opinions had been provided, opposing counsel had completed a deposition of the expert prior to the scheduling order's deadline for completion of discovery. <em>Id. </em>at 500, 921 A.2d 912.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">In contrast to the substantial compliance with the scheduling order and full compliance with the discovery requests in <em>Maddox, </em>Logan never provided to LSP the substance of the experts\u2019 opinions and grounds therefor. Unlike the situation in <em>Maddox, </em>the circuit court in this case was faced with Logan's failure to provide discovery as to the proposed experts' opinions even after being ordered to \"provide his experts\u2019 findings and opinions pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-402(f) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>and/or reports within 20 days\u201d of February 3, 2005, to bring his answer to compliance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
