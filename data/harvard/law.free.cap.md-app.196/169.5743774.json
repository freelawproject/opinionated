Along with his petition, Williams filed a request for waiver of prepayment of the filing fee. On August 4, 2009, the court denied Williams\u2019s request and ordered that the \u201c[pjetition be accepted but not processed until $80.00 is paid.\u201d Williams timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">The single issue before this Court is whether the circuit court properly denied Williams\u2019s request for waiver of prepay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>ment of the filing fee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons stated below, we affirm the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">On March 27, 2009, Williams filed a request for administrative remedy with the Maryland Division of Correction (\u201cDOC\u201d), challenging his transfer from the Eastern Correctional Institution (\u201cECI\u201d) to the Maryland Correctional Institution in Hagerstown (\u201cMCI-H\u201d). In support of his request, Williams alleged the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">The referenced transfer occurred despite the ECI administration\u2019s knowledge that Petitioner has potential known and unknown enemies in the Hagerstown and Cumberland prison complexes stemming from his participation in a murder investigation conducted at the Baltimore City Detention in, or about, Feb. 2006____Petitioner was consequently transferred from [the Maryland Reception, Diagnostic and Classification Center] to ECI for his protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">Williams stated that, by filing the request, he \u201cseeks redress for the ECI administration\u2019s acts of failing to abide by policies and procedures and for subjecting [him] to retaliation for using the [administrative remedy procedure] process in good faith.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, Williams sought to \u201cbe transferred back to ECI and housed on the East Compound.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">On March 30, 2009, the Warden, or Administrative Remedy Procedure (\u201cARP\u201d) Coordinator at MCI-H, dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Williams\u2019s request \u201cfor procedural reasons.\u201d The ARP Coordinator stated that the request did \u201cnot provide sufficient information to determine the basis for investigation.\u201d Accordingly, Williams was instructed to \u201c[r]esubmit [his] request by 4/16/09, and include ... names of known enemies and verification.\u201d In addition, Williams was asked to \u201c[p]rovide proof [that he was] transferred for reasons other than regular transfer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Williams declined to resubmit his request and, instead, appealed the ARP Coordinator\u2019s decision to the Commissioner of Correction on April 1, 2009. Williams argued that the dismissal was \u201cimproper, serves to deny [him] due process and places [his] safety and well being at jeopardy.\u201d On April 9, 2009, the Commissioner of Correction dismissed the appeal \u201cfor procedural reasons,\u201d specifically because Williams \u201cfailed to resubmit the request in accordance with the coordinator\u2019s instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">On April 23, 2009, Williams appealed the Commissioner\u2019s decision to the Executive Director of the Inmate Grievance Office (\u201cIGO\u201d). According to Williams, \u201cthe respective dismissals by the ARP coordinators are arbitrary, capricious and in bad faith.\u201d In addition, Williams alleged that \u201c[t]he dismissals serve to deter [his] use of the ARP process, deny [him] due process, reflect a deliberate and egregious indifference for [his] safety and violates DOC policy and procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">By letter dated June 25, 2009, the Executive Director of the IGO dismissed Williams\u2019s appeal, stating, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqN\">... [A]ny grievance complaining of a transfer is due to be filed, if at all, within 30 days of the transfer. I note from a[ ] ... report dated June 24, 2009 that you were transferred from ECI to [MCI-H] on March 16, 2009. This grievance was filed on April 27, 2009. I conclude, therefore, that you failed to file your grievance within the 30 days required by COMAR 12.07.01.05(A). Since this time limitation has not been waived for good cause shown, COMAR 12.07.01.05(F), COMAR 12.07.01.06(B)(3) requires that it be dismissed as wholly lacking in merit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>To the extent that you might argue that your complaint is subject to the ARP process, I note that your ARP complaint to the Warden was dismissed on March 80, 2009 pending resubmission with additional information. You apparently refused to do so, instead appealing to the Commissioner. The Commissioner then denied your appeal for your failure to resubmit your ARP complaint in accordance with the Warden\u2019s instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-4\">I conclude that you' failed to properly exhaust the ARP process by using all the steps available so that your complaint would be addressed on the merits. Since the exhaustion requirement has not been waived for good cause shown, COMAR 12.07.01.06(B)(4) requires that this grievance be dismissed as wholly lacking in merit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">On July 24, 2009, Williams filed a petition for judicial review of the IGO\u2019s decision in the circuit court, along with a request for waiver of prepayment of the filing fee. In support of his request for waiver of the fee, Williams stated that he is incarcerated, has no money, and earns approximately $21.50 per month, which he spends on necessities such as \u201csoap, detergent, toiletries, etc.\u201d In his petition for review, Williams averred that he \u201cpossesses a reasonable likelihood of success on issues of serious concern.\u201d To support his allegations, Williams attached a document wherein he made the following two arguments, regarding the IGO\u2019s decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">I. Grievant\u2019s use of the ARP process to address retaliation was proper and timely filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">II. Grievant\u2019s transfer was not a case management action pursuant to the DOC Case Management Manual (CCM).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Williams also included his Offender Traffic History (a list of his cell assignments) from July 2, 2008, through June 3, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">On August 4, 2009, the court denied Williams\u2019s request for waiver of the filing fee. In its order, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-10\">This civil action is governed by Section 5-1001 et seq., Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (Prisoner Litigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Act) and Maryland Rule 1-325 requiring payment of filing fees unless all or a portion is waived by the court. See also <em>Massey v. Inmate Grievance, </em>153 Md.App. 691 [837 A.2d 1040] (2003).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">The entire filing fee may not be waived unless, from information provided, the court finds that the inmate is indigent, not likely to accumulate sufficient funds to pay the filing fee within a reasonable time and <em>possesses a reasonable likelihood of success on issues of serious concern. </em>Based upon the information provided, the court may waive a portion of the filing fee unless the complaint is determined to be frivolous, but must require at least 25%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">Upon review of the papers presented and a failure to show sufficient cause for waiver pursuant to Sec. 5-1002(c), it is this 4 day of August, 2009, ORDERED that the Motion/Petition be accepted but not processed until $30.00 is paid to the Clerk of the Circuit Court for Washington County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Williams argues that he \u201csubstantially met the criteria\u201d set forth in the Prisoner Litigation Act (\u201cPLA\u201d) Section 5-1002(c) and, therefore, \u201cthe lower court abused its discretion in denying [his] motion to proceed without payment of the filing fee or, in the alternative, authorizing a payment schedule commensurate with [his] financial means.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, Williams contends that \u201cthe trial court was required to consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>request and provide a \u2018meaningful explanation\u2019 for denying it.\u201d According to Williams, by summarily denying waiver of the filing fee, the court misapplied the PLA and infringed upon his constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The State responds by stating that Williams \u201cfailed to prove that he possessed a reasonable likelihood of success on issues of serious concern.\u201d According to the State, Williams \u201cclaims that his transfer to ECI was based on retaliation,\u201d yet \u201che does not provide any information from which a court can reasonably conclude he was transferred for any reason other than legitimate, penological\u201d ones. Further, the State argues that Williams \u201cprovided no proof, or even alleged, that delay in the consideration of the issues would prejudice the consideration of the claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u201cBy 1997 Laws of Maryland, Chapter 495, the legislature enacted the Prisoner Litigation Act ... to deter frivolous litigation by prisoners.\u201d <em>Massey, supra, </em>153 Md.App. at 694, 837 A.2d 1040 (citations omitted). Consequently, the \u201climitations on those situations in which a trial court can waive or reduce filing fees\u201d for inmates under Section 5-1002(c) of the PLA \u201cexceed those limitations\u201d applicable to the members of the general population who request a waiver of the filing fee. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted); <em>compare </em>Md.Code (1973, 2006 Repl. Vol.), Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d) \u00a7 5-1002(c) <em>with </em>CJP \u00a7 7-201<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>and </em>Md. Rule 1-325(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under CJP \u00a7 5-1002(c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>A court may waive payment of the entire required filing fee for a civil action filed by a prisoner <em>only on a written showing under oath </em>by the prisoner that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">(1) The prisoner is indigent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">(2) The issue presented is of serious concern;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">(3) Delay in the consideration of the issues presented will prejudice the consideration of the claim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">(4) The prisoner is not likely to accumulate sufficient funds to pay the required filing fee within a reasonable period of time; <em>and</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-9\">(5) The prisoner possesses a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of the claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">In this case, Williams alleged, in his petition for judicial review, that he \u201cpossesses a reasonable likelihood of success on issues of serious concern.\u201d To support his allegation, Williams averred that his use of the ARP process \u201cto redress an issue of retaliation was proper\u201d and timely and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>therefore, the continuous denial of his ARP complaint \u201cwas improper and designed to intentionally hinder proper exhaustion of remedies.\u201d In his circuit court filing, Williams did not elaborate on the reason for the alleged retaliation against him, but only maintained that his transfer from ECI to MCI-H was \u201can administrative transfer ordered by the Warden\u201d and not \u201ca case management action pursuant to the DOC Case Management Manual.\u201d Williams did not recount any specific instances in which he encountered retaliatory statements or threats, nor did he provide any information to show that his transfer took place due to reasons other than legitimate, penological ones. Based upon this information, we conclude the circuit court properly found that Williams \u201cfail[ed] to show sufficient cause for waiver pursuant to Sec. 5-1002(c).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">To \u201cshow\u201d is more than just reciting the statutory language. It is essential to state the basis of one\u2019s claim with \u201csufficient particularity,\u201d such that the court can make a determination as to its validity, and the claimant\u2019s likelihood of success on the merits. <em>Cf. Spangler v. Dan A. Sprosty Bag Co., </em>183 Md. 166, 174, 36 A.2d 685 (1944) (a \u201cgood pleading\u201d alleging fraud requires that the facts constituting the allegation be \u201cset[ ] out with sufficient particularity\u201d). <em>See Massey, supra, </em>153 Md.App. at 696, 837 A.2d 1040 (\u201cAlthough Massey baldly alleged that his case was \u2018meritorious\u2019 and that the waiver of filing fees \u201cwould serve the interest of justice,\u2019 he provided no information regarding the basis of his claim that would have permitted the trial court to assess whether Massey had a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits.\u201d) (Citing \u00a7 5-1002(c)(5)). Even if we accepted as true Williams\u2019s claim that he is indigent and not likely to accumulate sufficient funds within a reasonable period of time, we could not reasonably conclude from Williams\u2019s petition that he possessed a reasonable likelihood of success on an issue of serious concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Moreover, the State correctly noted that Williams failed to satisfy the third factor of CJP \u00a7 5-1002(c). Williams failed to show, or even allege, that \u201c[djelay in the consideration of the issues presented will prejudice the consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>of the claim.\u201d CJP \u00a7 5-1002(c)(3). In his brief, Williams concedes this point, but argues that he \u201csubstantially sa-tisf[ies] the requirements of Section 5-1002.\u201d Williams\u2019s argument fails, however, because as we made clear in <em>Massey, </em>when an inmate does not satisfy the requirements of CJP \u00a7 5-1002, the trial court is \u201cnot required to consider the motion.\u201d <em>Massey, supra, </em>153 Md.App. at 696, 837 A.2d 1040. Further, there is \u201cno need for the court to explain its reasons for denying it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Williams relies on <em>Torbit v. State, </em>102 Md.App. 530, 650 A.2d 311 (1994), and <em>Davis v. Mills, </em>129 Md.App. 675, 743 A.2d 806 (2000), but those cases are inapposite. In <em>Torbit, </em>102 Md.App. at 532, 650 A.2d 311, the trial court denied, without explanation, the inmate appellant\u2019s motion to waive prepayment of the filing fee for a petition for change of name. On appeal, we vacated the decision and remanded the case, stating that a brief explanation was required. <em>Id. </em>at 537-38, 650 A.2d 311. <em>Torbit, </em>however, was decided under the less stringent requirements of CJP \u00a7 7-201, in conjunction with Maryland Rule 1-325(a), and not CJP \u00a7 5-1002. Unlike Williams, Torbit only needed to show that he was indigent and that his claim was not frivolous. <em>See </em>CJP \u00a7 7-201. As we have discussed, Williams had a heavier burden under CJP \u00a7 5-1002. Therefore, that case is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">In <em>Davis, </em>129 Md.App. at 677, 743 A.2d 806, the trial court denied the inmate appellant\u2019s motion to waive the filing fee in a civil action. On appeal, we held that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s failure to explain its reasons for denying the motion constituted an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 680, 743 A.2d 806. But, because our decision was again based on CJP \u00a7 7-201 and Maryland Rule 1-325, Williams\u2019s reliance on <em>Davis </em>is also misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">In the present case, the trial court did state its reasons for denying Williams\u2019s request to waive the filing fee. The trial court duly noted the pertinent provisions of \u00a7 5-1002(c) and concluded that there was \u201ca failure to show sufficient cause for waiver ...\u201d As we stated in <em>Massey, </em>\u201c \u2018[a] lengthy statement is not necessary; a brief, one line notation, such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>\u2018affidavit does not show that applicant is indigent,\u2019 or \u2018complaint is patently meritless [or frivolous]\u2019 will normally suffice.\u2019\u201d <em>Massey, supra, </em>153 Md.App. at 697, 837 A.2d 1040 (quoting <em>Torbit, supra, </em>102 Md.App. at 537, 650 A.2d 311) (also cited in <em>Davis, supra, </em>129 Md.App. at 679, 743 A.2d 806). Thus, for all of the foregoing reasons, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WASHINGTON COUNTY AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-11\">. In his brief, Williams presented the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-12\">1.
