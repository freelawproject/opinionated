Did the District Court err in concluding that Virgil Umland was not a resident of Umland\u2019s household at the time of Virgil\u2019s death?</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in concluding that Umland\u2019s affidavit was inadmissible hearsay?</p>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b43-12\">\u00b65 Virgil lived with his mother and Umland, his father, in Nevada from 1984 until August 1994, when Umland and Virgil\u2019s mother divorced. After the divorce, Umland moved to Montana, while Virgil stayed with his mother in Nevada.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-13\">\u00b66 The Nevada divorce decree awarded physical custody to Virgil\u2019s mother and granted visitation rights to Umland. Virgil\u2019s visits to Umland were at Virgil\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-14\">\u00b67 The Nevada divorce decree regarding custody states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-15\">Both parties are fit and proper persons to have the joint legal and physical and legal custody of the minor child. Petitioner DIANA UMLAND is hereby ordered to have physical custody of the minor child subject to Petitioner WALLACE UMLAND\u2019s rights of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>visitation at all reasonable times and places, including alternate weekends, holidays, and 6 continuous weeks during the school summer vacation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">\u00b68 The Nevada divorce decree also ordered Umland to pay $200 per month in child support. Umland paid child support from August 1994 through December 1996, but made only two payments in 1997 and made no payments in 1998 or 1999. Umland did not pay for Virgil\u2019s health insurance, nor did he pay for his half of Virgil\u2019s uncovered health expenses, although he was ordered to do so in the Nevada divorce decree. Rather, Virgil\u2019s mother fronted the costs for Virgil.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">\u00b69 Virgil visited Umland during the summer of 1995, and Virgil moved to Montana in the fall of 1996 at the advice of a juvenile officer. He lived with Umland from October 24, 1996, to December 2, 1996, before returning to Nevada to live with his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\u00b610 Virgil did not visit Umland during the summer of 1997, but did visit him for one month during the summer of 1998. When not visiting Umland, Virgil spent the balance of his time with his mother in Nevada.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">\u00b611 Virgil died in a car accident on February 19, 1999. He was 15 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">\u00b612 Before his death, while in Nevada, Virgil participated in extracurricular activities, such as football, basketball, and baseball. Virgil took a hunter\u2019s safety course in Nevada, and was also looking for part-time employment in Nevada. Further, both his medical and dental providers were located in Nevada.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">\u00b6 13 After Virgil\u2019s death, Virgil\u2019s mother continued to front the costs for Virgil\u2019s funeral expenses. She established a scholarship in Virgil\u2019s name-a scholarship to which Umland admitted he had not contributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">\u00b614 Also after Virgil\u2019s death, Umland\u2019s girlfriend added Umland as a named insured to her policy with AMCO. This policy provides for \u25a0underinsured motorist coverage for relatives who are \u201cresidents\u201d of the named insured\u2019s household.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">\u00b615 Umland and Virgil\u2019s mother entered into a settlement agreement with Progressive Casualty Insurance Company (the insurer of the driver of the car in which Virgil was a passenger when he was killed). Umland used his share of the settlement to pay his back child support owed, as well as to contribute to Virgil\u2019s funeral expenses. As part of the settlement agreement, Virgil\u2019s mother agreed to \u201cwaive any interest she may have in and to the claim of Wallace Umland for under insured or uninsured motorist coverage under his motor vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>insurance policy arising from the death of Virgil Harry Umland, the son of the parties hereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">\u00b616 At the time of Virgil\u2019s death, National Casualty Company issued a business auto insurance policy to Umland Trucking for Umland\u2019s logging operation. This policy also provides for underinsured motorist coverage for relatives who are \u201cresidents\u201d of the named insured\u2019s household.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">\u00b617 The District Court found that Virgil was not a resident of Umland\u2019s household, and also excluded from evidence Umland\u2019s affidavit, which contained assertions that Virgil said he was going to stay with Umland during the summer of 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">\u00b618 Umland now appeals the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">\u00b619 We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo. Cole ex rel. Revocable Trust v. Cole, </em>2003 MT 229, \u00b6 8, 317 Mont. 197, \u00b6 8, 75 P.3d 1280, \u00b6 8. The movant must prove that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once the movant demonstrates this, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to prove that a genuine issue of material fact does exist. After a district court determines that no genuine issues of material fact exist, the district court must then determine whether the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Cole, </em>\u00b6 8. We review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions for correctness. <em>Cole, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">\u00b620 1. Did the District Court err in concluding that Virgil Umland was not a resident of Umland\u2019s household at the time of Virgil\u2019s death?</p>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">\u00b621 Umland argues that under Montana\u2019s statutory definition, a minor\u2019s residence is the \u201cresidence of the parent having legal custody.\u201d And, because Montana allows for joint parenting, Umland further argues it naturally follows that Montana also allows for dual residency. In addition, Umland contends that under the four-part analysis this Court articulated in <em>Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. Blair </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 52, 817 P.2d 1156, Virgil was a resident of Umland\u2019s household. \u00b622 Umland also asserts that the policy language, namely the \u201cresident of a household\u201d language, is ambiguous, which should be construed against National Casualty Company and AMCO Insurance Company (the Companies).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-12\">\u00b623 The Companies argue that not only does Montana not allow dual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>residency, but, more importantly, Umland does not have joint custody of Virgil on which to base his residency argument. In addition, the Companies contend that Umland raises for the first time on appeal his argument that the \u201cresident of a household\u201d language is ambiguous. Hence, this Court should not address this argument. Finally, the Companies argue that the facts prove under the four-part analysis articulated in <em>Farmers Union </em>that Virgil was not a resident of Umland\u2019s household.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\u00b624 Section 1-1-215, MCA, states that in determining a person\u2019s place of residence, the following shall be observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-5\">(1) [A person\u2019s place of residence] is the place where a person remains when not called elsewhere for labor or other special or temporary purpose and to which the person returns in seasons of repose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">(2) There may only be one residence. If a person claims a residence within Montana for any purpose, then that location is the person\u2019s residence for all purposes unless there is a specific statutory exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">(3) A residence cannot be lost until another is gained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-8\">(4) The residence of a minor\u2019s parents or, if one of them is deceased or they do not share the same residence, the residence of the parent having legal custody or, if neither parent has legal custody, the residence of the parent with whom the minor customarily resides is the residence of the unmarried minor. In case of a controversy, the district court may declare which parental residence is the residence of an 'unmarried minor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">(5) The residence of an unmarried minor who has a parent living cannot be changed by either the minor\u2019s own act or that of the minor\u2019s guardian.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-10\">(6) The residence can be changed only by the union of act and intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">\u00b625 We have held that the above-quoted statutory language merely provides a district court with guidelines in determining a person\u2019s place of residence. Hence, each case regarding a person\u2019s place of residence \u201cmust stand on its own facts.\u201d <em>Lima School Dist. No. 12 v. Simonsen </em>(1984), 210 Mont. 100, 110-11, 683 P.2d 471, 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-12\">\u00b626  Mindful of these guidelines, Virgil clearly resided with his mother in Nevada and was a resident of her household. Under the Nevada divorce decree, she had physical custody over Virgil, while Umland only had visitation rights. Umland exercised these rights a total of three or four months over a four-year period. Virgil\u2019s mother, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>not Umland, financially supported Virgil, and, before his death, Virgil had not even been inside of Umland\u2019s house for more than seven months. The majority, if not all, of Virgil\u2019s contacts, time spent in school, and athletic involvement occurred in Nevada with the financial and emotional support of Virgil\u2019s mother. The record clearly shows that Virgil customarily resided with his mother in Nevada, thereby meeting the statutory language of \u00a7 1-1-215(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">\u00b627 In addition, under \u00a7 1-1-215(4), MCA, a district court may declare which parental residence is in fact the residence of an unmarried minor. Here, the District Court did just that by declaring the mother\u2019s residence as Virgil\u2019s place of residence on the facts presented. In further support of the District Court\u2019s finding, while some states may allow dual residency, Montana clearly does not under \u00a7 1-1-215(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\u00b628 The District Court further analyzed Umland\u2019s argument by applying the four-part analysis articulated in <em>Farmers Union. </em>Umland argued in his brief to the District Court that <em>Farmers Union </em>applied if the court found that \u00a7 1-1-215, MCA, did not resolve the issue of dual residency of a minor for insurance purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\u00b629 However, because we hold that \u00a7 1-1-215, MCA, does apply, we need not analyze the four factors articulated in <em>Farmers Union, </em>nor do we need to analyze the Companies\u2019 policy language itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">\u00b630  We hold, therefore, that under \u00a7 1-1-215, MCA, the District Court did not err in determining that Virgil was not a resident of Umland\u2019s household.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">\u00b631 2. Did the District Court err in concluding that Umland\u2019s affidavit was inadmissible hearsay?</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">\u00b632 Umland argues that Virgil\u2019s statement to him that Virgil intended on staying with him during the summer of 1999 was not hearsay. He maintains that the statement fell under an exception to the hearsay rule, namely that the statement was one of Virgil\u2019s then existing state of mind as to his intent or plan. Clearly relevant, Umland argues that the District Court erred in excluding such statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">\u00b633 The Companies argue that events that could have potentially taken place after Virgil\u2019s death, and statements to that effect, are not probative of the issue at hand, namely whether Virgil was a resident of Umland\u2019s household at the time of Virgil\u2019s death. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">\u00b634 At issue in <em>Moen v. Peter Kiewit &amp; Sons\u2019 Co. </em>(1982), 201 Mont. 425, 655 P.2d 482, was whether testimony from the decedent\u2019s wife regarding a phone call she received the night before her husband\u2019s death was admissible under Rule 803(3), M.R.Evid., as his then state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>of mind. Specifically, the decedent\u2019s wife desired to testify that her husband told her that he had to stay late at work to steam clean. <em>Moen, </em>210 Mont, at 436-37, 655 P.2d at 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">\u00b635 We held that the husband\u2019s state of mind regarding his reasoning as to why he had to stay late was irrelevant to the matter in controversy, namely whether her husband\u2019s coworker negligently failed to provide help to her husband as he was having a heart attack. <em>Moen, </em>210 Mont, at 437, 655 P.2d at 488. In so holding, we noted that \u201c[w]hen intention or state of mind is not at issue, the hearsay exception [Rule 803(3), M.R.Evid.] does not apply.\u201d <em>Moen, </em>201 Mont, at 437, 655 P.2d at 488 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u00b636  Here, the issue before the District Court was whether Virgil was a resident of Umland\u2019s household in Montana at the time of his death in February 1999. As in <em>Moen, </em>Virgil\u2019s intent on staying at Umland\u2019s house during the summer of 1999 is irrelevant to the issue here presented. Thus, we hold that the District Court did not err in excluding Umland\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u00b637 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b48-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
