McMahon (R.J.) were married for nearly ten years. However, McMahon and R.J. began to experience marital difficulties, and McMahon moved out of R. J.\u2019s house permanently near the end of October 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">\u00b64 On October 31, 2000, around 1:30 a.m., McMahon entered the 1145 Club, which R.J. owned. McMahon had previously worked at the 1145 Club, doing some book work and various other activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">\u00b65 Around 1:45 a.m., R.J. asked McMahon to leave. When McMahon refused to leave, R.J. took her by the arm to escort her out. In so doing, a \u201cyelling match\u201d between McMahon and R.J. ensued, and McMahon attempted to punch R.J.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">\u00b66 As R.J. continued more forcefully to escort McMahon out of the bar, McMahon pulled a gun from her purse with her finger on the trigger. In so doing, R.J. testified that he hoped the safety was on and immediately \u201ctried to make sure that she wouldn\u2019t be able to get it fired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">\u00b67 R.J. tackled McMahon to the floor, in an attempt to keep the gun flat, as he testified that he thought McMahon was going to \u201cprobably shoot me, and who knows, maybe shoot somebody else.\u201d While R.J. was physically able to keep the gun flat on the floor, several other patrons of the bar assisted R.J. in obtaining the gun from McMahon, who still had her finger on the trigger.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-15\">\u00b68 Looking relatively calm after the incident, R.J. maintained throughout the trial that he was \u201cnot really\u201d in fear for his life, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>although he did realize that he could have been shot, saying several times after the incident, \u201cWell, thank God that\u2019s over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AWM\">\u00b69 McMahon was ultimately arrested and charged with assault with a weapon. She pleaded not guilty, and her case proceeded to trial. At the close of the State of Montana\u2019s (the State) case, McMahon moved for a directed verdict based on insufficiency of the evidence. The District Court denied this motion, and the jury ultimately convicted McMahon of assault with a weapon. McMahon\u2019s sentence was deferred for three years upon several conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b610 McMahon now appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of her motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\u00b611  We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for directed verdict for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Landis, </em>2002 MT 45, \u00b6 23, 308 Mont. 354, \u00b6 23, 43 P.3d 298, \u00b6 23. As long as sufficient evidence exists to support the trier of fact in finding the elements of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt, no abuse of discretion results. <em>Landis, </em>\u00b6 23. We review the evidence in a criminal trial in the light most favorable to the prosecution to determine whether the trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Martin, </em>2001 MT 83, \u00b6 17, 305 Mont. 123, \u00b6 17, 23 P.3d 216, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">\u00b612 Did the District Court err in denying McMahon\u2019s motion for a directed verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">\u00b613 McMahon argues that the State produced insufficient evidence at trial to prove that R.J. had a reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury, as required under \u00a7 45-5-213(a), MCA, since R.J. testified that he was not really afraid of McMahon dining the attack. In addition, McMahon maintains that R. J.\u2019s testimony regarding his main concern that McMahon\u2019s gun would discharge in the bar and injure a patron of the bar, rather than himself, also evidences that R.J. was not in fear of serious bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">\u00b614 The State counters that proof of R. J.\u2019s fear of serious bodily injury is not required to prove reasonable apprehension under \u00a7 45-5-213(1), MCA. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">\u00b615 Section 45-5-213(l)(b), MCA, states that \u201c[a] person commits the offense of assault with a weapon if the person purposely or knowingly causes ... reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury in another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>by use of a weapon or what reasonably appears to be a weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b616 Serious bodily injury means bodily injury that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">(i) creates a substantial risk of death;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">(ii) causes serious permanent disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function or process of a bodily member or organ; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">(iii) at the time of injury, can reasonably be expected to result in serious permanent disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function or process of a bodily member or organ.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Section 45-2~101(65)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">\u00b617 We held in <em>State v. LaMere </em>(1980), 190 Mont. 332, 621 P.2d 462, that the element of fear is not required to prove reasonable apprehension, nor is \u201cdelayed apprehension\u201d required, as McMahon asserts. Indeed, we noted that \u201cas in civil assault, \u2018apprehension is not the same thing as fear.\u2019 \u201d <em>LaMere, </em>190 Mont. at 336, 621 P.2d at 464 (quoting W. Prosser, <em>Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 10 (4th ed. 1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">\u00b618 The issue in <em>LaMere </em>concerned whether a boy was in reasonable apprehension when the boy stated that he was not afraid at the time the defendant held a large knife to the boy\u2019s stomach and threatened that he would kill him, and instead stated that only after he left the situation did the boy realize that he could have been killed. <em>LaMere, </em>190 Mont, at 334, 336, 621 P.2d at 463-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">\u00b619 In holding that fear was not required to prove reasonable apprehension, we recognized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-12\">a victim may be put in a position ... of being so startled, or shocked, or afraid, that his reaction is a delayed one. The \u201creasonable apprehension\u201d may be a response that the victim is not instantly aware of, but his actions may clearly show that he apprehends the reality of the attack.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-13\"><em>LaMere, </em>190 Mont, at 336, 621 P.2d at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-14\">\u00b620 In addition, we noted that the legislative aim of assault statutes was to prevent breaches of the peace in situations where a victim may be provoked into breaching the peace when placed in a position knowing that self defense is required. <em>LaMere, </em>190 Mont. at 335, 621 P.2d at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-15\">\u00b621 We also held in <em>State v. Hagberg </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 33, 920 P.2d 86, that in looking at the totality of the circumstances-i.e., the officer\u2019s testimony regarding his apprehension and the defendant\u2019s belligerence, alcohol odor, and glazed look-sufficient evidence existed to prove that the officer was in reasonable apprehension. <em>Hagberg, </em>277 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Mont, at 41, 920 P.2d at 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u00b622  Here, after realizing that McMahon had pulled a gun from her purse, R. J. immediately tried to make sure that she did not fire it, as he thought she was probably going to shoot him or somebody else. R. J. and several other patrons of the bar physically struggled with McMahon in attempting to keep the gun flat and in obtaining the gun from McMahon. While R. J. maintained that he was not in fear for his life, he did testify that he later realized, much as the boy in <em>LaMere </em>did, that he could have been shot. In totality, this reaction, coupled with R. J.\u2019s struggle with McMahon in obtaining the gun from her, and his belief that McMahon would shoot him or someone else, sufficiently establishes that he reasonably apprehended serious bodily injury. The fact that he testified that he did not fear for his life is inconsequential under our holding in <em>LaMere </em>and the legislative aim of assault statutes in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u00b623 Therefore, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying McMahon\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u00b624 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b107-7\">JUSTICES REGNIER, COTTER, RICE and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
