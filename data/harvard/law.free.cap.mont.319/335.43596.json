The District Court dismissed Smart\u2019s action with prejudice as a sanction for dilatory discovery practices. Smart now appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"ACK\">\u00b62 On the cold and snowy night of November 8, 1998, Smart was traveling on Highway 87 heading towards Havre. Outside the town of Fort Benton, Secondary 386 intersects Highway 87, with a stop sign facing travelers on Secondary 386. Molinario approached this intersection and stopped at the sign. The roads were snow-packed and icy with poor visibility due to a lightly falling snow. As Smart came around the bend approaching the intersection his vehicle began to skid on the ice. Smart\u2019s 1978 Ford Bronco slid broadside for at least 175 feet before colliding with Molinario\u2019s 1994 Pontiac. Both vehicles ended up in the ditch with Molinario\u2019s on top of the stop sign. Smart moved his Bronco twice before officers arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">\u00b63 The accident was investigated by Officer Ayers of the Montana Highway Patrol and Officers Hulme and Oeleis of the Chouteau County Sheriffs Department. The physical evidence of Smart\u2019s skid marks through the ice crusted snow, the debris field at the point of impact, and the final resting point of the vehicles led all three officers to reach the same conclusions: that immediately prior to the impact, Molinario\u2019s vehicle was resting upon the white stop bar on Secondary 386, thirty-two feet back from the intersection with Highway 87 and that Smart was driving too fast for the conditions. Smart was cited for a basic rule violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">\u00b64 Despite the physical evidence, the officers\u2019 conclusions and the citation, Smart maintained that Molinario had failed to stop. According to Smart, he applied his brakes and entered the skid when he saw Molinario continue to pull forward, and, thus, she caused the accident. Smart obtained an attorney and filed a complaint against Molinario on July 11, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">\u00b65 Discovery proceeded with Molinario serving interrogatories and requests for production of documents. These requests included: Smart\u2019s medical records for the last eleven years; a statement of the subject matter, substance of the facts, and substance of each opinion to which each expert would testify; and copies of any and all reports prepared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>by expert witnesses. Five days before the scheduled trial, on January 31, 2001, as Smart was taking the video deposition of his physician, Dr. Nelson, Molinario became aware that a large portion of Dr. Nelson\u2019s medical file on Smart had not been identified or produced in response to discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">\u00b66 Immediately thereafter, Molinario moved to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint with prejudice as a sanction for the discovery violations or, in the alternative, to preclude Dr. Nelson from testifying. Before the court ruled on this motion, Smart informed the court that he had fired his attorney, who similarly indicated that he could not continue to represent Smart. The court then vacated the trial which had been set for the very next day, allowed Smart\u2019s attorney to withdraw and took Molinario\u2019s motion under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u00b67 Despite Smart\u2019s repeated requests for more time to retain new counsel, the court subsequently dismissed his claim with prejudice. Smart now claims on appeal that the dismissal of his claim with prejudice denied him due process because he was not given sufficient time to obtain the services of another attorney. He claims that his cognitive disability made it more difficult to get a new attorney given that his previous attorney did not give him the complete file in a timely manner. Molinario responds that the dismissal with prejudice was an appropriate sanction for discovery abuse and cross-appeals claiming that the District Court should have granted summary judgment in favor of defendant on the issue of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">\u00b68 We review a trial court\u2019s imposition of discovery sanctions for an abuse of discretion. <em>Lewistown Propane Co. v. Moncur, </em>2002 MT 349, \u00b6 22, 313 Mont. 368, \u00b6 22, 61 P.3d 780, \u00b6 22. This Court has consistently deferred to a district court\u2019s imposition of sanctions because \u201c[t]he trial judge is in the best position to know ... which parties callously disregard the rights of their opponents and other litigants seeking their day in court. The trial judge is also in the best position to determine which sanction is the most appropriate.\u201d <em>Cass v. Composite Indus. of Am., Inc., </em>2002 MT 226, \u00b6 19, 311 Mont. 406, \u00b6 19, 56 P.3d 322, \u00b6 19 <em>(quoting Dassori v. Roy Stanley Chevrolet Co. </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 178, 180, 728 P.2d 430, 431).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">\u00b69 A sanction under Rule 37(d), M.R.Civ.P., is appropriate when a party fails:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">(1) to appear before the officer who is to take the deposition, after being served with a proper notice, or (2) to serve answers or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>objections to interrogatories submitted under Rule 33, after proper service of the interrogatories, or (3) to serve a written response to a request for inspection submitted under Rule 34, after proper service of the request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">\u00b610 Here, in responding to discovery requests, Smart withheld some seventy-five to eighty pages of documents with crucial information regarding his case for damages. The previously unproduced portions of Dr. Nelson\u2019s file included the report and deposition of Dr. Wu, to whom Dr. Nelson had referred Smart for a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan. Dr. Nelson stated in his deposition that he intended to rely on the report and deposition testimony of Dr. Wu. \u00b611 Other undisclosed items from the file included letters between Smart and Dr. Nelson regarding the extent and nature of his injuries with Smart\u2019s handwritten notes which contradicted his deposition, the names of two other doctors who had consulted or participated in Smart\u2019s case, and letters from Dr. Nelson requesting MRI examinations of Smart. The previously undisclosed documents all had bearing on Smart\u2019s claim for damages. In light of the foregoing, a sanction for discovery abuse was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\u00b612 We next analyze the appropriateness of the sanction in relation to the abuse. In <em>Schuff, </em>we stated that in our review of sanctions for discovery abuse, we may consider the following factors: (1) whether the consequences imposed by the sanctions relate to the extent and nature of the actual discovery abuse; (2) the extent of the prejudice to the opposing party which resulted from the discovery abuse; and (3) whether the court expressly warned the abusing party of the consequences. <em>Schuff v. A.T. Klemens &amp; Sons, </em>2000 MT 357, \u00b6 72, 303 Mont. 274, \u00b6 72, 16 P.3d 1002, \u00b6 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\u00b613 In <em>Smith v. Butte-Silver Bow County </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 329, 916 P.2d 91, we refused to uphold the imposition of the sanction of dismissal with prejudice because it bore little relationship to the extent and nature of the discovery abuse which was curable with further discovery. Furthermore, the imposition of dismissal was harsher than what the court had forewarned. <em>Smith, </em>276 Mont. at 338-40, 916 P.2d at 96-97. However, it is not necessary for the court to warn of sanctions before imposing them for a violation of Rule 37(d), M.R.Civ.P. In <em>Jerome v. Pardis </em>(1989), 240 Mont. 187, 783 P.2d 919, we upheld a dismissal with prejudice when the plaintiff concealed information by way of failing to produce material portions of his doctor\u2019s file. <em>Jerome, </em>240 Mont, at 193, 783 P.2d at 923. Also, we have upheld the sanction of imposing liability and presuming that punitive damages were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>appropriate where a defendant\u2019s dilatory tactics showed he had little interest in having the case adjudicated on its merits. <em>Maloney v. Home &amp; Investment Center, Inc., </em>2000 MT 34, \u00b6 36, 298 Mont. 213, \u00b6 36, 994 P.2d 1124, \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">\u00b614  In the present case, Smart engaged in dilatory tactics calculated to hide his weak case from Molinario. Smart has also consistently demonstrated little interest or ability in adjudicating this case on its merits. By way of example, when the court denied Smart\u2019s request to vacate the second trial setting, Smart\u2019s response was to fire his attorney and thereby avoid going to trial. Molinario has a right to have this matter resolved. She has been prejudiced by having to deal with Smart\u2019s dilatory tactics. Such tactics must not be rewarded. The sanction of dismissal with prejudice was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">\u00b615 Because we conclude Smart\u2019s case was appropriately dismissed, we do not need to address Molinario\u2019s cross-appeal on the issue of summary judgment. To the extent Smart\u2019s brief purports to raise other issues, they are not supported by citation to legal authority. Thus, pursuant to Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., we also decline to address those issues. The order of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b365-6\">JUSTICE NELSON, REGNIER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
