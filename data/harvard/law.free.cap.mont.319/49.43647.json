County of Cascade.</court>\n<parties data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"parties\" id=\"b543-9\">STATE OF MONTANA, Plaintiff, vs. BRANDON L. MAIN, Defendant,</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b543-20\">No. ADC-02-353</docketnumber>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"AKd\">Decision</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b543-13\">On April 24, 2003, the defendant was sentenced to thirteen (13) month commitment to the Department of Corrections, followed by three (3) years probation for the offense of DUI, a felony. This sentence is to run concurrently with defendant\u2019s sentence out of Blaine County, and to run consecutively with the defendant\u2019s sentence out of Hill County.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-14\">On August 21, 2003, the Sentence Review Division of the Montana Supreme Court heard the defendant\u2019s application for review of that sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-15\">The defendant was present and was represented by Meghan Lulf. The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-16\">Before hearing the application, the defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also increase it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-17\">Rule 17 of the Rules of the Sentence Review Division of the Supreme Court of Montana provides that \"the sentence imposed by the District Court is presumed correct, and the sentence will not be reduced or increased unless it is deemed clearly inadequate or excessive.\" (\u00a746-18-904(3), MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-18\">The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are insufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is inadequate or excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-19\">Therefore, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be affirmed.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AHs\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>DATED this 8th day of September, 2003.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b544-3\">Done in open Court this 21st day of August, 2003.</p>\n<judges id=\"b544-5\">Chairperson, Hon.
