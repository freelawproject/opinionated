The Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) filed a petition for termination of KP.\u2019s parental rights to R.B. and J.C. in the Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Custer County. The District Court granted the petition, and K.P. appeals. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">\u00b62 We restate the sole issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">\u00b63 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it terminated KP.\u2019s parental rights to R.B. and J.C.?</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b139-13\">\u00b64 On January 10, 2002, K.P. left two-year-old R.B. and two-month-old J.C. alone in their home in Miles City, Montana, for over one hour. As a result, DPHHS filed a petition for emergency protective services and temporary legal custody of R.B. and J.C. on January 15,2002. The District Court conducted a hearing on the petition on March 22, 2002. At the hearing, the parties stipulated to the fact that the children were youths in need of care, and agreed that the District Court could award temporary legal custody of the children to DPHHS. The parties also submitted a treatment plan for K.P. The District Court reviewed and approved the treatment plan that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-14\">\u00b65 On March 28, 2002, the District Court adjudicated the children youths in need of care, as defined in \u00a7 41-3-102, MCA (2001), and granted temporary legal custody of the children to DPHHS. On September 12, 2002, DPHHS filed a petition requesting that the District Court terminate KP.\u2019s parental rights to R.B. and J.C. As grounds for the termination, DPHHS asserted that K.P. failed to complete the treatment plan approved by the District Court. On October 25,2002, Amber Trenka, the guardian ad litem for the instant case, filed a report recommending that K.P.\u2019s parental rights to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>children be terminated. Among other things, Trenka\u2019s report indicated that K.P. had not successfully completed the treatment plan approved by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">\u00b66 The District Court conducted a hearing on the petition on January 14, 2003. On January 28, 2003, the District Court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law, terminating K.P.\u2019s parental rights to R.B. and J.C. K.P. appealed on February 6, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>In re M.T., </em>2002 MT 174, \u00b6 21, 310 Mont. 506, \u00b6 21, 51 P.3d 1141, \u00b6 21. We review a district court\u2019s specific findings to determine if they are clearly erroneous. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence or if, upon reviewing the record, this Court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>In re M.T., </em>\u00b6 21. Additionally, we will presume that a district court\u2019s decision is correct and will not disturb it on appeal unless there is a mistake of law or a finding of fact not supported by substantial evidence that would amount to a clear abuse of discretion. <em>In re M.T., </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">\u00b68 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it terminated K. P.\u2019s parental rights to R.B. and J.C.?</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">\u00b69 There are several circumstances under which a district court may order the termination of the parent-child legal relationship. See \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA (2001). Once such circumstance is in situations where the child is an adjudicated youth in need of care and both of the following exist: (1) an appropriate treatment plan that has been approved by the court has not been complied with by the parents or has not been successful; and (2) the conduct or condition of the parents rendering them unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Section 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">\u00b610 In the instant case, K.P. concedes that R.B. and J.C. were adjudicated by the District Court as youths in need of care. K.P. further concedes that she failed to successfully complete all portions of the treatment plan approved by the District Court. However, K.P. maintains that the District Court improperly terminated her parental rights because the evidence is insufficient to find that the conduct or condition rendering her unfit was unlikely to change within a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">\u00b611  In order to determine whether the conduct or condition rendering a parent unfit is likely to change within a reasonable time, the District Court is required to assess the past and present conduct of the parent. <em>In re M.T., </em>\u00b6 34. We do not have a crystal ball to look into to make this determination, so it must, to some extent, be based on a person\u2019s past conduct. <em>In re A.S., </em>2002 MT 265, \u00b6 23, 312 Mont. 277, \u00b6 23, 59 P.3d 382, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">\u00b612 In this case, DPHHS began providing services to K.P. in June of 2001. Some of these services included: public assistance, food stamps, Medicaid, low income housing, WIC, mental health services, family based services, and in-home services from the Developmental Education Assistance Program. Despite her utilization of such services, K.P. was unable to consistently meet her children\u2019s basic needs. Moreover, on January 10, 2002, K.P. left two-year-old R.B. and two-month-old J.C. alone at home for over an hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\u00b613 In the months following the removal of the children, K.P. failed to successfully complete the treatment plan approved by the District Court. Most notably, K.P. was unable to maintain employment, secure a permanent residence, attend counseling sessions, and attend all of her scheduled visits with the children. K.P. also tested positive for THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, on September 9, 2002, despite the fact that she was pregnant (with her third child) at the time. As a result of K.P.\u2019s failure to comply with the treatment plan, DPHHS requested that the District Court terminate her parental rights to R.B. and J.C. on September 12, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">\u00b614 On October 9, 2002, K.P. moved from Miles City to Hopkins, Minnesota. While in Hopkins, K.P. resided with her mother and stepfather. On November 15,2002, K.P. obtained employment at a Kmart store. However, she discontinued such employment in December of 2002, when her pregnancy forced her to be placed on bed rest. She remained unemployed and on bed rest when she appeared at the hearing on January 14, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">\u00b615 K.P. asserts that because she had obtained employment and was living in a stable environment at the time of the hearing, the District Court erred in finding that the conduct or condition rendering her unfit was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Indeed, the District Court stated at the hearing that: \u201cI believe that [K.P.] has made a lot of good progress in the last couple of months, and I think that\u2019s largely because her mother is giving her the support that she needs.\u201d However, the District Court also made the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>observations to K.P.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-4\">[Y]ou simply haven\u2019t taken advantage of things that were available to you. And it\u2019s not because you are not able to do so. You have the ability to do the things that you need to do. You just haven\u2019t done them. You have not complied with the service treatment plan.... you did a few things here and there, and that\u2019s just not enough. You made these strides with your mother, but your history is not that you will follow through with these strides and these steps that you have positively taken. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\u00b616  This Court has previously concluded that evidence of rehabilitation on the part of the parent is germane to the issue of that parent\u2019s ability to care for his or her child in the future. <em>In re A.S., </em>\u00b6 23. We have also concluded however, that evidence of rehabilitation does not render a district court powerless to find future danger to the child, it is simply evidence to be considered by the district court, and is subject to the same standard of review as any other evidence. <em>In re A.S., </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u00b617  Here, the District Court compared KP.\u2019s partial attempts to comply with the treatment plan in the three months preceding the hearing to her history of non-compliance over the course of seventeen months. The District Court then determined that, taken as a whole, it was unlikely that K.P. would become a fit parent within a reasonable time. After a careful review of the record, we conclude that the District Court did not err in making this determination. See generally <em>In re J.W., </em>2001 MT 86, \u00b6\u00b6 23-25, 305 Mont. 149, \u00b6\u00b6 23-25, 23 P.3d 916, \u00b6\u00b6 23-25. K.P. was not able to complete her treatment plan, nor does the record demonstrate that the District Court erred in finding that the conduct which rendered her unfit was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Accordingly, the statutory criteria listed in \u00a7 41-3-609(1)(f), MCA (2001), have been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">\u00b618 Because the statutory criteria listed in \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA (2001), were satisfied, the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it terminated K.P.\u2019s parental rights to R.B. and J.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">\u00b619 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b142-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
