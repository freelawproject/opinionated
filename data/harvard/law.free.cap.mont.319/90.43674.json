We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-15\">\u00b62 The two issues on appeal are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b117-16\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erred when it found that the condition rendering S.B. unfit was unlikely to change within a reasonable time?</p>\n<p id=\"b117-18\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred when it allowed the guardian ad litem to present hearsay evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"AW9\">\u00b65 S.B. is the natural mother of S.H. and B.H. The natural father of the children is deceased. The State of Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) became involved with the family in Cascade County because of allegations that the stepfather was sexually abusing the children. S.H. and B.H. were removed from the home and have been in foster care since June 13, 2001. The District Court adjudicated the children youths in need of care on September 25, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">\u00b66 In April of 2003, the District Court held a hearing regarding the State of Montana\u2019s petition for termination of parental rights. After the hearing, the court found the following facts. DPHHS developed a treatment plan for S.B. that included obtaining a chemical dependency evaluation, submitting to random urinalysis drug-testing, attending weekly Alcoholics Anonymous/Narcotics Anonymous (AA/NA) meetings, providing documentation of attendance at these meetings, receiving individual counseling, seeing a psychiatrist and taking prescribed medications, and maintaining consistent and frequent contact with S.H. and B.H. On December 31, 2001, the District Court approved the treatment plan and ordered S.B. to complete it. DPHHS reviewed the requirements of the treatment plan with S.B. on several occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u00b67 S.B. did not successfully complete her treatment plan. S.B. completed a chemical dependency evaluation but did not consistently submit to random drug testing. She did not provide verification of attendance at AA/NA meetings. She failed to attend individual counseling or keep psychiatrist appointments or take prescribed medication. S.B. also failed to maintain frequent and consistent contact with S.H. and B.H. Based on these factors, the District Court found that S.B. made minimal efforts to comply with and did not successfully complete her treatment plan. The court went on to conclude that, due to S.B.\u2019s history of noncompliance and her failed treatment plan, the conduct or condition rendering her unfit was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. The court concluded that despite DPHHS\u2019s reasonable efforts to reunite the family, the evidence demonstrated that the continuation of the parent-child legal relationship would likely result in continued abuse and neglect. The court determined that the interests of the children, considering their physical, mental, and emotional needs, would be best served by terminating S.B.\u2019s parental rights. The court entered an order terminating her parental rights. S.B. appeals from the District Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>order.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u00b68 Issue 1: Whether the District Court erred when it found that the condition rendering S.B. unfit was unlikely to change within a reasonable time?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">\u00b69  We review a district court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>In re J. </em>W., 2001 MT 86, \u00b6 7, 305 Mont. 149, \u00b6 7, 23 P.3d 916, \u00b6 7. We review the decision to \u201cdetermine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact supporting termination are clearly erroneous and whether the district court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct.\u201d <em>In re A.T., </em>2003 MT 154, \u00b6 9, 316 Mont. 255, \u00b6 9, 70 P.3d 1247, \u00b6 9. \u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence or if, upon reviewing the record, this Court is left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake.\u201d <em>In re J.W., </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">\u00b610 \u201cIt is well-established that in reviewing a district court\u2019s findings, ... we do not consider whether the evidence could support a different finding; nor do we substitute our judgment for that of the fact-finder regarding the weight given to the evidence.\u201d <em>In re D.V., </em>2003 MT 160, \u00b6 21, 316 Mont. 282, \u00b6 21, 70 P.3d 1253, \u00b6 21 (citation and internal quotations omitted). \u201c[I]t is the trial court\u2019s responsibility to weigh the evidence presented and ascertain the witnesses\u2019 corresponding <em>credibility.\u201dIn re K.S., </em>2003 MT 212, \u00b6 20, 317 Mont. 88, \u00b6 20, 75 P.3d 325, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">\u00b611 A court does not make the decision to terminate parental rights lightly. <em>In re D.V., </em>\u00b6 24. \u201cThe party seeking to terminate an individual\u2019s parental rights has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the statutory criteria for termination have been met.\u201d <em>In re A.T., </em>\u00b6 10 (citation omitted). \u201c[A] natural parent\u2019s right to care and custody of a child is a fundamental liberty interest which must be protected by fundamentally fair procedures.\u201d <em>In re A. </em>T., \u00b6 10. \u201c[A] district court must make specific factual findings in accordance with the requirements set forth in \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA.\u201d <em>In re </em>J.W., \u00b6 7. A person\u2019s parental rights to a child may be terminated by a district court, pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, if the court \u201c[1] finds that the child has been adjudicated a youth in need of care, [2] an appropriate court-approved treatment plan has not been complied with or has been unsuccessful, and [3] the conduct or condition rendering the parent unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable period of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>time.\u201d <em>In re J.W., </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">\u00b612  Complete compliance with a treatment plan is required. <em>In re D.V., </em>\u00b6 25. Substantial or partial compliance is insufficient to prove that a person is prepared to be a fit or responsible parent. <em>In re D.V., </em>\u00b6 25. In determining whether a parent\u2019s conduct or condition is likely to be cured in a reasonable period of time or is likely to continue for an extended time, a court considers history of emotional and mental illness, history of violent behavior, chemical or alcohol dependency, and imprisonment. Section 41-3-609(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u00b613 \u201c[T]he district court is bound to give primary consideration to the physical, mental, and emotional conditions and needs of the children. Consequently, the best interests of the children are of paramount concern in a parental rights termination proceeding and take precedence over the parental rights.\u201d <em>In re J. </em>W., \u00b6 8 (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\u00b614 In this case, the court considered S.B.\u2019s history of chemical dependency and her continual failure to successfully comply with the treatment plan. The record reflects that S.B. made minimal efforts to comply with her treatment plan. She did complete a chemical dependency evaluation but she failed to consistently submit to random drug testing. She failed to submit verification of attendance at AA/NA meetings. She did not attend individual counseling or keep psychiatrist appointments and take prescribed medication. S.B. failed to maintain a healthy relationship with S.H. or B.H. by maintaining frequent and consistent contact. Additionally, due to S.B.\u2019s history of noncompliance and minimal attempts to complete her treatment plan, the court determined S.B.\u2019s behavior was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Section 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u00b615  The evidence presented to the District Court supports its conclusion that S.B. failed to comply with her treatment plan and that the court\u2019s concerns about S.B.\u2019s parental fitness were unlikely to change in a reasonable period of time. The criteria of \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA, were satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">\u00b616 Issue 2: Whether the District Court erred when it allowed the guardian ad litem to present hearsay evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">\u00b617 The District Court determined that the three statutory conditions of \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, had been established and terminated S.B.\u2019s parental rights. On appeal, S.B. does not challenge the court\u2019s finding that S.H. and B.H. had been adjudicated youths in need of care. Rather, S.B. contends that the court\u2019s termination of her rights was based in part on the testimony of the guardian ad litem (GAL) and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>this testimony was highly prejudicial, based on hearsay, violated her constitutional due process rights, and lowered the State\u2019s burden of proof. S.B. also claims that the statute pursuant to which this testimony was allowed is unconstitutional. S.B. also claims that the court should have accepted her testimony that she had substantially complied with her treatment plan because it was not refuted by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">\u00b618 We have repeatedly recognized that courts should avoid constitutional issues whenever possible. <em>Merlin Myers Revocable Trust v. Yellowstone County, </em>2002 MT 201, \u00b6 24, 311 Mont. 194, \u00b6 24, 53 P.3d 1268, \u00b6 24. \u2018We have held that certain constraints govern the Court\u2019s power to determine the constitutionality of statutes. Among those constraints is the principle that we will not rule on the constitutionality of a legislative act if we are able to decide the case without reaching constitutional considerations.\u201d <em>Merlin Myers Revocable Trust, </em>\u00b6 24 (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\u00b619 On September 24,2001, the District Court adjudged B.H. and S.H. youths in need of care. Therefore, the two remaining statutory criteria to be determined at the termination of parental rights hearing in April of 2002 were whether an appropriate court-approved treatment plan had been complied with or had been unsuccessful, and whether the conduct or condition rendering the parent unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable period of time. Section 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">\u00b620 At the hearing the court heard testimony from three social workers, the appointed GAL, and S.B. herself. The court then entered its order that terminated S.B.\u2019s rights because the evidence presented satisfied the three statutory requirements for parental rights termination: (1) the youths had already been adjudicated youths in need of care; (2) S.B. did not comply with her treatment plan; and (3) the condition or conduct rendering S.B. unfit to be a parent was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Section 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA. The record does not reflect that the court relied upon the testimony of the GAL in determining either that S.B. did not complete her treatment plan or that the condition or conduct rendering her unfit was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. The testimony of the other two social workers was that S.B. did not comply with the treatment plan requirements to attend individual counseling, abstain from illegal drugs, submit to random drug-testing, attend AA/NA regularly and provide verification of this attendance, and maintain healthy relationships with S.H. and B.H.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">\u00b621 The District Court weighed all the evidence presented and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>determined that S.B. had not complied with her treatment plan and that the condition or conduct rendering her unfit to be a parent was not likely to change within a reasonable amount of time. Weighing the evidence and ascertaining witness credibility is the district court\u2019s responsibility, <em>In re </em>K.S., \u00b6 20, and we will not substitute our judgment for that of the fact-finder regarding the weight given to evidence, <em>In re D.V., </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">\u00b622  Clear and convincing evidence was provided that the statutory criteria for termination of parental rights had been met. <em>In re </em>AT., \u00b6 10. The court acted within its discretion when it gave more weight to the social workers\u2019 testimony than it gave S.B.\u2019s testimony. <em>In re </em>K.S., \u00b6 20. We have previously upheld a district court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights on the basis that a parent was unlikely to change within a reasonable time, despite the parent\u2019s testimony that she demonstrated progress in ending substance abuse and was making herself more fit to parent. <em>In re K.S., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\u00b623  S.B. has failed to provide evidence that an error of law occurred or that a finding of fact was factually unsupported. <em>In re A. T., </em>\u00b6 9; <em>In re D.V., </em>\u00b6 24. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the best interests of the children were served by terminating S.B.\u2019s parental rights. <em>In re J.W., \u00b6 7.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\u00b624 We will not reach the alleged unconstitutionality of the statute that allows a GAL to provide hearsay testimony because the record reflects that the District Court did not rely on this testimony in reaching its decision. <em>Merlin Myers Revocable Trust, </em>\u00b6 24. The District Court did not abuse its discretion. <em>In re J.W., </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">\u00b625 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b122-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
