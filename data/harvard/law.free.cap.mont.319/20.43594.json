The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">Before hearing the application, the defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also increase it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that she understood this and stated that she did not wish to proceed at this time. The defendant advised the Division that she was going to hire an attorney, outside of the public defender\u2019s office, to represent her in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">Therefore, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the application for review of sentence shall be continued, thus allowing the defendant sufficient time to retain an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-14\">Done in open Court this 4th day of April, 2003.</p>\n<judges id=\"b515-16\">Chairperson, Hon.
