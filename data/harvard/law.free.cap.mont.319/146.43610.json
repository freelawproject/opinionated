Did the District Court err in denying Brasda\u2019s motion in limine?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in admitting into evidence the knife confiscated from Brasda\u2019s person on the night of the assault?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">\u00b65 3. Did the cumulative effect of the State\u2019s errors cause sufficient prejudice to Brasda to warrant a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b174-14\">\u00b66 Following a jury trial, Brasda was convicted of assault with a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-15\">\u00b67 The assault in question occurred near closing time at a local bar, where Brasda and his wife began physically fighting each other. Jeff McCarthy (McCarthy), one of the bouncers at the bar, tried to break up the altercation, but in so doing, Brasda brandished a knife. He pointed the knife at McCarthy\u2019s torso, telling him that he would use his knife because he was not afraid of going back to prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-16\">\u00b68 McCarthy then backed away, but when Brasda and his wife continued fighting, McCarthy and another bar employee grabbed Brasda and pinned him to the ground. When Deputy Weinheimer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>arrived, Brasda stated to the deputy, \u201cFuck this Weinheimer. Man, you know, I didn\u2019t try to stab anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">\u00b69 Deputy Weinheimer then searched Brasda for weapons, and a folding knife was found in Brasda\u2019s left front pocket. At this point, Deputy Weinheimer noted that the knife was not difficult to open.</p>\n<p id=\"AFZ\">\u00b610 As he was being led away, Brasda stated to a female present at the scene that he was definitely going back to prison for this.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u00b611 Brasda brought a motion in limine to exclude (1) the statement that he had a knife and was not afraid of going back to prison (hereinafter referred to as \u201cstatement one\u201d); (2) the statement that Deputy Weinheimer knew that he (Brasda) did not try to stab anyone (hereinafter referred to as \u201cstatement two\u201d); and (3) the statement that he was definitely going back to prison (hereinafter referred to as \u201cstatement three\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u00b612 The District Court denied Brasda\u2019s motion in limine regarding statement one and statement two, and granted Brasda\u2019s motion in limine regarding statement three.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\u00b613 Brasda now appeals the District Court\u2019s denial in part of his motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">\u00b614  We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion in limine for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Vandersloot, </em>2003 MT 179, \u00b6 8, 316 Mont. 405, \u00b6 8, 73 P.3d 174, \u00b6 8. A district court abuses its discretion if the district court \u201cacts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>State v. Richardson, </em>2000 MT 72, \u00b6 24, 299 Mont. 102, \u00b6 24, 997 P.2d 786, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">\u00b615 1. Did the District Court err in denying Brasda\u2019s motion in limine?</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">\u00b616 Brasda argues that statement one and statement two were not relevant to any fact at issue in his case. Specifically, Brasda contends that both statements in no way naturally and logically tend to establish that Brasda assaulted McCarthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">\u00b617 In the alternative, Brasda argues that even if statement one and statement two are relevant, their probative value is outweighed by their prejudicial effect. In addition, Brasda contends that both statements are evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts, which are inadmissible, absent an exception, to which Brasda maintains none <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>apply. Further, Brasda maintains that under this Court\u2019s holdings in <em>State v. Matt </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 136, 814 P.2d 52, and <em>State v. Just </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 262, 602 P.2d 957, the State of Montana (the State) cannot satisfy the four requirements necessary for introducing evidence of other crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u00b618 The State counters that under the District Court\u2019s broad discretion in admitting evidence, the District Court properly found that statement one was relevant, noting that it was not hearsay and was otherwise admissible as an admission against interest. The District Court further determined that statement one was admissible under the transaction rale, and although prejudicial, the probative value of statement one was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. As regards statement two, the District Court allowed it into evidence inasmuch as statement two showed Brasda\u2019s mental state at the time of the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\u00b619 Specifically, the State contends that the District Court did not err in admitting both statements, as they tended to make more probable the fact that Brasda used a knife against McCarthy and threatened McCarthy-both facts that were relevant to the State\u2019s proof of the elements of the crime of assault with a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\u00b620  All relevant evidence is admissible. Rule 402, M.R.Evid. Relevant evidence is \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Rule 401, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\u00b621  A statement is hearsay if that statement is \u201cmade by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing,\u201d and is \u201coffered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Rule 801(c), M.R.Evid. However, a statement is not hearsay, by definition, if that statement \u201cis offered against a party and is ... the party\u2019s own statement, in either an individual or a representative capacity.\u201d Rule 801(d)(2)(A), M.R.Evid. If a statement is hearsay, it is not admissible, unless an exception applies. Rule 802, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">\u00b622  One such exception to the hearsay rule is the \u201c[t]hen-existing mental, emotional, or physical condition\u201d exception. This exception states that \u201c[a] statement of the declarant\u2019s then-existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition (such as ... mental feeling...), but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed,\u201d is admissible. Rule 803(3), M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"AjJ\">\u00b623  In addition, under the \u201ctransaction rule,\u201d which we articulated in <em>State v. Hansen, </em>1999 MT 253, 296 Mont. 282, 989 P.2d 338, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>which is codified at \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, where a \u201cdeclaration, act, or omission forms part of a transaction which is itself the fact in dispute or evidence of that fact, such declaration, act, or omission is evidence as part of the transaction.\u201d Further, statements regarding a defendant\u2019s history or imprisonment and probationary status which are inextricably linked to the circumstances surrounding the crime are also admissible. <em>See State v. Bauer, </em>2002 MT 7, 308 Mont. 99, 39 P.3d 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u00b624  Here, both of Brasda\u2019s statements were clearly relevant. Brasda stated that he had a knife and was not afraid of going back to prison. This statement tends to make more probable the fact that Brasda used a knife against McCarthy during the assault, and that McCarthy\u2019s apprehension at that point was reasonable. In addition, Brasda stated to Deputy Weinheimer that Deputy Weinheimer knew he did not try to stab anyone. This statement tends to make more probable the fact that Brasda had wielded a knife during the incident, a fact which Brasda denied at trial. Hence, both statements are integral to the State\u2019s proof of the elements of the crime of assault with a weapon, and to the jury\u2019s ability to evaluate witness testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u00b625  Further, Brasda\u2019s statements are admissible under the transaction rule set forth in <em>Hansen </em>and in \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA. Both statement one, made during the assault, and statement two, made during the arrest immediately following the assault, are declarations admissible as part of the same transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u00b626  Regardless, Brasda\u2019s statements target Brasda\u2019s then-existing mental state, and as such, are admissible under Rule 803(3) of the Montana Rules of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">\u00b627  Therefore, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying Brasda\u2019s motion in limine regarding statement one and statement two.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">\u00b628 2. Did the District Court err in admitting into evidence the knife confiscated from Brasda\u2019s person on the night of the assault?</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">\u00b629 Brasda argues that the State tampered with evidence, namely the knife that was confiscated from Brasda\u2019s person on the night of the assault. Specifically, Brasda contends that the sheriffs department made operable a knife that was inoperable when it was confiscated. As a result of this evidence tampering, Brasda contends his \u201conce valuable\u201d defense theory was rendered impossible, as he was going to demonstrate that, because \u201cthe knife could in no way have been quickly opened,\u201d he could not have brandished a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>\u00b630 The State counters that Deputy Weinheimer had opened the knife on the night of the incident and noted that it was not difficult to open. It was only after the sheriffs department performed a saline solution test for drugs that the knife became difficult to open, as some \u201ccrud\u201d had accumulated and solidified on the knife after the test. As a result, the sheriffs department \u201cworked\u201d the knife several times to return it to its condition at the time it was confiscated.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u00b631 Regardless, the State maintains that Brasda raises his evidence tampering argument for the first time on appeal, as the knife was received into evidence without objection. As such, the State argues that Brasda has waived his right to claim error now on appeal. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\u00b632 We have repeatedly held that we will only consider on appeal objections made at trial which are timely and specific. <em>Kizer v. Semitool, Inc. </em>(1991), 251 Mont. 199, 207, 824 P.2d 229, 234. Montana\u2019s Rules of Evidence state that error may not be predicated on the admission of evidence unless the objection to such admission was timely and states the grounds for the objection. Rule 103(a)(1), M.R.Evid. Objections which are not timely are not heard on appeal, as the time has passed to avoid or correct the error. Vandersloot, \u00b6 23. An objection is timely when it is made as soon as the grounds for the objection become apparent. <em>Kizer, </em>251 Mont, at 207, 824 P.2d at 234.</p>\n<p id=\"AGt\">\u00b633  Here, when the State offered the knife into evidence, Brasda objected to its admission on the basis of its condition. The District Court then received testimony explaining the knife\u2019s condition, after which the State again moved for admission of the knife. At this point, Brasda did not object; hence, the District Court admitted the knife without objection. Brasda did not argue at the District Court level that the sheriffs department had tampered with the knife, nor did the District Court rule on such an argument. Brasda did not ask the District Court to reconsider the admissibility of the knife. Brasda did not move for a mistrial or a new trial after the knife was admitted, nor did Brasda propose a cautionary or special instruction for the jury. Again, the District Court admitted the knife without objection, and Brasda waived his right to claim error now on appeal. Therefore, we hold that the District Court did not err in admitting the knife into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\u00b634 3. Did the cumulative effect of the State\u2019s errors cause sufficient prejudice to Brasda to warrant a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">\u00b635 Brasda argues that a number of prejudicial errors occurred during the trial of his case. As such, in the event that this Court does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>recognize the errors independently, Brasda contends that under the doctrine of cumulative error, he is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b636 The State maintains that this Court need not reach the issue of cumulative error, as the District Court did not abuse its discretion in ruling on the evidentiary issues posed. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u00b637  Because we hold that the District Court did not err in denying Brasda\u2019s motion in limine regarding statement one and statement two, nor did the District Court err in admitting the knife into evidence, we do not address Brasda\u2019s cumulative error argument here.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\u00b638 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b179-7\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER, REGNIER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
