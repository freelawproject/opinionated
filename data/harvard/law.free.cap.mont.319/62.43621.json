Lockhead appeals from the order entered by the Second Judicial District Court, Silver Bow County, which granted Debra Weinstein\u2019s motion to compel settlement. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">\u00b62 Lockhead sued Weinstein in federal court for defamation, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, malicious prosecution, actual malice, false imprisonment and a violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; the federal court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. Lockhead then sued Weinstein in state court, dropping the false imprisonment and \u00a7 1983 claims. We reversed the trial court\u2019s decision on venue in <em>Lockhead v. Weinstein, </em>2001 MT 132, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 305 Mont. 438, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 28 P.3d 1081, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. After a substitution of judge, the District Court scheduled trial for October 21, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">\u00b63 On September 23,2002, the parties\u2019 attorneys agreed to settle the case during a telephone conversation, specifying a dollar amount and the preparation of a general release. Weinstein\u2019s counsel prepared and faxed a proposed release to one of Lockhead\u2019s attorneys on September 25, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">\u00b64 Lockhead\u2019s attorney replied in a letter dated September 27,2002, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-10\">We received the proposed General Release and agree with the terms you have proposed. Brian Lockhead accepts the settlement offer for the sum of $7,500. Please forward a copy of the original General Release to [Lockhead\u2019s other attorney\u2019s] office with the Stipulation for Dismissal and we will return these to you early next week in exchange for the settlement proceeds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-11\">The Court contacted my office and notified us that the final pretrial conference has been vacated because the first trial set with this trial is expected to proceed. We have been bumped to a later date. It appears that we have resolved this matter and will not require another setting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">Thank you for your assistance with resolving this disputed claim. On the same day, Weinstein\u2019s counsel wrote to Lockhead\u2019s attorney that he had prepared and signed a stipulation to dismiss the action and had ordered a settlement check. Approximately two weeks later, Lockhead\u2019s attorney advised Weinstein\u2019s counsel by telephone that Lockhead refused to settle.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">\u00b65 Weinstein moved to compel settlement, submitting her counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>affidavit, the September 27 letters, the unsigned general release, a copy of the settlement check, and the stipulation to dismiss signed by her counsel in support. Lockhead responded. The District Court granted Weinstein\u2019s motion on the basis that Lockhead agreed to the terms of the settlement and \u00a7 37-61-401(1), MCA, does not apply. Lockhead appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"A98\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u00b66 Did the District Court err in granting Weinstein\u2019s motion to compel settlement?</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u00b67 The existence of a valid express contract is a question of law. <em>Larson v. Green Tree Financial Corp., </em>1999 MT 157, \u00b6 17, 295 Mont. 110, \u00b6 17, 983 P.2d 357, \u00b6 17 (citation omitted). We review a district court\u2019s conclusion of law, including one of statutory interpretation, for correctness. <em>Nelson v. Farmers Union Mut. Ins. </em>Co., 2003 MT 101, \u00b6 26, 315 Mont. 268, \u00b6 26, 68 P.3d 689, \u00b6 26 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\u00b68 Lockhead first argues his attorney\u2019s September 27 letter did not bind him to a settlement agreement because the agreement was not \u201cfinal.\u201d He concedes his attorney was \u201cspeaking on [Lockhead\u2019s] behalf\u2019 and did not \u201ccommitG a wrongful act\u201d in stating \u201cBrian Lockhead accepts the settlement offer for the sum of $7,500.\u201d However, Lockhead argues this statement was only an \u201cattemptG to reach a settlement proposal that his attorney would then communicate to Lockhead for purposes of final agreement.\u201d In doing so, he attempts to distinguish cases in which we determined settlement agreements were enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">\u00b69 Weinstein relies primarily on <em>Hetherington v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 395, 849 P.2d 1039. There, we determined the only essential elements of an enforceable agreement are an unconditional offer and unconditional acceptance. <em>Hetherington, </em>257 Mont. at 399, 849 P.2d at 1042. Weinstein contends the <em>Hetherington </em>elements are satisfied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">\u00b610 <em>Hetherington </em>is our leading case on the enforceability of settlement agreements. There, the Hetheringtons had met with their counsel, agreed to the settlement terms, and authorized their counsel to accept; thereafter, their counsel sent a letter to Ford\u2019s representatives indicating his clients\u2019 acceptance. <em>Hetherington, </em>257 Mont, at 397, 849 P.2d at 1041. Ford then moved for summary judgment on the basis of the settlement, but the Hetheringtons responded with an affidavit that they understood they would retain their right to bring a claim until they reviewed and signed a written agreement. <em>Hetherington, </em>257 Mont, at 398-99, 849 P.2d at 1041-42. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>The district court denied Ford\u2019s motion, determining that, absent a written and signed agreement, the parties\u2019 intent to be bound was a question of fact. <em>Hetherington, </em>257 Mont, at 398, 849 P.2d at 1041. \u00b611 On appeal, we observed the Hetheringtons did not disclose any intent not to be bound to their attorney or to the other parties. We applied Restatement (Second) of Contracts, \u00a7 21, which provides that \u201c[n] either real nor apparent intention that a promise he legally binding is essential to the formation of a contract, but a manifestation of intention that a promise shall not affect legal relations may prevent the formation of a contract <em>.\u2019\u2019Hetherington, </em>257 Mont, at 399, 849 P.2d at 1042. We ultimately concluded \u201c[a] party\u2019s latent intention not to be bound does not prevent the formation of a binding contract.\u201d On that basis, we reversed the district comb\u2019s determination that a question of fact existed regarding the parties\u2019 intent. <em>Hetherington, </em>257 Mont, at 399, 849 P.2d at 1042.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u00b612 Under <em>Hetherington, </em>a party to a settlement agreement is bound if he or she has manifested assent to the agreement\u2019s terms and has not manifested an intent not to be bound by that assent. <em>See Hetherington, </em>257 Mont, at 399, 849 P.2d at 1042. Lockhead attempts to distinguish <em>Hetherington </em>on the grounds that \u201cthere is no evidence\u201d that Lockhead met with his attorney, authorized him to accept, or \u201cwanted to agree.\u201d <em>Cf. Hetherington, </em>257 Mont, at 397, 849 P.2d at 1041. However, Lockhead authorized his attorney to write \u201cBrian Lockhead accepts,\u201d a statement which clearly manifested his acceptance. <em>See </em>\u00a7 28-2-501(1), MCA. Further, the unrefuted affidavit of Weinstein\u2019s counsel states \u201cthe parties had reached an agreement\u201d subject to Lockhead\u2019s review of the general release by September 23, and the September 27 letter indicates Lockhead reviewed and approved the release. Therefore, there is evidence of Lockhead\u2019s agreement and his attorney\u2019s authority to communicate acceptance. \u00b613 Lockhead argues, however, that the September 27 letter was an \u201cagreement to agree.\u201d This is precisely the \u201clatent intention\u201d argument we rejected in <em>Hetherington. See Hetherington, </em>257 Mont, at 399, 849 P.2d at 1042. Therefore, applying <em>Hetherington </em>to these facts, we conclude the unconditional September 27 agreement in this case is enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\u00b614 Lockhead also relies on <em>Bar OK Ranch, Co. v. Ehlert, </em>2002 MT12, 308 Mont. 140, 40 P.3d 378. There, we affirmed a district court\u2019s determination that a memorandum of understanding was an enforceable settlement agreement when three people and their attorneys attended a settlement conference and \u201call three persons, not their counsel\u201d signed the memorandum. <em>Bar OK Ranch, Co., </em>\u00b6 37. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Lockhead contends that, unlike <em>Bar OK Ranch, Co., </em>\u201cthere is no evidence\u201d in the present case that he participated in negotiations. Consequently, he argues \u201cit seems reasonable to conclude\u201d that the document in <em>Bar OK Ranch, Co. </em>would not have been enforceable if it had been signed by the parties\u2019 attorneys and not the parties themselves. We did not conclude or hold in <em>Bar OK Ranch, Co., </em>however, that parties must attend a settlement conference or sign a document to render an agreement enforceable. Rather, the parties\u2019 attendance and signatures, along with their later testimony, were evidence of their agreement to settle. <em>Bar OK Ranch, </em>Co., \u00b6 38. Here, the affidavit of Weinstein\u2019s counsel, Lockhead\u2019s attorney\u2019s September 27 letter, and Lockhead\u2019s concession that his attorney spoke on his behalf in stating unequivocally that \u201cBrian Lockhead accepts\u201d are evidence of Lockhead\u2019s agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">\u00b615 Lockhead also relies on <em>Marta Corp. v. Thoft </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 109, 894 P.2d 333. There, we affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for relief from a stipulation signed and mailed by an attorney without his clients\u2019 approval, noting the clients\u2019 participation in a settlement discussion both in our analysis of the clients\u2019 agreement to the settlement\u2019s general terms and in our rejection of the argument that the attorney was unauthorized to settle. <em>Marta Corp., </em>271 Mont, at 113, 894 P.2d at 335. Lockhead argues that, unlike in <em>Marta </em>Corp., \u201cthere is no evidence\u201d in the present case that he attended or participated in settlement negotiations. However, as in Bar <em>OK Ranch, Co., </em>we did not conclude that a settlement agreement is only enforceable if the parties attend and participate in a settlement discussion, but merely referred to the parties\u2019 attendance and participation as evidence of their agreement. Furthermore, our discussion of an attorney\u2019s authority in <em>Marta Corp. </em>does not apply here, because Lockhead has not asserted his attorney lacked settlement authority. Lockhead\u2019s reliance on <em>Marta Corp. </em>and <em>Bar OK Ranch, Co. </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u00b616 Lockhead also relies on \u00a7 37-61-401(1), MCA, and <em>In re Estate of Goick </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 13, 909 P.2d 1165, for the proposition that he is not bound because the settlement agreement was not filed with the clerk of court or entered upon the court\u2019s minutes. We disagree and partially overrule <em>Estate of Goick.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\u00b617 The Montana Legislature \u201cborrowed\u201d the original version of what is now \u00a7 37-61-401(1), MCA, from California in 1895, soon after statehood. <em>State v. Turlok </em>(1926), 76 Mont. 549, 562, 248 P. 169, 174. It reads the same now as it did then, except for a few omitted commas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>and a repositioning of the word \u201cto\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-4\">(1) An attorney and counselor has authority to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">(a) bind his client in any steps of an action or proceeding by his agreement filed with the clerk or entered upon the minutes of the court and not otherwise;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">(b) receive money claimed by his client in an action or proceeding during the pendency thereof or after judgment unless a revocation of his authority is filed and, upon the payment thereof and not otherwise, to discharge the claim or acknowledge satisfaction of the judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Section 37-61-401(1), MCA. This Court also adopted California\u2019s interpretation that the statute neither abridges nor expands an attorney\u2019s common law authority to represent a client, but merely \u201cprescribed] its exercise.\u201d <em>Turlok, </em>76 Mont, at 562, 248 P. at 174 (citations omitted). Further, we have recognized that a \u201c \u2018literal construction [of the statute] would ... lead to absurd consequences.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Nelson </em>(1991), 251 Mont. 139, 141, 822 P.2d 1086, 1087 (quoting <em>Turlok, </em>76 Mont, at 563, 248 P. at 175).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">\u00b618 Lockhead argues the District Court improperly relied on our statement of the statute\u2019s purpose in <em>Nelson, </em>which is \u201cto relieve the presiding judge of determining controversies between attorneys as to their unexecuted agreements.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>251 Mont, at 141, 822 P.2d at 1087 (citing <em>Bush v. Baker </em>(1913), 46 Mont. 535, 546, 129 P. 550, 553). Lockhead distinguishes <em>Nelson </em>on grounds it concerned an attorney\u2019s oral stipulation in a court\u2019s chambers, and the agreement in the present case did not involve the District Court. <em>See Nelson, </em>251 Mont. at 140, 822 P.2d at 1087. However, we adopted the statement of the statute\u2019s purpose in <em>Nelson </em>from <em>Bush, </em>a case which concerned an agreement between attorneys. Therefore, the District Court did not err in relying on <em>Nelson\u2019s </em>statement of the statute\u2019s purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">\u00b619 Alternatively, Lockhead contends Weinstein frustrated the purpose of the statute by moving the court to compel settlement without providing evidence that Lockhead authorized his attorney to settle, as was the situation in <em>Hetherington. Hetherington, </em>257 Mont, at 397, 849 P.2d at 1041. <em>Hetherington, </em>however, did not address \u00a7 37-61-401(1), MCA. Moreover, the statute was not intended to prevent a district court from enforcing \u201cstipulations admitted by the party or his attorney against whom they are alleged.\u201d <em>Bush, </em>46 Mont, at 546, 129 P. at 553-54 (citation omitted). Because Lockhead\u2019s attorney admits sending the September 27 letter and Lockhead does not contest his attorney\u2019s authority to do so, Weinstein did not frustrate the statute\u2019s purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"AA2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>\u00b620 Lockhead relies heavily on the interpretation of \u00a7 37-61-401(1), MCA, in <em>Estate of Goick. </em>There, the decedent\u2019s mother and siblings moved to compel settlement based on a telephonic oral agreement of the parties\u2019 attorneys. <em>Estate of Goick, </em>275 Mont. at 17, 909 P.2d at 1167. The decedent\u2019s spouse contended the agreement was tentative and subject to the parties\u2019 approval. <em>Estate of Goick, </em>275 Mont. at 17, 909 P.2d at 1167. The district court found counsel agreed to the settlement with the parties\u2019 consent, but concluded the agreement was insufficient to bind the parties. <em>Estate of Goick, </em>275 Mont, at 23, 909 P.2d at 1171.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u00b621 On appeal, this Court relied on both \u00a7 72-3-915(1), MCA, and \u00a7 37-61-401(1), MCA, in affirming the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to compel settlement. <em>Estate of Goick, </em>275 Mont. at 23, 909 P.2d at 1171. Section 72-3-915(1), MCA, is not at issue in the present case. With regard to \u00a7 37-61-401(1), MCA, we merely quoted the statute as providing that an attorney has authority to bind a client when the agreement had been \u201cfiled with the clerk or entered upon the minutes of the court and not otherwise,\u201d and observed that the settlement agreement at issue was not filed or entered in the minutes. <em>Estate of Goick, </em>275 Mont. at 23, 909 P.2d at 1171. Based in part on those facts, we concluded the oral agreement was not binding. We did not address <em>Turlok, Nelson, </em>or <em>Hetherington.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\u00b622  The Court\u2019s literal application of \u00a7 37-61-401(1), MCA, in <em>Estate of Goick </em>was inconsistent with prior case law interpreting the statute. <em>See, e.g., Nelson, </em>251 Mont. at 141, 822 P.2d at 1087; <em>Turlok, </em>76 Mont, at 563,248 P. at <em>175; Bush, </em>46 Mont. at 546, 129 P. at 553-54. Moreover, a literal interpretation of \u00a7 37-61-401(1)(a), MCA, would preclude an attorney from binding his or her client to a settlement agreement, while \u00a7 37-61-401(1)(b), MCA, would allow an attorney to discharge a claim or acknowledge satisfaction of judgment once he or she has received money. Under this literal interpretation, an attorney\u2019s authority to bind a client to a settlement would depend entirely on whether the attorney received funds. This not only does not make sense, it is an absurd result. Therefore, we overrule that portion of <em>Estate of Goick </em>stating a client is not bound to a settlement agreement unless the agreement is filed or entered upon the court\u2019s minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">\u00b623  We hold the District Court did not err in enforcing the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\u00b624 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b94-8\">JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON, RICE, LEAPHART, REGNIER and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
