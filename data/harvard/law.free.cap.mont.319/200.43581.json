Wenz (Wenz). The Commission concluded that Wenz violated Rule 1.10 of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct (M.R.P.C.), when he and his firm undertook dual representation of two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>clients who were directly adverse and Wenz failed to make appropriate inquiries about the clients\u2019 consent to the dual representation. The Commission unanimously recommended that Wenz be publicly censured for his violation of Rule 1.10 and that he be required to pay his pro rata share (one-fifth) of the costs incurred by the Commission associated with the prosecution of this matter and Cause Nos. 02-143, 02-144, 02-145 and 02-147.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\u00b62 The conflict arose when Wenz\u2019s firm agreed to represent Colleen Schuff (Schuff) in a wrongful death action after her husband was fatally injured in an explosion at a gas station in Great Falls. A few months after the firm began representing Schuff, they determined that one of the firm\u2019s other clients, A.T. Klemens and Son (Klemens) was a potentially responsible party. The firm filed a complaint against Klemens on behalf of Schuff while continuing to represent Klemens on other matters. <em>See Schuff v. A.T. Klemens &amp; Son, </em>2000 MT 357, 303 Mont. 274, 16 P.3d 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u00b63 On April 25, 2003, we entered an Order in this cause granting Wenz the opportunity to file objections to the Commission\u2019s Common Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in the aforementioned causes and to the individual Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Recommendation in this cause. Wenz filed said objections and a brief in support of his objections on June 9, 2003, wherein he raised the following legal arguments: 1) Rule 1.10 places an unreasonable and impractical burden upon partners and associates; 2) there is no evidence that Wenz knowingly, intentionally, or recklessly violated Rule 1.10; 3) the Commission violated its own rules when it refused to produce its entire file in this matter; 4) the Commission denied Wenz his right to substantive and procedural due process; 5) inordinate delay and laches mandate dismissal of these proceedings; and 6) several mitigating factors set forth in the 1991 ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions are present in this case and mandate reducing any sanctions to be imposed or withholding sanctions entirely.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u00b64 The Commission filed its response on August 6, 2003, wherein it argued that its findings, conclusions and recommendations are supported by the evidence and reflect an accurate interpretation of Rule 1.10; that Wenz violated Rule 1.10 when he and his firm simultaneously represented Klemens and Schuff, without consent, when these clients were directly adverse and Wenz failed to make appropriate inquiries about consent; that Wenz and his firm improperly terminated Klemens as a client; that Wenz\u2019s frame of mind is irrelevant to a determination of whether he violated Rule 1.10; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>the Commission observed and obeyed Wenz\u2019s due process rights; that the delay in referring this matter to the Commission is not grounds for relieving Wenz from his ethical violations; and that the Commission\u2019s recommendations for discipline are entirely appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\u00b65 As the Commission noted in its Common Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, because the Commission is involved in determinations that relate to Wenz\u2019s professional privileges, violations of the M.R.P.C. must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. Rule 15(C), Montana Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (M.R.L.D.E.) (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u00b66 In the companion case <em>of In the Matter of Johnson, </em>2004 MT 6,319 Mont. 188, 84 P.3d 637 (Cause No. 02-144), we held that Charles R. Johnson (Johnson) violated Rule 1.7, M.R.P.C., when he simultaneously represented Klemens and Schuff, without consent, when these clients were directly adverse and that Johnson improperly terminated Klemens as a client. Rule 1.7, M.R.P.C., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">(a) A lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client will be directly adverse to another client, unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">(1) the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not adversely affect the relationship with the other client; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">(2) each client consents after consultation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">(b) A lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyer\u2019s responsibility to another client or to a third person, or by the lawyer\u2019s own interests, unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-10\">(1) the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-11\">(2) the client consents after consultation. When representation of multiple clients in a single matter is undertaken, the consultation shall include explanation of the implications of the common representation and the advantages and risks involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">\u00b67 Rule 1.7 requires lawyers to foster and protect client loyalty. <em>Grievance Committee of Bar v. Rottner </em>(Conn. 1964), 203 A.2d 82, 84-85. \u201cLoyalty is an essential element in the lawyer\u2019s relationship to a client.\u201d Rule 1.7, Comment 1, Model Rules of Professional Conduct (2001). \u201cThe duty of loyalty is \u2018perhaps the most basic of counsel\u2019s duties.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Jones </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 121, 125, 923 P.2d 560, 563 <em>(quoting Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 692, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2067, 80 L.Ed.2d 674). One commentator expressed this duty thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-13\">The reasons for the basic rigor of Rule 1.7(a) are readily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>discernable. It is intuitively obvious that parties with conflicting interests who are concurrently represented by the same lawyer face significant risks that the lawyer will act disloyally to one client or the other, or that confidential information concerning one client will be \u201cleaked\u201d to the other ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\">When Rule 1.7(a) applies, it commands that a lawyer \u201cnot represent\u201d the clients in question. This means that a lawyer must not accept a second client if the directly adverse conflict is known in advance, and must withdraw if the conflict is discovered after the concurrent representation has been undertaken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr. &amp; W. William Hodes, <em>The Law of Lawyering </em>\u00a7 11.3 (3rd ed. 2003) (hereafter <em>\u201cHazard\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u00b68 In Wenz\u2019s case, the Commission determined that there was clear and convincing evidence that Wenz violated Rule 1.10, M.R.P.C., when Wenz failed to make appropriate inquiries about the consent obtained by Johnson from Gene Cantley, president of Klemens. Rule 1.10 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">(a) While lawyers are associated in a firm, none of them shall knowingly represent a client when anyone of them practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so by Rules 1.7, 1.8(c), 1.9 or 2.2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">(d) A disqualification prescribed by this Rule may be waived by the affected client under the conditions stated in Rule 1.7.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Rule 1.10(a) applies the duty of loyalty found in Rule 1.7 to all lawyers practicing within a law firm. Hence, each such lawyer is vicariously bound by the obligation of loyalty owed by all lawyers with whom that lawyer is associated. <em>See </em>Rule 1.10, Comment 6, Model Rules of Professional Conduct (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">\u00b69 Wenz argues in his brief on appeal that Rule 1.10 places an impractical and unreasonable burden on partners and associates. It is true that the requirements of Rule 1.10 are exacting, but there are good reasons for this stringent rule.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-11\">Lawyers in a firm, or in a close association like a firm, in fact normally function more or less as a single unit. They consult each other, have access to each other\u2019s files, overhear conversations with clients, and have a mutual financial interest in their clients\u2019 cases....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-12\">These rationales all trace back to the principal target of imputed disqualification-the risk that client confidences will be leaked to an opposing party or used against the original client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Rule 1.10(a) imposes imputed disqualification automatically, however, without requiring any showing of either actual leakage or even actual access to confidential information; these are conclusively presumed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><em>Hazard, </em>\u00a7 14.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\u00b610 Moreover, the imputed disqualification imposed by Rule 1.10(a) is absolute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">The first step is to decide whether a particular lawyer, considered alone, would be barred from taking on or continuing a matter.... If the individual lawyer is barred, the second step is <em>automatically </em>to extend or impute the same bar to all lawyers who are associated with that lawyer in the same \u201cfirm....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-7\"><em>Hazard, </em>\u00a7 14.4 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">\u00b611  Wenz maintains that he reasonably relied on Johnson\u2019s report of his conversation with Cantley, thus he lacked actual knowledge that Cantley did not consent to the concurrent representation and that it would be unreasonable to infer such knowledge from these circumstances. However, Wenz violated Rule 1.10, not because he knew about Johnson\u2019s violation of Rule 1.7, but because he knowingly represented Klemens and because he failed to make the appropriate inquiries regarding Klemens\u2019s consent to the simultaneous representation of Schuff. Furthermore, having been informed of the substance of the conversation between Cantley and Johnson regarding the conflict, Wenz was not reasonable in his belief that the firm\u2019s simultaneous representation of Klemens and Schuff would not adversely affect the relationship with Klemens. We determined in <em>Johnson </em>that it was untenable for an attorney to contend that no conflict of interest existed where the attorney asserted on behalf of one client via pleadings filed in court that another client negligently caused the death of the first client\u2019s spouse. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">\u00b612 Nor was it reasonable for Wenz to believe that Johnson had obtained Cantley\u2019s informed consent for the firm\u2019s continued representation of Schuff. Wenz\u2019s expert witness Professor Robert Aronson described the concept of informed consent this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-10\">[Attorneys who undertake to represent parties with divergent interests owe the highest duty to each to make full disclosure of all facts and circumstances necessary to enable the parties to make an informed decision. This \u201cfull disclosure\u201d should include areas of potential conflict, the desirability of seeking independent legal advice, the fact that information from either of the parties will not be confidential with respect to the other party, and the course of action the attorney will take if an actual conflict arises. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>\u201cConsultation\u201d or \u201cfull disclosure\u201d implies communicating \u201call of the facts and implications\u201d of an attorney\u2019s representation of multiple clients and any circumstances which might cause a client to question the undivided loyalty of the lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Robert H. Aronson &amp; Donald T. Weckstein, <em>Professional Responsibility in a Nutshell </em>226 (2d ed. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\u00b613 Because Wenz is a seasoned attorney with many years of experience, he should have recognized that Rule 1.7's (and by imputation, Rule 1.10's) requirement of consent \u201cafter consultation\u201d required, at a minimum, that Johnson should have explained Rule 1.7 to Cantley; discussed the ramifications of the firm\u2019s representation of Schuff; and informed Cantley that he had the right to withhold consent. However, Johnson did none of these things, thus it should have been clear to Wenz that Johnson did not sufficiently inform Cantley of the firm\u2019s obligations under Rule 1.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\u00b614 Wenz maintains that Cantley is a shrewd and capable businessman who is experienced with legal matters and that Cantley did consent by continuing to send Klemens\u2019s legal business to the firm. However, as the Commission points out in its brief on appeal, Klemens\u2019s efforts to remain connected to the firm do not demonstrate consent to the firm\u2019s representation of Schuff, rather it illustrates the very thing that Rule 1.7 exists to protect \u2014 a client\u2019s trust in his or her own lawyer. Moreover, Cantley\u2019s knowledge of the legal system is irrelevant to Johnson\u2019s violation of Rule 1.7 and, hence, Wenz\u2019s violation of Rule 1.10. The obligations of a lawyer as set forth in the M.R.P.C. must be followed regardless of a client\u2019s level of legal sophistication. Furthermore, the evidence confirms that the amended complaint was not served upon Klemens for ten months after Johnson\u2019s conversation with Cantley about the firm\u2019s representation of Schuff, thus it is not surprising that Klemens continued using the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">\u00b615  In his defense, Wenz contends that he reasonably relied upon the District Court\u2019s ruling denying Klemens\u2019s motion to disqualify the firm in believing that he had complied with the M.R.P.C. However, we have ruled that a district court is not the place for deciding alleged violations of the M.R.P.C. <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 33-37; Art. VII, \u00a7 2(3) of the Montana Constitution. The Commission correctly determined that the issue of whether Wenz violated Rule 1.10 was never within the scope of the District Court\u2019s inquiry and that court\u2019s decision not to disqualify the firm did not relieve Wenz from his ethical violations.</p>\n<p id=\"AdY\">\u00b616  Wenz maintains that he did not intentionally or recklessly violate Rule 1.10 because he reasonably relied on Johnson\u2019s report of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>bis conversation with Cantley and that he lacked actual knowledge that Cantley did not consent to the concurrent representation. Nothing in the M.R.P.C. implies that a lawyer has to knowingly violate the M.R.P.C. in order to be subject to discipline. Wenz knowingly represented Klemens when his firm was prohibited from doing so by Rule 1.7. An attorney cannot be relieved from liability for ethical violations just because the attorney did not mean to commit them. As the Commission points out in its brief on appeal, the public\u2019s confidence in the integrity of the Bar lies in the enforceability of the rules designed to protect the public from unprofessional behavior. If lawyers could avoid discipline for ethical lapses simply by claiming they did not intend to violate the M.R.P.C., then the M.R.P.C. would be impossible to enforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">\u00b617 Wenz also contends that his right to due process was violated by various actions of the Commission including: considering a letter submitted by counsel appointed by Klemens\u2019s insurer that castigated members of Wenz\u2019s firm; allowing Special Counsel to amend his report to recommend formal complaints against Wenz and the others; allowing Commissioner Mary Jo Ridgeway to participate in the hearings when her husband is District Judge Gary Day who wrote a dissenting opinion in the <em>Schuff </em>decision that was harshly critical of the members of Wenz\u2019s firm; and depriving Wenz and the others of the benefit of the entire Commission file on these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u00b618 The Commission\u2019s work on this matter is entitled to a presumption of honesty and fairness. <em>See Goldstein v. Commission on Practice, </em>2000 MT 8, \u00b6 27, 297 Mont. 493, \u00b6 27, 995 P.2d 923, \u00b6 27, <em>cert. denied sub nom Albers v. Supreme Court, </em>531 U.S. 918, 121 S.Ct. 276, 148 L.Ed.2d 201 (2000). To overcome that presumption, Wenz must show specific facts and circumstances that make the risk of unfairness to him intolerably high or that show he has been denied his due process rights. <em>Goldstein, </em>\u00b6 27. Wenz\u2019s allegations, however, are insufficient to meet his burden. First, counsel\u2019s letter castigating the members of Wenz\u2019s firm was not offered as evidence during the disciplinary proceedings and the Commission did not use counsel\u2019s letter as the basis for any of its findings or conclusions. Second, Special Counsel\u2019s recommendations regarding discipline were amended at the request of Special Counsel, not the Commission. Third, Commissioner Ridgeway recused herself from participating in this action and she was not present at the hearing. Fourth, Rule 13, M.R.L.D.E. (2001), requires that all Commission deliberations remain confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\u00b619 Wenz also argues that the proceedings against him should be dismissed because the Commission violated its own procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>requirements in Rule 8A, M.R.L.D.E. He maintains that while the Commission directed letters to other attorneys in the firm notifying them that this Court had directed the Commission to conduct an inquiry into their ethical conduct in the Schuff case, Wenz received no such letter. Wenz maintains that although he spoke with Special Counsel once, he was not informed that he was the subject of any disciplinary investigation. Wenz contends that his first notice that he was the subject of a disciplinary inquiry was when he was presented with the formal complaint against him on October 22, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\u00b620  Rule 8A specifies that unless the Commission directs otherwise, \u201cthe lawyer involved... shall be notified that the matter has been referred for investigation.\u201d This Court stated in <em>Schuff:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">Pursuant to this Court\u2019s singular jurisdiction under Article VII, Section 2(3), of the Montana Constitution over matters pertaining to lawyer discipline and claimed violations of the [M.R.P.C.], we conclude that the conduct of <em>Schuffs counsel </em>and of <em>Klemens\u2019 trial and appellate counsel </em>as regards those claimed violations, must be referred to the Commission on Practice. If the Commission\u2019s farther investigation reveals violations of the [M.R.P.C.] as regards counsels\u2019 conduct in this case, then the Commission may pursue appropriate prosecutions and recommendations for discipline as the facts and law may, in the Commission\u2019s discretion, warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-6\"><em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 57 (emphasis added). Clearly, Wenz and the other members of his firm were on notice as early as December 27, 2000, when the <em>Schuff </em>decision was handed down, that an investigation by the Commission was underway. Because Wenz represented Klemens on various matters in 1992 and 1993, it was unreasonable for Wenz to assume that he would not be one of the subjects of the Commission\u2019s investigation. Moreover, Wenz was interviewed by Special Counsel regarding his representation of Klemens.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\u00b621 Wenz further contends that inordinate delay and laches mandate dismissal of these proceedings because more than ten years have passed since this conflict arose. The defense of laches cannot apply without a showing of lack of diligence by the party against whom the defense is asserted and prejudice to the party asserting the defense. <em>Coalition for Canyon Preservation v. Bowers </em>(9th Cir. 1980), 632 F.2d 774,779 (citation omitted). Here, the Commission and Special Counsel have at all times acted diligently in investigating and prosecuting this matter. We referred this matter to the Commission on December 27, 2000. Special Counsel commenced an investigation in January 2001. The Commission voted to file formal charges against Wenz and several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>other members of his firm in June 2001. Wenz and the others received copies of the complaints in October 2001. The complaints were filed in March 2002 and an evidentiary hearing was conducted in November 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">\u00b622 Furthermore, Wenz suffered no prejudice by the delay in this matter. His testimony at the November 2002 hearing reflects clear memories about the facts that form the basis for the allegations against him. Moreover, most of the evidence of Wenz\u2019s ethical violations comes from the firm\u2019s records including correspondence and billing records. In addition, the transcript of the 1993 disqualification hearing recounts the facts surrounding the firm\u2019s conflict between Klemens and Schuff. Therefore, the defense of laches is inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\u00b623 As his final argument, Wenz maintains that several mitigating factors set forth in the 1991 ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions are present in this case and that those factors mandate reducing any sanctions to be imposed or withholding sanctions entirely. These mitigating factors include the absence of any selfish or dishonest motive on Wenz\u2019s part; the fact that both clients actively sought representation by the firm; the fact that while Wenz represented Klemens throughout the relevant period, he was not directly involved in prosecution of the Schuff matter; Wenz\u2019s reputation for good character and high competence as an attorney; the fact that Wenz practiced law in Montana for more than thirty-five years without any prior disciplinary record before the Commission; and the delay in bringing and processing disciplinary proceedings in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\u00b624  Both the Commission and this Court have taken these mitigating factors into consideration. Nevertheless, we agree with the Commission\u2019s recommendation and hold that public censure is appropriate in this case for the following reasons: 1) it will inform Wenz of the gravity of his transgressions; 2) it will deter similar unethical conduct by other Montana attorneys; 3) it will serve notice to all Montana lawyers that the M.R.P.C. are to be taken seriously and consulted in order to avoid situations that would erode public confidence in the Bar. Therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\u00b625 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Commission\u2019s Common Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law insofar as they pertain to Wenz and the Commission\u2019s individual Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Recommendation as to Wenz, are adopted in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">\u00b626 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Wenz appear before this Court in Helena, Montana, on the 24th day of February, 2004, at 10:00 a.m., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>for the administration of a public censure.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\u00b627 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Wenz shall pay his pro rata share (one-fifth) of the costs incurred by the Commission associated with the prosecution of this matter and the other cases referred to above, in accordance with the attached statement of the Secretary of the Commission on Practice.

The following factors shall be considered in determining discipline to be recommended or imposed:</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">(1) The duty violated;</p>\n<p id=\"b237-14\">(2) The lawyer\u2019s mental state;</p>\n<p id=\"b237-15\">(3) The actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer\u2019s misconduct; and</p>\n<p id=\"b237-16\">(4) The existence of aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-17\">\u00b632 In my view, upon a consideration of the entire record of this case, and after consideration of the applicable criteria set forth in Rule 9B, the more appropriate censure is a private admonition before the Commission, and payment of the cost of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-18\">\u00b633 The duty violated by Wenz was the failure to make sure that his partners were acting appropriately. Such duty is clearly imposed, and for good reason. A partner in a law firm, a principal in a professional corporation, or an associate, cannot avoid discipline by ignoring what his partners are doing. Had he asserted himself, Wenz may have been able to convince his partners to act correctly. However, it must be acknowledged that his dereliction was one of omission. He did not intend to violate the rules, or to cause harm. His mental state was one of complacency, not of intent to engage in prohibited conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-19\">\u00b634 The majority of the Court is correct in stating that an attorney cannot be relieved from liability, or avoid discipline, simply by claiming he did not intend to violate the rules of conduct. However, the disciplinary rules specifically provide that the mental state of the offender is to be taken into account in imposing sanctions. Wenz\u2019s omission was with no scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-20\">\u00b635 The District Court, the Commission on Practice, and this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>have all found that there was no harm caused to either client by Wenz\u2019s omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b636 Wenz was admitted to the bar in 1968. There is no record of any previous violations of the M.R.P.C., this violation occurred in 1992, and there have been no violations since. No harm was done to any client, or to anyone else. Most importantly, there is no indication whatever that further transgressions are likely and, in fact, all indications are to the contrary. There is no need to protect the citizenry from Wenz and by all accounts he still has much good to offer the bar and the citizens of Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b637 Reported cases over the last 33 years do not reveal an instance where a public censure was admini stered to a lawyer who practiced for 36 years, who was guilty of a single infraction of the rules which resulted in no harm. <em>In re Graveley </em>(1990), 246 Mont. 58, 805 P.2d 1263; <em>In re Wyse </em>(1984), 212 Mont. 339, 688 P.2d 758; <em>In re Johnson </em>(1979), 182 Mont. 486,597 P.2d 740; <em>In re Porter </em>(1970), 156 Mont. 190, 478 P.2d 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b638 Wenz\u2019s failure cannot be condoned. Nor can this matter just go away. However, a fair consideration of the circumstances mandates imposition of the lesser sanction of a private admonition and payment of the costs of this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">I join in the foregoing concurrence and dissent of Justice Warner.</p>\n<judges id=\"b238-8\">/s/ Blair Jones, District Judge sitting for Justice W.
