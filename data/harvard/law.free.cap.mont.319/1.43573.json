He filed a Motion to Dismiss arguing \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA (2001), is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The District Court denied the motion. Leeson appeals. We affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-13\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b28-14\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in finding that \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA (2001), is not unconstitutionally vague on its face?</p>\n<p id=\"b28-15\">\u00b64 2. Is \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA (2001), unconstitutionally overbroad?</p>\n<p id=\"b29-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">\u00b65 Nathaniel Leeson was charged by Information for violating \u00a745-9-132, MCA (2001), which is entitled \u201cOperation of unlawful clandestine laboratory-penalties.\u201d The affidavit filed in support of the Information alleges that a van occupied by Leeson contained numerous items that could be used to operate an unlawful clandestine laboratory, including 27 pseudoephedrine boxes, two cans of acetone, Rooto drain cleaner, iodized salt, two plastic coolers smelling of ammonia, a plastic baggie of white powder, plastic tubing attached to a plastic bottle top and two funnels, a scale with white powder on it, rubber gloves, two syringes, and a fire extinguisher, among other items. The affidavit also states that detectives received information that Leeson had been purchasing large amounts of pseudoephedrine pills and references previous encounters law enforcement had with Leeson involving the manufacture of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\u00b66 Leeson filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing that \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA (2001), is vague and overbroad in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 17 of the Montana Constitution. The District Court denied the motion. Leeson later pled guilty to the charges, but through an Order Nunc Pro Tunc preserved his right to appeal \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA (2001), as being unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">\u00b67 \u201cThe denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case is a conclusion of law which we review to determine whether it was correct.\u201d <em>State v. Dixon, </em>2000 MT 82, \u00b6 10, 299 Mont. 165, \u00b6 10, 998 P.2d 544, \u00b6 10. \u201cOur review of questions involving constitutional law is plenary. A district court\u2019s resolution of an issue involving a question of constitutional law is a conclusion of law which we review to determine whether the conclusion is correct.\u201d <em>State v. Bedwell, </em>1999 MT 206, \u00b6 4, 295 Mont. 476, \u00b6 4, 985 P.2d 150, \u00b6 4 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">DISCUSSION ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err in finding that \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA (2001), is not unconstitutionally vague on its face?</p>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">\u00b69 The State argues that Leeson does not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA (2001). Without regard to whether Leeson has standing, his argument fails on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-11\">\u00b610 \u201cIt is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined.\u201d <em>City of Whitefish v. O\u2019Shaughnessy </em>(1985), 216 Mont. 433, 440, 704 P.2d 1021, 1025. This Court has explained that vague laws offend several important values:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-4\">First, we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct, and we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning. Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them. Avague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an <em>ad hoc </em>and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application. Third, where a vague statute abuts upon sensitive areas of basic First Amendment freedoms, it operates to inhibit the exercise of those freedoms. Uncertain meanings inevitably lead citizens to steer far wider of the unlawful zone than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">O\u2019Shaughnessy, 216 Mont, at 440, 704 P.2d at 1025-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\u00b611  A statute can be challenged as unconstitutionally vague on its face, or as applied in a particular situation. <em>State v. Nye </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 505, 513, 943 P.2d 96, 101. Leeson argues that \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA (2001), is unconstitutional on its face. A statute is void for vagueness on its face \u201cif it fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden.\u201d <em>Nye, </em>283 Mont. at 513, 943 P.2d at 101 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">\u00b612 Leeson contends that a person of ordinary intelligence may be in possession of supplies, equipment and materials commonly used for other purposes, that <em>could </em>be used to manufacture methamphetamine, subjecting that person to arrest for operating an unlawful clandestine laboratory under \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA (2001). Section 45-9-132, MCA (2001), provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-8\">(1) A person commits the offense of operation of an unlawful clandestine laboratory if the person purposely or knowingly engages in:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-9\">(a) the procurement, possession, or use of chemicals, precursors to dangerous drugs, supplies, equipment, or a laboratory location for the criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs as prohibited by 45-9-110;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-10\">(b) the transportation of or arranging for the transportation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>chemicals, precursors to dangerous drugs, supplies, or equipment for the criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs as prohibited by 45-9-110; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-4\">(c)the setting up of equipment or supplies in preparation for the criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs as prohibited by 45-9-110.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\u00b613 Section 45-9-131, MCA, defines some of the terms used in \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA (2001):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-6\">(2) \u201cEquipment\u201d or \u201claboratory equipment\u201d means all products, components, or materials of any kind when used, intended for use, or designed for use in the manufacture, preparation, production, compounding, conversion, or processing of a dangerous drug as defined in 50-32-101. Equipment or laboratory equipment includes but is not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-7\">(a) a reaction vessel;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-8\">(b) a separatory funnel or its equivalent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-9\">(c) a glass condensor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-10\">(d) an analytical balance or scale; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-11\">(e) a heating mantle or other heat source.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-12\">(3) \u201cPrecursor to dangerous drugs\u201d means any material, compound, mixture, or preparation that contains any combination of the items listed in 45-9-107(1), except as exempted by 45-9-108.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-13\">Section 45-9-107, MCA, provides a list of \u201cprecursors to dangerous drugs,\u201d a term used in both \u00a7\u00a7 45-9-131 and -132, MCA (2001):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-14\">(1) A person commits the offense of criminal possession of precursors to dangerous drugs if the person possesses any material, compound, mixture, or preparation that contains any combination of the following with intent to manufacture dangerous drugs:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-15\">(a) phenyl-2-propanone (phenylacetone);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-16\">(b) piperidine in conjunction with cyclohexanone;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-17\">(c) ephedrine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-18\">(d) lead acetate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-19\">(e) methylamine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-20\">(f) methylformamide;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-21\">(g) n-methylephedrine</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-22\">(h) phenylpropanolamine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-23\">(i) pseudoephedrine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-24\">(j) anhydrous ammonia;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-25\">(k) hydriodic acid;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-26\">(l) red phosphorus;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>(m) iodine in conjunction with ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or red phosphorus;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-4\">(n) lithium in conjunction with anhydrous ammonia.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\u00b614  Leeson does not indicate which term or terms in \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA (2001), fail to give proper notice. However, given the specificity of the above statutes, it is difficult to imagine how a person of ordinary intelligence could fail to understand what conduct \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA (2001), forbids. Moreover, \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA (2001), incorporates the requirement that a person have intent to operate an unlawful clandestine laboratory. Under \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA (2001), a person must \u201cpurposely or knowingly\u201d engage in the listed activities \u201cfor the criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs.\u201d \u201c[T]he requirement of a mental state to do a prohibited act may avoid those consequences to the accused which may otherwise render a vague or indefinite statute invalid.\u201d <em>Nye, </em>283 Mont, at 514, 943 P.2d at 102. It would be difficult, if not impossible, for a person to inadvertently purposely or knowingly take action in furtherance of the criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"AF\">\u00b615 Leeson also argues that \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA (2001), is void for vagueness because it lends itself to arbitrary enforcement because it is based upon subjective standards. He cites testimony by an officer that enforcement of \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA (2001), is done on a case-by-case basis using subjective standards. While this may be true, we disagree with Leeson that the subjective nature of the enforcement of \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA (2001), renders it unconstitutionally vague. The United States Supreme Court has recognized that even when \u201cstandards are undoubtedly flexible, and the officials implementing them will exercise considerable discretion, perfect clarity and precise guidance have never been required....\u201d <em>Ward v. Rock Against Racism </em>(1989), 491 U.S. 781, 794, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 2755, 105 L.Ed.2d 661.</p>\n<p id=\"AC\">\u00b616  We hold that the District Court did not err when it concluded that \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA (2001), is not unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">\u00b617 Is \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA (2001), unconstitutionally overbroad?</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">\u00b618 The State argues that Leeson waived his right to challenge \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA (2001), as overbroad because he did not properly raise it before the District Court. Once again, without regard to the State\u2019s waiver argument, Leeson\u2019s argument fails on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-11\">\u00b619  \u201cA clear and precise enactment may nevertheless be \u2018overbroad\u2019 if in its reach it prohibits constitutionally protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>conduct.\u201d <em>O\u2019Shaughnessy, </em>216 Mont, at 440, 704 P.2d at 1026. \u201cAn overbroad statute is one that is designed to burden or punish activities which are not constitutionally protected, but the statute includes within its scope activities which are protected by the First Amendment.\u201d <em>State v. Martel </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 143, 152, 902 P.2d 14, 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">\u00b620  Leeson contends that \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA (2001), is unconstitutionally overbroad because it subjects innocent people to being arrested for possessing certain items which are otherwise legal to possess, if such items could be used to manufacture methamphetamine. However, as we stated in <em>Nye, </em>\u201cthe claimed overbreadth of a statute must not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep, particularly where conduct and not merely speech is involved.\u201d <em>Nye, </em>283 Mont. at 515, 943 P.2d at 103. Here, Leeson has not demonstrated how \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA (2001), might infringe on constitutionally protected rights in a real or substantial way.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u00b621  In <em>Nye </em>we explained that when the claimed overbreadth of a statute is not substantial and real, the statute is not unconstitutional on its face, but that an unconstitutional application of the statute should be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. <em>Nye, </em>283 Mont, at 515, 943 P.2d at 103. Here, Leeson does not argue that the statute is unconstitutional as applied. Therefore, we hold that \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA (2001), is not unconstitutionally overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">\u00b622 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b33-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON, LEAPHART and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
