Did the District Court err when it granted the preliminary injunction?</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err when it denied Canyon\u2019s motion for a written undertaking as provided for under \u00a7 27-19-306, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b160-14\">\u00b65 From the late 1980s to the mid-1990s, CR Kendall, a Colorado Corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Canyon Resources Corporation, a Delaware Corporation licensed to do business in the State of Montana, mined its property situated in the North Moccasin Mountain Range. The Respondents in this action, who will be collectively referred to as the Shammels, all own property downstream and downslope from the property that CR Kendall mined.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-15\">\u00b66 In 1996, Alan and Stephanie Shammel were notified that their water was contaminated with nitrates, selenium, thallium, and sulfate. That same year, Canyon installed a pump-back system on the mine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>site.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, in 1998, Alan and Stephanie began to experience water quantity problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">\u00b67 The Shammels brought a civil action against Canyon on October 10, 2001, alleging theories of trespass, nuisance, and negligence, and seeking compensatory and punitive damages. The Shammels alleged that Canyon had tortiously affected the quantity and quality of water in several drainages-Dog Creek, Little Dog Creek, and the South Fork of Last Chance Creek-resulting in damage to their properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u00b68 Canyon decided to sell many of its Montana properties and mineral rights at an auction, through the Sheldon Good Auction Company, on August 6, 2002. Canyon advertised the sale in several newspapers in Montana and around the country. The Shammels learned about the auction and filed an application for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction on July 30, 2002, to restrain Canyon from dissipating the proceeds of the sale of any Montana assets. On August 5, 2002, the District Court granted the TRO and ordered Canyon to deposit any funds received from the auction, up to and including $12,359,141, with the Clerk of the Tenth Judicial District Court. The amount realized from the auction was $616,305. The TRO, as per \u00a7 27-19-316, MCA, expired in ten days time and a hearing on the application for preliminary injunction was held on August 14,2002. The court granted the preliminary injunction but, recognizing that Canyon\u2019s harm may outweigh the Shammels\u2019, the court set another hearing date for October 1, 2002, to allow Canyon to present any evidence that farther addressed the balancing of the equities and to consider Canyon\u2019s motion for undertaking for security pursuant to \u00a7 27-19-306, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\u00b69 After the October 1 hearing, the District Court issued a supplemental order to the preliminary injunction and an order on undertaking. The court found that the scale of equities tipped in the Shammels\u2019 favor and so continued the preliminary injunction. In the supplemental order, the court authorized the release of $133,000, which Canyon was contractually obligated to pay. Of the $616,000 sequestered funds, this left a balance of $483,000. The court ordered Canyon to deposit $45,000 from corporate cash on hand with the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>to bring the total to $528,000. The $528,000 figure represented, according to the court, the value of Canyon\u2019s fee lands that would have been available, but were -under contract for sale, to the Shammels were they to prevail at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">\u00b610 The court also denied Canyon\u2019s motion for undertaking for security because Canyon had nearly $1 million in cash on hand to use for payroll purposes, and because the court deemed it to be in the \u201cinterests of justice.\u201d Canyon now appeals the order granting the Shammels\u2019 application for preliminary injunction and the court\u2019s subsequent denial of the motion for an undertaking for security.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\u00b611 It has come to our attention that there is confusion in our case law regarding the standard of review where an injunction has been granted or denied. The standard first used was an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Nelson v. O'Neal </em>(1871), 1 Mont. 284, 187 Mont. LEXIS 4. \u201cThe granting or refusing an injunction was discretionary with the court below ... it was [not] an abuse of discretion in refusing an injunction.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>1 Mont. at 286. Later, a manifest abuse of discretion standard was introduced. <em>Craver v. Stapp </em>(1902), 26 Mont. 314, 67 P. 937. \u201cThe granting or dissolving of an injunction is so largely within the discretion of the lower court, that the supreme court will never disturb its action, unless there has been a manifest abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Craver, </em>26 Mont, at 314, 67 P. at 937. These two different standards have been used interchangeably over the last hundred years. <em>Hagener v. Wallace, </em>2002 MT 109, \u00b6 12, 309 Mont. 473, \u00b6 12, 47 P.3d 847, \u00b6 12; <em>M.H. v. Montana High School Ass\u2019n </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 123, 130, 929 P.2d 239, 243; <em>Mont. Tavern Ass\u2019n v. State, Dept. of Revenue </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 258, 263, 729 P.2d 1310, 1314; <em>Madison Fork Ranch v. L&amp;B Lodge, Etc. </em>(1980), 189 Mont. 292, 302, 615 P.2d <em>900, 906; Hansen v. Galiger </em>(1949), 123 Mont. 101, 113, 208 P.2d 1049, 1056; <em>Colusa Parrot Mining &amp; Smelting Company v. Barnard </em>(1903), 28 Mont. 11, 15, 72 P. 45, 45; <em>Anaconda Copper-Min. Co. v. Butte Min. Co. </em>(1896), 17 Mont. 519, 521, 43 P. 924, 925.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">\u00b612  It is incumbent upon us to rectify this century-old confusion and provide consistency to the law and guidance to the bar by adopting one standard of review. Unfortunately, none of our prior decisions discuss the difference between the two standards nor state a reason for adopting one over the other. In light of the high degree of discretion vested in district courts to maintain the status quo through injunctive relief, we determine that the more deferential \u201cmanifest abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>discretion\u201d is the appropriate standard for reviewing the granting of a preliminary or permanent injunction. A \u201cmanifest\u201d abuse of discretion is one that is obvious, evident or unmistakable. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 6th Ed. To the extent that the cases listed below are inconsistent with this holding, they are overruled<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AVN\">Issue 1</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u00b613 <em>Did the District Court err when it granted the preliminary injunction?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\u00b614 Canyon argues that the preliminary injunction should not have been granted for several reasons. The first, and most relevant for purposes of this opinion, is that the Shammels failed to meet the requirements under the <em>Van Loan </em>test. <em>Van Loan v. Van Loan </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 176, 181-82, 895 P.2d 614, 617. Second, the District Court did not set forth its reasoning for issuing the injunction with sufficient clarity to allow informed appellate review. Third, the lower court\u2019s sequestration of Canyon\u2019s assets is an improper prejudgment attachment. F ourth, the District Court took judicial notice of numerous pages of newspaper articles, editorials, letters, and excerpts from an MEIC report without first granting Canyon a hearing under Rule 201(e), M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">\u00b615 Section 27-19-201, MCA, provides for issuance of a preliminary injunction</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">(1) when it appears that the applicant is entitled to the relief demanded and the relief or any part of the relief consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the act complained of, either for a limited period or perpetually;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">(2) when it appears that the commission or continuance of some act during the litigation would produce a great or irreparable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>injury to the applicant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">(3) when it appears during the litigation that the adverse party is doing or threatens or is about to do or is procuring or suffering to be done some act in violation of the applicant's rights, respecting the subject of the action, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">(4) when it appears that the adverse party, during the pendency of the action, threatens or is about to remove or to dispose of the adverse party's property with intent to defraud the applicant, an injunction order may be granted to restrain the removal or disposition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">(5) when it appears that the applicant has applied for an order under the provisions of 40-4-121 or an order of protection under Title 40, chapter 15.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">This Court has held that only one of these subsections need be met for an injunction to be issued. <em>Sweet Grass Farms v. Board of County Com\u2019rs, </em>2000 MT 147, \u00b6 27, 300 Mont. 66, \u00b6 27,2 P.3d 825, \u00b6 27 (citing <em>Stark v. Borner </em>(1987), 226 Mont. 356, 359-60, 735 P.2d 314, 317). \u00b616 Here, subsections two and three apply. In his affidavit, Richard De Voto (De Voto), President of Canyon Resources Corporation, stated that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">[h]alf the proceeds from the August 6th sale of assets of Canyon and its subsidiaries will go to their lenders, pursuant to prior agreements, and the remainder will be utilized to meet and fulfill the ongoing expenses and obligations of Canyon and its subsidiaries, including the funding of continued reclamation obligations at the Kendall mine site.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">Accordingly, there is a very real possibility that, should the Shammels prevail at trial, they will have no recourse against Canyon. This would render a judgment in the Shammels\u2019 favor ineffectual and produce a great or irreparable injury to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">\u00b617  This case, however, presents an additional obstacle. Generally, injunctive relief is not granted where an action for monetary damages will afford an adequate remedy. <em>Boyer, </em>178 Mont, at 31, 582 P.2d at 1177 (citing <em>State v. Krieg </em>(1965), 145 Mont. 521, 402 P.2d 405). In <em>Van Loan, </em>this Court adopted a four-part test to determine \u201cwhether a preliminary injunction should issue when a party\u2019s monetary judgment may be made ineffectual by the actions of the adverse party thereby irreparably injuring the applicant. The moving party has the burden of proving these elements.\u201d The test is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-11\">(1) the likelihood that the movant will succeed on the merits of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>the action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\">(2) the likelihood that the movant will suffer irreparable injury absent the issuance of a preliminary injunction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">(3) the threatened injury to the movant outweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party (a balancing of the equities); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">(4) the injunction, if issued, would not be adverse to the public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-7\"><em>Van </em>Loan, 271 Mont. at 182, 895 P.2d at 617. It is this test, Canyon contends, that the Shammels have failed to meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">\u00b618 Canyon argues the first element was not met because the court relied heavily on the testimony of a lay witness, Stephanie Shammel (Stephanie), when the Shammels\u2019 two expert witnesses contradicted each other and raised real doubt as to the Shammels\u2019 likelihood of succeeding on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">\u00b619  \u201cTestimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.\u201d Rule 704, M.R.Evid. According to the commission\u2019s comments regarding this rule, it is identical to the Federal Rules of Evidence and is consistent with Montana law. Advisory committee notes to the Federal rule indicate that the \u201c \u201cbasic approach to opinions, lay and expert, in these rules is to admit them when helpful to the trier of fact.\u2019 The language of the rule allows lay witnesses to give their opinions on an ultimate issue if the requirements of Rule 701 are met.\u201d The Federal Rules and Montana Rules of Evidence, 701, indicate that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">[i]f the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness\u2019 testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (a) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness\u2019 testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AaZ\">\u00b620  The District Court found Stephanie\u2019s testimony \u201cpersuasive\u201d as to the resolution of a fact in issue. The lower court decided to hear from Stephanie regarding the harm the plaintiffs were suffering because of the \u201cbright-line dispute between the experts\u201d regarding water quality and quantity. Stephanie\u2019s testimony was based on her rationally based perception. She testified that beginning in 1988, she and her husband were involved in the mine permitting process. The couple had water samples taken over the years and were notified in 1996 that their water was contaminated with nitrates, selenium, thallium, and elevations of sulfate. Stephanie further testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>water quantity had been significantly reduced after the pump-back system was installed in 1996. The District Court did not err in relying on Stephanie\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\u00b621 Regarding the second element, Canyon points to the District Court\u2019s findings that Canyon had been able to pay off nearly $32 million in loans in a six-year period, its stockholder equity as of June 30,2002, exceeded $33 million, and it had $990,000 cash on hand as of October 1, 2002. Having determined that it is not in a financially precarious position, Canyon contends it was inconsistent for the court to conclude that Canyon would not be able to satisfy a judgment should the Shammels prevail at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\u00b622 As noted above, De Voto asserted in his affidavit that sequestering the funds would hamper current reclamation efforts; that half of the proceeds from the auction were to go to Canyon\u2019s lenders; and that the other half of the proceeds would be used to meet operating costs and obligations to various subsidiaries, including funding of continued reclamation obligations. While Canyon correctly points out the District Court\u2019s findings with respect to Canyon\u2019s financial position, the affidavits presented at the hearing do bring to light the distinct likelihood that Canyon may not have money to satisfy a future judgment. As the District Court pointed out, Canyon\u2019s money appears to be obligated everywhere except Montana. If this money is allowed to leave Montana and go to creditors and subsidiaries, there is a likelihood that there will be no recourse for the Shammels should they prevail at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u00b623 As to the third element, Canyon argues that the District Court did not articulate any basis or identify evidence that would show that the threatened injury to the Shammels outweighed the damage the proposed injunction would cause Canyon. Canyon attempted to bolster this argument by pointing out that the only evidence the court referenced in its August order was the evidence Canyon offered to establish that an injunction would cause it greater harm than the Shammels.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">\u00b624  After the initial hearing for the preliminary injunction where the District Court found that the damage to the Shammels would be greater than Canyon\u2019s, the District Court conducted an <em>additional </em>hearing to allow Canyon a further opportunity to present evidence regarding the balancing of the equities. The District Court found the evidence presented by Canyon as to the financial damage caused by the preliminary injunction to be \u201cwholly unconvincing.\u201d The court noted Canyon\u2019s ability to pay not only the Sheldon Good Auction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Company bill in the summer of 2002, but also its ability to repay nearly $32 million in loans in a six-year period, and the $1.3 million Canyon made from a land sale in Argentina. Based on these figures the court reasoned that Canyon\u2019s resting the company\u2019s financial future on the $616,000 in auction proceeds was misplaced. We conclude that the District Court did not err in finding that the Shammels would suffer greater injury if the injunction were not issued. The record reflects that Canyon appears to have sufficient funding without the $616,000 to carry on its operations. On the other hand, if the court had not sequestered the $616,000, the Shammels would very likely be without recourse should they be successful at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">\u00b625 Concerning the fourth element, Canyon contends that the injunction would be against the public interest because sequestering funds from the auction jeopardized Canyon\u2019s ability to continue reclamation activities and maintain the public\u2019s interest in a clean healthful environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\u00b626 The District Court concluded that because Montanans have a fundamental right to a clean and healthful environment, it is in the public interest to ensure that funds are available for potential clean up of contaminants on the Shammels\u2019 private property. Art. II, Sec. 3, Mont. Const. Assuming, as the District Court did, for purposes of issuing an injunction, that there is pollution on the Shammels\u2019 property, and given the pervasive nature of water pollution, the court did not err in concluding that, under Art. II, Sec. 3, it is in the public\u2019s interest as well as the Shammels\u2019 interest to assure that funds are available for potential clean up of any such pollution.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\u00b627  We hold that the <em>Van Loan </em>test was met, and that the District Court did not manifestly abuse its discretion when it granted the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">\u00b628 Canyon next argues that the District Court erred in granting the preliminary injunction because the District Court failed to set forth its reasoning for issuing the injunction with sufficient clarity to allow informed appellate review. Canyon correctly points out that Rule 52(a), M.R.Civ.P., requires that a court must set forth the findings of fact <em>and </em>conclusions of law which constitute the grounds of its action in granting or refusing interlocutory injunctions. However, we have held that \u201cthe extent of such findings and conclusions is necessarily dependent on the facts and circumstances of each case ... the litmus test in such cases is whether the District Court\u2019s order sets forth its reasoning in a manner sufficient to allow informed appellate review.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number><em>Lake v. Lake County </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 126, 134, 759 P.2d 161, 165 (citing <em>Clemons v. Martin </em>(1986), 221 Mont. 483, 487, 719 P.2d 787, 789-90. We determine, based on the above discussion, that the District Court set forth its reasoning in this case in a manner sufficient to allow informed appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\u00b629 Canyon also contends that because the instant case does not satisfy <em>Van Loan, </em>the only other grounds upon which the District Court might have properly ordered the sequestration of Canyon\u2019s assets was under Montana\u2019s prejudgment attachment statutes, which are not applicable in this situation. Because we hold that the <em>Van Loan </em>requirements were met, there is no need to address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u00b630 Last, Canyon argues that the preliminary injunction should not have been granted because the District Court improperly'took judicial notice of numerous pages of newspaper articles, editorials, letters, and excerpts from an MEIC report and denied Canyon\u2019s request for a hearing pursuant to Rule 201(e), M.R.Evid. While Canyon again correctly quotes the law, and while judicial notice of the documents, assuming they were judicially noticed, may have been inappropriate without offering Canyon an opportunity to be heard, Rule 201(2)(e),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the tenor of the articles had to do with whether Canyon was unreasonable in resisting an increase in the reclamation bond. The issue here, however, was the sequestration of sale proceeds, not the size of the reclamation bond. Assuming arguendo, that the District Curt erred in taking judicial notice, the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u00b631 Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s decision to grant the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Issue 2</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">\u00b632 <em>Did the District Court err when it denied Canyon\u2019s motion for a written undertaking as provided for under \u00a7 27-19-306, MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">\u00b633 Canyon contends that the court improperly denied the motion for undertaking because, even though Canyon is no longer mining, its reclamation activities constitute \u201cconstruction\u201d under \u00a7 27-19-306(2)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">\u00b634 Section 27-19-306, MCA, requires that \u201c[i]f a party seeks an injunction or restraining order against an industrial operation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>activity, the judge shall require a written undertaking to be filed by the applicant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\">\u00b635 The District Court denied Canyon\u2019s request for undertaking interpreting the statute as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-4\">The legislature\u2019s intent was those injunctions which stopped an activity of mining, of timber, or other activity, as defined, grazing operation, as defined in that statute, that that was their goal, that if these things are stopped in process by an injunction you get this undertaking to cover the wages of those poor folks who get stopped who can\u2019t earn a living when the injunction is granted, that they were dealing with very precise injunctions that were aimed against timber and mining that were ongoing active enterprises with employed people who will be stopped because of [the] injunction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">This is not the instance here. We are not stopping an ongoing operation. We are requiring the company to retain Montana assets for the eventual outcome of this case ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\u00b636 Canyon contends that the mandatory language in \u00a7 27-19-306(2)(a), MCA, is applicable in the instant case. \u201c[T]he judge <em>shall </em>require a written undertaking to be filed by the applicant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This requirement, however, must be read in the context of the entire subsection, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">The amount of the written undertaking must be set in an amount that includes all of the wages, salaries, and benefits of the employees of the party enjoined or restrained during the anticipated time that the injunction or restraining order will be in effect. The amount of the written undertaking may not exceed $50,000 unless the interests of justice require. The written \u25a0undertaking must be conditioned to indemnify the employees of the party enjoined or restrained against lost wages, salaries, and benefits sustained by reason of the injunction or restraining order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Section 27-19-306(2)(a), MCA. The expressed purpose of the undertaking is to protect the employees of the party enjoined from loss of wages, salaries, and benefits during the period that operations are enjoined. The subsection has no application to the present case. The injunction at issue does not restrain Canyon from engaging in an industrial operation or activity. Rather, it requires sequestration of sale proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">\u00b637  Beyond that, the District Court has discretion whether an undertaking may be waived. Section 27-19-306(l)(b), MCA. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>District Court acted within that discretion in denying the request for an undertaking, \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d Section 27-19-306(l)(b)(ii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">\u00b638 We affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Canyon\u2019s motion for written undertaking.</p>\n<judges id=\"b170-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER, COTTER and DISTRICT JUDGE McCARTER, sitting for JUSTICE WARNER concur.

I would conclude that the issuance of the injunction herein by the District Court did not meet the <em>Van Loan </em>test, which, in my view, has not been fully set forth and applied by the Court, and would reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">\u00b640 In devising the <em>Van Loan </em>requirements, this Court took direction from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Deckert v. Independence Shares Corp. </em>(1940), 311 U.S. 282, 61 S.Ct. 229, 85 L.Ed. 189, and the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>In re Estate of Ferdinand Marcos, Human Rights Litigation </em>(9th Cir. 1994), 25 F.3d 1467. <em>Van Loan, </em>271 Mont. at 179-80. 895 P.2d at 615-16. We noted in our analysis of those cases that the injunctive relief granted therein was premised upon the defendant\u2019s insolvency, the defendant\u2019s history of secreting assets, or its present threat to do so. <em>Van Loan, </em>271 Mont, at 179-80, 895 P.2d at 615-16. We declared that injunctive relief in a tort case was only available in the \u201cextraordinary\u201d case, defined by the Ninth Circuit as when \u201cmoney damages will be an inadequate remedy due to impending insolvency of the defendant or that defendant has engaged in a pattern of secreting or dissipating assets to avoid judgment.\u201d <em>Van Loan, </em>271 Mont. at 179-80, 895 P.2d at 616 (quoting <em>Estate of Marcos, </em>25 F.3d at 1469).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">\u00b641 We adopted our own test based upon these principles, holding that injunctive relief was appropriate \u201cif it is alleged that the defendant threatens to, or is about to secret or dissipate his/her assets in order to thwart any monetary recovery by the plaintiff ....\u201d <em>Van Loan, </em>271 Mont. at 184, 895 P.2d at 619. We \u201ccaution[ed] that our analysis is to be narrowly interpreted\u201d and stressed that relief is to be granted \u201conly under the most clear facts that fully satisfy the four-part test.\u201d <em>Van Loan, </em>271 Mont. at 183, 895 P.2d at 618. The Court decides this case today without referencing these principles or requiring that they be satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">\u00b642 Unlike the plaintiff in <em>Van Loan, </em>the Plaintiffs here have not established the required elements with the required proof. In <em>Van Loan, </em>the defendant had \u201cadmitted liability and stated that significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>damages [had] occurred.\u201d <em>Van Loan, </em>271 Mont. at 183, 895 P.2d at 618. Here, the Plaintiffs\u2019 own experts disagreed about the Defendants\u2019 potential liability. In <em>Van Loan, </em>the defendant \u201c[had] threatened that he will move his assets out of [plaintiffs] reach.\u201d <em>Van Loan, </em>271 Mont. at 182, 895 P.2d at 617. Here, the District Court made no findings whatsoever about a threat or history of asset dissipation by the Defendants in order to thwart recovery. Although the clarity of proof presented in <em>Van Loan </em>may well be rare, the District Court issued relief here on wholly inadequate grounds-because it was \u201cgravely concerned that the Defendants are operating a variety of subsidiaries with subsidiaries.\u201d Speculation or surmise is not proof. \u201cGrave concern\u201d about a company\u2019s business structure does not establish a pending insolvency, a threat or plan to dissipate assets, or an intention to thwart a monetary recovery, as required by <em>Van Loan, </em>and does not qualify as \u201cclear facts that fully satisfy\u201d the standards for the narrow, emergent relief we created in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">\u00b643 In \u00b6 16, this Court references the Defendants\u2019 proposed expenditure of the sale proceeds, and from there makes the unsupported leap that \u201c[accordingly, there is a very real possibility that, should the Shammels prevail at trial, they will have no recourse ....\u201d However, the distribution of $600,000 in sale proceeds by a $33 million company hardly constitutes proof that a plaintiff will be left with \u201cno recourse.\u201d Neither is it correct to state that \u201c[i]f this money is allowed to leave Montana ... there will be no recourse\u201d (\u00b6 22). The arm of the law reaches beyond our state\u2019s borders. <em>Van Loan </em>requires \u201cclear facts\u201d of a company\u2019s pending insolvency or its intent to avoid a judgment. Neither were demonstrated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">\u00b644 Because of the failure to prove the requisite elements of the relief requested, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b171-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY joins in the dissent of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\"> According to Montana Environmental Information Center (MEIC), the pump-back system Canyon installed at the mine site \u201cintercepts contaminated water in four drainages emanating from the mine, and pumps the water back on to the mine site.
