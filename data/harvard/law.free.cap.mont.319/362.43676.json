We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">\u00b62 Legg raises numerous issues on appeal, which we restate as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>\u00b63 1.

Did the District Court err in not applying the exceptions to the mandatory minimum sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">\u00b68 6. Does Legg\u2019s fifty-year sentence violate statutory sentencing policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">\u00b69 7. Did the District Court err in failing to designate an offender level?</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">\u00b610 8. Did the District Court violate Legg\u2019s substantive due process rights in sentencing him to fifty years in State prison?</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">\u00b611 On February 5,2001, R.G. reported to the Carbon County Sheriffs Department that his nine-year-old daughter, N.J.G., had been sexually assaulted by Charles Legg. The following day, Carbon County Undersheriff Bob Reed (Reed) conducted a videotaped interview of N.J.G., who reported that Legg had been sexually assaulting her since June 2000. N.J.G. disclosed to Reed that the assaults occurred on the ranch where Legg and she and her family lived and worked. According to N.J.G., Legg took her to places where they were alone, including her house, the shop, barn, cookhouse, and a friend\u2019s house. There, Legg touched her \u201cprivate parts,\u201d which she identified as her buttocks, breasts, and vaginal area. N.J.G. additionally reported that Legg kissed her mouth, put his hands under her clothing, and rubbed her breasts and buttocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">\u00b612 On February 9, 2001, Deputy Sheriff Hanly Loyning interviewed Legg concerning the allegations of sexual assault. Legg confessed that he had, on approximately twenty different occasions, touched the sexual or other intimate parts of N.J.G. for the purpose of arousing his or her sexual response or desire. Legg was subsequently arrested and charged with sexual assault, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA. \u00b613 After receiving appointed defense counsel, Legg was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to the charge of sexual assault. At the request of his defense counsel, the District Court ordered an examination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Legg\u2019s mental condition, pursuant to \u00a7 46-14-202, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">\u00b614 Pursuant to the court\u2019s order, Dee Woolston, Ph.D. (Dr. Woolston), a licensed clinical psychologist, performed a forensic psychological examination of Legg on June 8,2001. Dr. Woolston diagnosed Legg as suffering from a serious depressive disorder, which he judged was severe enough to significantly interfere with Legg\u2019s social and occupational functioning and caused him to suffer suicidal tendencies. Despite this, however, Dr. Woolston concluded Legg was intellectually competent, understood the nature of the criminal charge against him, and appreciated the possible consequences of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\u00b615 Shortly thereafter, at the request of Legg\u2019s counsel, Michael D. Sullivan, M.S.W. (Sullivan), Director of South Central Treatment Associates, performed a psychosexual evaluation of Legg. Using a number of assessment scales, including the Sex Offender Risk Appraisal Guide, the Static 99, and the Screening Scale for Pedophilic Interests, Sullivan categorized Legg as a low risk, or Level I, sexual offender and suggested that a community-based placement and outpatient sexual offender treatment would be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\u00b616 On November 5, 2001, Legg entered a plea bargain agreement with the State whereby he agreed to plead guilty to the sexual assault charge. In exchange, the State agreed to recommend sentencing in accordance with that suggested by the psychological and psychosexual evaluations. Legg acknowledged in the agreement that such a recommendation might range from a lengthy suspended sentence to incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">\u00b617 That same date, in accordance with the plea bargain agreement, Legg appeared before the District Court and changed his plea to guilty. After due inquiry, the court accepted Legg\u2019s guilty plea, ordered the preparation of a presentence investigation report (PSI), and scheduled the matter for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">\u00b618 Probation and Parole Officer Deborah Willis (Willis) was assigned the task of preparing the PSI. During the course of her investigation, Willis received numerous letters, both from the victim and her family, as well as from individuals who were either familiar with the victim and her family, or with Charles Legg. Many of the letters reported their observations of Legg around children and young adults. Others spoke about being secondary victims of Legg\u2019s sexual abuse. Willis additionally learned that Legg\u2019s ex-wife had been awarded exclusive care and custody of the parties\u2019 minor children during their divorce, which had been entered by default judgment in a Tennessee district court in 1998. Pursuant to the court decree, Legg was prohibited from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>visiting his children and was permanently restricted from the residence of his ex-wife or her workplace. Willis included this information within the PSI and additionally forwarded it to Michael Sullivan for his review.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\u00b619 On January 7, 2002, Sullivan submitted an addendum to his earlier psychosexual evaluation of Legg, reclassifying Legg as a Level II, or moderate risk offender. Based upon his review of the additional information provided by Willis, Sullivan concluded that Legg had not been \u201centirely candid in regards to his self-reports at the time of evaluation.\u201d In particular, Legg had misrepresented his relationship with his children during the initial evaluation by leading Sullivan to believe that he had a normal, ongoing relationship with his children, and failing to disclose that the divorce decree had severed the relationship. It also appeared that there were additional victims of Legg\u2019s sexual abuse, including Legg\u2019s own children and ex-wife. Finally, Sullivan noted that Legg was consistently described by others \u201cas a rather dishonest, manipulative, and irresponsible individual who tends to prey on vulnerable people. He [was] also described as a man who tends to feign depression and suicidal ideation as a way to either gain sympathy or avoid responsibility for his behavior.\u201d In light of this information, Sullivan concluded that Legg likely presented too great a risk to the community to be placed in a community-based setting and treated as an out-patient sexual offender, and suggested that treatment within a penitentiary would be appropriate. As a minimum level of confinement, Sullivan recommended treatment within a prerelease center.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\u00b620 On February 4, 2002, Willis filed the completed PSI with the District Court. In addition to the psychological evaluation performed by Dr. Woolston and the psychosexual evaluation and addendum prepared by Sullivan, the PSI included the letters and statements which had been submitted to Willis during her investigation, as well as the court decree dissolving Legg\u2019s marriage. After considering Legg\u2019s social and criminal history, the nature of his offense, and relevant statutes, Willis recommended that Legg be sentenced to a term of commitment with the Department of Corrections, and left suspension of any part of that term to the discretion of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u00b621 In response to the PSI, Legg filed a Motion in Limine and Sentencing Memorandum requesting the District Court to \u201cexclude from evidence all portions of the Presentence Investigation and Report based on letters or statements from persons other than [N. J.G.], her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>family, or her therapists.\u201d Legg also asked the court to take note of the mitigating factors set forth at \u00a7 46-18-222(2), MCA, as well as to recognize the public policy that sentences should be commensurate with the punishment imposed on other persons committing the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\u00b622 A sentencing hearing was held on February 4,2002. Legg\u2019s motion to exclude the letters and statements contained in the PSI was not ruled upon by the District Court, and thus, the challenged evidence was not excluded. The State recommended a thirty-year term of commitment at the Montana State Prison, with twenty-five years suspended, and Legg consented to the State\u2019s recommendation. After hearing testimony from the victim\u2019s father, physician, counselor, and Michael Sullivan, the District Court sentenced Legg to a fifty-year term in State prison, with no part of the sentence suspended. From this judgment, Legg appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u00b623 On March 6, 2002, Legg applied for sentence review before the Sentence Review Division of the Montana Supreme Court. Such review has been stayed pending the outcome of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\u00b624  This Court reviews a criminal sentence for legality only. Thus, our review is confined to whether the sentence is within the parameters provided by statute. <em>State v. Scarborough, </em>2000 MT 301, \u00b6 90, 302 Mont. 350, \u00b6 90, 14 P.3d 1202, \u00b6 90. When the issue on appeal concerns whether the district court violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights at sentencing, the question is a matter of law which we review <em>de novo </em>to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>State v. Bedwell, </em>1999 MT 206, \u00b6 4, 295 Mont. 476, \u00b6 4, 985 P.2d 150, \u00b6 4; <em>State v. Guillaume, </em>1999 MT 29, \u00b6 7, 293 Mont. 224, \u00b6 7, 975 P.2d 312, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">\u00b625 1. Did the District Court err in failing to exclude evidence contained in the presentence investigation report?</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">\u00b626 Legg concedes that \u00a7 46-18-115(4)(a), MCA, allows the victim to provide the court with a statement concerning the effects of the crime on the victim, the circumstances surrounding the crime, the manner in which the crime was perpetrated, and the victim\u2019s opinion regarding appropriate sentence. Legg argues, however, that the District Court exceeded its statutory authority in considering statements from individuals other than N.J.G., her family, and therapists in imposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>sentence. The State responds by citing \u00a7 46-18-115(4)(c), MCA, which commands the court to \u201cconsider the victim\u2019s statement <em>along with other </em>factors.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b627 When interpreting statutes, this Court\u2019s only function is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature. <em>State v. Hamilton, </em>2002 MT 263, \u00b6 14, 312 Mont. 249, \u00b6 14, 59 P.3d 387, \u00b6 14. While legislative intent must first be determined from the plain meaning of the words in the statute, when the plain meaning of a statute is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, as it is here, we will examine the legislative history to aid our interpretation. <em>Hamilton, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u00b628 In 1995, \u00a7 46-18-115, MCA, was amended to include subsection 4, which, as stated above, requires the sentencing court to permit the victim to present a statement concerning the effects of the crime on the victim and to give an opinion regarding appropriate sentence. Additionally, subsection 4(c) was added, which commands the court to \u201cconsider the victim\u2019s statement along with other factors. However, if the victim\u2019s statement includes new material facts upon which the court intends to rely, the court shall allow the defendant adequate opportunity to respond and may continue the sentencing hearing if necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\u00b629 As advocated in hearings before the House and Senate Judiciary Committees during the 1995 legislative session, one of the primary purposes of the bill amending \u00a7 46-18-115, MCA, was to require consideration of the victim\u2019s interest by the courts and parole board at the critical stages of the proceedings. In particular, Representative Marjorie Fisher, sponsor of the legislation, informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">[H.B. 69] requires consideration of the protection of the victim by the courts when imposing restrictions on the offender and by the court before allowing a sex offender who assaulted a child to be treated in a community setting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Mont. S. Jud. Comm., <em>Hearing on H.B. </em>69, 54th Leg., Reg. Sess. 1 (Mar. 1, 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">\u00b630 Given the Legislature\u2019s concern with protecting victims from repeat offenses and the treatment of child sexual offenders within a community setting, we believe the Legislature intended to allow the sentencing court wide latitude in considering any information relevant to the treatment of the offender and the risk he or she poses to the victim or to other children in a community.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">\u00b631 Further, when the defendant has been convicted of a sex offense, as Legg has, the presentence investigation must include a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>psychosexual evaluation of the defendant and a recommendation as to treatment of the offender in the least restrictive environment, considering <em>the risk the offender presents to the community. </em>Section 46-18-111(1), MCA. We also note that under \u00a7 46-18-112(1)(e), MCA, the probation officer preparing the PSI must inquire into and report upon such things as \u201cthe harm caused, as a result of the offense, to the victim, the victim\u2019s immediate family, <em>and the community. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b632 Here, Sullivan\u2019s consideration of the statements submitted to Probation Officer Willis as well as the divorce decree terminating Legg\u2019s marriage was in keeping with the statutory mandate of \u00a7 46-18-111(1), MCA. While Sullivan reclassified Legg\u2019s risk designation after considering this additional information, Sullivan testified at sentencing that he reconsidered Legg\u2019s risk level only after it became apparent that Legg had not been \u201centirely candid\u201d with him during the initial evaluation. In particular, Sullivan noted that Legg\u2019s relationship with his children had been severed pursuant to a divorce decree, which was contrary to Legg\u2019s initial report to Sullivan, and that Legg was prohibited from being around his ex-wife and children. It was also apparent to Sullivan that there may be additional victims of Legg\u2019s sexual abuse, including his own children, and that Legg was consistently described by others as \u201cmanipulative\u201d and \u201cdishonest.\u201d In light of this information, Sullivan concluded that Legg posed a greater risk to the community than previously assessed and recommended placement at a pre-release center as the minimum level of structure and supervision necessary for treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u00b633  As it was required to do by statute, the District Court considered the contents of the PSI and the recommendations contained therein. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-18-111(1), MCA. This notwithstanding, it is unclear from the record what specific consideration the District Court gave to the statements submitted to Willis. Rather, the record shows only that the court was greatly concerned with the risk Legg posed to the community, particularly minor girls, should he receive the minimum level of treatment. Although the court based its determination of Legg\u2019s risk to the community largely upon the testimony of Michael Sullivan, who considered the statements and divorce decree in calculating Legg\u2019s risk status, such consideration was in keeping with the purpose of \u00a7 46-18-115(4), MCA, which requires the court to recognize the importance of protecting the victim, as well as \u00a7 46-18-111(1), MCA, which requires consideration of the risk the offender presents to the community. In light of these statutory imperatives, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>hold the District Court did not exceed its statutory authority by disregarding Legg\u2019s motion in limine to exclude from the PSI letters and statements from individuals other than N. J.G.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b634 2. Did the District Court adequately state its reasons for Legg\u2019s sentence in its oral pronouncement of sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b635 Legg contends that the reasons stated in the District Court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence were insufficient as a matter of law and urges this Court to remand for resentencing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u00b636 Section 46-18-115(6), MCA, provides that, \u201cin felony cases, the court shall specifically state all reasons for the sentence ... in open court on the record and in the written judgment.\u201d Nonetheless, we have not required a district court to give an extensive statement of its sentencing reasons. <em>State v. St. John, </em>2001 MT 1, \u00b6 27, 304 Mont. 47, \u00b6 27, 15 P.3d 970, \u00b6 27, <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Brister, </em>2002 MT 13, 308 Mont. 154, 41 P.3d 314; <em>see also State v. Osterloth, </em>2000 MT 129, \u00b6\u00b6 39-40, 299 Mont. 517, \u00b6\u00b6 39-40, 1 P.3d 946, \u00b6\u00b6 39-40 (holding that sentencing court\u2019s oral pronouncement that defendant\u2019s participation in intensive outpatient sex offender treatment program \u201cdidn\u2019t work out\u201d and that the court \u201ccannot accept the risk to the other children in this community\u201d met the requirements under \u00a7 46-18-115(6), MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\u00b637  Here, after rendering judgment against Legg, the District Court stated in open court the following reasons for its sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">Mr. Legg, I don\u2019t want to have another family come before me and say that their child had to experience what [N.J.G.] has experienced. Therefore, I\u2019ve given you a 50-year prison term, such that you will be under supervision until you\u2019re 91 years of age. So even if you are 71,1 pray that it would not occur. There will be under the laws of Montana some eligibility for parole, but it will be a long time before that eligibility kicks in, Mr. Legg.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">The reason for that, quite frankly, is that the law allows the Court to impose sentences for the purposes of punishment. We should not allow in this society people to abuse and injure children without extreme consequences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-10\">Therefore, this sentence is passed for the reason that I believe society needs to be protected from Mr. Legg. The injury visited upon the child needs to be addressed appropriately by the Court. And the psychological and sexual counseling and criminal thinking counseling can be adequately addressed at the Montana State Penitentiary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Thus, as reflected on the record, the District Court imposed a fifty-year sentence on Legg both to punish Legg for his crime, as well as to protect society from Legg in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">\u00b638 Additionally, the court had questioned Michael Sullivan concerning the duration of Legg\u2019s required treatment. Sullivan had testified that Legg would always need some sort of structure to maintain a non-offending status. Thus, the court reasoned that incarceration presented the most appropriate course for providing the counseling, treatment, and supervision Legg required. On this record, we hold the District Court\u2019s stated reasons for Legg\u2019s fifty-year sentence satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 46-18-115(6), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u00b639 3. Did the District Court adequately state its reasons for Legg\u2019s sentence in its written judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u00b640 As in the previous issue, Legg argues that the District Court\u2019s statement of reasons for sentence in its written judgment was inadequate under \u00a7 46-18-115(6), MCA. The State counters, however, that Legg has waived this issue on appeal. We agree with the State. \u00b641 The sentence orally pronounced from the bench in the presence of the defendant is the legally effective sentence and valid, final judgment. <em>Osterloth, </em>\u00b6 40; <em>see also State v. Lane, </em>1998 MT 76, \u00b6 40, 288 Mont. 286, \u00b6 40, 957 P.2d 9, \u00b6 40. When there is a conflict between the oral pronouncement of sentence and the written judgment, \u00a7 46-18-116(2), MCA, permits the defendant to request the sentencing court to \u201cmodify the written judgment to conform to the oral pronouncement\u201d of sentence. However, the defendant \u201cwaive[s] the right to request modification of the written judgment if a request for modification of the written judgment is not filed within 120 days after the filing of the written judgment of the sentencing court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">\u00b642  Here, after receiving the written judgment, Legg moved to amend or correct the judgment to include a designation of his offender status and consideration of mitigating factors. Although Legg made his motion pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-116, MCA, Legg failed to establish, or even discuss, the existence of a conflict between the oral pronouncement of sentence and the written judgment. Thereafter, Legg made no motion to conform the written judgment to the oral pronouncement of sentence. Because the prescribed time period for doing so has now elapsed, Legg has waived his right to request modification of the written judgment. His request for remand and resentencing on this issue is therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">\u00b643 4. Did the District Court adequately consider the presentence investigation report\u2019s recommendations for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>least restrictive environment at sentencing?</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b644 Legg argues that the District Court erred by failing to consider Sullivan\u2019s recommendations for the least restrictive environment at sentencing. Legg notes that, in <em>State v. Alexander </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 192, 203, 875 P.2d 345, 352, we held that a district court must consider a completed PSI prior to sentencing a defendant. Based upon our holding in <em>Alexander, </em>Legg argues that the District Court must review and analyze each of the PSI\u2019s recommendations for sentence, so that a defendant may receive treatment in the \u201cleast restrictive environment.\u201d Legg concludes that since neither the oral pronouncement of sentence nor the written judgment contained any analysis or consideration of Sullivan\u2019s recommendation, the District Court failed to consider such recommendations and, thus, erred in rendering sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u00b645 As Legg correctly points out, \u00a7 46-18-111(1), MCA, requires the PSI to include a psychosexual evaluation of the defendant when the defendant has been convicted of sexual assault. According to \u00a7 46-18-111(1), MCA, the evaluation must be completed by a qualified sexual offender therapist and must include a recommendation as to treatment of the defendant in the least restrictive environment, considering the risk the defendant presents to the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">\u00b646  In this case, Michael Sullivan, a qualified sexual therapist, completed the psychosexual evaluation of Legg. While it is true the District Court did not explicitly state that it had considered Sullivan\u2019s recommendations at sentencing, Legg provides no authority requiring the court to \u201citemize each piece of evidence presented and either accept or reject it.\u201d <em>See State v. Gordon, </em>1999 MT 169, \u00b6 49, 295 Mont. 183, \u00b6 49, 983 P.2d 377, \u00b6 49. Furthermore, from the record, it appears the District Court did consider Sullivan\u2019s recommendations for sentencing. At the sentencing hearing, the District Court questioned Michael Sullivan at length concerning possible treatment of Legg at a community or prison setting, and inquired about Legg\u2019s prognosis for success in both. Additionally, the PSI bears the court\u2019s handwritten notes and highlighted marks, which, while not conclusive evidence, suggest the court considered the PSI before sentencing the defendant. Finally, the District Court stated in its written judgment that it had \u201cconsidered the Pre-Sentence Investigation, the psychosexual evaluation, the testimony of Michael Sullivan and the recommendation of the County Attorney and of the defendant\u2019s attorney\u201d in imposing sentence. From this record, we hold the District Court adequately considered the PSI\u2019s recommendations for the least restrictive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>environment at sentencing, and, therefore, affirm the District Court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u00b647 5. Did the District Court err in not applying the exceptions to the mandatory minimum sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b648 Legg argues that, pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-222(2), MCA, the District Court should have considered Dr. Woolston\u2019s evaluation in imposing sentence. Section 46-18-222(2), MCA, provides that a district court may sentence a criminal defendant to less than the statutory mandatory minimum sentence when \u201cthe offender\u2019s mental capacity, at the time of the commission of the offense for which the offender is to be sentenced, was significantly impaired, although not so impaired as to constitute a defense to the prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\u00b649  However, we have consistently held that the exceptions set forth at \u00a7 46-18-222, MCA, do not apply in cases in which the district court sentences the offender to more than the minimum sentence. <em>State v. Zabawa </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 307, 317, 928 P.2d 151, 157, <em>followed in State v. Keith, </em>2000 MT 23, \u00b6 23, 298 Mont. 165, \u00b6 23, 995 P.2d 966, \u00b6 23. <em>See also State v. Graveley </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 519, 524, 915 P.2d 184, 188, <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Lane, </em>1998 MT 76, \u00b6 41, 288 Mont. 286, \u00b6 41, 957 P.2d 9, \u00b6 41; <em>State v. Nichols </em>(1986), 222 Mont. 71, 82, 720 P.2d 1157, 1164; and <em>State v. DeSalvo </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 343, 348, 903 P.2d 202, 205. Furthermore, there is no requirement that the District Court make findings on why it did not apply the exceptions. <em>Zabawa, </em>279 Mont. at 317, 928 P.2d at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u00b650 Here, Legg conceded before the District Court at sentencing that the mitigating factors set forth at \u00a7 46-18-222, MCA, did not apply as he had agreed to the State\u2019s recommended sentence of thirty years, which exceeded the mandatory minimum sentence for his sexual assault of a victim under sixteen years of age. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA. Accordingly, we need not address the merits of Legg\u2019s argument because the exceptions found at \u00a7 46-18-222, MCA, do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">\u00b651 6. Does Legg\u2019s fifty-year sentence violate statutory sentencing policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">\u00b652 Legg claims that his fifty-year sentence, which is one-half the maximum allowed under law, violates public policy that sentences should be commensurate with the punishment imposed on other persons committing the same offense. Section 46-18-101(3)(b), MCA. \u00b653  The State responds, and we agree, that this is an issue concerning the equity of Legg\u2019s sentence, which properly lies with the Sentence Review Division. This Court does not review a sentence on appeal for mere inequity or disparity. <em>DeSalvo, </em>273 Mont, at 350, 903 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>P.2d at 207. Rather, \u201cthe proper channel for a challenge to the equity of a sentence as opposed to its legality is through the Sentence Review Division.\u201d <em>DeSalvo, </em>273 Mont. at 350, 903 P.2d at 207. Accordingly, we hold that further review of Legg\u2019s sentence for any alleged inequity properly lies with the Sentence Review Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\u00b654 7. Did the District Court err in failing to designate an offender level?</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u00b655 Legg correctly argues that \u00a7 46-23-509(3), MCA, commands the District Court to designate the sexual offender\u2019s risk level at the time of sentencing. However, the statute further provides that \u201cif, at the time of sentencing, the sentencing judge did not apply a level designation to a sexual offender who is required to register under this part, the department shall designate the offender as level 1, 2, or 3 when the offender is released from confinement.\u201d Section 46-23-509(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\u00b656  Here, the District Court failed to designate Legg\u2019s risk level, despite the fact that Legg brought this omission to the court\u2019s attention by motion. To this extent, we conclude the District Court erred. However, our conclusion does not require this case to be remanded for resentencing because the statute contemplates that the Department of Corrections may designate an offender level at the time of the offender\u2019s release from confinement, if the district court has failed to do so. Section 46-23-509(5), MCA. In other words, the statute provides its own remedy. Because the sentence imposed on Legg did not result in prejudice, we hold the District Court\u2019s failure to designate Legg\u2019s offender level was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">\u00b657 8. Did the District Court violate Legg\u2019s substantive due process rights in sentencing him to fifty-years in State prison?</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">\u00b658 Legg challenges his fifty-year sentence as a violation of substantive due process, arguing that the District Court acted arbitrarily in imposing sentence because it failed to consider the mitigating factors referenced in Dr. Woolston\u2019s psychological evaluation, or make a finding of aggravating circumstances. Although Legg did not challenge his sentence on this basis in District Court, he urges this Court to nonetheless review his claim under the common law \u201cplain error\u201d doctrine. The State responds by arguing that the plain error exception does not apply in this case as plain error review is reserved for exceptional cases in which the claimed errors implicate a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights. In this case, the State argues, Legg has not demonstrated that his constitutional rights were violated by the District Court\u2019s alleged error. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>\u00b659 We agree with the State that the plain error exception does not apply in this case. In order to invoke our power of common law plain error review, the criminal defendant must \u201cinitially demonstrate that a fundamental right constitutionally guaranteed to him was implicated by the plain error which he now claims.\u201d <em>State v. Hart, </em>2000 MT 332, \u00b6 49, 303 Mont. 71, \u00b6 49, 15 P.3d 917, \u00b6 49 (quoting <em>State v. Pizzichiello, </em>1999 MT 123, \u00b6 11, 294 Mont. 436, \u00b6 11, 983 P.2d 888, \u00b6 11). Although Legg claims his constitutional right to due process was implicated by the District Court\u2019s failure to consider the mitigating factors set forth in Dr. Woolston\u2019s evaluation or enter findings of aggravating circumstances, Legg has failed to demonstrate how such inaction amounted to any error, much less fundamental unfairness amounting to plain error. Nor does a review of the record convince us that neglecting to review Legg\u2019s claimed error will result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of fundamental fairness of the proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process. <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2003 MT 247, \u00b6 20, 317 Mont. 331, \u00b6 20, 77 P.3d 224, \u00b6 20; <em>State v. Brown, </em>1999 MT 31, \u00b6 9, 293 Mont. 268, \u00b6 9, 975 P.2d 321, \u00b6 9 (citing <em>State v. Finley </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 126, 137, 915 P.2d 208, 215). Because we will not \u201cset a precedent of presenting full analysis whenever a party asserts that an issue not properly preserved for appeal constitutes plain error,\u201d <em>Daniels, </em>\u00b6 28, and Legg does not meet the narrow criteria required to invoke our discretionary plain error review, we decline to address the merits of Legg\u2019s argument under plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\u00b660 However, under our holding in <em>State v. Lenihan </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 338, 602 P.2d 997, we may review a sentence that is alleged to be illegal or exceeding statutory limits, even if no objection was made at the time of sentencing. <em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000. While Legg has failed to meet the requirements for plain error review, he has challenged the legal validity of his sentence by alleging that it was issued without regard to the mitigating factors identified in Dr. Woolston\u2019s evaluation, thus violating his due process rights in the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 17, of the Montana Constitution. Such a claim is reviewable on appeal. However, in this case, Legg has failed to cite any authority in support of his argument or otherwise demonstrate how the District Court\u2019s alleged actions or inactions violated his constitutional rights. We have repeatedly stated that we will not consider arguments on appeal that are unsupported by authority. <em>State v. Peterson, </em>2002 MT 65, \u00b6 24, 309 Mont. 199, \u00b6 24, 44 P.3d 499, \u00b6 24 (citing <em>State ex. rel. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number><em>Booth v. Mont. Twenty-First Jud. Dist., </em>1998 MT 344, \u00b6 35, 292 Mont. 371, \u00b6 35, 972 P.2d 325, \u00b6 35).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">\u00b661  Rather, after an extensive review of Legg\u2019s argument concerning this issue, we conclude that Legg has cloaked an equitable challenge of his sentence in the vestiges of a constitutional argument. Essentially, Legg contends that the fifty-year sentence imposed upon him so exceeds the recommendations in the PSI and the recommendations made by counsel as to be fundamentally unfair. Given the lack of authority, this is an argument concerning the equity of Legg\u2019s sentence, not its legality. As we have already stated, issues of equity are matters which are proper for the Sentence Review Division, and are not considered on appeal by this Court. Accordingly, we decline to address the merits of Legg\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u00b662 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b403-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b403-7\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"ApR\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">\u00b663 I concur in the opinion with the caveat that the statement in \u00b6 30 that a sentencing court has latitude to consider \u201cany information relevant to the treatment of the offender\u201d is subject to the concerns I expressed in my dissent in <em>State v.
