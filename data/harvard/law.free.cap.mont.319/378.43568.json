Adamson concedes that he does not challenge the facts underlying the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">\u00b64 Adamson was employed by the Pondera County Road Department from November 21,1977, to May 25,1996. During that time, Adamson held the position of County Equipment Operator/Laborer and performed the duties of his position without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-13\">\u00b65 In December 1993, Adamson injured his left shoulder when he slipped while stepping from his camper. This accident did not occur while Adamson was working nor while he was on duty. Adamson sought medical treatment for this injury in February 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>\u00b66 Around April or May 1994, Adamson injured his right shoulder while performing prescribed physical therapy exercises for his left shoulder. Again, this injury did not occur while Adamson was working nor while he was on duty. Adamson again sought medical treatment for this injury, and received medical treatment from Michael E. Luckett, M.D. (Dr. Luckett).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">\u00b67 Dr. Luckett noted that Adamson was suffering from bilateral rotator cuff tears. On June 2, 1994, Adamson underwent surgery on his right shoulder to repair the torn rotator cuff, and the surgery was successfully completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\u00b68 On August 12, 1994, Dr. Luckett told Adamson that he could return to work; however, he placed a 20-pound lifting restriction on Adamson. On August 16, 1994, Adamson requested of the Pondera County Commissioners\u2019 Office that he be returned to his position. After meeting with the Road Supervisor, the commissioners denied Adamson\u2019s request to be returned to work, as they believed Adamson would have difficulty using certain equipment and could endanger himself or others. Their denial was evidenced and further explained by a letter from the Pondera County Commissioners\u2019 Office, dated August 17, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\u00b69 After receiving the letter, Adamson requested from Dr. Luckett a more specific medical release, which Dr. Luckett twice provided. In these releases, Dr. Luckett indicated that Adamson\u2019s lifting restriction was for no more than 20 pounds on his right upper extremity and would continue for a period of approximately six months. The commissioners still refused to return Adamson to his position or to modify his position in any manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">\u00b610 Adamson subsequently returned to work without any restrictions on Friday, January 13, 1995. Adamson provided the commissioners with his full work release on January 18, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">\u00b611 On April 13, 1995, Adamson underwent surgery on his left shoulder to repair the torn rotator cuff, and the surgery was successfully completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">\u00b612 On May 12,1995, Dr. Luckett released Adamson to modified duty, restricting Adamson to lifting not more than 25 pounds and not more than 15 pounds above his shoulder. Adamson notified the Pondera County Commissioners of these restrictions and requested that he be returned to his position. The commissioners refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">\u00b613 On October 13, 1995, Dr. Luckett provided Adamson a full work release, and the commissioners returned Adamson to work on October 26,1995. Adamson remained working with Pondera County until May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>25,1996, when he retired.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\u00b6 14 As a result of his absences from work, during which time the commissioners refused to return Adamson to his position, in total, Adamson incurred a financial loss of $21,305.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u00b615 On March 12,1998, Adamson presented evidence of his financial loss to the Hearing\u2019s Examiner for the MHRC, claiming he incurred such loss as a result of Pondera County\u2019s discrimination. The Hearing Examiner found in favor of Pondera County, a ruling that the MHRC affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">\u00b6 16 The First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, upheld the MHRC\u2019s ruling on June 5, 2001, holding that Adamson was not disabled as that term was defined in the Montana Human Rights Act. \u00b617 Adamson now appeals the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">\u00b618 We review an administrative agency\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether those findings are clearly erroneous in light of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence in the record. <em>State Personnel v. Investigators, </em>2002 MT 46, \u00b6 18, 308 Mont. 365, \u00b6 18, 43 P.3d 305, \u00b6 18. We review an administrative agency\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>State Personnel, </em>\u00b6 20. Because Adamson represents that his present appeal is limited to the legal conclusions reached by the District Court, our review is limited to whether the District Court\u2019s legal interpretations were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">\u00b619 Did the District Court err in affirming the MHRC\u2019s decision that Adamson was not disabled within the meaning of that term in the Montana Human Rights Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">\u00b620 Adamson initially argues that because the present case is one of direct evidence, he needs only to prove two elements: (1) that he was disabled; and (2) that he was qualified for continued employment and that his employment did not subject him or others to physical harm. Consequently, Adamson contends that he was disabled as this Court interpreted that term in <em>Martinell v. Montana Power Co. </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 292, 886 P.2d 421. Namely, he argues that his situation likens that of Martinell\u2019s, wherein this Court held that Martinell was handicapped although her condition was not chronic. In addition, Adamson contends that Pondera County did not attempt to accommodate his restricted lifting conditions, although he was capable of performing the majority of his duties should the county have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>returned him to his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\u00b621 Pondera County and the MHRC implicitly concede that the present case is one of direct evidence, as they also apply and argue under the direct evidence test. They both argue that because Adamson\u2019s condition was temporary, he was not disabled, and because Adamson was not disabled, the county did not need to accommodate his condition. They also argue that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Butterfield v. Sidney Public Schools, </em>2001 MT 177, 306 Mont. 179, 32 P.3d 1243, is inapplicable on these facts, as Adamson\u2019s restrictions were temporary and his job was never in jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u00b622 Under the Montana Human Rights Act, it is an unlawful discriminatory practice for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">[a]n employer to refuse employment to a person, to bar a person from employment, or to discriminate against a person in the compensation or in a term, condition, or privilege of employment because of... physical or mental disability... when the reasonable demands of the position do not require [a] ... physical or mental disability... distinction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Section 49-2-303(1)(a), MCA. A physical or mental disability is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">(i) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of a person\u2019s major life activities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">(ii) a record of such impairment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-10\">(iii) a condition regarded as such an impairment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">Section 49-2-101(19)(a), MCA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-12\">In addition,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-13\">[i]t is unlawful to discriminate, in hiring or employment, against a person because of the person\u2019s physical disability. There is no discrimination when the nature or extent of the disability reasonably precludes the performance of the particular employment or when the particular employment may subject the person with a disability or that person\u2019s fellow employees to physical harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-14\">Section 49-4-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-15\">\u00b623 In <em>Reeves v. Dairy Queen, Inc., </em>1998 MT 13, 287 Mont. 196, 953 P.2d 703, we relied in part on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Interpretive Guidelines in holding that a determination under the Montana Human Rights Act regarding whether a person is disabled must be made on a case-by-case basis. <em>Reeves, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23-28. These interpretive guidelines, in pertinent part, state that \u201ctemporary, non-chronic impairments of short duration, with little or no long term or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>permanent impact, are usually not disabilities. Such impairments may include, but are not limited to, broken hips, sprained joints, concussions, appendicitis, and influenza.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j). As an example, these interpretive guidelines also state that \u201ca broken leg that takes eight weeks to heal is an impairment of fairly brief duration. However, if the broken leg heals improperly, the \u2018impact\u2019 of the impairment would be the resulting permanent limp.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u00b624 Several United States Supreme Court cases have also relied on the interpretive guidelines, noting that impairments which can be mitigated by corrective measures, such as medications, are not disabling impairments. <em>See e.g. Sutton et al. v. United Air Lines, Inc. </em>(1999), 527 U.S. 471, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.E.2d 450; <em>Murphy v. United Parcel Service, Inc. </em>(1999), 527 U.S. 516, 119 S.Ct. 2133, 144 L.E.2d 484; <em>Albertson\u2019s, Inc. v. Kirkingburg </em>(1999), 527 U.S. 555, 119 S.Ct. 2162, 144 L.E.2d 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u00b625 We have also held that we must determine whether a person suffers from a \u201cphysical handicap\u201d on a case-by-case basis. <em>Martinell, </em>268 Mont. at 307, 886 P.2d at 430. The woman in <em>Martinell </em>suffered from chronic endometriosis, the medication for which caused her to become depressed and ultimately miss a substantial amount of work. Her condition persisted for three years. <em>Martinell, </em>268 Mont. at 298-300, 886 P.2d at 425-26. In holding that Martinell\u2019s condition was a handicap, we noted Martinell\u2019s difficulty in retaining and advancing her employment. <em>Martinell, </em>268 Mont. at 307, 886 P.2d at 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\u00b626 <em>la Butterfield </em>we held that: (1) since Butterfield was restricted in his basic job functions, due to his back injury; and (2) since the School District did not allow Butterfield to return to his position because of these restricted job functions, although he was released from his doctor to the extent of not lifting more than 50 pounds, the School District regarded him as disabled, and the District Court erred in holding to the contrary. <em>Butterfield, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">\u00b627 Here, unlike the woman\u2019s condition in <em>Martinell, </em>which lasted three years, and the man\u2019s condition in <em>Butterfield, </em>which was permanent, Adamson\u2019s condition was temporary. Indeed, Dr. Luckett fully released Adamson after six months following Adamson\u2019s first surgery, and six months following Adamson\u2019s second surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">\u00b628 In addition, Adamson\u2019s job was never in jeopardy during his absence. During the interim of both shoulder surgeries, Pondera Comity kept open and available Adamson\u2019s position for his return, unlike the School District did in <em>Butterfield. </em>Adamson\u2019s surgeries, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>his absence from work also did not prevent him from retaining or advancing his employment with Pondera County, as did the woman\u2019s condition in <em>Martinell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\u00b629 Further, the Hearing Examiner in charge of Adamson\u2019s claim never concluded that Adamson\u2019s condition precluded him from performing a class of jobs, as was the case in <em>Butterfield. </em>The Hearing Examiner merely determined that Adamson\u2019s return could endanger either Adamson or Adamson\u2019s coworkers, and such a determination is in accordance with Montana law, namely \u00a7 49-4-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u00b630 Finally, as the interpretive guidelines state, Adamson\u2019s condition was both temporary and non-chronic, as evidenced by his return to work-with Dr. Luckett\u2019s full release-six months after both surgeries. \u00b631 Accordingly, we hold that both the MHRC and the District Court did not err in concluding that Adamson was not disabled under the Montana Human Rights Act, as there was no error in the Hearing Examiner\u2019s legal conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\u00b632 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b410-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
