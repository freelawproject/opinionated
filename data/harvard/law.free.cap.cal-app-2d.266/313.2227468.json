Industries, Inc. (hereinafter called the \u201ccorporation,\u201d or ,\u201cAJ\u201d). The questions presented are whether, under the circumstances of the present ease, the corporation should be required to pay attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred in the action (1) by the stockholders who brought it as plaintiffs, or \u25a0 (2) by two officer-directors of the corporation who were named as defendants and whose alleged misconduct was the basis of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Respondents Maurice Fletcher and Bradley, both stockholders of the corporation (and hereinafter \u201cplaintiffs\u201d), commenced the derivative action in December, 1964. The named defendants included the corporation; respondents Ver . Halen and Malone; Messrs. Wendell Fletcher and E. J. Sargent; and the personal representative of George T. Fox, - deceased. Ver Halen was president of the corporation, Malone was its treasurer. Both men, and Sargent, were members of its board of directors. Wendell Fletcher and Fox had been board members before the action was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The complaint alleged generally that at relevant times Ver \u2019 Halen had dominated and controlled the board and the man- . agement of the corporation; that he had dominated and acted in concert with Wendell Fletcher, Sargent, Fox and Malone in several transactions which had occurred while all were members of the board;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that, in consequence, the corporation had been damaged in the various transactions, which were then detailed in seven causes of action in the complaint. In an eighth cause of action, plaintiffs alleged that Ver Halen had breached his contract of employment with the corporation. The complaint prayed for several forms of relief on behalf of the corporation, including a money judgment against Ver Halen for $134,150 and one against all the individual defendants in the amount of $1,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">' Ver Halen appeared in plaintiffs\u2019 action and noticed a motion for security for his litigation expenses, pursuant to subdivision (b) of section 834 of the Corporations Code. The corporation subsequently made a general appearance and joined in Ver Halen\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">. During the course of a protracted hearing on the joint '.motion, a settlement of the action was negotiated. Plaintiffs, the corporation, Ver Halen' and Malone (the last-named <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>appearing for the first time) filed a formal stipulation executed by their respective attorneys. The stipulation' provided that its purpose was to settle all claims set forth in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint; that upon performance of the stipulation\u2019s \u201cexecutory provision,\u201d the action was to'be dismissed with prejudice ; and that, pending dismissal, the.trial court was to make an order approving the stipulation, the action was not to be prosecuted further, and the trial court was to retain jurisdiction for the purpose of enforcing its order of approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The \u201cexecutory provisions\u201d of the stipulation included these agreements: Four incumbent directors were\u201d to be replaced by persons acceptable to plaintiffs, to Ver Halen, and to the corporation; failing their agreement, the new directors w\u00e9re to be appointed by the trial court. The corporation agreed to employ a new officer who would be in charge of its \u201coperations,\u201d and who would be one of the four new dired-' tors. In the election of future directors, Ver Halen\u2019s voting powers as a stockholder were to be limited so as to permit him to elect only two of the board\u2019s nine members. His employment contract was to be amended to provide that he could be employed as president of the corporation or, at the board\u2019s option, as chairman of the board. Malone was to be one of the directors replaced, and he was to resign as the corporation\u2019s treasurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Several of the specific charges alleged in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint related to claimed mismanagement of the corporation due to Ver Halen\u2019s \u201cdomination\u201d of its affairs; to Malone\u2019s allegedly excessive salary; and to Ver Halen\u2019s asserted breach' of his employment contract. The stipulated agr\u00e9ments summarized above apparently disposed of these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Most of the other charges made in the complaint related to specific transactions in which plaintiffs asserted misconduct on the part of Ver Halen. In other \u201cexecutory provisions\u201d of the stipulation it was agreed that these would be referred to arbitration, to be conducted in a subsequent proceeding. The question to be arbitrated, in each instance, was \u201cwhether or not\u201d the alleged misconduct had occurred. The parties to the' stipulation agreed to be bound by the arbitrator\u2019s decision as to each transaction, and the stipulation clearly contemplated the prospect that the corporation could receive a monetary award when the arbitration proceeding had been concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Whether the corporation was entitled to monetary recovery in any respect was, thus, to be determined in the future. In contrast, the stipulated agreements\u2014providing for the reor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ganization of the corporation\u2019s board of directors and its management, the ouster of Malone, and the amendment of Ver Halen\u2019s contract of employment \u2014 were to be peformed immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">The stipulation further provided that the arbitrator could award attorneys\u2019 fees, to be paid by the corporation, to any counsel who appeared in the arbitration proceeding, except that plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys could be awarded fees only in the event the corporation received a monetary award. The parties acknowledged (1) that plaintiffs\u2019 and the individual defendants\u2019 attorneys intended to apply to the trial court\u2014as distinguished from the future arbitrator\u2014for fees and costs to be paid to them by the corporation \u201cin connection with this action,\u201d but (2) that the corporation could take \u201cany position in connection with such applications that it may choose. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The trial court entered an order which referred to the stipulation, approved it, and ordered the parties to perform its executory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">In the order the court made this finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">\u2018 \u2018 The Court finds that, in view of the terms, conditions and provisions of said written stipulation, the best interests of the corporation and of all of its shareholders have been, are, and will be, fully protected; that the necessity for prolonged and expensive litigation will be avoided and; further, that the arbitration proceedings provided for in said written stipulation will be less time consuming and less expensive but will, nevertheless, insure to the corporation and to its shareholders the benefit of any financial recovery to which it or they may be entitled, if any. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Plaintiffs noticed and filed their application for an order requiring the corporation to pay their attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred in the action. Ver Halen and Malone separately noticed application for indemnity, to be assessed against the corporation, for their fees and costs incurred as defendants. After hearings\u2014at which the corporation opposed all three applications, as it was free to do under the stipulation\u2014the trial court entered orders granting each. We now consider these orders in each of their two separate categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">\n<em>The Order Awarding Attorneys\u2019</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">\n<em>Fees and Costs to Plaintiffs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">In its order granting plaintiffs\u2019 application for attorneys fees and costs, the trial court found that they had employed their attorneys to prosecute the derivative action, in good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>faith, on behalf of themselves and the other stockholders of the corporation, and that the corporation was able to pay the fees and costs incurred. The court also found that by reason of the action, and its settlement, \u201csubstantial benefits have been conferred\u201d upon the corporation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Based upon these findings, the court ordered the corporation to pay plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees ($64,784) and costs ($2,179.26).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The validity of the foregoing order is the issue first presented on the corporation\u2019s appeal.  Under the general rule in California and in most American jurisdictions, the party prevailing in an action may not recover attorneys\u2019 fees unless a statute expressly permits such recovery. The California expression of the general rule, itself statutory, is found in Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>An exception to the general rule is found, however, in the so-called common-fund doctrine, which is applicable in equity cases and recognized as such in California. As the Supreme Court has stated, \u201cIt is a well-established doctrine of equity jurisprudence that where a common fund exists to which a number of persons are entitled and in their interest successful litigation is maintained for its preservation and protection, an allowanee of counsel fees may properly be made from such fund. By this means <em>all </em>of the beneficiaries of the fund pay their share of the expense necessary to make it available to them.

None, however, did: they were referred to an arbitration proceeding which was to be conducted in the future. For the obvious reason that no fund existed, the trial court applied the substantial-benefit rule<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in entering the order in question, under which the award of attorneys\u2019 fees is charged directly against the corporation. The latter, appealing from the order, contends that the award could not be made unless the action produced a fund, because the substantial-benefit rule does not apply in California. The issue apparently presents a matter of first impression in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The California decisions are substantially uniform to the effect<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that a plaintiff who has successfully maintained a representative action is entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees from a common fund.

Bank </em>v. <em>Peterson </em>(1936) 5 Cal.2d 601, 607 [55 P.2d 867].)</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Appellant corporation cites some of the foregoing authorities in support of its assertion that a successful plaintiff cannot be awarded attorneys\u2019 fees <em>unless </em>an identifiable common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>fund has been recovered or protected in the representative action. None of them, however, so holds or states; none goes further than to indicate that the award <em>may </em>be made payable from a fund <em>if </em>one exists in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">In one derivative-suit decision the Supreme Court stated that \u201c. . . the law . . . does provide, apart from statute, for charging <em>against the corporation </em>the costs and counsel fees of a plaintiff who has successfully maintained a representative action. [Citations.] Since counsel fees for maintaining the action in such a situation <em>are measured </em>in a material part by the <em>benefits recovered </em>on behalf of the corporation, and both costs and counsel fees <em>are charged against the corporation </em>and <em>may </em>be made payable out of or a lien against the fund recovered, there is little likelihood that a plaintiff might successfully maintain the action and yet be unable to collect an award for his expenses.\u201d (Italics added.) <em>(Beyerbach </em>v. <em>Juno Oil Co. </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 11,19-20 [265 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The <em>Beyerbach </em>language imports, and we conclude, that under the California rule (1) an award of attorneys\u2019 fees to a successful plaintiff may properly be measured by, and paid from, a common fund where his derivative action on behalf of a corporation has recovered or protected a fund in fact: but (2) the existence of a fund is not a prerequisite of the award itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">This conclusion is not dispelled by other decisions, relied upon by appellant corporation, in which successful plaintiffs were denied attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>(Bank of America </em>v. <em>West End etc. Co. </em>(1940) 37 Cal.App.2d 685 [100 P.2d 318]; <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Nakano </em>(1939) 12 Cal.2d 711 [87 P.2d 700, 121 A.L.R. 417]; <em>Los Angeles Trust etc. Bank </em>v. <em>Ward </em>(1925) 197 Cal. 103 [239 P. 847].) In the <em>Mann </em>case the action was essentially by one class of corporate stockholders against another. The <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec, </em>and <em>Los Angeles Bank </em>cases each involved a stakeholder action against conflicting claimants, as presently contemplated in Code of Civil Procedure section 386.6. Thus, none of these cases is relevant here because none involved a representative action. (See 3 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, <em>supra, </em>at p. 2390.)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Our conclusion, moreover, is supported by the history of the common-fund doctrine itself. The doctrine\u2014permitting attorneys\u2019 fee awards to a successful plaintiff in a representative action, but from a common fund\u2014originated with the United States Supreme Court in <em>Trustees of Internal Improv. Fund </em>v. <em>Greenough </em>(1881) 105 U.S. 527, 532, 537 [26 L.Ed 1157, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>1160, 1162], (See Hornstein, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>39 Colum.L.Rev. 785 at pp. 787-788; Hornstein, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>69 Harv.L.Rev. 658.)</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The same court later held that the <em>Greenough </em>rule would apply in favor of a successful plaintiff although a common fund as such had <em>not </em>materialized in the action. <em>(Sprague </em>v. <em>Ticonic Nat. Bank </em>(1939) 307 U.S. 161, 166-167 [83 L.Ed. 1184,1186-1187, 59 S.Ct. 777].) This was so, the <em>Sprague </em>court reasoned, because the trial court\u2019s power to award attorneys\u2019 fees derived, not from the fact that a fund had been created, but from the broad \u201cpower of equity in doing justice as between a party and the beneficiaries of his litigation. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at p. 167 [83 L.Ed. at p. 1187].) The <em>Sprague </em>holding has been recognized as a significant extension of the <em>Greenough </em>rule. (Hornstein, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>69 Harv.L.Rev. 658 at p. 659. Note, <em>supra, </em>48 Cal.L.Rev. 843 at p. 846.)</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The California courts have consistently recognized <em>Greenough </em>as the source of the basic rule in question. (See, e.g., <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Harold G. Ferguson Corp., supra, </em>25 Cal.2d 274 at p. 277; <em>In re Pacific Coast Bldg.-Loan Assn., supra, </em>15 Cal.2d 155 at pp. 157-158; <em>County of Tulare </em>v. <em>City of Dinuba, supra, </em>205 Cal. 111 at p. 127; <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Hale &amp; Norcross Silver Min. Co., supra, </em>108 Cal. 475 at pp. 476, 477; <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.2d 272 at p. 282].)  It therefore appears that the <em>Sprague </em>extension should be recognized in California, and that the substantial-benefit rule may be applied, to permit an attorneys\u2019 fee award in the absence of a common fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">It bears emphasis that the substantial-benefit rule is an <em>extension </em>of the common-fund doctrine, because as such it attains the doctrine\u2019s recognized status as an exception to the language of Code of Civil Procedure section 1021 (quoted in footnote 3, <em>ante.) </em>Language suggesting to the contrary appears in <em>Solorza </em>v. <em>Park Water Co. </em>(1949) 94 Cal.App.2d 818 [211 P.2d 891], In that ease, which involved a stockholder\u2019s derivative action, the court stated <em>(id., </em>p. 822) that section 1021 operated to disallow an attorneys\u2019 fee award to the plaintiff because \u201c. . . [The common-fund doctrine] . . . [is] . . . the <em>only possible basis </em>for an award of attorney\u2019s fees in a suit of this nature.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">In <em>Solorza, </em>however, the claimed award had not been earned: the derivative action was entirely unsuccessful. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 821, 822.) For that reason, no \u201cbenefit\u201d\u2014pecuniary or otherwise\u2014had been realized by the corporation; the ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>tion of \u201csubstantial\u201d benefit did not arise; and, in that context, the <em>Solorza </em>court\u2019s reference to the common-fund doctrine as the \u201conly possible basis\u201d for an attorneys\u2019 fee award was dictum. <em>Solorza, </em>morover, turned upon an intricate procedural sequence which tends to limit its holding to its unique facts. We do not, in any event, read it to preclude the application of the substantial-benefit rule in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">And in our view the rule should be applied in a proper ease. The more limited common-fund doctrine is followed in fairness to the successful plaintiff, to prevent unfair advantage to those who benefit in his success by requiring them to share its cost, and to encourage proper litigation by assuring that the successful attorneys will be adequately compensated. <em>(Estate of Stauffer, supra, </em>53 Cal.2d 124 at p. 132.) Application of the substantial-benefit rule serves the same purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The stockholder\u2019s derivative suit, moreover, is an effective means of policing corporate management. The action should not be inhibited by a doctrine which limits the compensation of successful attorneys to eases which produce a monetary recovery; the realization of substantial, if nonpecuniary, benefits by the corporation should be the criterion. (Note, <em>supra, </em>48 Cal.L.Rev. 843 at p. 845.) And, to the extent that the substantial-benefit rule affirmatively encourages stockholders to exercise their right to seek redress for corporate mismanagement, it serves important considerations of public policy. (Note (1960) 13 Stan.L.Rev. 146, 148; Hornstein, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>47 Colum.L.Rev. 784 at p. 791 et seq.) The encouragement of nuisance-value derivative actions (\u201cstrike suits\u201d) is avoided or minimized by the requirement that only \u201csubstantial\u201d benefits will entitle the successful stockholder to attorneys\u2019 fees. (See <em>Bosch </em>v. <em>Meeker Coop. Light &amp; Power Assn., supra, </em>101 N.W.2d 423 at p. 426 [quoting <em>Schechtman </em>v. <em>Wolf son, supra, </em>244 F.2d 537 at p. 540].)</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The final question in the present case is whether the benefits realized by the corporation were sufficiently \u201csubstantial\u201d to warrant the award. To find that they were, the trial court need not determine that abuses existed in the corporate management, and that the action corrected them. It will suffice if the court finds, upon proper evidence, that the results of the action \u201cmaintain the health of the corporation and raise the standards of \u2018fiduciary relationships and of other economic behavior,\u2019 \u201d or \u201cprevent[s] an abuse which would be prejudicial to the rights and interests of the corporation or affect the enjoyment or protection of an essential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>right to the stockholder\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>(Bosch </em>v. <em>Meeker Coop. Light &amp; Power Assn., supra, </em>101 N.W.2d 423 at pp. 426, 427: (italics added.) The trial court was explicit to this effect in its order awarding plaintiffs their attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. (See pars, [c] and [d], quoted in footnote 2, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">It is not significant that the \u201cbenefits\u201d found were achieved by settlement of plaintiffs\u2019 action rather than by final judgment. The authorities recognizing the substantial-benefit rule have permitted attorneys\u2019 fee awards in settled cases. (See, e.g., <em>Steinberg </em>v. <em>Hardy </em>(1950) 93 F.Supp. 873.) This is in keeping with the law\u2019s general policy favoring settlements <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. Public Works </em>v. <em>Forster </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 257, 263 [23 Cal.Rptr. 582, 373 P.2d 630]); and in a stockholder\u2019s derivative action the trial court is in a position to scrutinize the fairness of a settlement because the court alone can authorize the action\u2019s dismissal. <em>(Spellacy </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1937) 23 Cal.App.2d 142, 146-148 [72 P.2d 262].)</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Some of the \u201cbenefits\u201d found by the trial court in the present case related to the comparative economy to be realized by proceeding in arbitration rather than in conventional adversary litigation. Other \u201cbenefits,\u201d though, were realized in the form of immediate changes in the corporate management. The corporation argues that some of these had been under consideration by its board of directors before plaintiffs sued and settled, and that the real value of others is speculative. But the trial court found that the changes were substantial as benefits to the corporation and, in effect, that plaintiffs \u2019 action had brought them about. The finding is supported by ample evidence, and it is decisive on the appeal. We therefore affirm the award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\n<em>The Orders Awarding Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Costs to the Defendant Officer-Directors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">We turn to the corporation\u2019s appeal from the orders providing indemnity to respondents Ver Halen and Malone for their attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, and assessing charges therefor against the corporation. Since both orders are controlled by the same principles, we first review the Ver Halen order.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">The order assessed against the corporation Ver Halen\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in the aggregate amount of $38,415.10. In two of several enumerated findings in it, the trial court found that Ver Halen had reasonably incurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>attorneys\u2019 fees ($38,294.50) and costs ($120.60) in defending the action, and that the corporation was able to pay both amounts. These findings are not disputed: three others which are relevant to the appeal (numbers 2, 3 and 5) are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The findings numbered 2 and 3 were indicated\u2014and supported\u2014by the history of the action: no evidence was received on the issue of Yer Halen\u2019s conduct as evaluated in finding no. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 application for litigation expenses was not controlled by statute because an exception to the statutory rule expressed in Code of Civil Procedure section 1021 was found in ease law. With Yer Halen\u2019s application, the opposite occurs: it fell within subdivision (a) of section 830 of the Corporations Code.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 830 expressly provides that it is the \u201cexclusive\u201d authority for an order assessing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>defendant officer-director\u2019s litigation expenses against the corporation which employs him <em>(id., </em>subd. [e]; see Ballantine, <em>California\u2019s 1943 Statute as to Directors\u2019 Litigation Expenses: An Exclusive Remedy for Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Employees </em>(1943) 31 Cal.L.Rev. 515, 517), and no decisions qualify its exclusive application. The question, then, is whether section 830 permitted the Ver Halen order at the time of its entry and under the unusual circumstances then existent.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Subdivision (a) of section 830 permits such order upon two conditions. In the present ease the first condition was literally met: as the trial court also found, plaintiffs \u2019 action was \u201csettled with the approval of the court.\u201d According to the express language of the statute, the second condition is met if \u201c [t]he court finds that . . . [the] . . . conduct [of the officer-director applicant] . . . fairly and equitably merits such indemnity.\u201d Ver Halen contends that the second condition was met here because the trial court did so find as to him. In our view, a proper construction of section 830 in the present ease will not sustain either his argument or the finding itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In enacting section 830 the Legislature applied, in favor of corporate personnel, the theory under which a principal is obligated to indemnify the agent for expenses arising from his performance of the agency. (Ballantine, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>31 Cal.L.Rev. 515 at p. 520.) The theory applies and the duty exists, however, only where the agent is not barred from its benefits by the illegality of his own conduct. (Rest. 2d, Agency, \u00a7 439.) As the latter qualification is expressed with reference to litigation expenses the principal has a duty to indemnify where the litigation against the agent is \u201cunfounded\u201d (Rest.2d, Agency, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 439, subd. (d); <em>id., </em>com. h; Rest.2d, Agency, Appendix, Rep. Notes, pp. 685-686); and the Legislature accordingly intended to limit the statutory indemnity of corporate officer-directors to \"expenses springing from the <em>proper </em>performance\u201d of their duties. (Ballantine, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>atp. 520: italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">It therefore appears that, when a trial court finds\u2014\u2022 as section 880 requires\u2014that the \u201cconduct\u201d of an officer-director \u201cfairly and equitably merits\u201d indemnity for his attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, the court must necessarily have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>made a favorable assessment of his \u201cconduct\" as an officer-director, and in the light of the charges made against him in the litigation involved. This is clearly true where the litigation has gone to trial and judgment. (See <em>New Capital for Small Businesses, Inc. </em>v. <em>Saunders </em>(1963) 215 Cal.App.2d 728, 733 [30 Cal.Rptr. 563].) It may also be true where the officer-director applies for indemnity in connection with a settlement of the action (a possibility clearly contemplated by section 830); and we may acknowledge that in a given ease the court\u2019s favorable assessment of his \u201cconduct,\" and the entry of its finding reflecting it, may be agreed upon in the settlement itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">But the trial court made no assessment of Ver Halen\u2019s conduct, favorable or otherwise: and in its order awarding plaintiffs their attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, it expressly disclaimed doing so. (See footnote 2, <em>ante, </em>particularly pars, [e] and [d].) The disclaimer was obviously made because Ver Halen\u2019s conduct remained to be tested in the future arbitration proceeding. The decisive point on the appeal, though, is that no evidence concerning his \u201cconduct\u201d was received when his application for indemnity was heard; the parties stipulated to none, and they did not stipulate to the finding that his conduct \u201cfairly and equitably\u201d merited the indemnity awarded him. Certain presumptions which might ordinarily have been accepted as evidence were in statutory effect when the Ver Halen order was entered (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1963, subds. 1, 19), but these could not have operated in Ver Halen\u2019s favor while Ms innocence of wrongdoing (\u00a7 1963, subd. 1) and the fairness and regularity of his transactions <em>(id., </em>subd. 19) were subject to determination in the future arbitration. For lack of any evidence supporting it, the finding concerning his conduct fails and the order must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The language of the other order, which awarded Malone $4,500 in attorneys\u2019 fees, was substantially similar to that of the Ver Halen order, including\u2014and the Malone order was equally dependent upon\u2014a finding that his \u201cconduct fairly and equitably\" merited the indemnity. Malone was not named in the provisions of the parties\u2019 stipulation which referred certain matters to arbitration: only Ver Halen was named. However, Malone\u2019s conduct\u2014if not his liability to the corporation\u2014was still at issue in the arbitration, because plaintiffs\u2019 complaint had alleged that he \u201cacted in concert\" with Ver Halen in some of the transactions in question. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Again, no evidence concerning his \u201cconduct\u201d was received when his application for indemnity was heard; no stipulation of the parties reached it; and no presumption applied in his favor. The finding that Malone\u2019s conduct \u201cfairly and equitably\u201d merited indemnity fails for lack of supporting evidence, and the Malone order must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The \u201cOrder Granting Plaintiffs Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Costs\u201d entered herein on December 20, 1965, is affirmed. The \u201cOrder Granting Defendant C. J. Ver Halen, Jr. Indemnity for Expenses and Attorneys\u2019 Fees\u201d and the \u201cOrder Granting Joseph J. Malone Indemnity for Expenses and Attorneys\u2019 Fees,\u201d both entered herein on December 20, 1965, are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Devine, P. J., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b353-7\">CHRISTIAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2K\">I dissent in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">In <em>Solorza </em>v. <em>Park Water Co. </em>(1949) 94 Cal.App.2d 818 [211 P.2d 891], like the present ease a shareholder\u2019s derivative action in behalf of a corporation, the Court of Appeal, citing <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Harold </em>G. <em>Ferguson Corp. </em>(1944) 25 Cal. 2d 274 [153 P.2d 714] as establishing the \u201ccommon fund\u201d doctrine in California, declared: \u201cThe principles quoted from the Winslow ease are the only possible basis for an award of attorney\u2019s fees in a suit of this nature. Unless specifically provided by statute, or by express or implied agreement of the parties, a party to an action is not entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d (94 Cal.App.2d at p. 822.) I regard the language just quoted not as dictum but as an alternative ground of decision. Reasonable predictability in appellate decisions is desirable; accordingly, I would follow the <em>Solorza </em>decision until it has been nullified by legislation or disapproved by our Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Leaving aside Solorza, I dissent on a further ground from the holding that attorneys\u2019 fees are allowable despite the fact that here there is no \u201ccommon fund\u201d: allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees is in California regulated by statute. That statute (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1021) is old; it has been construed many times as establishing a general rule in this state prohibiting the allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees in the absence of an agreement between the parties \u201cexcept as specifically provided for by statute.\u201d There is no such statute or agreement applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">The majority opinion refers to certain considerations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>policy which appear to indicate that it would be a good thing to allow attorneys\u2019 fees against a corporation when one of its shareholders succeeds in a derivative action and substantial benefit to the corporation results. The opinion then declares the existence of such a rule as an extension of the judicially created \u201ccommon fund\u201d exception to the statutory rule. But countervailing policy arguments are not lacking: for example, if the existence of a \u201ccommon fund\u201d protected or increased by the stockholders\u2019 action is not prerequisite to the allowance of fees the officers and directors may well be faced with a liquidation of assets to pay fees, even though resulting harm to the corporation might be disproportionate to the \u201csubstantial benefits\u201d derived from the lawsuit. Considerations of this character can better be appraised in the legislative process than by the episodic reaction of courts to such facts as may happen to be presented to them in isolated litigation. Moreover, it appears likely that the new enlargement of the \u201ccommon fund\u201d exception to the rule laid down in the statute may greatly outweigh in practical importance the court-created exception on which it is to be grafted. The variety of shareholders\u2019 actions in which \u201csubstantial benefit\u201d to the corporation may be found is literally boundless. Before such an important change in the law is effected it would be better to conduct hearings open to all interested persons, to commission thorough technical analyses by specialists in the field, or to authorize studies by the Law Revision Commission. All these avenues of enlightenment are open to the Legislature but not to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">I would reverse the \u201cOrder Granting Plaintiffs Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Costs. \u2019 \u2019 I concur in the reversal of the other orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 1, 1968.
