He also asserts that the court committed prejudicial error by instructing the jury with respect to the defenses of assumption of risk and contributory negligence, and in failing to give his proffered instructions on the rules of reasonable necessity and momentary forgetfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Error is found in the refusal to give plaintiff\u2019s instructions concerning the defendant\u2019s duty to furnish the plaintiff a safe place to work, and in unqualifiedly instructing the jury on assumption of risk. No error is found in connection with the other specifications. After an examination of the entire cause, including the evidence, it is determined that the errors complained of and found did not result in a miscarriage of justice. The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Plaintiff seeks to recover for injury to the fingers of his right hand which resulted in the permanent loss of the distal tip of his middle finger, portions of the index finger and thumb, and limitation of motion in the ring finger. The injuries were received August 13, 1964, when plaintiff attempted to start the air compressor at the service station which he operated under a lease and agreement of sale with defendant, and caught his fingers in the pulley belt of the machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">According to the plaintiff, at the time of the accident, he had been operating the service station under arrangements with defendant for about 15 years or more, and the compressor involved was in the station when he first took it over. The property was owned by third parties who had leased the service station and equipment, including the compressor, to the defendant (see fn. 1, <em>supra,). </em>At the time of the accident plaintiff was operating the service station under a lease dated July 5, 1961 for a three-year term ending August 31, 1964, with a provision for renewal for successive terms of three years each, and under an agreement of sale executed the same date as the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The lease provided that the lessee should maintain the equipment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the uncontradicted evidence showed that at the time of the original negotiations the defendant\u2019s representatives undertook to make all major repairs. The defendant\u2019s consignee-distributor testified that it was the custom and practice of the defendant to make provision for and pay for repairs that the plaintiff was incapable of effecting personally. The plaintiff\u2019s accountant testified that plaintiff\u2019s disbursements for repairs and maintence over a 10-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>year period had been minimal\u2014less than 1 percent of gross sales. The defendant had in fact arranged and paid for repairs to the gasoline pumps and a hoist. At least some months, and perhaps more than a year, before the accident, the defendant, in response to plaintiff\u2019s complaint that air was leaking, put in a new underground air line from the compressor to the hoist.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The compressor itself was set away from the station in a box and it was necessary to lift up a cover to get inside to the mechanism. It was operated by a double belt running from a smaller pulley on an electric motor to a larger pulley on the compressor itself. When the electricity was on it was ordinarily actuated automatically when the air pressure dropped below a fixed amount. It was used to furnish air for customers\u2019 tires, and for the operation of two hoists, one inside and one outside the station. According to plaintiff, in the 15 years he was operating the station, the only repair to the compressor and motor was the replacement of the belt which connected the pulleys.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The repairs to the air line were ineffective. Air continued to escape from the system, and the hoist would slip down on occasion. The compressor would run constantly unless the air valve was turned off, and there was a consequent increase in the electricity bills for the station. For about six months prior to the accident it had been the practice to turn the compressor off when it was not in use, and to activate it when needed by closing or opening a valve located on the corner of the box. About a month before the accident the condition of the compressed air system deteriorated so that the motor would just hum when the valve was opened, and it became necessary to activate the mechanism manually so that the motor and compressor would start operating.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">The evidence is in conflict with respect to whether plaintiff advised the defendant or its representatives of the malfunction of the compressed air system and the hoist after the new air line was installed. Plaintiff, with corroboration from a part-time employee, who relieved him on Sundays and on Saturday afternoons when plaintiff wanted to get away, and from his wife, testified that he had telephoned to the defendant\u2019s office at Moss Landing and to the office of its consignee-distributor in Hollister to complain about the manner in which the compressor was functioning. He testified that he had also told the defendant\u2019s delivery drivers and sent a note with one to advise the defendant\u2019s office that unless the air <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>line compressor was fixed he would not pay the rent. None of the drivers on duty during the period had any recollection of such a complaint. The consignee-distributor denied receiving any such complaint after the air line had been replaced. A witness for plaintiff indicated that the threat to withhold the rent occurred before the new line was installed. Plaintiff expressly acknowledged that he had never told anyone he was starting the compressor by hand, and that his complaint was that \u201cthe line leaked and the compressor was running all the time and it needed fixing.\u201d The only danger allegedly mentioned was that occasioned by the hoist slipping down.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">According to plaintiff\u2019s relief man, at the time of the accident the motor and compressor could be activated by putting a hand on top of the belt at one pulley and giving a pretty good push toward the other pulley. He did not like the situation and knew it was dangerous. He customarily turned the compressor on and let it run. all day. He testified that there was no guard of any type located around the flywheel on the compressor. He had observed guards on other compressors, and he described to the jury the manner in which the guard would prevent anything from getting into the mechanism. With such a guard it would be impossible to start the compressor in the manner which he used, although it would be possible, with greater likelihood of getting one\u2019s fingers caught, to pull the belt from underneath. The plaintiff subsequently testified to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Two days after the accident the plaintiff\u2019s wife called the consignee-distributor, advised him of the accident, and requested him to get the compressor fixed. The motor was repaired and the charges were paid by defendant. It was necessary to replace a bearing and the brushes, and the motor was given a general clean-up and overhaul. The repairman testified that the brushes were only used to start the motor, and that they were so worn that they would probably only work intermittently. He stated that he would not attempt to start the motor by giving the belt a pull or a shove; that he had never seen anyone do it; that the presence of two wheels and a belt and pulley, and the fact that one could not tell whether the mechanism was going to go or not, made it obvious to him that one might get injured by the moving parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The plaintiff testified that it was more or less routine to push the mechanism with his hand to start the motor after it was worn out. He stated that although he did not like the inconvenience of going over to start it all the time, he was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>aware of any danger in it, and he had never been told that he might get hurt starting it by hand. He said his sole concern was with the operation of the hoist. He acknowledged, however, that his friends who had started the motor on occasion had told him that they almost got their hands caught in the compressor.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">On the day of the accident a vehicle came in for an oil change. It was positioned above the hoist, and the hoist was started, and then it stopped when the vehicle was a little way, about 10 or 12 inches, off the ground. The compressor motor had stopped. Plaintiff demonstrated how he pushed the apparatus and testified, \u201cSomehow my fingers got in there. I don\u2019t know how,\u201d when the motor started after a second shove. He denied that he pulled on the belt and stated that he pushed from the big pulley on the compressor to the small pulley on the motor, and caught his finger on the top of the big one. The defendant introduced plaintiff\u2019s testimony from a prior deposition in which he testified he caught his fingers in the bottom of the little pulley, and that he held the band, as distinguished from the wheels, and gave it a jerk\u2014\u201cwent down to this last pulley.\u201d On redirect examination, after reflection, he reiterated that he did nothing different on the day of the accident; that the belt ran on the top <em>side </em>from the motor to the compressor; and that he would shove that way to start it. He demonstrated to the jury how he stood, and testified, \u201cI crossed over there went like this (indicating) and my fingers got caught . . . [by the big wheel].\u201d Other extracts from plaintiff\u2019s deposition revealed his prior testimony that he generally started the motor by pulling the belt and that he pulled the belt on the occasion of the accident; that others who had started the motor almost got their fingers caught too; and that he told kids to get out of the box containing the compressor because they might get hurt.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">On this evidence the court submitted the case to the jury under instructions which embodied principles applicable to general negligence, to the duties of a landlord to a tenant, to contributory negligence and to assumption of risk. The court refused to give proffered instructions on the duty imposed upon an \u201cemployer\u201d by the provisions of division 5 (\u00a7\u00a7 6300 et seq.) of the Labor Code, and on safety rules which are the subject of administrative regulations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>After deliberating for not quite three-quarters of an hour the jury requested the court to read the instruction pertaining to plaintiff\u2019s responsibility regarding contributory negligence. The court thereupon read that instruction and the instructions defining negligence in general. Thereafter, only four minutes after retiring, the jury rendered its unanimous verdict for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\n<em>Safe Place of Employment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Plaintiff seeks to tread a path from which a fall on one side leads into an employment relationship which would subject him to the limited indemnity provided by workmen\u2019s compensation under the provisions of division 4 of the Labor Code (\u00a7\u00a73201 et seq., particularly \u00a7\u00a73601 and 3706; and see <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Hollywood Canteen </em>(1946) 27 Cal.2d 802, 805 [167 P.2d 729].) The other side presents the dismal aspect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>nonliability because of an absence of control and other factors which would give rise to responsibility on the part of the lessor-supplier.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Plaintiff relies upon the theory which has been developed under the law of this state to hold a general contractor, or owner, responsible for furnishing a safe place of employment to those coming on the premises under the control of the general contractor or owner. The principle and the conditions for its application have been set forth at length in <em>Kuntz </em>v. <em>Del E. Webb Constr. Co. </em>(1961) 57 Cal.2d 100 [18 Cal.Rptr. 527, 368 P.2d 127], as follows: \u201cAmong the provisions read to the jury were sections 6400 and 6401 of the Labor Code, which provide that every \u2018employer\u2019 shall furnish employment and a place of employment which are \u2018safe\u2019 for the employees therein and shall do everything reasonably necessary to protect the \u2018safety\u2019 of employees, including the use of safety devices, safeguards, and methods reasonably adequate to insure safety. Section 6304 provides that the term \u2018employer\u2019 shall include \u2018every person having direction, management, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>control, or custody of any employment, place of employment, or any employee.\u2019 Section 6310 defines the terms \u2018safe\u2019 and \u2018safety\u2019 as \u2018such freedom from danger to the life or safety of employees as the nature of the employment reasonably permits. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\u201cThese provisions of the Labor Code should not be construed as meaning that, where a general contractor or owner of premises does nothing more with respect to the work done by an independent contractor than exercise general supervision and control to bring about its satisfactory completion, it is his responsibility to assure compliance with all applicable safety provisions of the code and regulations issued thereunder, including those relating to the manner in which the independent contractor performs operative details of the work not affecting its ultimate result.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\u201cWe recognize that an employer-employee relationship in the usual sense is not essential for application of the Labor Code. <em>(Porter </em>v. <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Inc., </em>48 Cal.2d 846, 847-849 [313 P.2d 854].) For example, the code has been applied where an employee of an independent contractor was injured by the dangerous manner in which the defendant owner of the premises operated his machinery <em>(Maia </em>v. <em>Security Lbr. &amp; Concrete Co., </em>160 Cal.App.2d 16, 18 et seq. [324 P.2d 657]), by a dangerous condition existing when the owner turned the premises over to the independent contractor <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>A. Schilling &amp; Co., </em>170 Cal.App.2d 318, 324 [339 P.2d 139]), and by a dangerous condition due to the failure of the owner to complete construction after the area in question had been returned to his control <em>(Atherley </em>v. <em>MacDonald, Young &amp; Nelson, Inc., </em>142 Cal.App.2d 575, 581 et seq. [298 P.2d 700]), as well as where an employee of one subcontractor was injured by the dangerous method in which work was being done by another subcontractor and the defendant general contractor had by agreement authorized the use of the method resulting in injury <em>(Gonzales </em>v. <em>Robert Hiller Constr. Co., </em>179 Cal.App.2d 522, 529 et seq. [3 Cal.Rptr. 832]).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">\u201cNo cases have been found, however, holding that the mere right to see that work is satisfactorily completed imposes upon the one hiring an independent contractor the duty to assure that the contractor\u2019s work is performed in conformity with all safety provisions. To the contrary in <em>Hard </em>v. <em>Hollywood Turf Club, </em>112 Cal.App.2d 263, 266 et seq. [246 P.2d 716], where the defendant general contractor had no relation to a subcontractor\u2019s work other than the right of general supervi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>sion and control, the court held that safety provisions of the code relating to the work done by the subcontractor were not applicable in determining the defendant\u2019s liability and the propriety of this holding was recognized in two of the cases cited above which applied the Labor Code <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>A. Schilling &amp; Co., </em>170 Cal.App.2d 318, 323 [339 P.2d 139]; <em>Atherley </em>v. <em>MacDonald, Young &amp; Nelson, Inc., </em>142 Cal.App.2d 575, 582 [298 P.2d 700]). The opinion in the <em>Hard </em>ease pointed out that to hold in such a situation that a general contractor has the duty of overseeing labor done by various subcontractors, of inspecting the equipment used by them, and of enforcing all applicable safety provisions would be to place an extremely onerous burden upon him.\u201d (57 Cal.2d at pp. 106-107. See, in addition to the eases cited, <em>De Cruz </em>v. <em>Reid </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 217, 228-230 [70 Cal.Rptr. 550, 444 P.2d 342]; <em>Van Arsdale </em>v. <em>Hollinger </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 245, 256-257 [66 Cal.Rptr. 20, 437 P.2d 508]; <em>Markley </em>v. <em>Beagle </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 951, 956-957 [59 Cal.Rptr. 809, 429 P.2d 129]; <em>Alber </em>v. <em>Owens </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 790, 792 [59 Cal.Rptr. 117, 427 P.2d 781]; <em>Woolen </em>v. <em>Aerojet General Corp. </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 407, 412-413 [20 Cal.Rptr. 12, 369 P.2d 708]; <em>O\u2019Melia </em>v. <em>California Production Service, Inc. </em>(1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 618, 625 [68 Cal.Rptr. 125]; <em>Freire </em>v. <em>Imperial Irr.

Kress Co. </em>(1959) 168 Cal.App.2d 365, 368 [335 P.2d 952, 337 P.2d 163]; Brooks, <em>Tort Liability of Owners and General Contractors for On-the-Job Injuries to Workmen </em>(1965) 13 U.C.L.A. L.Rev. 99, 116-123; Note, <em>Duties of General Contractor Under the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number><em>California Labor Code </em>(1964) 13 Hastings L.J. 604, 606-613; and Wolfe, <em>Determination of Employer-Employee Relationships in Social Legislation </em>(1941) 41 Colum.L.Rev. 1015.)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">None of the foregoing cases deal particularly with the status of the lessee-operator of the service station in the dual role of an independent contractor and statutory \u201cemployee\u201d of the lessor-supplier. There are many cases dealing with the question of the relationship insofar as the responsibility of the lessor-supplier for the acts or omissions of the lessee-operator are concerned, and insofar as there is an employment relationship which makes the former responsible for furnishing the latter workmen\u2019s compensation unemployment insurance, or other benefits. (See Annotations, Status of Gasoline and Oil Distributor, etc. (1962) 83 A.L.R.2d 1282, 1292-1303; and (1938) 116 A.L.R. 457, 470-473.) Numerous eases in these and other fields have been referred to and examined.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Preliminarily, it may be noted that the precedents concerning the respective right and obligation of the parties with respect to workmen\u2019s compensation benefits are not eontrol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>ling in this ease. It was agreed and the court instructed the jury, that the plaintiff was an independent contractor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Both parties are bound by that stipulation. (See <em>Pobor </em>v. <em>Western Pac. R.R. </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 314, 320 [11 Cal.Rptr. 106, 359 P.2d 474]; <em>Goodwins. Wolpe </em>(1966) 240 Cal.App.2d 874, 878-879 [50 Cal.Rptr. 55]; <em>Seckler </em>v. <em>Yamin, supra, </em>212 Cal.App.2d 67, 70.) The compensation cases, however, and, as well, the cases involving the liability of the lessor-supplier for the negligence of the lessee-operator, do focus attention on the question of control, and furnish analogies helpful to the determination of the question of direction, management, control or custody of any . . . place of employment . . .\u201d as raised by the provisions of section 6304 of the Labor Code, and elaborated on in <em>Kuntz </em>(57 Cal.2d at pp. 106-107) and <em>Woolen </em>(57 Cal.2d at pp. 412-413) and related cases set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">Defendant asserts that the eases under Labor Code section 6304 are limited to situations where the injured party was an employee of a subcontractor, or supplier, on the job, and that here the lessee-operator himself was not the division 4 (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3351) \u201cemployee\u201d of anyone. The fact that the lessee-operator was himeslf responsible for maintaining a safe place of employment will not necessarily defeat his right as against one who owes him a similar duty of care. (See <em>Alber </em>v. <em>Owens, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d 790, 793-799; <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Case, supra, </em>220 Cal.App.2d 170, 180-181; and discussion of contributory negligence, <em>infra. </em>Cf. <em>Souza </em>v. <em>Pratico, supra, </em>245 Cal.App.2d 651, 659-662, with <em>Conner </em>v. <em>Utah Constr. &amp; Min. Co., supra, </em>231 Cal.App.2d 263, 276-277.)  The duty of maintain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>ing a safe place of employment, if established, may run to members of the general public as well as to employees of some one on the job site. <em>(Porter </em>v. <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; co., Inc. </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 846, 847-849 [313 P.2d 854]; and see <em>Graves </em>v. <em>William J. Nicolson Co. </em>(1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 865, 867-869 [43 Cal.Rptr. 885]; and <em>Gaw V. McKanna, supra, </em>228 Cal.App.2d 348, 352-353.) In <em>Sechler </em>v. <em>Yamin, supra, </em>212 Cal.App.2d 67, the plaintiff was apparently a sole proprietor acting as an independent contractor. Nevertheless, the court held the defendant general contractor liable for failure to furnish him a safe place of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In <em>Graves, supra, </em>the court observed, \u201c. . . . the existence of industrial hazards and the presence of workmen in various areas on a project in which many employers may be involved are not dependent on contractual relationships, and no more should be the duty to take necessary safety precautions. In <em>Chance </em>v. <em>Lawry\u2019s Inc., </em>58 Cal.2d 368, 378-379 [24 Cal.Rptr. 209, 374 P.2d 185], our Supreme Court held that the traditional legal classifications of invitee, licensee, and trespasser should not be used where recovery is sought from persons other than the landowner, and that an independent contractor has a duty to use reasonable care to prevent injury to all persons whom he may reasonably expect to be affected by his work.\u201d (233 Cal.App.2d at pp. 870-871.) More recently in <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Christian </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 108 [70 Cal.Rptr. 97, 443 P.2d 561], the court has rejected traditional classifications insofar as the occupier of land is concerned. It concluded, \u201cThe proper test to be applied to the liability of 'the possessor of land in accordance with section 1714 of the Civil Code is whether in the management of his property he has acted as a reasonable man in view of the probability of injury to others, and, although the plaintiff\u2019s status as a trespasser, licensee, or invitee may in the light of the facts giving rise to such status have some bearing on the question of liability, the status is not determinative.\u201d (69 Cal.2d at p. 119.)  It follows that any designation of the relationship of the parties in this action as lessor and lessee, owner and operator, seller and purchaser, or supplier and independent com-tractor should not be conclusive in establishing the duty of care on either party. The question of whether one in the defendant\u2019s relationship to the business conducted by plaintiff has a duty to furnish a safe place of employment affects not only the lessee-operator, but his employees and the members of the public whom he serves. The question remains, did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>the defendant as lessor-supplier under the terms of the lease and sales agreement, and by engaging in practices which were developed over the years, retain such control over the manner in which plaintiff conducted his business so as to be a \u201cperson having direction, management, control or custody of . . . [that] place of employment, . . (Lab. Code, \u00a7 6304.)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Plaintiff and amici curiae point to the following facts and circumstances as establishing that defendant\u2019s control of plaintiff\u2019s premises and business made it responsible under the statutory policy. The lease and agreement of sale were interrelated. Each would automatically terminate upon termination or cancellation of the other. Plaintiff could not transfer his rights under either instrument without the consent of defendant. The agreement required plaintiff to take a minimum amount of defendant\u2019s products annually and limited the amount which defendant was bound to supply him. It reserved to the defendant the right to fix from time to time the prices for its products. The failure of plaintiff \u201cto perform strictly any of the obligations imposed\u201d by the agreement would give the defendant the right to terminate the agreement and presumably, with it, the lease. The rental provided in the lease was a fixed sum, plus fixed rates applicable to the gallonage delivered to the station. The plaintiff\u2019s use of the premises was restricted to \u201cthe operation of a gasoline service station, including the sale of petroleum products and automobile accessories,\u201d and he was prohibited from using them \u201cfor a parking lot, garage or repair shop (minor repairs and adjustments to motor vehicles excepted), or for the sale or rental of motor vehicles, trailers, machinery, appliances, tools or other equipment (except automobile equipment, accessories, or appliances). ...\u201d He could not place \u201csigns which do not relate to the business conducted thereon,\u201d on the premises. He was required to keep the station \u201copen for business and properly illuminated\u201d between the hours of 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. on 365 days of the year, and not to \u201csuffer or permit the said premises to be vacant or unattended for any period in excess of 48 hours.\u201d Plaintiff could \u201cmake no change, alteration or substitution in the demised premises, buildings or equipment\u201d without the prior written consent of defendant. In addition to usual causes for the termination of a tenancy, the lease provided for termination of the lease by defendant if the premises were closed or unattended for any period in excess of 48 hours, or for any other breach of the terms and covenants of the lease, or in the event of the death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>of the lessee. In the event of condemnation any and all interest, which might otherwise be attributed to plaintiff as lessee, was deemed to be assigned to defendant. As indicated above, the defendant, despite the terms of the lease, assumed the responsibility for all but minor repairs to the equipment. The record shows that prior to the accident, the defendant planned to remodel the station and install new equipment. (These plans were carried out by defendant in the spring of 1965 after plaintiff had terminated his tenancy.) The defendant\u2019s consignee-distributor testified that he spoke for defendant when dealing with the dealers; that he had the authority to order repairs for any equipment in a station and to commit the defendant to pay for them; that it was his duty to supervise the stations with respect to maintenance\u2014to \u201csee that the places were kept clean and in operable condition.\u201d Plaintiff testified that defendant\u2019s representative made him take competitor\u2019s products off the shelf; and instructed him he could not buy from other companies; that he could use no name other than defendant\u2019s on the station; that defendant attempted, unsuccessfully, to have him lower the retail price he charged for gasoline; and that he was instructed to clean up the premises. The testimony of plaintiff\u2019s accountant indicated that the bulk of the gross receipts from sales of the service station went to defendant\u2014ranging from $22,637 for the incomplete year 1964 to almost $30,000 in 1960; that the largest deduction, almost half of the expense, deducted from gross profit was rent paid to defendant; that plaintiff\u2019s net profit over a seven-year period ranged from a high of about $3,000 to a low of $209 for that portion of 1964 in which he was in business; and that defendant obtained the majority of the expenses and almost all of the costs of sales that were paid out in connection with the operation of the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Plaintiff and amici curiae contend that the facts which have been recited indicate that plaintiff is in no different position than an employee in a managerial capacity, and that the controls retained by the defendant should be attended by a commensurate responsibility to provide a safe place of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">On the other hand, defendant insists that since plaintiff was an independent contractor, it had no control over the details of the methods whereby plaintiff marketed its product to the ultimate consumers; and that since as lessor-supplier it did no more with respect to the work of plaintiff, as lessee-operator, than exercise general supervision and control to bring about a satisfactory exploitation and sale of its products, it had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>responsibility for the manner in which the plaintiff performed the operative details of the work. (Cf. <em>Kuntz </em>v <em>Del. E. Webb Constr. Co., supra, </em>57 Cal.2d at p. 106.) Defendant refers to the fact that the lease and agreement of sale left plaintiff free to fix his own retail prices, and did not dictate the manner in which he should operate the station. He was free to hire his own employees on such terms as he desired. The principal supervision to which plaintiff referred was \u201cthey didn\u2019t exactly tell me what to do, but, especially when the big wheels [supervisors from Texaco] come along they wanted me to clean up, you know, and take off. \u2019 \u2019 Apparently no one ever visited the station other than the consignee-distributor or the truck drivers on the monthly or semi-monthly delivery. The plaintiff never even saw any supervisor pass by. According to the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses the local representatives did no more than deliver oil and other products. Plaintiff\u2019s wife testified that she had never heard defendant\u2019s representative tell plaintiff how to run his business; that plaintiff received no wages from defendant; that he arranged for an employee to relieve him, and compensated him by offsetting his wages against credit extended for gasoline; that he purchased his own supplies and utilities, and kept his own books; that he retained the net profits from the business for his own use and \u201cenjoyed being in business for himself.\u201d She indicated that he was \u201can operator\u201d for defendant because he could not sell anything other than defendant\u2019s products, but she acknowledged that other oils could be carried if not prominently exhibited, and that noncompetitive products were handled and sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Defendant\u2019s consignee-distributor testified that all he was supposed to do in supervising the stations with respect to maintenance, was to see that the places were kept clean and in operable condition; that it was not his duty to inspect the equipment at the stations under his authority; that he would not know what needed to be repaired or whether the operator could repair it himself; and that in working along with a lessee of the station to keep it in repair he would rely on the lessee to tell him what the difficulties were.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">The evidence recited does not establish, as a matter of law, that defendant should be relieved of any responsibility as a statutory \u201cemployer.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nor does this evidence require that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>defendant be deemed responsible under the statutes for maintaining a safe place of employment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On the evidence before the court, the question was one of fact and should have been presented to the jury. (See <em>De Cruz </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>254 Cal.App.2d 380, 382 [61 Cal.Rptr. 925]; <em>West </em>v. <em>Guy F. Atkinson supra, </em>69 Cal.2d 217, 228; <em>Van Arsdale </em>v. <em>Hollinger, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 245, 256-257; <em>Souza </em>v. <em>Pratico, supra, </em>245 Cal.App.2d 651, 658, fn. 6; <em>Hardin </em>v. <em>Elvitsky, supra, </em>232 Cal.App.2d 357, 369-370 and 373-374 [42 Cal.Rptr. 748]; and <em>Conner </em>v. <em>Utah Constr. &amp; Min. Co., supra, </em>231 Cal.App.2d 263, 273.) Plaintiff asked no more. (See Instructions Nos. 7, 8 and 9, fn. 4, <em>supra.) </em>It was error to refuse to leave to the trier of fact the question of whether defendant was a statutory \u201cemployer \u2019 \u2019 under a duty to furnish plaintiff a safe place of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Defendant contends that even if the evidence was sufficient to submit the question of liability under the statutory policy to the jury, the instructions offered were incomplete and misleading. It asserts that the instructions were incomplete because they did not contain an explanation, such as is found in the instruction referred to in <em>Souza </em>v. <em>Pratico, supra </em>(245 Cal.App.2d at p. 658, fn. 6; and see <em>Hardin </em>v. <em>Elvitsky, supra, </em>at pp. 371-372), of the conditions which would make defendant an \u201cemployer\u201d as defined in section 6304 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Tabor Code. (See Instruction No. 7, fn. 4, <em>supra.) </em>It also complains that the instructions were defective because they lacked the qualifying language found in BAJI Instruction No. 149.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (See <em>De Cruz </em>v. <em>Reid, supra, </em>69 Cal. 2d 217, 228; <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Inc., supra, </em>48 Cal.2d 846, 847; <em>Hardin </em>v. <em>Elvitsky, supra, </em>232 Cal.App.2d 357, 366; and <em>Dauer </em>v. <em>Aerojet General Corp., supra, </em>224 Cal.App.2d 175, 180-181.) The instructions are also said to be misleading because, if given without qualification, they would impose a similar duty on plaintiff in his capacity of employer of his relief man, and thereby confuse the issue of contributory negligence to plaintiff\u2019s prejudice. (See <em>Alter </em>v. <em>Owens, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d 790, 799, and discussion of contributory negligence, <em>infra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u201cIt is not error for a trial court to refuse a proposed instruction which is incomplete or misleading. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Pobor </em>v. <em>Western Pac. R. R. Co., supra, </em>55 Cal.2d 314, 324. See also <em>Menchaca </em>v. <em>Helms Bakeries, Inc. </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 535, 543 [67 Cal.Rptr. 775, 439 P.2d 903]; <em>Graves </em>v. <em>William J. Nicolson Co., supra, </em>233 Cal.App.2d 865, 869-870; and <em>Hardin </em>v. <em>Elvitsky, supra, </em>232 Cal.App.2d 357, 372.) The objections to the form of the instructions raised by defendant, however, are not substantial. If it desired further explanation of the term \u201cemployer\u201d as used in the statute under consideration it could have proposed its own instruction. The question of whether instructions should have been given on the subject of excuse or justification, and on the qualification of the application of the prescribed duty of care to the injured party was never reached. The situation is governed by the principle enunciated in <em>Menchaca, supra, </em>as follows: \u201cThe instant instruction, however, so far as it went, correctly and accurately stated the rule. The omission should not have been misleading; common knowledge tells us that horns should not be sounded unnecessarily and indiscriminately. Plaintiffs were not required to cover in their requested instructions each and every point favorable to defendant. If defendant had decided that further instruction about the statute would have been helpful, it could have submitted such an instruction. [Citations.] \u201d (68 Cal.2d at p. 543.)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>The offered instructions with respect to the safety orders (see Instructions Nos. 17, 18 and 19, <em>supra, </em>fn. 4) should also be considered with respect to the general duties of defendant, who, as a lessor, is in the position of an owner of the premises.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The jury was instructed that \u201cplaintiff was a tenant occupying premises leased from the defendant landlord at the time of the alleged accident\u201d that the defendant as landlord would not be liable for injury resulting from an unsafe condition of which the plaintiff had notice or which would have come to his attention by inspection.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> They were told that it was a question of fact whether plaintiff or defendant had a duty to repair; that if the duty was on the landlord it was not obligated to make repairs until a reasonable time after notice from the tenant, or after receiving constructive notice of the defect; and that if the repairs were undertaken by the landlord, whether it was obligated to do so or not, it had a duty to exercise ordinary care in effecting the repairs.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>last rule was qualified by statements that the tenant could not recover if the dangerous condition resulting from the negligent repairs was patent.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court also instructed the jury that due care was necessary in the performance of a duty voluntarily undertaken.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">These instructions suggest, although, since proposed by defendant, they do not stress the general obligations owed by a landlord to his tenant. (See 2 Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7\u00a7355, 356, 357, 358 and 362.)  A latent defect may result from the violation of a safety order. <em>(Holliday </em>v. <em>Greene </em>(1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 482, 487-490 [53 Cal.Rptr. 267]; and see <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. Inc., supra, </em>48 Cal.2d 846, 850; <em>Hardin </em>v. <em>Elvitsky, supra, </em>232 Cal.App.2d 357, 370; and <em>Longway </em>v. <em>McCall </em>(1960) 181 Cal.App.2d 723, 729-731 [5 Cal.Rptr. 818]; but cf. <em>Kolstad </em>v. <em>Ghidotty </em>(1963) 212 Cal.App.2d 228, 232-233 [28 Cal.Rptr. 123].)  Under the circumstances of this ease the trier of fact could have found that the defendant, as the owner of a place which would be used as a place of employment by its prospective tenant and his employees (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 8, \u00a7\u00a73200 and 3202), delivered to its lessee possession of premises which were latently dangerous in that they had a compressor which lacked a guard as required by safety regulations. Furthermore, if the trier of fact found that defendant had the duty to repair, it was entitled to consider whether defendant had effected the repairs with due care. It could find that it was not due care to repair the compressed air system in an ostensible place of employment without placing a proper guard on the compressor.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Under these circumstances it was error to not amplify the instructions on the standard of care between landlord and tenant by reference to the safety orders. The determination of whether the errors exposed were prejudicial necessitates further analysis after review of plaintiff\u2019s other contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\n<em>Assumption of Risk</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Plaintiff contends that the court erred in instructing the jury on the principle of assumption of risk.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In <em>Hardin </em>v. <em>Elvitsky, supra, </em>this court noted, \u201cIt is the established rule in California that the doctrine of assumption of risk is inapplicable where the action is based on a violation of a safety law intended to protect a class, of which the plaintiff is a member, against the very risk he is claimed to have assumed. <em>(Atherley </em>v. <em>McDonald, Young &amp; Nelson, Inc., supra, </em>142 Cal.App.2d 575, 587; <em>Bickham </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Edison Co., </em>120 Cal.App.2d 815, 823-824 [263 P.2d 32]; <em>Longway </em>v. <em>McCall, supra, </em>181 Cal.App.2d 723, 732.) This rule has been applied specifically to the safety orders herein involved. <em>(Maia </em>v. <em>Security Lbr. &amp; Concrete Co., </em>160 Cal.App.2d 16, 20 [324 P.2d 657].)\u201d (232 Cal.App.2d at p. 377. See also <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Case, supra, </em>220 Cal.App.2d 170, 177; and <em>Seckler </em>v. <em>Yamin, supra, </em>212 Cal.App.2d 67, 69.) The propriety of the instruction depends on whether liability is to be predicated upon breach of the law and safety orders, or whether liability is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>predicated upon the common law relationship of landlord and tenant and an accompanying agreement to repair. (See <em>Hardin </em>v. <em>Elvitsky, supra, </em>at pp. 377-378.) It may be assumed that it was error to fail to give a qualified instruction along with the requested instructions first reviewed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\n<em>Contributory Negligence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s contention that the court erred in instructing the jury with respect to contributory negligence<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> cannot be sustained. Plaintiff contends that there was wilful and wanton misconduct which bars the assertion of this defense. The eases upon which plaintiff relies are those in which the doctrine of last clear chance has been equated with wilful misconduct so as to impose liability in spite of the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s negligence put him in a position of peril. (See <em>Girdner </em>v. <em>Union Oil Co. </em>(1932) 216 Cal. 197, 202 [13 P.2d 915]; <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Ry. Co. </em>(1903) 140 Cal. 514, 522-523 [74 P. 15, 98 Am. St. Rep. 85, 63 L.R.A. 238]; <em>Esrey </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co. </em>(1894) 103 Cal. 541, 544-545 [37 P. 500]; and <em>Cawog </em>v. <em>Rothbaum </em>(1958) 165 Cal.App.2d 577, 591-592 [331 P.2d 1063].) No such circumstances are present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Although violation of a safety order may be such wilful misconduct as may make an immediate employer liable for extra compensation (see <em>Chick </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1951) 107 Cal.App.2d 292, 295 [237 P.2d 8]), it does not bar the defense of contributory negligence. In <em>Alber </em>v. <em>Owens, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d 790, the court ruled, \u201c. . . whether liability for failure to provide a safe place to work is predicated upon the common law duty or the statutory duty, the defense of contributory negligence is available to defendants. <em>(Mason </em>v. <em>Case </em>(1963) 220 Cal.App.2d 170, 177-179 [33 Cal.Rptr; 710]; <em>Mula </em>v. <em>Meyer </em>(1955) 132 Cal.App.2d 279, 284-285 [282 P.2d 107].)\u201d (66 Cal.2d at p. 792, footnote omitted.) That case also establishes, as pertinent to the relationship which existed in this ease, that the fact the injured party was also one who was charged with a duty to furnish a safe place of employment will not make him contributorily negligent as a matter of law. <em>(Id., </em>pp. 793-799.) The opinion concludes: \u201c. . . we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>reject the argument that plaintiff-employee\u2019s actions must be judged by the rigorous standards imposed on him by statute in his capacity as an employer. They are primarily for the protection of those who serve under him. We hold that his actions relevant to his own protection must be judged by the common law standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u201cIn order to bar an injured employee from recovery, therefore, a negligent employer must show that the employee acted in a manner unreasonable under the circumstances. [Citations.]\u2019\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>p. 799. See also <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Case, supra, </em>220 Cal.App.2d at pp. 177-179 and 180-181.) There was no error in leaving the issue of contributory negligence to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\n<em>Reasonable Necessity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Plaintiff offered an instruction taken verbatim from <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Riverside Portland Cement Co. </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 225 at page 239 [282 P.2d 69], on the subject of the rule of reasonable necessity as it may lessen the amount of caution required of a workman for his own care. (See also <em>Fry </em>v. <em>Sheedy </em>(1956) 143 Cal.App.2d 615, 627 [300 P.2d 242]; and <em>Mula </em>v. <em>Meyer, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.2d 279, 285-286.) The court did instruct the jury in accordance with another instruction offered by plaintiff which contains substantially all of the language found in <em>Austin.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>A comparison of the two reveals no material deletion, and indicates that the giving of the instruction which was refused would have been for the most part repetitious. Under these circumstances no error can be predicated upon the failure to give the proffered instruction.  \u201cThe law is clear that instructions on points which have been sufficiently covered by other instructions may properly be refused although they are correctly drawn and applicable to the evidence. [Citations.]  \u2018A party is not entitled to have the jury instructed in any particular phraseology, and may not complain on the ground that his requested instructions are refused if the court, of its own motion or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>otherwise, correctly announces the substance of the law applicable to the case. [Citation.] \u2019 <em>(Luis </em>v. <em>Cavin </em>(1948) 88 Cal.App.2d 107, 115 [198 P.2d 563]; [further citations omitted] .) \u201d <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept, of Public Works </em>v. <em>Wasserman </em>(1966) 240 Cal.App.2d716, 736 [50 Cal.Rptr. 95].)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\n<em>Forgetfulness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The plaintiff offered an instruction on forgetfulness in language found in <em>Austin, supra, </em>44 Cal.2d at pages 236237. (See also <em>Kingery </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Edison Co., supra, </em>190 Cal.App.2d 625, 636-637, particularly fn. 3 and p. 638.) The trial court gave but one sentence from the instruction offered.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The first part of the instruction merely served to place the principle upon which plaintiff desired to rely in focus with this particular case. This result could be obtained by argument and plaintiff was not entitled to have the court\u2019s assistance in enunciating a formula. The second part reiterates the principle that the standard of care must depend on the circumstances, a principle further enunciated in the general instructions on negligence which were given. (See BAJI (1967 Pocket Parts) Instruction No. 101 (Revised) second par. and former Instruction No. 101-A, first par.) the remaining language indicates matters of general information which are not principles of law, but more appropriately the subject of argument and application to the particular facts of the case at hand. No error is found in the action of the court in modifying and condensing this instruction. (See <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept, of Public Works </em>v. <em>Wasserman, supra, </em>240 Cal.App.2d 716, 736.)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">\n<em>Prejudice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">\u201c No judgment shall be set aside, or new trial granted, in any cause, on the ground of misdirection of the jury, or of the improper admission or rejection of evidence, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>for any error as to any matter of pleading, or for any error as to any matter of procedure, unless, after an examination of the entire cause, including the evidence, the court shall be of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.\u2019\u2019 (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a713; and see former art. VI, \u00a7 4%.) It is, therefore, necessary to examine the entire record to determine if the errors in the misdirections of the jury resulted in a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The evidence points to the contributory negligence of the plaintiff. Each witness familiar with the machinery in some way recognized the danger involved in starting the compressor and motor mechanism by hand. Plaintiff\u2019s alleged ignorance of danger is qualified by his admitted knowledge that his friends had suffered close calls. He was caught in discrepancies between his testimony on the stand and that in his deposition concerning the manner in which he operated the mechanism customarily, and on the occasion when he suffered his injuries. There is also a serious question of whether the safety regulations were violated\u2014the mechanism was enclosed in a box. More fundamentally, on the issue of proximate cause, it is questionable whether a safety guard would have prevented plaintiff and others from undertaking to start the mechanism manually, or merely increased the hazard.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Moreover, the evidence fails to show that defendant ever knew that the motor had to be started manually, as distinguished from knowing that it had to be kept running because of a leak in the system.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Although none of these issues can be resolved against plaintiff as a matter of law, it is concluded on the whole record that there is no reasonable probability that a retrial would result in a plaintiff\u2019s verdict. \u201cIt is not necessary to find contributory negligence as a matter of law in order to affirm the judgment.\u201d <em>(Mason </em>v. <em>Case, supra, </em>220 Cal.App.2d 170, 183.

[Citations.] \u201d (217 Cal.App.2d at pp. 873-874. See also <em>Butigan </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co. </em>(1958) 49 Cal.2d 652, 660-661 [320 P.2d <em>500]; Fry </em>v. <em>Sheedy, supra, </em>143 Cal.

If the plaintiff was eontributively negligent it would be immaterial whether the defendant was negligent because of breach of duty as a landlord or because of breach of duty as a statutory \u201cemployer.\u201d Although the duties of a statutory \u201cemployer\u201d may be greater than those imposed by common law (see <em>Souza </em>v. <em>Pratico, supra, </em>245 Cal.App.2d 651, 657), contributory negligence is, as has been determined above, a defense to either form of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">In this case, \u201cThe evidence on the subject of contributory negligence is not close; rather it is heavily weighted against plaintiff\u201d (see <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Case, supra, </em>at p. 183). Moreover, the record indicates that .the jury found the plaintiff contributorily negligent. In <em>Borenkraut </em>v. <em>Whitten, supra, </em>56 Cal.2d 538, the court considered an unauthorized comment on the verdict \u201cto the effect that the verdict was predicated upon a finding that defendants were \u2018not guilty of negligence.\u2019 \u201d (56 Cal.2d at p. 542.) The court concluded that under such circumstances there was no prejudicial error in giving an unwarranted instruction on contributory negligence. <em>(Id., </em>pp. 543-544. See also <em>Gillespie </em>v. <em>Rawlings </em>(1957) 49 Cal.2d 359, 368-369 [317 P.2d 601]; and <em>McKay </em>v. <em>Hedger </em>(1934) 139 Cal.App. 266, 278 [34 P.2d 221] for examples of conclusions drawn from the verdict of the jury.) Here the jury requested rereading of the instructions on contributory negligence,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>and then immediately returned with a unanimous verdict for the defendant. That action not only manifests that the jury resolved the issue of contributory negligence against the plaintiff, but also, suggests that in order to reach that issue, they had resolved the issue of negligence against the defendant. The erroneous failure of the court to instruct on the safe place of employment theory of liability could not be prejudicial if the jury found the defendant negligent as a landlord with a duty to repair. If the negligence of the defendant was established \u201cthe safety order gilds the lily; it belabors the obvious. So far as the ease turns on [defendants] . . . negligence, the safety order adds nothing.\u201d <em>(Mason </em>v. <em>Case, supra, </em>220 Cal.App.2d at p. 181; see also <em>Kramer </em>v. <em>Ferguson </em>(1964) 230 Cal.App.2d 237, 246 [41 Cal.Rptr. 61].)</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">There remains for consideration the question of whether the unqualified use of the assumption of risk instructions prejudiced the plaintiff. In the absence of the recorded request from the jury, this court would be hesitant to speculate upon the basis of the verdict and the probability that it was based on an erroneous instruction. (See <em>Vistica </em>v. <em>Presbyterian Hospital </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 465, 471 [62 Cal.Rptr. 577, 432 P.2d 193].) With the jury\u2019s inquiry and action in the record, and the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence being what it is, the misdirection of the jury was not prejudicial and did not result in a miscarriage of justice. The plaintiff has had his day in court on the issue of his contributory negligence, and there is no reasonable probability that a retrial would result in a verdict in his favor. (See <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Case, supra, </em>at pp. 183-184.)</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The purported appeal from the order denying plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial is dismissed, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Molinari, P.

He reasserts his claim that it was error to refuse to give the instructions which he offered on this theory. Examination of the new authorities cited reveals that in order to sustain a finding of wilful and wanton misconduct there must be knowledge of the dangerous operation or condition and some inference of deliberate choice in the failure to rectify it. As pointed out in the opinion, there is no evidence to show that the defendant had any knowledge that anyone was going inside the boxed mechanism to start the compressor engine. On the facts, the court properly refused the offered instructions, and the issue of contributory negligence was not foreclosed, conditionally or unconditionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Rehearing denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied November 20,1968.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-11\">The record reflects that the lessor-supplier holds its interest in the property under a lease from the owners, who appeared as defendants and cross-complainants in the action.

If such unsafe condition, if any, has come to plaintiff\u2019s attention or would have if he had made such an inspection and exercised ordinary care in doing so, the tenant may not hold the landlord liable for injury resulting from it.

If when entitled to that assumption and relying on it, but not otherwise, the tenant suffers injury from an unsafe condition resulting from the landlord\u2019s negligence in connection with such work, such negligence is actionable. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The instructions read: \"The rule just stated may be put in another way.

Nevertheless, the record contained evidence, which has been referred to above, concerning the use of guards on such machinery and that practice was therefore before the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b127-8\">It is suggested that the court erred in rereading the instructions because it did not reread the instructions on reasonable necessity (see fn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>17, <em>supra), </em>or forgetfulness (see fn. 18, <em>supra). </em>The instructions reread did include that portion of the definition of negligence which makes the actor\u2019s conduct dependent on the circumstances. (See BAJI (1967 Pocket Part), Instruction No. 101 (rev.) second par.; and former Instruction No. 101-A, first par.) At the conclusion of the rereading the court suggested that there might be other instructions in which the jurors were interested, and received a negative response from the foreman. Plaintiff did not direct the court\u2019s attention to or request the further instructions. Under these circumstances there was no cognizable error. <em>(Pittman </em>v. <em>Boiven </em>(1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 207, 219-220 [57 Cal.Rptr. 319]; and see <em>Mula </em>v. <em>Meyer </em>(1955) 132 Cal.App.2d 279, 286 [282 P.2d 107]; but cf. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Erickson </em>(1960) 53 Cal.2d 860, 863-864 [3 Cal.Rptr. 567, 350 P.2d 535].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
