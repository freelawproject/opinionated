To <em>observe </em>from a hidden area that which is open to public view does not constitute an unreasonable <em>search.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">\u201cIt has been consistently held that it is proper to receive testimony of police officers as to their observation of acts of sexual perversion through hidden peepholes looking into a public men\u2019s rest room where the acts were committed in the open area of the room and would have been in plain view of anyone entering. ...\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>256 Cal.App.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>488, 494 [64 Cal.Rptr. <em>70]; People </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>240 Cal. App.2d 812, 813-814 [50 Cal.Rptr. <em>45]; People </em>v. <em>Hensel, </em>233 Cal.App.2d 834, 836 [43 Cal.Rptr. 865] (hearing denied); <em>People </em>v. <em>Young, </em>214 Cal.App.2d 131, 133-135 [29 Cal.Rptr. 492] (hearing denied<em>) </em>and <em>People </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>209 Cal.App.2d 173,174-177 [25 Cal.Rptr. 676] (hearing denied).)</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Appellant recognizes that it is not the province of an intermediate appellate court to \u201coverrule\u201d the explicit holdings of prior decisions in which our highest court has repeatedly denied petitions for hearing. Rather, he argues that \u201cThe modification<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by [the above cited decisions of] the <em>Bielicki </em>case <em>[Bielicki </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>57 Cal.2d 602 (21 Cal.Rptr. 552, 371 P.2d 288)] because a door was removed from toilets and thus it was a place that was investigated, not the privacy of the person, has now been altered by the <em>Katz </em>case <em>[Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347 (19 L.Ed.2d 576, 88 S.Ct. 507)].\u201d Our reading of the decision in <em>Katz </em>requires us to reject such contention. The specific language of <em>Katz </em>on which the argument is founded is as follows (pages 581-582 [19 L.Ed.2d]) : \u201cBecause of the misleading way the issues have been formulated, the parties have attached great significance to the characterization of the telephone booth from which the petitioner placed his calls. The petitioner has strenuously argued that the booth was a \u2018constitutionally protected area.\u2019 The Government has maintained with equal vigor that it was not. But this effort to decide whether or not a given \u2018area,\u2019 viewed <em>in the abstract, </em>is \u2018constitutionally protected\u2019 deflects attention from the problem presented by this case. For the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places. <em>What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection. </em>[Citations.] But what he seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected. [Citations.]</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">\"The Government stresses the fact that the telephone booth from which the petitioner made his calls was constructed partly of glass, so that he was as visible after he entered it as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>he would have been if he had remained outside. <em>But what he sought to exclude when he entered the tooth was not the intruding eye\u2014it was the uninvited ear. </em>He did not shed his right to do so simply because he made his calls from a place <em>where he might he seen. </em>No less than an individual in a business office, in a friend\u2019s apartment, or in a taxicab, a person in a telephone booth may rely upon the protection of the Fourth Amendment. One who occupies it, <em>shuts the door </em>behind him, and pays the toll that permits him to place a call, is surely entitled to assume <em>that the words he utters </em>into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">It appears manifest that the teaching of <em>Katz </em>offers further support to the holding of the California decisions, cited <em>supra, </em>rather than weakening them.  The test is not whether a <em>place, </em>in this instance one containing toilet facilities, is to be regarded as a sanctuary in the abstract, but rather whether the conduct and reasonable expectations of the <em>person </em>utilizing such a <em>place </em>entitles him to freedom from judicially unauthorized surveillance. \u201cIf a defendant conducts his activities under circumstances indicating an indifference to public observation, he cannot object if the observer is a policeman.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Aguilar, </em>232 Cal.App.2d 173, 177 [42 Cal. Rptr. 666].)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">This point finds further explicit recognition in Justice Harlan\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Katz </em>wherein he observed at pages 587-588 [19 L.Ed.2d] : \u201cAs the Court\u2019s opinion states, \u2018The Fourth Amendment protects people, not places.\u2019 The question, however, is what protection it affords to those people. Generally, as here, the answer to that question requires reference to a \u2018place.\u2019 My understanding of the rule that has emerged from prior decisions is that there is a twofold requirement, first that a person have exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy and, second, that the expectation be one that society is prepared to recognize as \u2018 reasonable.' Thus a man's home is, for most purposes, a place where he expects privacy, but objects, activities, or statements that he exposes to the \u2018plain view\u2019 of outsiders are not \u2018protected\u2019 because no intention to keep them to himself has been exhibited. On the other hand, conversations in the open would not be protected against being overheard, for the expectation of privacy under the circumstances would be unreasonable. [Citation.] \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>In what is apparently an attempt to avoid the application of the foregoing principles to his specific conduct, appellant urges that because the nature of his act was such that he stood inside the open stall facing his seated co-participant, he thereby partially obscured the public\u2019s view of the prohibited action in which they were engaged. This, he argues, manifested his desire for privacy. With the exception of those who intentionally commit acts of indecent exposure, it may well be that persons who engage in various forms of prohibited sexual perversion would prefer that their conduct escape detection by anyone and certainly by the police. This hope, however, is common to nearly all participants in criminal enterprises. To date it has not been deemed worthy of constitutional protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Appellant\u2019s contention regarding the extent of his probationary term is without merit. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203a.) However, as the Attorney General concedes, the fine imposed does exceed the maximum provided by the statute governing the offense of which appellant was convicted. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 415.)</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The fine imposed is reduced from $250 to $200 and, as thus amended, the order granting probation is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Roth, P. J., and Fleming, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-11\">The parties stipulated that for purposes of this proceeding, Penal Code section 415 might be deemed a lesser offense included within the dime defined by Penal Code section 288a with which appellant was charged. Such stipulation is equivalent to an informal amendment of the information to include a charge which was supported by the evidence although not set forth in the original information filed herein. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Hensei, </em>233 Cal.App.2d 834, 838-840 [43 Cal.Rptr. 865].) Appellant does not contend to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b780-7\">We reject, of course, the assertion that the cited appellate court decisions were, or could possibly be, \u201cmodifications\u201d of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bielicki. </em>They are entirely consistent with <em>Bielicki </em>and did no more than refuse to \u2018 \u2018 modify \u201d it by extending its scope to circumstances to which it was not applicable. Likewise, in <em>Britt </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>58 Cal.2d 469 [24 Cal.Rptr. 849, 374 P.2d 817], emphasis was given to the fact that the toilet booth was so constructed that it provided a reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
