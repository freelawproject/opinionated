J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeI\">The plaintiff Employers\u2019 Surplus Lines Insurance Company (hereinafter designated by the name Employers\u2019 Surplus) sought a declaratory judgment as to its rights and duties and the respective rights and duties of other insurance companies under policies of insurance issued to the defendant Crescent Wharf &amp; Warehouse Co. (hereinafter designated by the name Crescent Wharf), a corporation engaged in the business of stevedoring.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff Employers\u2019 Surplus has appealed from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">. The nature of the controversy is readily made apparent by the findings of fact. Portions of such findings relating to the claims involved are as follows: (1) Since March 1, 1963, defendant Crescent Wharf has been sued in 30 different suits by means of third-party complaints or cross-complaints asserted against it by the owners of vessels whereon Crescent Wharf was employed for cargo handling and stevedoring services. In each of those suits an employee of Crescent Wharf who was working as a stevedore for Crescent Wharf during the period between March 1, 1963, and July 14, 1964, sued the owner of the vessel for damages for personal injuries sustained by the employee while performing cargo operations on board or about the vessel. Each cross-complaint or third-party complaint of the shipowner against Crescent Wharf was based upon the doctrine of <em>Ryan Co. </em>v. <em>Pan-Atlantic Corp., </em>350 U.S. 124<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> [100 L.Ed. 133, 76 S.Ct. 232], or upon an express indem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>nity agreement between the shipowner and Crescent Wharf. (2) At the time of each accident Crescent Wharf was performing stevedoring services pursuant to agreement between it and the respective shipowner. As stipulated by the parties, the following three claims are examples of the types of agreements under which the stevedoring work was performed by Crescent Wharf in the claims to which reference has been made: (a) The claim of William H. Johnson, injured on May 30, 1963, while performing work under an oral agreement between Crescent Wharf and the shipowner for stevedoring services; (b) The claim of Joe Edwards, injured on April 4, 1963, while performing stevedoring services under a written contract between Crescent Wharf and the shipowner for stevedoring services; (c) The claim of Benjamin Iacono, injured on February 21, 1964, while performing stevedoring services under a written agreement between Crescent Wharf and the shipowner for stevedoring services, which written contract contained an express \u201chold harmless\u201d clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Portions of the findings of fact relating to the insurance contracts issued by Stuyvesant and Employers\u2019 Surplus, respectively, are as follows: (1) On or about March 1, 1963, Stuyvesant issued to Crescent Wharf its public liability and property damage policy which was in effect from March 1, 1963, to and including July 14, 1964. Therein it is stated that the policy is \u201cTo cover the Legal and/or Assumed and/or contractual Liability of Assured for damages, including damages for care and loss of services, because of bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death at any time result<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>ing therefrom, sustained by any person or persons . . . .\u201d The policy limit is stated to be in the sum of $25,000 for any one claim. A further provision of the policy is that \u201cthis insurance is a primary insurance and in the event of any other insurance carried by Assured independently or jointly with others, being applicable, such other insurance to be considered as excess insurance.\u201d It is also provided that the policy does not apply, <em>\u201cexcept with respect to liability assumed under contract, </em>to bodily injury or sickness, disease or death of any employee of the Assured while engaged in the employment of the Assured, or to any obligation for which the Assured or any company as his insurer may be held liable under any Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law.\u201d (Italics added.) A further provision is: \u201cIn all cases involving the Assured\u2019s liability to steamship companys <em>[sic] </em>or others for Bodily Injury to Assured\u2019s Employees: $1,250.00 shall be deducted from the amount of each claim including claims expense.\u201d (2) On or about March 1, 1963, plaintiff Employers\u2019 Surplus issued to Crescent Wharf its excess public liability and property damage policy, which was in effect from March 1, 1963, to and including July 14, 1964. That policy afforded Crescent Wharf excess coverage, over and above the $25,000 limit of the Stuyvesant policy, in the amount of $475,000 for each claim. The Employers\u2019 Surplus policy was intended by the parties to afford coverage for the same risks and for the same claims as was afforded by the primary policy of insurance issued to Crescent Wharf by Stuyvesant. In the Employers\u2019 Surplus policy it is provided that the insurance afforded thereunder \u201cis to pay on behalf of the Assured all sums which the Assured shall become legally obligated to pay, or by final judgment be adjudged to pay, to any person or persons as damages (a) for bodily injury . . . caused by accident occurring during the period mentioned in the Schedule and arising out of such hazards as are set forth in Item 4 of the Schedule and which are also covered by and defined in the policy/ies specified in the Schedule and issued by the \u2018Primary Insurers\u2019 stated therein, including endorsements and amendments attached thereto.\u201d A further provision is that \u201cIn respect of the hazards set forth in Item 4 of the Schedule this Insurance is subject to the same warranties, terms and conditions (except as regards the premium, the obligation to investigate and defend, the renewal agreement (if any), the amount and limits of liability other than the deductible or self-insurance provision where applicable, and except as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>otherwise provided herein) as are contained in or as may be added to the policy/ies of the Primary Insurers prior to the happening of an accident for which claim is made hereunder . ...\u201d An endorsement issued and dated July 15, 1964, but by its terms made effective as of March 1, 1963, provides for the deletion of a prior provision and the substitution therefor of the following provision: \u201c1. This Insurance Does Not Cover: (a) Liability for Bodily Injury to employees of the Assured injured during the course of their employment but <em>this Exclusion does not apply to such liability assumed under any contract </em>(other than a Contract of Employment) <em>as is covered by the policy/ies of the Primary Insurers.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">With respect to the Fireman\u2019s Fund and Pacific Employers policies, respectively, portions of the findings of fact are as follows: (1) On or about August 1, 1962, Fireman\u2019s Fund issued to Crescent Wharf its policy entitled \"Standard Workmen\u2019s Compensation and Employers\u2019 Liability Policy\u201d and concurrently therewith Fireman\u2019s Fund issued to Crescent Wharf another policy covering the liability of Crescent Wharf under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Both policies were in effect during the period of August 1, 1962, to August 1, 1963. The policy relating to the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act contains an endorsement in the following language: \u201cIt is mutually understood and agreed that except as this policy may be otherwise extended by endorsement, no other liability of any nature whatsoever, except as defined by the said Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, is covered hereunder.\u201d That policy contains no endorsement extending its coverage. Under \u201cCoverage B\u201d of the other Fireman\u2019s Fund policy it is provided that the insurer shall \u201cpay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury by accident or disease . . . sustained . . . by any employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of his employment by the insured either in operations in a state designated in Item 3 of the declarations or in operations necessary or incidental thereto.\u201d Under the heading of \u201cExclusions\u201d that policy contains the provision that it does not apply \u201cunder coverage B, to liability assumed by the insured under any contract or agreement.\u201d (2) On or about August 1, 1963, Pacific Employers issued to Crescent Wharf its policy entitled \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation and Employers\u2019 Liability Policy,\u201d which was in effect during the period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>from August 1, 1963, to July 14, 1964. The policy contains provisions which are the same as those set forth hereinabove with respect to the Fireman\u2019s Fund policy entitled \"Standard Workmen\u2019s Compensation and Employers\u2019 Liability Policy.\u201d In addition, embodied in an endorsement to the Pacific Employers policy is the following provision: \u2018 \u2018 The obligations of the Company under paragraph One (b) of the policy are limited to the liability imposed by law upon this Employer for negligence but <em>specifically exclude any liability assumed by this Employer under any contract entered into with any other person, association or </em>organization.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Portions of the conclusions of law of the trial court are that, for the period of March 1, <em>1963, </em>to July 14, 1964, the Stuyvesant policy covers every claim for indemnity made against Crescent Wharf by the owner of a ship for the liability of such owner for damages for injuries suffered by a stevedore employed by Crescent Wharf on or about the ship in the performance of a stevedoring contract between the owner of the ship and Crescent Wharf, whether the contract is oral or \u25a0written, and that the Employers\u2019 Surplus policy constitutes excess insurance over and above the Stuyvesant policy limit of $25,000 for injury to one person with respect to the same risks and claims as are covered by the Stuyvesant policy, except as to costs of defense of any such claim. Other conclusions of law are that neither Fireman\u2019s Fund nor Pacific Employers are, as to their respective policies, under any obligation to furnish a defense for, or to pay, any claim that is covered by the Stuyvesant and Employers\u2019 Surplus policies. Judgment was entered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">On this appeal the position of the plaintiff Employers\u2019 Surplus is that, except for those cases wherein the relationship between Crescent Wharf and the shipowner involved was governed at the time of the accident by a contract containing an express and unequivocal \u201chold harmless\u201d agreement, Employers\u2019 Surplus policy does not afford coverage' to Crescent Wharf. Employers\u2019 Surplus further contends that the policies issued by Fireman\u2019s Fund and Pacific Employers do afford coverage of the nature involved in this case. For reasons which will be stated, the contentions of Employers\u2019 Surplus are untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">As has been noted, the policy of Employers\u2019 Surplus contains a provision that the insurance afforded does not cover liability for bodily injury to employees of Crescent Wharf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>injured during the course of their employment, but it is expressly provided that such exclusion does not apply to <em>such liability assumed under any contract </em>(other than a contract of employment) <em>as is covered by the policy of the primary insurer, </em>As has also been noted hereinabove, the Stuyvesant policy affords coverage as to \u201cliability assumed under contract\u201d with respect to claims involving Crescent Wharf\u2019s liability to shipowners arising out of bodily injury to Crescent Wharf\u2019s employees. The question presented for resolution is what constitutes liability assumed under contract as used in the Stuyvesant and Employers \u2019 Surplus policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The governing law is found in <em>Indemnity Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>California Stevedore &amp; Ballast Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1962) 307 F.2d 513, a case involving liability policies issued to contracting stevedores. The court stated (page 514) : \u201cAnd when longshoremen work aboard vessels they are maritime workers having the benefits of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 901 et <em>seq.; </em>hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Act\u2019). The Act gives longshoremen their exclusive remedy against their employers for any personal injury arising out of their employment. (33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 905.) Therefore a longshoreman cannot sue his employer for personal injuries arising out of his employment. He can, however, sue the owner or operator of the vessel aboard which he was injured.\u201d In that ease, as in the case presently before this court, in actions by the contracting stevedores\u2019 employees against shipowners for damages for bodily injuries sustained while performing stevedore services, the shipowners filed third-party complaints against the contracting stevedores. In each of those actions the employees had performed their services under a written contract between the shipowners and the contracting stevedores.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">In the <em>Indemnity Ins. Co. </em>case the court pointed out that the contracts between the contracting stevedores and the shipowners are maritime contracts which are to be construed in accordance with federal law. The court then stated that, after the reviewing court first decides the terms of such contracts, the question presented is whether the claims asserted by the shipowners against the contracting stevedores are within the coverage of the insurance contracts, that is, whether the contracting stevedores\u2019 liabilities to the shipowners were assumed under a written contract. (307 F.2d, at pages 516-517.) After noting that under the federal law as set forth in <em>By an </em>(see footnote 2 of this opinion) the contracting stevedores\u2019 \u201cwar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>ranties to perform their services in a workmanlike manner were the essence of their contracts with the shipowners,\u201d the court stated (307 F.2d at page 517) : \u201cThus it appears clear that appellees\u2019 [the contracting stevedores\u2019] liabilities to the shipowners were assumed under written contracts. While it may be true that the same liabilities could be imposed under an oral contract, the fact remains that, here, appellees, either as good business or by good fortune, assumed the liabilities to the shipowners under a written contract. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Turning to the question of whether the liabilities imposed upon the contracting stevedores by the shipowners were within the coverage extended by the insurance policies, the court in the <em>Indemnity Ins. Co. </em>case held that they were, stating (307 F.2d, at pages 517-518) : \u201cBeing liabilities assumed under written contracts, the clear and unambiguous language of appellant\u2019s insurance policies except these liabilities from Exclusion (c). This conclusion is consistent with California law. . . . Here there is no ambiguity. There is nothing to construe. Even if there were an ambiguity, then . . . the circumstances of the case at bar would require appellant\u2019s insurance policies to be construed in the favor of appellees and against the insurance company. <em>Continental Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Phoenix Constr. Co. </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 423, 437 [296 P.2d 801, 57 A.L.R.2d 914]. The result in either case is coverage. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">In the case presently before this court the Stuyvesant and Employers\u2019 Surplus policies do not restrict coverage to liabilities assumed under a <em>written </em>contract, the word \u201cwritten\u201d being omitted in the pertinent provision of each policy. The liability imposed upon Crescent Wharf by the shipowners is within the coverage afforded by those policies whether the contract between Crescent Wharf and a shipowner was oral or whether it was written. Obviously, coverage is afforded with respect to a written contract in which there was embodied an express \u201chold harmless\u201d clause as to liability of the nature of that involved in the present case; such a clause relates to an obligation which, as stated in <em>Ryan </em>(see footnote 2 of this opinion), is \u201cof the essence\u201d of the stevedoring contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">In <em>Booth S.S. Co. </em>v. <em>Meier &amp; Oelhaf Co. </em>(2d Cir. 1958) 262 F.2d 310, a shipowner filed a third-party complaint against Meier &amp; Oelhaf Co., machinists, claiming indemnity with respect to whatever sum might be awarded against it in the main action on behalf of the plaintiff, an employee of Meier &amp; Oelhaf Co., for injuries he sustained while engaged in engine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>repair work aboard the vessel. The agreement between Meier &amp; Oelhaf Co. and the shipowner was oral. The plaintiff prevailed on the issue of the unseaworthiness of the vessel and recovered judgment against the shipowner. After holding that federal maritime law governed the construction of the agreement there in issue, the court, quoting from <em>Ryan </em>(see footnote 2 to this opinion), stated (262 F.2d, at page 313) : \u201cIt cannot be disputed that the services performed were carried out pursuant to an agreement between Booth and Meier. That the terms of the agreement may have been oral, or implied from the course of dealing between the parties and custom of the trade, or part oral and part according to custom, can make no difference. The warranty here involved is an incident of the agreement, \u2018it is [appellee\u2019s] warranty of workmanlike service that is comparable to a manufacturer\u2019s warranty of the soundness of its manufactured product. \u2019 <em>Ryan, supra, </em>350 U.S. at pages 133-134 [100 L.Ed. at pp. 141, 142], 76 S.Ct. at page 237. The way in which the contract was arrived at or preserved is irrelevant. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">With respect to the Fireman\u2019s Fund policies, as has been noted, one thereof contains a provision that the only liability covered thereunder is that defined by the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Worker\u2019s Compensation Act. There is no endorsement extending such coverage. The language in the other Fireman\u2019s Fund policy and in the Pacific Employers policy upon which the plaintiff\u2019s contention of coverage with respect to the liability herein involved is based is in each instance limited by a further provision that such coverage is not afforded as to liability assumed by the insured under any contract or agreement. Since the pertinent liability is one assumed by Crescent Wharf under a contract or agreement, such policies afforded no coverage of the nature of that asserted by the plaintiff Employers \u2019 Surplus.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Cobey, J., and Moss, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The other defendants are The Stuyvesant Insurance Company (hereinafter designated by the name Stuyvesant), Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company (hereinafter designated by the name Fireman\u2019s Fund), and Pacific Employers Insurance Company (hereinafter designated by the name Pacific Employers). Defendant Stuyvesant filed a cross-complaint for declaratory relief and indemnification, naming the plaintiff and the other defendants as cross-defendants. Reliance Insurance Company (hereinafter designated by the name Reliance) filed a complaint in intervention for declaratory and other relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b208-8\"><em>Ryan </em>involved the matter of the liability of a stevedoring contractor to reimburse a shipowner for damages paid by the latter to one of the contractor\u2019s longshoremen on account of injuries received by him in the course of his employment on shipboard. The Supreme Court stated (350 U.S., at page 131 [100 L.Ed. at p. 140]) : \u201cThe shipowner\u2019s action here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>is not founded upon a tort or upon any duty which the stevedoring contractor owes to its employee. The third-party complaint is grounded upon the contractor\u2019s breach of its purely consensual obligation <em>owing to the shipowner </em>to stow the cargo in a reasonably safe manner. Accordingly, the shipowner\u2019s action for indemnity on that basis is not barred by the Compensation Act.\u2019\u2019 The Supreme Court further stated (350 U.S., at pages 133-134 [100 L.Ed. at pp. 141-142]) : \u201cThe shipowner here holds petitioner\u2019s uncontroverted agreement to perform all of the shipowner\u2019s stevedoring operations at the time and place where the cargo in question was loaded. That agreement necessarily includes petitioner\u2019s obligation not only to stow the pulp rolls, but to stow them properly and safely. Competency and safety of stowage are inescapable elements of the service undertaken. The obligation is not a quasi-eontraetual obligation implied in law or arising out of a noncontractual relationship. It is of the essence of petitioner\u2019s stevedoring contract. It is petitioner\u2019s warranty of workmanlike service that is comparable to a manufacturer\u2019s warranty of the soundness of its manufactured product. The shipowner\u2019s action is not changed from one for a breach of contract to one for a tort simply because recovery may turn upon the standard of the performance of petitioner \u2019s stevedoring service, \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
