Her appeal presents the following narrow question: May a defendant whose fraudulent acts and misrepresentations have caused another to fail to perform in conformity with promises made to his promisee under an oral agreement assert the statute of frauds as a defense against an action for damages brought by the promisee alleging defendant\u2019s tortious interference with a contractual relationship? We have concluded that this question must be answered in the negative. The judgment having been entered on the pleadings, the facts are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges that she is a licensed real estate broker. During the month of July 1963, she and the \u201cowners\u201d of certain real property \u201centered into an oral agreement under the terms and conditions of which 'Owners \u2019 agreed to and did employ plaintiff as a real estate broker to obtain and procure a purchaser for [their] real property and improvements for which \u2018Owners\u2019 promised to pay to plaintiff a commission of 5 percent of the selling price thereof; ...\u201d During the term of this agreement she \u2018 \u2018 did meet with and show\u201d the property to some 14 prospective purchasers, including defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s complaint further alleges that following her initial contacts with defendants, they cancelled further scheduled appointments and falsely and fraudulently informed plaintiff that \u201cthe property was \u2018too much money\u2019 \u201d and that they \u201cintended to take no further action with respect to inspection or possible purchases of said real property ...\u201d However, immediately thereafter \u201cwith full knowledge of the . . . agreement existing between plaintiff and \u2018 Owners, \u2019 defendants . . . did fraudulently represent to \u2018Owners\u2019 that defendants . . . had learned that the subject real property . . . was on the market for sale through a \u2018friend\u2019 whose name was \u2018Mrs. Gold\u2019 and not through a real estate broker; . . .\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">As a result of this intentional deceit defendants were able <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>to induce the \u201cowners\u201d to sell the property directly to defendants at a price which, at least inferentially, did not include plaintiff\u2019s agreed commission. It is further alleged that \u201cplaintiff procured defendants ... as the buyers of said real property and fulfilled all of the terms and conditions of said agreement between plaintiff and \u2018Owners\u2019 on her part to be performed, and were it not for the said acts and conduct of defendants . . . \u2018Owners\u2019 would have performed the terms and conditions imposed upon them under said agreement and would have paid to plaintiff the said commission upon the sale of said real property and improvements.\u201d Plaintiff prayed for general damages in the amount of her agreed commission and exemplary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Although the reasoning of the trial court in granting defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings is not revealed by the record before us, defendants concede that it was based upon the holdings in cases such as <em>Colburn </em>v. <em>Sessin, </em>94 Cal.App.2d 4, 6 [209 P.2d 989], and <em>Sweeley </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>47 Cal.App.2d 381, 387 [118 P.2d 14].) However, these decisions stand only for the proposition that where the owner of real property, with full knowledge of the relationship of the parties, sells his property directly to the buyer with the preconceived intention of violating his oral contract with a broker and asserting the non-enforceability of such contract by reason of a failure to comply with the statute of frauds (Civ. Code, \u00a71624, subd. 5), the broker may not recover his commission from the owner or the buyer even though the latter may have \u201cconspired\u201d with the owner to achieve this end or \u201cinduced\u201d him to assert the statutory bar. They do not reach the question whether or not a purchaser may be liable where, through fraudulent means, he has induced the seller to breach his contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">\u201cSince the instant agreement falls within the statute, it constitutes, without doubt, a voidable contract. Section 1624 of the Civil Code provides: \u2018The following contracts are invalid, unless the same, or some note or memorandum thereof, is in writing and subscribed by the party to be charged or by his <em>agent: 5. </em>An agreement authorizing or employing an agent or broker to purchase or sell real estate for compensation or a commission. . . .\u2019 The courts have held that the word \u2018invalid\u2019 as used in the statute means voidable. [Citations.] Once a defendant raises the defense of the statute against the contract, the broker cannot recover upon it. [Citations.]</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>\u201cThe tort of interference with an advantageous relationship, or with a contract, does not, however, disintegrate because it relates to a contract not written or an advantageous relation not articulated into a contract. The nature of the tort does not vary with the legal strength, or enforceability, of the relation disrupted. The actionable wrong lies in the inducement to break the contract or to sever the relationship, not in the kind of contract or relationship so disrupted, whether it is written or oral, enforceable or not enforceable.\u201d <em>(Zimmerman </em>v. <em>Bank of America, </em>191 Cal.App.2d 55, 57 [12 Cal.Rptr. 319].)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Although the court in <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>248 Cal.App.2d 502, 506 [56 Cal.Rptr. 715], cites the <em>Zimmerman </em>decision, <em>supra, </em>for the proposition that the broker may always recover from the buyer of real property where the \u201cprospective purchaser and the owner consummate the sale in such a way that they intentionally breach the agent\u2019s commission contract,\u201d the <em>Zimmerman </em>decision actually expressly refrained from reaching this point, i.e.: \u201cIt might be contended that in such a situation the umbrella of the statute could protect the buyer, who in reality stands in the same financial position as the seller. No such contention can be made as to the respondent bank, which was a stranger to the transaction. We are therefore not called upon to pass upon the issue whether the statute would or would not apply to a buyer in such circumstances as composed the cited cases <em>[Colburn, supra, </em>and <em>Sweeley, supra\\ </em>in which the defendant was a party to the transaction. We hold that the third party respondent, at least, cannot lay hold of the statute in the instant case.\u201d <em>(Zimmerman </em>v. <em>Bank of America, supra, </em>191 Cal.App.2d at p. 61.)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Similarly, in the present case, we need not undertake a review of the earlier decisions of this court in <em>Colburn </em>and <em>Sweeley. </em>Whatever may be the rights and liabilities of a purchaser who encourages or \u201cconspires\u201d with a seller in the latter\u2019s knowing decision to avoid his obligation to a broker, a purchaser may not, by fraudulent means, cause a seller unwittingly to so change his position that thereafter he cannot reasonably be required to fulfill his oral commitment to his agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Drawing all reasonable inferences from plaintiff\u2019s complaint, the instant factual situation is essentially indistinguishable from that presented to the court in <em>Golden </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>256 Cal.App.2d 714, which the court described as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>follows: (p. 718 [64 Cal.Rptr. 404].) \u201cThe basic underlying theory of plaintiff\u2019s action, is that the various defendants [the corporate purchaser and its agents] . . . interfered with the brokerage relationship plaintiff had with the sellers of the Bayly Ranch; that they did so unjustifiably and through fraudulent representations and concealment. In a nutshell, plaintiff alleges that defendants Forest Lawn \u2018did him out of his commission \u2019 by purchasing the property through an undisclosed principal, thereby concealing the fact that there was a broker involved, namely plaintiff, who had rendered services pursuant to an agreement with the seller in interesting them in buying the ranch.\u201d Passing upon the issue presented by the present appeal, the court in <em>Golden </em>stated at pages 718-719: \u2018 \u2018 Preliminarily, it is to be observed that although the brokerage agreement relied upon by plaintiff was oral, and thus subject to the defense of the statute of frauds [citation] which could be asserted by the seller of the property to defeat any action by plaintiff on the contract, defendants, being strangers to such contract, may not interpose that defense in this action which is founded in tort. [Citation.] \u2018 [Contracts which are voidable by reason of the statute of frauds, formal defects, lack of consideration, lack of mutuality, or even uncertainty of terms, still afford a basis for a tort action when the defendant interferes with their performance.\u2019 [Citation.] The rationale for the rule is succinctly stated in <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Perl </em>(1963) 41 N.J. 455 [197 A.2d 359, 363], in the following language: \u2018 [O]ne who unjustifiably interferes with the contract of another is guilty of a wrong. And since men usually honor their promises no matter what flaws a lawyer can find, the offender should not be heard to say the contract he meddled with could not have been enforced. \u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The decisions in <em>Golden </em>and <em>Zimmerman </em>(cf. also <em>Shida </em>v. <em>Japan Food Corp., </em>251 Cal.App.2d 864, 867 [60 Cal.Rptr. 43]; <em>Di Lorenzo </em>v. <em>Stewart Title Guar. Co., </em>232 Cal.App.2d 839, 843 [43 Cal.Rptr. 261]; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Powell, supra, </em>248 Cal.App.2d 502, 506, and <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Grua, </em>215 Cal.App.2d 1, 8 [30 Cal.Rptr. 39]) are basically in accord with the rules enunciated in the Restatement of Torts. Section 766 thereof provides: \u201c [0]ne who, without a privilege to do so, induces or otherwise purposely causes a third person not to (a) perform a contract with another, or (b) enter into or continue a business relation with another is liable to the other for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>harm caused thereby.\" In comment (c) to this section it is stated :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">\u201cClause (a) relates to cases in which the conduct induced or otherwise purposely caused by A constitutes a breach of B\u2019s existing contract with C. Separation of the situations described in Clauses (a) and (b) is not necessary for the statement of the general principle expressed in the rule stated in this Section; but the separation is necessary in determining the existence or non-existence of privilege in certain circumstances. The privileges to induce breach of contract are fewer than those to induce the conduct stated in Clause (b). . . . In the latter case the person induced is subject to a legal duty which the actor causes him to violate, while in the former case there is no duty. Moreover, in the latter case, the person harmed has paid consideration for the expectancy with which the actor interferes. An interest which is a sufficient basis for a privilege to induce a person not to enter into a business relation with another may, therefore, be insufficient to create a privilege to induce a breach of contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">\u201cThe word \u2018contract\u2019 connotes a promise which creates a duty recognized by law (see Restatement of Contracts, \u00a71). A promise may be a contract though it is voidable (see Restatement of Contracts, \u00a713). . . <em>.A contract unenforceable because of non-compliance with the statute of frauds falls within Clause (a) rather than Clause (b) of the rule stated in this Section.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">In addition to the rarity with which a person will be entitled to cause another to breach a contract, as distinguished from merely inducing a refusal to deal, it is virtually never permissible to use fraudulent methods to effect another\u2019s conduct. As stated in Comment (b) to section 767 which defines the factors applicable in determining the existence of a privilege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">\u201cThe nature of the actor\u2019s conduct is a chief factor in determining whether the conduct is privileged despite its harm to the other person. . . . Under the same circumstances inducement by some means is privileged while inducement by other means is not privileged; and, likewise, the same means may be proper under some circumstances while improper in others. The issue is not simply whether the actor is privileged to cause the harm, but rather whether he is privileged to cause it in the manner in which he does cause it. The propriety of the means is not, however, determined as a separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>issue unrelated to the other factors. On the contrary, their propriety is determined in the light of all the factors present. Thus physical violence, <em>fraudulent misrepresentation </em>and threats of illegal conduct <em>are ordinarily improper means and subject their user to liability even though he is privileged to accomplish the same result by proper means.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Roth, P.
