Khan specifically waives his asylum claim by stating that he does not contest the finding that he was ineligible for asylum. Khan also waives any challenge to the denial of his withholding of removal claim by failing to properly brief the issue. <em>See Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993); <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-23\">As to his CAT claim, Khan argues that the BIA erred in affirming the decision of the IJ on the issue of credibility. This court gives great deference to a factfinder\u2019s decisions concerning an alien\u2019s credi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>bility. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 905 (5th Cir.2002). This court does not substitute its own judgment for that of the BIA or IJ with respect to witness credibility or ultimate factual findings based on credibility determinations. <em>Id. </em>When an IJ\u2019s credibility determination is based on a \u201creasonable interpretation of the record and therefore supported by substantial evidence,\u201d it will be upheld. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994). The IJ\u2019s credibility determination may not be overturned unless the record compels it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Notwithstanding Khan\u2019s arguments to the contrary, the BIA did not err in affirming the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determinations. The inconsistencies in the Khan\u2019s testimony show that the credibility determinations were a reasonable interpretation of the record and therefore supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 79. The opposite conclusion, that Khan was credible, is not compelled by the evidence. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the BIA did not err in denying Khan relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b637-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
