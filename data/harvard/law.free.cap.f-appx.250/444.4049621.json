Dec. 19, 2006), <em>affg </em>No. A78 229 199 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 23, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-15\">Where, as here, the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s decision and emphasizes particular aspects of it, we review the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>See Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. I.N.S., </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. I.N.S., </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. I.N.S., </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>We conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Kamana was not credible and that he failed to establish the threshold element of his claim for relief \u2014 his Burundian identity. The IJ reasonably found Kamana\u2019s inability to speak Kirundi, the native language of Burundi, inconsistent with his claim of Burundian nationality. While Kamana attributed his inability to speak Kirundi to having lived in isolation with his father, the IJ refused to credit that explanation, finding it inconsistent with his testimony that his Tutsi neighbors may have reported him to the military, that he attended Koranic school for six years, and that he had lived in Bujumbura, Burundi\u2019s capital. Furthermore, the IJ noted that while Kamana testified that the only language he spoke was French, the interpreters at his hearings expressed difficulty in understanding his French. Moreover, the IJ noted that Kamana\u2019s asylum interview was conducted through a Swahili interpreter. While Kamana asserted that he did not speak Swahili, and that the interview had been conducted in French, \u201csufficiently accurate\u201d records from the asylum interview indicate to the contrary. <em>See Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, 357 </em>F.3d 169, 179 (2d Cir.2004). Accordingly, the IJ properly refused to credit his explanation for why he spoke only French and not Kurundi. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Noting her additional concerns that Kamana did not know that Christianity was the main religion in Burundi and not Islam, as he testified, and that the forensics examiner had been unable to confirm the authenticity of his Burundian identity card, the IJ reasonably concluded that Kamana was not credible and that he had failed to establish his identity and country of origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The inconsistencies identified by the IJ go to the heart of Kamana\u2019s claims of persecution, because they cast doubt on the most basic aspect of his claim \u2014 that he was of Burundian nationality and feared persecution at the hands of the ruling Tutsi ethnic group. <em>See Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308 (distinguishing substantial from minor inconsistencies). An asylum applicant\u2019s nationality is a threshold question in determining his eligibility for asylum, <em>see Wangchuck v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Dhoumo v. BIA, </em>416 F.3d 172, 174 (2d Cir.2005), and it is his burden to establish such eligibility, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a); <em>Osorio v. I.N.S., </em>18 F.3d 1017, 1021-22 (2d Cir.1994). In light of the inconsistencies identified above, the IJ did not err in finding that the unverified identity card merited little weight in establishing the issue of Kamana\u2019s nationality. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 342 (2d Cir.2006) (finding that the weight afforded to the applicant\u2019s evidence in immigration proceedings lies largely within the discretion of the IJ). Kamana\u2019s inability to establish the threshold issue of his Burundi nationality, moreover, was fatal to his claims for relief. <em>See Dhoumo, </em>416 F.3d at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Because the only evidence of a threat to Kamana\u2019s life or freedom depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on his claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Wu Biao Chen v. I.N.S., </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir. 2003). Likewise, Kamana\u2019s claim for CAT relief, which was based on the same factual predicate, also fails. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
