O\u2019BRIEN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b873-18\">On June 15, 2005, Leroy Joe Yazzie, Sr., pled guilty to one count of involuntary manslaughter in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1112 and 1153. The Presentence Investigation Report (PSR)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> determined the applicable guideline range to be ten to sixteen months.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court instead sentenced him to eighteen months imprisonment \u2014 two months in excess of the maximum of the original guideline range. The district court based its upward departure on the fact it believed criminal history category I under-represented Yazzie\u2019s criminal history.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>USSG \u00a7 4A1.3. In light of Yazzie\u2019s two prior tribal convictions for battery, the district court deemed a criminal history category II to be more appropriate. This resulted in a modified guideline range of twelve to eighteen months. Judgment was entered on September 21, 2005. In his timely appeal, Yazzie argues the district court unreasonably increased his sentencing range by relying on past tribal convictions. We exercise jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Discussion:</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">We review sentences imposed after <em>United States v. Booker </em>for reasonableness in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). 543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States, v. Kristl, </em>437 F.3d 1050, 1053 (10th Cir. 2006). However, the district court \u201cis not required to consider individually each factor listed in \u00a7 3553(a) before issuing a sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Kelley, </em>359 F.3d 1302, 1305 (10th Cir.2004). \u201c[W]e review legal questions <em>de novo </em>and we review any factual findings for clear error, giving due deference to the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts.\u201d <em>United States v. Wolfe, </em>435 F.3d 1289, 1295 (10th Cir.2006) (quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-13\">After <em>Booker, </em>\u201cdistrict courts still maintain the ability to depart downward <em>or upward </em>from the sentencing guideline range, so long as the sentence imposed is reasonable in light of the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Montgomery, </em>439 F.3d 1260, 1262 (10th Cir. 2006). On review, \u201ca sentence that is properly calculated under the Guidelines is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Kristl, </em>437 F.3d at 1054.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We require reasonableness in two respects \u2014 \u201cthe length of the sentence, as well as the <em>method </em>by which the sentence was calculated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1055. When evaluating departures and variances post-Booker,<footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we first determine whether the initial guideline range was appropriately calculated, then examine whether the departure was warranted under the traditional de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>parture scheme,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and finally consider whether the ultimate sentence imposed was reasonable in light of \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Yazzie does not contest the calculation of the initial guideline range. <em>See Kristl, </em>437 F.3d at 1055 (requiring the initial guideline calculation to be methodologically sound). Thus, we turn our attention to whether the upward departure was warranted under the traditional guideline departure scheme. <em>See Calzada-Maravillas, </em>443 F.3d at 1305 (\u201ca district court\u2019s sentencing decision necessarily includes consideration of [the] Guideline departure provisions\u201d). Under the traditional guideline departure scheme, we evaluate upward departures by examining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-6\">(1) whether the factual circumstances supporting a departure are permissible departure factors; (2) whether the departure factors relied upon by the district court remove the defendant from the applicable Guideline heartland thus warranting a departure; (3) whether the record sufficiently supports the factual basis underlying the departure; and (4) whether the degree of departure is reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-7\"><em>United States v. Walker, </em>284 F.3d 1169, 1171 (10th Cir .2002). Under USSG \u00a7 4A1.3, an upward departure may be warranted \u201c[i]f reliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, ...\u201d An upward departure is \u201creasonable\u201d in this context if the district court \u201cprecisely lay[s] out its reasoning and analysis as to why it is selecting a particular degree of departure\u201d sufficient to \u201cgive us reasonable indicia that the sentence the district court pronounces is proportional to the crime committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Proffit, </em>304 F.3d 1001, 1012 (10th Cir.2002). \u201cThe district court accomplishes this task by using any reasonable methodology hitched to the Sentencing Guidelines to justify the reasonableness of the departure.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">In this case, the PSR accounted for Yazzie\u2019s 2003 conviction for aggravated driving while intoxicated. However, the criminal history category did not account for four other prior convictions: a 1996 conviction for criminal damage and battery; a 2000 conviction for battery; a 2000 conviction for speeding, no driver\u2019s license and no insurance; and another 2000 conviction for no driver\u2019s license. The 1996 and 2000 battery convictions were in tribal court and the information about them was obtained from Navajo Department of Law Enforcement arrest reports. Yazzie did not dispute the tribal court convictions, but asserted a departure was not warranted because \u201cthe location of the court, the nature of the plea or trial, and the presence or absence of an attorney is unknown.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br., Attach. C at 1.) The district court characterized the two battery convictions in tribal court as \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d and deemed them to be \u201cserious in nature.\u201d (R. Vol. III at 4.) Based on these findings, the district court held Yazzie\u2019s \u201ccriminal conduct is significantly under-represented by his criminal history score.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 3-4.) Relying on \u00a7 4A1.3, the district court held Yazzie\u2019s \u201ccriminal history category [would] be more adequately represented [and] more similar to those individuals having a criminal history category of II,\u201d resulting in a sentencing range of twelve to eighteen months. <em>(Id. </em>at 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b876-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>We find this departure to be a reasonable upward departure under USSG \u00a7 4A1.3. USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(a) allows for the consideration of \u201cprior sentence(s) not used in computing the criminal history category,\u201d and specifically lists the example of \u201csentences for ... tribal offenses\u201d as acceptable. <em>See also </em>USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(i) (\u201ctribal court convictions ... may be considered under \u00a7 4A1.3\u201d); <em>United States v. Yates, </em>22 F.3d 981, 988 (10th Cir.1994) (allowing tribal court sentence to serve as a basis for an upward departure); <em>United States v. Benally, </em>756 F.2d 773, 779 (10th Cir.1985) (\u201cIn sentencing an Indian the court may consider the defendant\u2019s uncounselled tribal convictions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Additionally, the district court\u2019s comparison of Yazzie\u2019s criminal history to other defendants\u2019 history resulted in an appropriate degree of departure. Had Yazzie been given a criminal history point for each of his two prior tribal convictions for battery his criminal history category would have been II, resulting in a guideline range of twelve to eighteen months. Thus, the district court\u2019s analysis of the degree of the upward departure was appropriately hitched to the guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hurlich, </em>348 F.3d 1219, 1222 (10th Cir.2003) (\u201cThe district court may use any reasonable methodology hitched to the Sentencing Guidelines to justify the reasonableness of a departure, which includes using extrapolation from or analogy to the Guidelines.\u201d) (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Yazzie argues the district court erred by holding the earlier tribal battery convictions were \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d and \u201cserious in nature\u201d based upon unreliable arrest reports and not court documents. Even assuming the tribal convictions in this case could not qualify as \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d under USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Yazzie\u2019s argument overlooks the fact that the district court\u2019s characterization of his prior battery convictions as \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d was unnecessary to the determination that an upward departure was warranted. Had the prior tribal battery convictions been given the minimum value of one point under \u00a7 4A1.1, Yazzie still would have warranted a criminal history category of II independent of the nature of the. prior convictions. Criminal history category points are determined by the length of the sentence imposed, not the nature of the offense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4A1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">Additionally, while district courts are limited to judicial documents and are not allowed to use police reports when determining the classification of an offense, <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), the guidelines only require a district court to use \u201creliable information\u201d when determining whether \u201cthe defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.... \u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.3. The limitation imposed by <em>Shepard </em>relates to the determination of the nature of the offense charged, not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>evaluation of uncounted prior convictions when determining upward departures. Even were we to consider <em>Shepard </em>as analogous to this case, Yazzie\u2019s argument is especially unpersuasive because he did not challenge the existence of the tribal battery convictions, but objected only to the lack of specific details such as the locations of the court, the nature of the plea or trial, or whether he was afforded counsel. These details are unnecessary in the absence of an objection to the fact of conviction. \u201cWhen a defendant does not contest ... criminal conduct at sentencing, a district court may rely on the facts in a presentence report.\u201d <em>Yates, </em>22 F.3d at 989; <em>see also Benally, </em>756 F.2d at 779 (approving upward departure based on pri- or tribal conviction obtained where defendant was unrepresented).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Nor is this case like <em>United States v. Wyne, </em>where we held thirty prior convictions could not serve as a basis for an upward departure because they fell outside of the ten and fifteen year periods established by \u00a7 4A1.1, comments 1 and 2, and did not meet the standard for inclusion under \u00a7 4A1.2, comment 8. 41 F.3d 1405, 1407-08 (10th Cir.1994). <em>Wyne </em>was an interpretation of guideline provisions governing the inclusion of old (greater than ten or fifteen years) prior convictions when evaluating upward departures. It is, therefore, inapplicable to this case. There is no suggestion that Yazzie\u2019s prior tribal convictions run afoul of the time periods laid out in \u00a7 4A1.1, comments 1 and 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Finally, we must consider the ultimate question of whether the sentence imposed is reasonable in light of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Sanchez-Juarez, </em>446 F.3d 1109, 1114 (10th Cir.2006) (\u201c[Ajfter <em>Booker, </em>every sentence that a district court ultimately imposes must reflect its determination of what is reasonable in light of the same \u00a7 3553(a) factors, whether that sentence is within or outside the Guidelines range.\u201d). We recognize some amount of overlap with our reasonableness inquiry under the upward departure analysis. <em>United States v. Still, </em>249 Fed.Appx. 30, 33-34 (10th Cir. 2007) (unpublished).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 3553(a), we may appropriately consider the nature of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 36-37 (focusing on the nature of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions under the analysis of \u00a7 3553(a) factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">Given the existence and nature of Yazzie\u2019s two tribal battery convictions, it was reasonable to assign him a sentence above that reserved for first time offenders and individuals with little chance at recidivism. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4A1.3 (\u201cThe lower limit of the range for Criminal History Category I is set for the first offender with the lowest risk of recidivism.\u201d). It was not unreasonable for the district court to consider that even a slightly increased sentence would better promote respect for the law, deter future criminal conduct, and protect the public from further crimes. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). No other \u00a7 3553(a) factors weigh against this conclusion, nor do any of Yazzie\u2019s arguments undermine it. Based on Yazzie\u2019s prior criminal history, the nature of his criminal offenses, both past and present, and his likelihood of recidivism, we conclude Yazzie\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b873-9\"> After examining appellant's brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b873-10\">. By stipulation, Yazzie was sentenced under the 2002 edition of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Unless otherwise noted, all references to the guidelines are to that edition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b873-19\"><em>. </em>The PSR determined Yazzie's initial base offense level as 14 pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2A 1.2(a)(2), but he received a two level deduction for acceptance of responsibility under USSG \u00a7 3E1.1. His criminal history category was determined to be I, resulting in a guideline range of ten to sixteen months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b873-20\">. The PSR advised Yazzie's criminal history category I may under-represent Yazzie\u2019s criminal history and category II would be more appropriate. Yazzie informally objected to this conclusion but filed no formal objections to the PSR. Because the PSR stated the factors warranting departure, the district court did not <em>sua sponte </em>depart upward, and Yazzie had reasonable notice. <em>United States v. Calzada-Maravillas, </em>443 F.3d 1301, 1306 (10th Cir. 2006) (\"A PSR may satisfy the notice require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>ment by identifying grounds for an upward departure____\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b874-7\">. The presumption of reasonableness is an appellate presumption only. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). \u2018\u2018[T]he courts of appeals' \u2018reasonableness\u2019 presumption, rather than having independent legal effect, simply recognizes the real-world circumstance that when the judge's discretionary decision accords with the Commission's view of the appropriate application of \u00a7 3553(a) in the mine run of cases, it is probable that the sentence is reasonable.\" <em>Id. </em>And the presumption is discrete and quite limited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-11\">For one thing, the presumption is not binding. It does not, like a trial-related evidentiary presumption, insist that one side, or the other, shoulder a particular burden of persuasion or proof lest they lose their case. Nor does the presumption reflect strong judicial deference of the kind that leads appeals courts to grant greater factfinding leeway to an expert agency than to a district judge. Rather, the presumption reflects the fact that, by the time an appeals court is considering a within-Guidelines sentence on review, <em>both </em>the sentencing judge and the Sentencing Commission will have reached the <em>same </em>conclusion as to the proper sentence in the particular case. That double determination significantly increases the likelihood that the sentence is a reasonable one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 2463 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b874-15\">.
