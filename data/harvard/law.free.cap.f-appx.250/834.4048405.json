LUCERO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b861-14\">Robert H. Soule appeals his sentence of 130 months\u2019 imprisonment imposed following his guilty plea for possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) and (b)(2). Soule\u2019s counsel moves for leave to withdraw in a brief filed pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Because we conclude that each of the arguments raised by Soule\u2019s counsel in her <em>Anders </em>brief is frivolous, we AFFIRM Soule\u2019s sentence, DISMISS his appeal, and GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b861-18\">Soule\u2019s troubles in this case began on May 20, 2006, when members of his family contacted the Laramie Police Department to report that they had discovered what appeared to be child pornography amongst Soule\u2019s possessions at his mother\u2019s home. After attempting to interview Soule about his family\u2019s discovery, officers applied for and obtained a search warrant for Soule\u2019s mother\u2019s residence as well as for two storage units leased by Soule. Officers executed the search warrant on May 25 and 26, 2006, and found approximately seventy 3.5-inch floppy computer disks, ammunition for several types of firearms, and numerous pornographic photographs. The officers later turned over the computer disks to members of the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, who determined that the disks contained approximately 210 digital images depicting children engaged in explicit sexual activity. Some of the children depicted in the images were prepubescent, and at least six images allegedly depicted children engaged in sadomasochistic conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-19\">On July 19, 2006, a federal grand jury indicted Soule on two counts, charging: (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>unlawful possession of ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2); and (2) knowing possession of images of child pornography that affected interstate commerce in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) and (b)(2). Soule initially pleaded not guilty to both counts at his arraignment, but later entered into a written plea agreement with the government, in which he agreed to plead guilty to the count alleging possession of child pornography in exchange for the government\u2019s dismissal at sentencing of the other count. The district court held a hearing on the plea agreement on September 22, 2006, and accepted the revised plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">Soule was sentenced on December 8, 2006. His Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) noted an adjusted total offense level of 26 and a criminal history category of V. Taken together with the 120-month mandatory minimum sentence required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(2),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> these sentencing considerations provided for a potential range of 120 to 187 months\u2019 imprisonment. In response to the PSR, Soule advanced three main objections: (1) the mandatory minimum sentence required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(2) constitutes a per se cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eight Amendment; (2) the PSR overrepresented his criminal history and a departure from the Guidelines was thus warranted under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b); and (3) under the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the court should impose a sentence below the Guidelines, or, in the alternative, sentence Soule to no more than the mandatory minimum. The district court rejected each of these arguments and imposed a sentence of 130 months\u2019 imprisonment, with fifteen years of supervised release. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">If an attorney conscientiously examines a case and determines that any appeal would be wholly frivolous, counsel may \u201cso advise the court and request permission to withdraw.\u201d <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. Counsel must submit a brief to both the appellate court and the client, pointing to anything in the record that would potentially present an appealable issue. The client may then choose to offer any arguments to the court. If, upon complete examination of the record, the court determines that the appeal is in fact frivolous, it may grant the request to withdraw and dismiss the appeal. <em>Id. </em>In the present case, acting pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>counsel provided Soule with a copy of the appellate brief; Soule has declined the opportunity to file a pro se brief. Counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief raises four potentially appealable issues, each of which we determine to be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">First, counsel\u2019s brief argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying Soule\u2019s motion for a downward departure based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b). We generally have no jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s discretionary decision to deny a defendant\u2019s motion for downward departure. <em>United States v. Fonseca, </em>473 F.3d 1109, 1112 (10th Cir. 2007). Indeed, we may only review a denial of a defendant\u2019s motion for departure if the denial was based on the district court\u2019s erroneous belief that it was without authority to grant the departure. <em>Id. </em>As the transcript from Soule\u2019s sentencing hearing makes clear, the district court used its discretion to deny the motion for downward departure and did not errone<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>ously rely on the belief that it was without authority to grant the requested departure. We are thus without jurisdiction to review its denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Second, counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief raises what is essentially a reasonableness argument under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Counsel specifically asserts that the district court erred in denying Soule\u2019s request for a variance from the Guidelines pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Post-<em>Booker, </em>we review a sentence for reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Kristl, </em>437 F.3d 1050, 1053 (10th Cir.2006). In conducting this analysis, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal determinations de novo. <em>United States v. Serrata, </em>425 F.3d 886, 906 (10th Cir.2005). We also apply a presumption that a sentence falling within a properly calculated Guidelines range is reasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Kristi, </em>437 F.3d at 1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Soule did not object to the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines or to the court\u2019s calculation of the relevant sentencing range based on Soule\u2019s adjusted offense level and prior criminal record. In addition, our review of the transcript from the sentencing hearing reveals that the district court properly considered Soule\u2019s objections to the proposed sentence, as well as the factors articulated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Soule has done nothing to overcome the presumption that his 130-month sentence is reasonable, and we therefore conclude that, under the circumstances presented, Soule\u2019s sentence is reasonable. <em>See Kristl, </em>437 F.3d at 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Third, counsel\u2019s brief posits that the statutory minimum sentence of 120 months for Soule\u2019s conviction amounts to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Specifically, Soule\u2019s counsel asserts that it is per se cruel and unusual for Congress to impose a mandatory minimum sentence under any statute. Because this issue presents a purely legal question, we review the district court\u2019s denial of this objection de novo. <em>See United States v. Angelos, </em>433 F.3d 738, 750 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">\u201cThe Eighth Amendment ... contains a narrow proportionality principle that applies to noncapital sentences.\u201d <em>Ewing v. California, </em>538 U.S. 11, 20, 123 S.Ct. 1179, 155 L.Ed.2d 108 (2003) (quotations omitted). It does not, however, \u201crequire strict proportionality between crime and sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23, 123 S.Ct. 1179 (quotation omitted). The Supreme Court has \u201cdrawn the line of required individualized sentencing at capital cases, and see[s] no basis for extending it further.\u201d <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 996, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991); <em>see also id. </em>at 995, 111 S.Ct. 2680 (recognizing that \u201c[tjhere can be no serious contention ... that a sentence which is not otherwise cruel and unusual becomes so simply because it is mandatory.\u201d). Given the weight of Supreme Court precedent on this issue, and the fact that the Guidelines recommend a sentencing range of 110 to 137 months\u2019 imprisonment in this case, even without consideration of the applicable mandatory minimum, we decline to hold that the 120-month mandatory minimum sentence imposed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(2) violates the Eight Amendment\u2019s proscription against inflicting cruel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>and unusual punishment, per se or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Finally, counsel argues that Soule\u2019s guilty plea was invalid. We have often recognized that a defendant\u2019s plea must be given voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Gigot, </em>147 F.3d 1193, 1197 (10th Cir.1998). To ensure these basic requirements are met, a district court must inform a defendant of the nature of the charges to which he pleads, the rights he waives by pleading guilty, and the possible penalties that will be imposed if he is adjudged by the court to be guilty. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1). The district court must also question the defendant to ensure that he gives the plea voluntarily and not as a result of \u201cforce, threats, or promises.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(2). Our review of the record before us leads us to conclude that the district court scrupulously complied with the requirements of Rule 11 and that Soule\u2019s plea was entered voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Because Soule fails to present us with any meritorious grounds for appeal, we AFFIRM Soule\u2019s sentence, DISMISS his appeal, and GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b861-15\"> The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b862-7\">. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(2), a person with a prior conviction for possession of child pornography, like Soule, must be \"imprisoned for not less than 10 years nor more than 20 years.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b863-8\">. Our circuit\u2019s use of an appellate presumption of reasonableness for those sentences falling within a properly calculated Guidelines range was recently upheld by the Supreme Court in <em>Rita v.
