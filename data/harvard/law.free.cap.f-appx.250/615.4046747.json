Arora sought a continuance of his removal proceedings pending an appeal of the denial of an 1-130 petition filed on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-16\">The grant of a motion to continue lies within the sound discretion of the IJ, who may grant the motion for good cause shown. <em>Witter v. INS, </em>113 F.3d 549, 555 (5th Cir.1997); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29. An IJ\u2019s \u201cdecision denying the motion for continuance will not be reversed unless the alien establishes that [the] denial caused him actual prejudice and harm and materially affected the outcome of his case.\u201d <em>In re Sibrun, </em>18 I &amp; N Dec. 354, 356-57 (BIA 1983). To show prejudice; \u201cthe alien must specifically articulate the particular facts involved or evidence which he would have presented, and otherwise fully explain how denial of his motion fundamentally changed the result reached.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-17\">Contrary to Arora\u2019s assertion, he failed to show good cause. Arora did not demonstrate that the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance prejudiced him or that it had a material affect on the outcome of his case. <em>See In re Sibrun, </em>18 I &amp; N Dec. at 356-57. Moreover, the petition was not \u201cprima facie approvable\u201d given that the 1-130 petition filed by his wife had been denied. <em>See In re Garcia, </em>16 I <em>&amp; </em>N Dec. 653, 655-56 (BIA 1978), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds, as stated in Dielmann v. INS, </em>34 F.3d 851 (9th Cir.1994). Accordingly, Arora has not shown that the BIA abused its discretion in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of his motion for continuance. <em>See Witter, </em>113 F.3d at 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-18\">Arora also argues that the BIA erred in finding that the appeal of the I-130 petition was a collateral matter. This argument, however, is unavailing. The merits of the 1-130 petition are not before this court because this appeal is from the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s order of de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>portation; the IJ had no jurisdiction over the petition for alien relative. <em>See Liu v. INS, </em>645 F.2d 279, 284-85 (5th Cir.1981); <em>see also Conti v. INS, </em>780 F.2d 698, 702 (7th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Finally, Arora argues that the denial of the continuance resulted in the denial of a full and fair hearing. The denial of a continuance does not violate due process where an alien fails to show good cause. <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>440 F.3d 678, 681 (5th Cir.2006). Arora\u2019s full and fair hearing argument fails because he has not shown good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b642-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
