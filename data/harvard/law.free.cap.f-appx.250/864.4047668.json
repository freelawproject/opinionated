O\u2019BRIEN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Patrick M. O\u2019Neill (O\u2019Neill) pled no contest to one count of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 14 pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 21-3502. He was eventually sentenced to 155 months imprisonment. Subsequently, he filed motions attempting to withdraw his plea based on, <em>inter alia, </em>ineffective assistance of counsel and newly discovered evidence. O\u2019Neill exhausted his claims at the state court level; the trial court\u2019s well-reasoned decisions were upheld by the Kansas Court of Appeals on two separate occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">O\u2019Neill, appearing pro se,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brought this 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus on March 1, 2006. The district court accurately summarized the numerous claims made by O\u2019Neill: 1) ineffective assistance of counsel; 2) error by the trial court in denying his motion to withdraw his no contest plea; 3) withholding exculpatory evidence in violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963); and 4) violation of his rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">O\u2019Neill\u2019s habeas petition was denied in district court as was his application for certificate of appealability (COA). He also moved for appointment of counsel and to proceed <em>informa pauperis (ifp). </em>The district court found \u201cno basis to appoint counsel in this matter\u201d but granted O\u2019Neill <em>ifp </em>status pursuant to Rule 9.1(g) of the United States Court for the District of Kansas. (R. Doc. 28 at 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">O\u2019Neill renews his application for COA in this Court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A); Fed. R.App. P. 22(b)(1). A COA is a jurisdictional prerequisite to our review. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). We will issue a COA only if O\u2019Neill makes \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make this showing, he must establish \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether ... the petition should have been resolved [by the district court] in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-13\">The district court reviewed O\u2019Neill\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim against the two-prong test set out in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) and found no error. After thorough analysis it also rejected his claims regarding his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, concluding portions related solely to state law, while the remainder were without merit. His <em>Brady </em>claim was not supported by the record and the <em>Miranda </em>claim was proeedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-14\">We have reviewed O\u2019Neill\u2019s arguments and we agree with the district court: \u201cthe evidence clearly establishes Mr. O\u2019Neill is entitled to no relief.\u201d (R. Doc. 18 at 1.) We DENY O\u2019Neill\u2019s application for a COA and DISMISS the appeal. O\u2019Neill\u2019s letter tp this Court requesting counsel is con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>strued as a motion for appointment of counsel and is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-9\">. Pro se pleadings are liberally construed. <em>Ledbetter v. City of Topeka, Kan., </em>318 F.3d 1183, 1187 (10th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
