Rogan, II, appeals the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board that dismissed his appeal as untimely filed. <em>Rogan v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>CH-0752-06-0556-I-1 (MSPB July 19, 2006). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Rogan was required to file his appeal with the board within thirty days of his removal from his position at the United States Postal Service, or to show good cause why he was unable to timely file. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1201.12, 1201.22. Given that Rogan\u2019s appeal was received by the board in an envelope postmarked more than four months past the filing deadline, the board properly determined that Rogan\u2019s appeal was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">While Rogan made representations to the board regarding family and financial problems, he failed to establish that these difficulties prevented him from meeting the filing deadline. We conclude, therefore, that substantial evidence supports the board\u2019s determination that Rogan failed to show good cause for his failure to file in a timely manner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
