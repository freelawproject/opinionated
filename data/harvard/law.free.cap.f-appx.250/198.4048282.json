That person was an undercover officer, and Zatarain thereafter pled guilty to conspiring to distribute 500 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing methamphetamine. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced Zatarain to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment be served consecutively to the undischarged 188-month sentence. Zatarain appeals, arguing his sentence is unreasonable because application of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors support a partially concurrent sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">After careful review, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a fully consecutive sentence. <em>See United States v. Winston, </em>456 F.3d 861, 867 (8th Cir.2006) (standard of review). The court explicitly and properly considered the seriousness of the offense, Zatarain\u2019s failure to be deterred by his previous 188-month sentence, and the fact Zatarain committed the instant offense while in custody for a similar offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a)-(b) (declaring when a term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant who is already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment, the terms may run concurrently or consecutively; in determining whether to impose the terms consecutively or concurrently, a court shall consider \u00a7 3553(a) factors); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (nature and circumstances of offense and history and characteristics of defendant), (2)(A) (seriousness of offense), (2)(B) (adequate deterrence); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(a) (requiring consecutive sentence where offense was committed while serving term of imprisonment on another offense); <em>Winston, </em>456 F.3d at 868 (affirming a sentence where the district court explained its decision to run sentence consecutively and cited \u00a7 3553(a) factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-17\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-14\">.
