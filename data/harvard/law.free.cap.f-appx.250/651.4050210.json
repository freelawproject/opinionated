Naranjo had 10 days from the entry of the July 5, 2006, judgment to file a timely notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). As the parties concede, his pro se August 14, 2006, notice of appeal was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-21\">A district court may grant a defendant an additional 30 days in which to file a notice of appeal upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). Because Naranjo\u2019s pro se notice of appeal was filed within this 30-day period, it sufficed as a motion for a finding on excusable neglect or good cause. <em>See United States v. Golding, </em>739 F.2d 183, 184 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-22\">Accordingly, the case is remanded to the district court for a finding under Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). <em>Id. </em>Upon making the finding, the district court shall promptly return the case to this court for dismissal or further proceedings, as may be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-23\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b677-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
