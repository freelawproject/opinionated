On October 21, 2005, following a four-day jury trial, Defendants, who are brothers, were found guilty in connection with the stabbing death of Kenneth Tutt on the Navajo Indian Reservation in Shipr\u00f3ck, New Mexico. The district court sentenced Henry to 262 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release and Larry to 235 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-14\">Defendants challenge their convictions on four grounds: (1) Larry argues there was insufficient evidence adduced at trial to support his conviction; (2) both Henry and Larry argue evidence was admitted at trial in violation of Fed.R.Evid. 401 and 403; (3) Larry challenges several of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks made during closing arguments; and (4) Henry argues the district court erroneously imposed a special condition on his supervised release without giving prior notice pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(h). Exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), we reverse both convictions \u2014 Larry\u2019s due to insufficient evidence and Henry\u2019s due to the erroneous admission of evidence substantially prejudicial to his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-15\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b894-16\">In the early morning hours of April 26, 2004, Kenneth Tutt\u2019s body was discovered under a tree behind the City Market in Shiprock, New Mexico. The area in which Tutt\u2019s body was discovered is known to be frequented by transients. It was later determined that the cause of Tutt\u2019s death was a stab wound to the left side of his neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>On February 25, 2005, a federal grand jury returned a second superseding indictment charging Defendants with the second-degree murder of Tutt. After the district court denied the government\u2019s motion to sever, trial commenced on October 17, 2005, and ended on October 20, 2005. The jury returned guilty verdicts against Defendants the following day. In sentencing Defendants, the district court imposed, without notice, a condition of supervised release that both Defendants submit to suspicionless searches of their property and persons whenever requested by law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Because we must review the record for sufficiency of the evidence in Larry\u2019s appeal and for the admission of unfairly prejudicial evidence in Henry\u2019s appeal, we recount in some detail the pertinent portions of the trial testimony. Prosecution witness, Officer Brenda Harrison with the Navajo Nation Department of Law Enforcement, was the first officer to arrive on scene after Tutt\u2019s body was discovered on April 26. She observed a pair of broken sunglasses and a baseball cap near the body. She also observed blood splatters on the tree branches near Tutt\u2019s head. She and another officer did not locate any other evidence in the area surrounding the crime scene. Harrison also testified she was familiar with Defendants prior to Tutt\u2019s death and both of them usually carried backpacks. At some point during the investigation of the crime scene, the authorities received information from Nelvis Dawes, a man who resided between 100 and 200 yards from where Tutt\u2019s body was found, that led them to focus their attention on Defendants. The information gleaned from Dawes also led police to the property of Barbara Litson for the purpose of searching a shack occupied by Paul Hayes, Jr. At around 11:00 a.m., the authorities received permission from Litson to search the shack, and, based on something they found during the search, the shack was secured until a search warrant could be obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">George Joe, the individual who called law enforcement to report the discovery of Tutt\u2019s body, testified next. He explained a friend had informed him there was a body behind the City Market. Joe also testified that he had known Defendants for three or four years and had seen them in the vicinity of the City Market in the early afternoon on April 25. He described how Larry typically wore blue jeans, tennis shoes, sunglasses that fold over the eyes, and a cap. Henry typically wore square sunglasses, a light blue jacket, blue jeans, and tennis shoes. Later, during cross-examination, Joe confirmed Henry was wearing a light blue windbreaker on April 25, the day before the body was discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">Phillip Joe, the second law enforcement officer to arrive on scene after Tutt\u2019s body was discovered, testified to observing broken wrap-around style sunglasses near the victim and described the general area around the body as \u201csomewhat trashy.\u201d (R. Vol. IX at 59.) He explained the Hayes shack was located right next to the street and was \u201cpretty simply put together with numerous rough material, lumber, bark wood, plywood, and the front of the shed was or the entrance was unsecured.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 67.) Hayes was not in the shack at the time of the search. Next, Officer Joe detailed how he searched the shack and discovered what appeared to be a bloody steak knife within a cupboard. On redirect examination, Officer Joe testified that, at the time of the search, he also noticed a portion of a blue jacket with reflective tape on it stuck behind a mattress. Later in the trial, Officer Joe claimed a jacket seized from Henry following his arrest was similar to the blue jacket he had seen in the shack on April 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>Shirley Hayes, Paul Hayes\u2019s aunt, who also lives on the property with Litson, testified as follows: Hayes was indeed living in the shack on April 25; Defendants were staying at the shack on the afternoon of April 25; and food from a birthday party was sent out to them at around 4:00 p.m. She opined that Henry always wore a light or dark blue windbreaker, Larry always wore a blue and white jacket, and both of them always carried backpacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Litson was called next and testified that when she returned home from Las Vegas, Nevada, on the evening of April 25, nobody was at the shack. She confirmed, however, that sometime before 10:00 a.m. on the morning of April 26 she saw Defendants walking near the shack and both were holding bags.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Dawes was next. He said Defendants had been in the Shiprock area in the month and a half preceding Tutt\u2019s death. He observed the following on the evening of April 25:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-6\">And I seen a bunch of people walking as a group, and there was this one individual that they were kicking, and he kept falling down. He would get up, and they would kick him again. And then the taller one would eventually help him up, and it seems like he was getting his hits in at the same time, too. And he would get up again, and he would kick him down again. And finally, they just kept on doing that, and they just kept on walking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">(R. Vol. X at 165.) Dawes recalled a total of six individuals in the group \u2014 the victim of the beatings, the two individuals inflicting blows, and three observers who were just following. He thought nothing of the incident because fights happen all the time in that area of Shiprock; he turned away to return to his work. When he looked outside again a half an hour later, he saw nothing. Dawes identified Henry as the individual kicking the victim and Larry as the individual hitting the victim, but did not testify he ever observed a weapon in the hands of either. When the prosecution showed Dawes the shirt Tutt was found wearing when his body was discovered on April 26, Dawes confirmed the victim of the beatings he observed was wearing the same shirt. On cross-examination, Dawes admitted the only way he even recognized Larry was by his height, and claimed that Larry was hitting the victim with only his right hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">Next, the government called four expert witnesses to discuss the scientific evidence (or lack thereof). First, Sandra Koch, a forensic examiner in the trace evidence (hairs and fibers) unit of the FBI, testified she could not match any hairs from Tutt to those found on the items seized from Henry\u2019s backpack. Lora J. Gioeni, a forensic examiner in the mitochondrial DNA unit at the FBI, testified that, based on DNA testing, Tutt could be excluded as a possible source of a hair found on Henry\u2019s backpack. Julie Ann Kidd, a DNA and serology (the study of bodily fluids) examiner with the FBI, testified she performed DNA testing on Henry\u2019s boots, a jacket, a pafr of pants, a t-shirt, and a backpack. Tutt\u2019s DNA was not found on any of these items. Nor was either Defendants\u2019 DNA found under Tutt\u2019s fingernails. DNA extracted from blood found on the handle and blade of the knife located in Hayes\u2019s shack matched Tutt\u2019s DNA to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty but no latent fingerprints \u2014 from Defendants or anyone else \u2014 were found on the knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">The government\u2019s final scientific expert was Dr. Jeffrey Nine, the forensic pathologist who performed an autopsy on Tutt. According to Dr. Nine, Tutt\u2019s blood-alcohol level was .142 at the time of his death. Dr. Nine testified the cause of death was a stab wound \u201con the left side of the neck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>just above like the collarbone area, and that penetrated about two and a half inches into the neck tissues both perforating and penetrating a couple of major blood vessels, the cephalic artery and carotid artery, resulting in a lot of blood loss.... \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 265-66.) Tutt also exhibited a number of other injuries (mostly scrapes and bruises), including a superficial knife wound to the neck. In Dr. Nine\u2019s opinion, both of the stab wounds to Tutt\u2019s neck were consistent with having been inflicted by a knife like the one found in Hayes\u2019s shack. He admitted during cross-examination, however, an inability to determine whether the wound was inflicted by a right-handed or left-handed assailant. He also estimated Tutt would have lost two and a half quarts of blood before he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">The next witness for the government was Paul Hayes who was not an eager witness. The government secured his presence by arrest for failing to comply with a subpoena. When he was called as a \u25a0witness, prior to any questioning, the trial court addressed Hayes as follows: \u201cNow, you have been given the oath, and you have promised to tell the truth. Do you understand that?\u201d (R. Vol. XI at 329.) No other witness was addressed in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Hayes began his testimony by explaining that on April 25, 2004, he was living in the shack on Litson\u2019s property, but did not see Defendants that afternoon. He went on to testify: (1) he spent the night in the shack on April 25th but did not remember seeing either Henry or Larry; (2) his father and a female friend also spent the night at the shack on April 25, but they left the next morning around 7:00 or 8:00 a.m.; and (3) he did not see Defendants in the morning either. He then offered this description of the shack:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-10\">I can tell you this. Over at my dad\u2019s house, we have no door. We use a curtain for a door. And on the other side is a car hood, and we chain it up, and then we leave. Sometimes we come back, and the door\u2019s already opened again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-11\"><em>(Id. </em>at 340.)</p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">Hayes was interviewed by FBI Agent William Hall on April 29, three days after Tutt\u2019s body was discovered. When Hayes testified he could not remember what he said to Agent Hall, the court allowed him to silently read Hall\u2019s report to refresh his memory. Due to a concern Hayes may have difficulty reading the report in English, the court called a translator to read the report to Hayes in Navajo.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After Hayes stated he understood the substance of the report, the government renewed its questioning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-13\">Q: And this is a statement that you gave to Mr. Hall and Mr. Deale at the BIA office, do you recollect that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-14\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-15\">Q: Okay. Now ... I\u2019m going to ask you about the statement at the bottom ... of Page 1, the last sentence. Do you remember making that statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-16\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-17\">Q. Do you remember the agent asking you about Henry Woody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-18\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-19\">Q. Okay. Do you remember telling the agent that Henry Woody stutters when he gets scared?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-4\">Q: Do you remember telling the agent that you saw Henry Woody two days after Mr. Tutt\u2019s death, on the 28th?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-5\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-6\">Q: And do you remember telling him that Henry Woody told you not to say anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-7\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-8\">Q: You don\u2019t remember that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-9\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-10\">Q: Do you remember telling me this morning that when Henry Woody gets nervous, that he stutters?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-11\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-12\">Q: Do you remember talking to me downstairs this morning about 7:30 a.m.... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-13\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-14\">Q: But you don\u2019t remember telling me that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-15\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-16\">(R. Vol. XI at 347-48.) The court then intervened (with the jury present)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-17\">The Court: Mr. Hayes, do you understand the questions that the lawyer is asking you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-18\">The Witness: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-19\">The Court: Look at me when I talk to you. You took an oath this morning to tell the truth. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-20\">The Court: You swore to tell the truth, you promised to tell the truth as to all questions that ... would be asked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aess\">The Witness: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-22\">The Court: I have concerns that you are not honoring ... that oath. Mr. Hayes, what is it about the questions that you do not understand? Tell me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-23\">The Witness: I understand everything. There\u2019s some things that\u2019s written there. I don\u2019t think I said those things.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-24\"><em>(Id. </em>at 349.) When further questioning received the same type of response, the jury was sent on break. The court again admonished Hayes regarding his evasiveness and warned he was treading close to contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-25\">Still outside the presence of the jury, the government suggested Hayes was afraid of the Defendants and his fear was the source of his contrived lack of memory. The court questioned Hayes regarding this suggestion, but Hayes denied being afraid or receiving any threats from the Defendants. \u25a0 Henry objected to the form of the government\u2019s questioning. The court responded to the prosecutor, \u201cI do have concern with the amount of detail here that you are noting, [counsel], with respect to the substance of the statements that you have.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>The prosecution replied, \u201cYour Honor, just so the Court is aware, the reason I\u2019m doing or going into detail because my intention is to call Agent Hall and get these [statements in] uqder the Rules of Evidence ... prior inconsistent [statements],...\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>There was no further discussion and the jury returned to the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-26\">The questioning resumed in the same form. After several minutes, the court spoke to the jury, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>[L]et me just remind the jurors. Some of the earlier instructions that I have given, which I will give from time to time again throughout the course of this trial, you are to determine the facts solely from the evidence admitted in this case. The evidence consists of the testimony of witnesses and the exhibits that are received in evidence. Questions asked by the lawyers are not evidence, for the evidence consists of the witnesses\u2019 answers to the questions, not the questions themselves. Let us continue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-5\"><em>(Id. </em>at 360-361.) Eventually, the government reached the point where it tried to elicit Hayes\u2019s reported statement to Agent Hall describing the Defendants\u2019 conduct when they drink or get angry. It inartfully asked, \u201cAnd what, in fact, did you tell the agent about Larry Woody when they [sic] get mad?\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 363.) Henry objected alleging the statement was irrelevant and unduly prejudicial under Rule 403. The court did not address Rule 403 but, rather, told the prosecutor to lay a better foundation and ruled it would permit the question. These questions followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-6\">Q Now, so when you made this statement about how they act when they get mad, what made you tell the agent that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-7\">A Well, like I said, what Larry does is when he gets mad and then when we try to joke around, he just gets mad and hits me or some other people there. Then he hits them, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-8\">Q. And then did you tell the agent that he talked about killing people when he gets mad?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-11\">A. That, I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-12\"><em>(Id. </em>at 366.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-13\">Agent Hall was the government\u2019s final \u25a0witness. Assigned to investigate Tutt\u2019s murder, Hall responded to the crime scene early on April 26 and at approximately 11:00 a.m. he was informed of the search of Hayes\u2019s shack and the discovery of the bloody knife. In response, he prepared a search warrant and affidavit, and after obtaining a search warrant, seized the knife. He next described how he interviewed Henry in Cortez, Colorado, a couple of weeks after the murder. During that interview, Henry claimed he had heard about Tutt\u2019s death on the radio and then spontaneously volunteered, \u201cI\u2019m innocent. I don\u2019t even know that guy.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 88 (quotations omitted)). Henry later referred to Tutt as Ken, leading Agent Hall to believe Henry had indeed known Tutt.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-14\">Henry eventually admitted to Agent Hall during the interview that on April 25 he had been drinking with Tutt behind the City Market. With regard to the moment when Tutt was stabbed, Henry advised Hall, \u201che got up and bent over, and it happened really fast.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 390.) Henry claimed that after the stabbing he went back to Hayes\u2019s shack and fell asleep. Henry described the murder weapon \u201cas a fixed blade hunting style knife with a four-inch blade [and] a black handle.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 391.)</p>\n<p id=\"b899-15\">Agent Hall detailed two interviews he conducted with Larry, during which Larry also admitted to being with Tutt on the day he was slain. Larry claimed that on April 25 he encountered Tutt, who requested that Larry go into the City Market and purchase some \u201cocean\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>to consume. After Larry purchased mouthwash and gave Tutt his change, the two drank \u201cocean.\u201d Larry claimed he then went back to Hayes\u2019s shack and spent the night. When confronted specifically about Tutt\u2019s death, Larry blurted out, \u201cI didn\u2019t stab him or I would have blood all over my jeans.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 395 (quotations omitted).)</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">The government then moved to Hayes\u2019s statements to Hall regarding Defendants\u2019 propensity for violence when drinking. Because Hayes denied making the statements, the government was allowed to elicit impeachment testimony from Agent Hall. Hall testified Hayes told him, \u201c \u2018[When Henry and Larry] get mad, they talk about killing people\u2019 and [Hayes] went on to say, \u2018When they get together and drink, they also threaten people.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 402.) When the jury returned from lunch, the court properly instructed the jury that such evidence was admissible only to impeach the credibility of the witness and not to establish the truth of Hayes\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">On cross-examination, Hall testified that, at the time of his first interview with Larry on April 28, Larry\u2019s right hand was extremely swollen (his fingers were twice the normal diameter) and he had sutures on one of his fingers. Larry told Hall he had surgery on his right hand in early April, a fact Hall independently corroborated through medical records. Hall admitted he had previously testified before a grand jury saying: \u201cIt\u2019s my belief, based on what I saw of Larry Woody\u2019s hand, that he could not have stabbed someone.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 422 (quotations omitted).) After evaluating the crime scene, Hall believed the assailant was right-handed and Larry would not have been able to make a fist without injuring the surgery wound. Hall further testified that, during a prior investigative interview, Dawes had said four of the five men he saw on April 25 were kicking Tutt, but that one individual \u2014 who was wearing a blue jacket, black pants, and black plastic wrap-around sunglasses \u2014 did most of the pushing and kicking.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">At the conclusion of Hall\u2019s testimony, the government rested and Defendants moved for judgments of acquittal. The judge denied the motions, finding sufficient evidence as to each element of the charged offenses. The Defendants chose not to put on any evidence. Following jury instructions and closing arguments, the case was submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">Larry now argues the government presented insufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find he caused Tutt\u2019s death. Larry also takes issue with several of the prosecutor\u2019s statements made during closing argument, including one suggesting he might have enjoyed killing the victim \u201cin a primitive and human recreational kind of way thinking that he would never be in front of you guys [the jury].\u201d (R. Vol. XII at 486.) Both Larry and Henry contend the district court committed reversible error when it allowed the prosecutor to question Hayes and Agent Hall regarding Hayes\u2019s prior statements that the Defendants get violent and threaten to kill people when drinking and angry. Finally, Henry argues the court erred in attaching the suspicionless search condition upon his supervised release without first giving notice pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-12\">II. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"AAL\">A. <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b900-13\">Since Henry and Larry were co-defendants much of the evidence was over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>lapping. We take care to delineate the scope of our review with regard to each of the brothers because Larry briefed and argued insufficiency of the evidence, but Henry did not. Henry has waived any such argument as a result of his failure to raise and brief the issue. <em>See State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Mhoon, </em>31 F.3d 979, 984 n. 7 (10th Cir.1994) (failure to raise an issue in the appellate brief waives that issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">B. <em>Larry Woody</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">We begin and end our discussion of Larry\u2019s appeal by addressing the sufficiency of the evidence. The requirement for the government to prove each essential element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt is of immense importance in our criminal justice system. <em>See In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 363-64, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970) (\u201ca society that values the good name and freedom of every individual should not condemn a man for commission of a crime when there is reasonable doubt about his guilt\u201d). Accordingly! we review the sufficiency of the evidence de novo. <em>United States v. </em>Voss, 82 F.3d 1521, 1524-25 (10th Cir.1996). In so doing, We must \u201cview[ ] the evidence in the light most favorable to the government\u201d and ask whether \u201cany rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Vallo, </em>238 F.3d 1242, 1247 (10th Cir.2001); <em>accord Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). The discretion to resolve conflicting testimony, weigh the evidence, and draw inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts lies with the jury. <em>United States v. Nieto, </em>60 F.3d 1464, 1469 (10th Cir.1995). On the other hand, the evidence relied upon to support a conviction must be substantial and raise more than a mere suspicion of guilt. <em>United States v. Jameson, </em>478 F.3d 1204, 1208 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 321, 169 L.Ed.2d 227 (2007). Inferences may be properly drawn from the evidence but, to be reasonable, an inference must be based on more than mere conjecture and speculation, <em>United States v. Atencio, </em>435 F.3d 1222, 1232 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2310, 164 L.Ed.2d 830 (2006), and the jury is not permitted to arrive at a guilty verdict by piling inference upon inference, <em>Jameson, </em>478 F.3d at 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">To convict of second-degree murder under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1111(a) and 1153(a), the government must show the defendant (1) is American Indian (2) who killed the victim (3) unlawfully (4) with malice and (5) committed the crime within Indian Country. <em>See United States v. Visinaiz, </em>428 F.3d 1300, 1306 (10th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1123, 126 S.Ct. 1101, 163 L.Ed.2d 913 (2006). All parties concede Defendants are Indians and Tutt, also an Indian, was killed in Indian Country. Indeed, the only element with which Larry takes issue, and we think correctly, is whether the evidence was sufficient to convict him. <em>See United States v. Swallow, </em>109 F.3d 656, 659 (10th Cir.1997) (\u201cProximate cause of death is an essential component of both first-and second-degree murder.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">Both Henry and Larry denied involvement; neither self defense nor any other type of justification was at issue. Thus, the primary question is whether the evidence submitted to the jury was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt Larry killed Tutt or whether he aided and abetted the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-13\">Upon close examination of the testimony and evidence adduced against Larry, we conclude no rational trier of fact could have found him guilty of second-degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt. While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>there was certainly evidence indicating he was involved (along with others) in an assault of Tutt, the cause of death was not the assault, but rather a stabbing. Even viewed in the light most favorable to the government, the evidence simply does not sufficiently link Larry with the stabbing. The jury could have concluded the Def\u00e9ndants stayed at Hayes\u2019s shack the night before the murder weapon was found there. But the evidence also demonstrates the murder weapon was not discovered for over twelve hours after the stabbing allegedly occurred, at least three other individuals \u2014 Paul Hayes, Jr., his father and his father\u2019s girlfriend \u2014 stayed at the shack on the night of April 25, and the shack was freely accessible to all who wished to enter.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">The lack of forensic evidence connecting Larry to the killing is also noteworthy. The forensic pathologist stated Tutt lost large amounts of blood, probably two to two and a half quarts, and significant bleeding would have occurred given the nature of the injuries. Indeed, the testimony revealed that blood had covered surrounding tree branches, and yet authorities did not find any of Tutt\u2019s blood on Larry\u2019s clothing or the backpack he constantly carried. Neither could the government establish the time of death. The FBI also did not find any trace evidence from Tutt (i.e. hairs or fibers) on Larry\u2019s possessions and did not find any of Larry\u2019s DNA on Tutt. Lastly, the FBI found no fingerprints on the steak knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">The most damning bit of evidence against Larry is, of course, Dawes\u2019s testimony \u2014 he observed Henry (described as \u201cthe shorter [man]\u201d) and Larry (described as \u201cthe taller [man]\u201d) kicking and punching a man matching Tutt\u2019s description around dusk on April 25. (R. Vol. X at 166.) Despite the great distance from which Dawes made these observations and the inconsistencies in his statements regarding the number of individuals participating in the assault, we must assume his testimony is true and he did indeed see the Defendants hitting and kicking Tutt that evening. But while that fact incontrovertibly establishes battery of Tutt by the Defendants, it does not, without more, provide sufficient evidence to convict Larry of second-degree murder. Notably, Dawes never testified he saw a weapon of any sort, let .alone a steak knife. Moreover, the exculpatory evidence regarding the physical state of Larry\u2019s right hand only two days after the killing must function into the equation and Larry only confessed to buying and drinking \u201cocean\u201d with Tutt, hardly an admission to second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">Larry\u2019s spontaneous statement to Agent Hall is insufficient to lift the government\u2019s case over the threshold of reasonable doubt. He told Hall, \u201cI didn\u2019t stab him or I would have blood all over my jeans.\u201d (R. Vol. XI at 395 (quotations omitted).) We are somewhat baffled by the government\u2019s argument that this exculpatory statement is overt evidence of guilt. Even false exculpatory statements (which the government did not prove this was) cannot be considered by the jury as direct evidence of guilt. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>437 F.3d 989, 996 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1122, 126 S.Ct. 1935, 164 L.Ed.2d 682 (2006). Viewed in the light most'favorable to the government, Larry\u2019s statement is not sufficiently inculpatory, even when combined with drinking \u201cocean\u201d and participation in the assault on Tutt, to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>Moreover, Agent Hall admitted he did not believe Larry could have stabbed Tutt given the physical condition of his right hand at the time of the April 28 interview. He described the hand as extremely swollen, sutured, and bandaged and independently confirmed that Larry underwent hand surgery on April 10. Not only does this evidence cast some doubt on Dawes\u2019s testimony \u2014 he claimed he saw Larry hitting Tutt with his right hand \u2014 but it further erodes the already thin evidence in this record suggesting Larry might have killed Tutt.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Although the government is not required to present evidence which eliminates all possible hypotheses of innocence, \u201creadily available inferences of innocence\u201d must be factored into our determination of whether a reasonable jury could find a particular defendant guilty of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Maldonado v. Scully, </em>86 F.3d 32, 37 (2d Cir. 1996) (Oakes, J., dissenting). Suffice it to say that the evidence brought forth at trial, even when viewed in toto and in the light most favorable to the government, is insufficient to establish Larry\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">A comparison of the evidence against Larry with that presented in <em>United States v. Vallo, </em>is instructive. 238 F.3d 1242 (10th Cir.2001). In that case, we held the evidence was sufficient to support the defendants\u2019 (a mother for aiding and abetting and her boyfriend as a principal) second-degree murder convictions for the death of an infant. <em>Id. </em>at 1247-49. Although the type and quantity of evidence adduced in <em>Vallo </em>is by no means the minimum required to convict for second-degree murder, it is nonetheless illustrative. The evidence indicated the defendants had repeatedly assaulted the child on the date of his death and in the past (the defendants, in fact, admitted to doing so), and the expert medical testimony established the infant died from a recent combination of shaking and blunt force trauma. The evidence presented in <em>Vallo </em>\u2014 clear admissions of assaulting an infant (something which is, in and of itself, sufficient to cause death) coupled with scientific evidence and consistent past behavior \u2014 was vastly stronger than the evidence the jury took under consideration in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">Unfortunately, there are few other reported federal decisions addressing the sufficiency of the evidence presented in second-degree murder trials. We have located, however, a factually analogous state court decision. In <em>State v. White, </em>293 N.C. 91, 235 S.E.2d 55 (1977), the North Carolina Supreme Court concluded there was insufficient evidence to support the defendant\u2019s second-degree murder conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 59. The jury heard evidence in the case that the victim had lived in a mobile home adjacent to a motel where the defendant resided, the defendant frequently visited the victim, the defendant was a black male and a black male was seen running away from the mobile home on the evening of the killing, there was blood found on the carpet of the defendant\u2019s motel room, and a knife similar to the murder weapon was found in the defendant\u2019s motel room. <em>See id. </em>at 56-58. In reversing the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for non-suit, the North Carolina Supreme Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-10\">[t]he State has shown that the defendant was in the general vicinity of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>ceased\u2019s home at the time of the murder and that he made several arguably contradictory statements during the course of the police investigation. It may even reasonably be inferred that the defendant was at the home of the deceased when the deceased came to her death, or shortly thereafter. Thus, the State has established that the defendant had an opportunity to commit the crime charged. Beyond that we must sail in a sea of conjecture and surmise. This we are not permitted to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 59 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). This reasoning applies equally here.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">The government, however, also relies upon an aiding and abetting theory. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a), \u201c[wjhoever ... aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures [the] commission [of a crime] is punishable as a principal.\u201d The federal aiding and abetting statute does not establish a separate crime but merely eliminates \u201cthe common law distinction between principal and accessory.\u201d <em>United States v. Langston, </em>970 F.2d 692, 705-06 (10th Cir. 1992). Regardless, \u201cone cannot aid and abet a completed crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Ledezma, </em>26 F.3d 636, 642 (6th Cir.1994). A conviction based upon an aiding and abetting theory, therefore, requires the government to prove:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-6\">(1) that the defendant associated [himself] with a criminal venture; (2) that the defendant participated in the venture as something [he] wished to bring about; (3) that [he] sought by [his] actions to make it succeed; and, lastly, (4) that the proof establishes the commission of the offense by someone and the aiding and abetting by the defendant so charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-7\"><em>United States v. Lee, </em>54 F.3d 1534, 1540 (10th Cir.1995). \u201cAlthough knowledge a crime is being committed is relevant, some showing of intent to further the criminal venture must be introduced at trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Delgado-Uribe, </em>363 F.3d 1077, 1084 (10th Cir.2004); <em>see also United States v. Hanson, </em>41 F.3d 580, 582 (10th Cir.1994) (\u201cA defendant may not stumble into aiding and abetting liability by inadvertently helping another in a criminal scheme unknown to the defendant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">The government\u2019s case is not salvaged by its aiding and abetting theory. Aiding and abetting requires a defendant to \u201cwillfully associate himself with the criminal venture and seek to make the venture succeed through some action of his own.\u201d <em>United States v. Leos-Quijada, </em>107 F.3d 786, 794 (10th Cir.1997); <em>see also United States v. Sarracino, </em>131 F.3d 943, 946 (10th Cir.1997) (discussing the required elements of a conviction under an aiding and abetting theory). In other words, \u201c[t]he aider must have the <em>mens rea </em>to bring about the result committed by the other principals.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooley, </em>1 F.3d 985, 997 (10th Cir.1993); <em>see also United States v. Hatatley, </em>130 F.3d 1399, 1406 (10th Cir.1997) (discussing aiding and abetting liability and differentiating it from principal liability). That being said, the government was required to prove Larry participated in the assault and battery of Tutt intending (or reasonably expecting) it would bring about his death. An unpredictable stabbing during the assault (and certainly not later) would not satisfy that requirement. No evidence was presented from which a rational jury could find Larry participated with the knowledge or reasonable expectation the assault would be fatal. Because aiding and abetting requires specific intent, <em>United States v. Lambert, </em>995 F.2d 1006, 1008 (10th Cir.1993), the act of assaulting Tutt, standing alone, is insufficient. At the very least, the government was required to show Larry knew or should have known a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>dangerous weapon would be employed such that the jury could infer he appreciated the risk of mortal injury and participated in the assault nonetheless. But no such evidence, circumstantial or direct, was adduced. Consequently, there was insufficient evidence from which the jury could find Larry aided and abetted Tutt\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">C. <em>Henry Woody</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Henry claims Hayes\u2019s statements to Agent Hall regarding Defendants\u2019 propensity toward violence and talking about killing people when drinking were erroneously admitted. He argues Hayes\u2019s statements were not relevant (Fed.R.Evid. 401), were unduly prejudicial (Fed.R.Evid. 403), and for the first time, almost as an afterthought, argues the statement is inadmissible as evidence of Henry\u2019s character (Fed.R.Evid. 404(a)). Because the statements were originally intended to be introduced as substantive evidence, but actually came in as impeachment evidence, we separately address each context.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">1. Statements as Substantive Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">When the government attempted to introduce Hayes\u2019s statements to Agent Hall as substantive evidence during Hayes\u2019s direct examination, Henry objected on the basis of Rules 401 and 403. \u201cA district court has broad discretion ... and will be reversed only on a showing .... it [made] a clear error of judgment, exeeed[ed] the bounds of permissible choice, or when its decision is arbitrary, capricious or whimsical, or results in a manifestly unreasonable judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Nickl, </em>427 F.3d 1286, 1300 (10th Cir.2005) (quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">Rule 401 of the Federal Rules of Evidence defines relevant evidence as that which has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Henry claims Hayes\u2019s statements were irrelevant because (1) there was no foundation for Hayes\u2019s knowledge of Henry\u2019s conduct while drinking or angry, (2) there was no evidence the Defendants were angry the night of the murder, and (3) general threats directed at no one in particular are not probative of intent to kill a particular person. We easily reject the Rule 401 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">As to a lack of foundation, Hayes testified he knew Larry better than Henry, but that does not negate personal knowledge of Henry\u2019s behavior. Hayes admitted he was interviewed by Agent Hall and clearly stated his acquaintance with both Defendants as well as his personal knowledge of Larry\u2019s tendency to hit people when angry. Similarly, the lack of direct evidence that the Defendants were angry the night of the murder is not fatal. The jury could reasonably infer anger from their assault on Mr. Tutt.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-12\">The government concedes a defendant\u2019s generic threats to people other than the victim are generally inadmissible to show the defendant was predisposed to murder the victim. <em>See People v. Williams, </em>85 Ill.App.3d 850, 41 Ill.Dec. 110, 407 N.E.2d 608, 613 (Ill.App.Ct.1980); <em>see also Sikes v. State, </em>252 So.2d 258, 260-61 (Fla.Dist.App. Ct.1971); <em>State v. Faust, </em>254 N.C. 101, 118 S.E.2d 769, 772 (1961). However, it argues the statements at issue were relevant because they prove motive for the unpremeditated murder of Tutt, stating: \u201cIn this case, the United States offered the evidence to show that the Woody brothers become violent and angry while drinking. The evidence made it more probable that the Woody brothers attacked Tutt while drunk and angry, without any premedita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>tion or any cognizable motive.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s Br. at 15.) Apparently, the government maintains if the jury believed Hayes\u2019s statements to Hall about the Defendants\u2019 violent behavior and threats of murder, it could infer the assault escalated into murder. Given this explanation, the court could reasonably conclude the evidence was relevant, a relatively low hurdle.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">Henry\u2019s counsel-also objected to the admission of the evidence with a very general objection under Rule 403. Relevant evidence is excluded under Rule 403 if \u201cits probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 403. \u201cUnfair prejudice in the Rule 403 context \u2018means an undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.\u2019 \u201d <em>See United States v. Tan, </em>254 F.3d 1204, 1211 (10th Cir.2001) (quoting Fed. R.Evid. 403 advisory committee\u2019s note.)</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">We find the Seventh Circuit\u2019s discussion of motive in the context of Rule 404(b) instructive. In <em>United States v. Cunningham, </em>the court noted inadmissible character evidence (i <em>e., </em>propensity) and evidence of motive can \u201coverlap.\u201d 103 F.3d 553, 556 (7th Cir.1996). \u201cThey ... overlap when the crime is motivated by a taste for engaging in that crime or a compulsion to engage in it (an \u2018addiction\u2019), rather than by a desire for pecuniary gain or for some other advantage to which the crime is instrumental .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>The more \u201coverlap\u201d there is .in a given case, the greater the danger a jury will misuse the evidence, even when given a limiting instruction. In Henry\u2019s case, the overlap is complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">In opening argument, the government explained its theory of the case as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-7\">This case is almost without a motive. It\u2019s a fight. Kenneth Tutt got beaten. You say what was the motive? The motive you may infer from the evidence and the facts that you get, that Mr. Tutt had recently got paid, he had money, and he having money would be able to supply, with that money, the alcohol that these two defendants and Kenneth were drinking. He was a source for the procurement of alcohol. And when he didn\u2019t continue to procure it, he got beaten, punished, stabbed and killed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">(R. Vol. VIII at 128.) Hayes\u2019s statements regarding the Defendant\u2019 propensity toward violence when drinking was the only evidence supporting this theory. There was testimony Tutt gave Larry some money to buy \u201cocean,\u201d but no evidence Tutt had just been paid, no evidence Tutt and either Defendant argued over money, no evidence linking the murder to robbery, and no money found on Henry or Larry. Consequently, only the Defendants\u2019 violent and threatening characters lend credence to the government\u2019s theory of Tutt\u2019s murder. As a result, the \u201cmotive\u201d evidence is nothing more than evidence of Henry\u2019s general propensity toward violence when drinking and angry. \u201cShowing that a man is generally bad has never been under our system allowable. The defendant has a right to be tried on the truth of the specific charge contained in the indictment.\u201d <em>United States v. Gilliland, </em>586 F.2d 1384, 1389 (10th Cir.1978). We conclude the district court erred in allowing evidence of Henry\u2019s violent character.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">The government argues that if there was error, it was harmless because no actual character \u201cevidence\u201d was adduced through Hayes\u2019s continued denial he made the statement. The statements were presented to the jury solely through the government\u2019s questions, which are not evidence, as the court so instructed. If this were the only introduction of Hayes\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>statements, we might agree. However, the statements were reintroduced and affirmed by Hall only a short time later.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">2. Statements as Impeachment Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Henry argues the district court improperly allowed the government to introduce inadmissible substantive evidence under the guise of impeachment. Although Henry did object to the use of the statement as improper impeachment, he did so only because he claimed Hayes\u2019s testimony at trial was not inconsistent, an objection correctly overruled by the court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">Rule 613(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-8\">(b) Extrinsic evidence of prior inconsistent statement of witness. Extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a witness is not admissible unless the witness is afforded an opportunity to explain or deny the same and the opposite party is afforded an opportunity to interrogate the witness thereon, or the interests of justice otherwise require. This provision does not apply to admissions of a party-opponent as defined in rule 801(d)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">Rule 607 states: \u201cThe credibility of a witness may be attacked by any party, including the party calling the witness.\u201d Read together, Rules 607 and 613(b) allow a party to impeach its own witness with extrinsic evidence of prior inconsistent statements. <em>See United States v. Carter, </em>973 F.2d 1509, 1512 (10th Cir.1992). Before such evidence is allowed, however, it must meet certain requirements. First, under Rule 613(b), the witness must be confronted with the statement and afforded an opportunity to explain or deny it. The record clearly demonstrates this requirement was met.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">There are further restrictions, however, to impeachment evidence. While not specifically incorporated in Rule 607 or Rule 613(b), when the contradiction relates to a \u201ccollateral matter,\u201d impeachment may be received only through the testimony of the witness to be impeached. <em>United States v. Durham, </em>470 F.3d 727, 732 (8th Cir.2006). Evidence extrinsic to that witness\u2019s testimony is inadmissible to prove a witness\u2019s trial testimony is contradicted by a previous statement. The application of the collateral matter rule is an extension of Rule 403, which also remains controlling in admitting impeachment evidence. M; <em>see also United States v. Buffalo, </em>358 F.3d 519, 524-25 (8th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-14\">In addition, upon admission of prior inconsistent statements, \u201c[i]t is well settled that contradictory statements introduced for the purpose of impeachment are not admissible as substantive evidence.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number><em>United States v. Neal, 452 </em>F.2d 1085, 1086 (10th Cir.1971); <em>see also Carter, </em>973 F.2d at 1512 (\u201cA witness\u2019 prior statements are admissible only to impeach or discredit the witness and are not competent substantive evidence of the facts to which the former statements relate.\u201d) (quotations omitted).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Henry maintains Hayes\u2019s statements about the Defendants\u2019 conduct when drinking fail each of these tests: (1) Hayes\u2019s statement concerned an irrelevant, collateral issue; (2) the evidence was highly prejudicial and its probative value regarding Hayes\u2019s credibility was negligible; and (3) the statements were used as substantive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">a. <em>Collateral Matter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">The collateral matter rule is a subset of a court\u2019s authority to exclude impeachment evidence under Rule 403. <em>U.S. v. Walker, </em>930 F.2d 789, 791 (10th Cir.1991). \u201cA matter has been held to be collateral if it could not have been introduced in evidence for any purpose independent of the impeachment.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Rosario Fuentez, </em>231 F.3d 700, 707 (10th Cir.2000) (\u201cBecause the truth-seeking function of the court would be impaired, and because the questions [the witness] refused to answer were germane to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>issues in the indictment, the testimony was not collateral.\u201d); <em>Fryar v. Curtis, </em>485 F.3d 179, 184 (1st Cir.2007) (\u201cA matter is considered collateral if the matter itself is not relevant in the litigation to establish a fact of consequence, i.e., not relevant for a purpose other than mere contradiction of the in-court testimony of the witness. Stated another way, extrinsic evidence to disprove a fact testified to by a witness is admissible when it satisfies the Rule 403 balancing test and is not barred by any other rule of evidence.\u201d). The danger of allowing impeachment via a collateral matter is that when the fact to be impeached is not material, \u201cthe trier of fact may become confused by the attention directed at an unimportant fact. As a result, the trier of fact may attach undue importance to extraneous matters.\u201d 27 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Victor James Gold, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 6096.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">In <em>Walker, </em>the defendant was charged with two counts of illegal possession of a firearm. One of the counts stemmed from an incident in which Walker drove to Hyle\u2019s house, a man he suspected was dating his ex-wife. Hyle testified Walker shot at him and he returned fire. To impeach this testimony, Walker attempted to introduce evidence of the investigating officer\u2019s testimony in a prior hearing that Hyle told the officer Walker did not shoot first. The trial court allowed Walker to put the officer on the stand. However, when the officer did not testify he was told Hyle shot first, the court precluded further questioning of the witness. We upheld the trial court\u2019s decision, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-6\">There is no dispute that the issue of whether at some prior time Mr. Hyle stated he had fired first was relevant only for impeachment purposes. The indictment charged only the status offense of possession of a weapon and did not include assault charges. Who fired first was irrelevant to the issue of guilt. The defense effort to impeach Mr. Hyle on the issue of who fired first was therefore a collateral issue.... [Ijmpeachment on a collateral matter [is] properly excluded in the discretion of the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">930 F.2d at 791-92 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">\u201cThat evidence concerns a collateral matter does not, of course, necessarily render it inadmissible. To the contrary, such evidence is admissible provided that it is \u2018relevant\u2019 and not otherwise prescribed by law or rule.\u201d <em>United States v. Fonseca, </em>435 F.3d 369, 374-75 (D.C.Cir.2006). Under Rule 401, evidence that contradicts a witness\u2019s trial testimony, even on a collateral subject, may be relevant \u201cbecause it would undermine [his] credibility as a witness regarding facts of consequence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375; <em>see also United States v. Marino, </em>277 F.3d 11, 24 (1st Cir.2002) (\u201cNevertheless, extrinsic evidence to disprove a fact testified to by a witness may be admissible if the trial judge deems that it satisfies the Rule 403 balancing test <em>and </em>it is not excluded by another rule.\u201d). Therefore, we proceed to review the admission of Hayes\u2019s statements under a Rule 403 analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">b. <em>Rule 403</em></p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">Rule 403 requires the court to balance the relative probative and prejudicial value of evidence. This \u201cserves to prevent a party from calling a witness, knowing him or her to be adverse, merely to make an end-run around the rule against hearsay by impeaching the witness with a prior inconsistent statement that the jury would not otherwise have been allowed to hear.\u201d <em>Durham, </em>470 F.3d at 732 (quotations omitted). The applicable inquiry is whether, under Rule 403, \u201c[t]he prior statements are inculpatory to [the defendant] if considered to be true.\u201d <em>United States v. Logan, </em>121 F.3d 1172, 1175 (8th Cir.1997). If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>so, \u201cto be admissible, their value for im-' peachment purposes \u2014 or portraying or exposing [the witness] as a person who is unworthy of belief \u2014 has to outweigh the danger of unfair prejudice and jury confusion that those prior statements may create if admitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The value of impeachment, then, is determined after an examination of the entire testimony of the witness to be impeached.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Hayes\u2019s testimony established his age, 34; the location and lack of security of his residence; his acquaintance with the Defendants; a birthday party on August 25, 2004; the presence of his father and his father\u2019s companion on the 25th in the shack; he did not see the Defendants on the 25th or 26th; he was interviewed by Agent Hall and another officer; Henry stutters when he gets nervous;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Hayes did not remember or did not think he made certain statements to Agent Hall. In other words, he did not testify to much of anything demonstrating Henry\u2019s guilt. Instead, any impeachment was most probative of what Hayes denied or could not remember at trial. Thus, the probative value of the impeachment, challenging his credibility to undermine the subject matter of his testimony, was negligible. Moreover, Hayes\u2019s credibility was already attacked by the court when it admonished him during his direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">On the other hand, the admission of Henry\u2019s alleged behavior when drinking or angry was highly prejudicial. No other witness testified to Henry\u2019s propensity for violence when drinking or his tendency to make death threats when angry. We recognize \u201cexclusion of evidence under Rule 403 that is otherwise admissible under the other rules \u2018is an extraordinary remedy and should be used sparingly.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tan, </em>254 F.3d at 1211 (quoting <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>192 F.3d 946, 949 (10th Cir. 1999)). However, \u201cthe danger of confusion which arises from the introduction of testimony under circumstances such as are presented here is so great as to upset the balance and to warrant continuation of the rule of exclusion.\u201d <em>United States v. Ince, </em>21 F.3d 576, 580 (4th Cir.1994) (quotations omitted). Thus, the unfair prejudice of Hayes\u2019s out-of-court statement substantially outweighed the probative value and were inadmissible to impeach Hayes under Rule 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">c. <em>Substantive Use of Impeachment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">Because Hayes\u2019s descriptions of the Defendants\u2019 behavior was not admitted for its truth, the jury could not properly consider them evidence of Henry\u2019s motivation to kill or of his guilt. <em>United States v. Magleby, </em>241 F.3d 1306, 1313 n. 4 (10th Cir.2001). Henry maintains, despite the court\u2019s limiting instruction to the jury, this is exactly how the government urged the jury to use the information in reaching a verdict. We must agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">In closing, the government stated, \u201cIn the course of the impeachment [of Hayes], later through Agent Hall, it was developed impeachment style on Hayes that he told Agent Hall when these two defendants get mad, they talk about killing people and [when] they drink, they threaten people. This is for you to decide because you\u2019re the best people to do this.\u201d (R. Vol. XII at 480.) In other words, the government invited the jury to use the impeachment testimony not to judge Hayes\u2019s credibility, but to believe his statements to Hall and determine Defendants\u2019 guilt from an inference they are violent characters who will murder when drinking and angry.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>Indeed, the government continues to use the impeachment evidence for substantive purposes on appeal. In its harmless error argument, the government posits the evidence against Henry was sufficient, in part, because the evidence showed \u201cHenry Woody told Paul Hayes not to say anything to the police about the murder.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s Br. at 26.) However, that \u201cfact\u201d was introduced solely through the impeachment testimony of Agent Hall, and therefore cannot be considered as evidence of Henry\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">We sympathize with the district court given the lack of assistance from counsel for all parties in appropriately defining the evidentiary issues. However, despite our deferential review of the court\u2019s evidentiary decisions, we conclude the admission of Hayes\u2019s statement was error. The probative value was far outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and jury confusion. Given the facts before us, the admission of Hayes\u2019s statements regarding Henry\u2019s propensity toward violence \u201cplaced the underlying fairness of the entire trial in doubt.\u201d <em>See Rosario Fuentez, </em>231 F.3d at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">As discussed in Larry\u2019s appeal, the evidence supporting Henry and Larry\u2019s guilt overlapped and, as a whole, was weak at best. In addition, the possibility the jury used these statements as substantive evidence cannot be ignored.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-7\">The introduction of such testimony, even where limited to impeachment, necessarily increases the possibility that a defendant may be convicted on the basis of unsworn evidence, for despite proper instructions to the jury, it is often difficult for jurors to distinguish between impeachment and substantive evidence.... When the prosecution attempts to introduce a prior inconsistent statement to impeach its own witness, the statement\u2019s likely prejudicial impact often substantially outweighs its probative value for impeachment purposes because the jury may ignore the judge\u2019s limiting instructions and consider the \u201cimpeachment\u201d testimony for substantive purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-10\"><em>Ince, </em>21 F.3d at 580-81 (quotations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Beno, </em>324 F.2d 582, 587 (2d Cir.1963) (\u201cBy attempting to show [the defendant] was the sort of man likely to be the perpetrator of crime, the prosecution denied him a fair opportunity to defend against the particular crime charged, for this sort of evidence weighs too heavily with the jury and makes impossible the dispassionate approach necessary if justice is to be achieved.\u201d). Given the paucity of the government\u2019s evidence (including the lack of forensic evidence against Henry), the small probative value of impeaching Hayes, the government\u2019s suggestion in closing that the jury use the statements for substantive purposes (coupled with an unsupported comment that Hayes was afraid of the Defendants), we must conclude the admission of Henry\u2019s propensity toward violence requires reversal and a new trial. Therefore, the remainder of Henry\u2019s claims are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">Because the government failed to present sufficient evidence to find Larry Woody guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, his conviction is REVERSED.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s erroneous admission of evidence showing Henry Woody\u2019s general propensity toward violent behavior placed the underlying fairness of the entire trial in doubt.

Henry's counsel objected to the admission of impeachment evidence under Rule 613 arguing that because Hayes testified he could not remember making the statements, the report was not inconsistent with Hayes\u2019s testimony. The court overruled the objection stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-11\">His testimony was quite mixed with \"I don\u2019t remember\u201d or very affirmative \"no\u2019s\u201d when he was very specifically asked, Did you say this, did you do this? .... And I think that there was a great deal or potential great deal of inconsistency in the statements as the witness is going to relate them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-15\">(R. Vol. XI at 400.) Henry wisely does not raise this argument on appeal. <em>See United States v. Rogers, </em>549 F.2d 490, 496 (8th Cir. 1976) (\"A statement\u2019s inconsistency may be determined from the circumstances and is not limited to cases in which diametrically opposite assertions have been made.

Insana, </em>423 F.2d 1165, 1169-70 (2d Cir.1970) (\"The conclusion that prior testimony inconsistent with a present lack of memory may be admissible as a contradiction is not a novel one.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b908-4\">. Henry also argues, although the evidence was not admissible for substantive purposes, the government\u2019s primary purpose was to place the evidence before the jury for just that purpose. \u201cEvery circuit has said evidence that is inadmissible for substantive purposes may not be purposely introduced under the pretense of impeachment.\" <em>United States v. Peterman, </em>841 F.2d 1474, 1479 n. 3 (10th Cir.1988) (listing cases); <em>see also Carter, </em>973 F.2d at 1512 (\u201cThe government may not introduce evidence of prior statements under the guise of impeachment for the <em>primary </em>purpose of placing before the jury substantive evidence which is not otherwise admissible.\u201d) (quotations omitted). A party may not call a witness knowing the witness will not provide substantive testimony but only to impeach the witness with damaging prior statements that would, otherwise, be inadmissible. However, the determination to admit or exclude impeachment evidence pivots on the intentions of counsel. <em>See Peterman, </em>841 F.2d at 1480 (factual findings by the trial court supported its conclusion the prosecutor did not call witness with the primary purpose of introducing evidence of his prior conviction.). In <em>United States v. Clifton, </em>the defendant challenged the admission of impeachment testimony that would have been inadmissible hearsay. 406 F.3d 1173 (10th Cir.2005). In his concurrence, Judge Hartz observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-5\">The <em>Peterman </em>rule strikes me as passing strange. Why should the admissibility of evidence depend on the state of mind of the attorney proffering the evidence? To be sure, the prosecutor's motive plays a limited role in some legal issues ... But it is hard to find support in the Federal Rules of Evidence for considering attorney intent as a factor in determining admissibility. Instead, as one would expect, we look at factors relating to the probative and unfairly prejudicial impact of the evidence. Of course, the more such prejudicial impact exceeds the probative value, the greater the likelihood that the prosecutor\u2019s motive in proffering the evidence was impure. But when the unfairly prejudicial impact substantially predominates, we should not admit the evidence just because the prosecutor\u2019s thoughts are pure, nor should we exclude evidence on the ground of prosecutorial obliquity when the probative value is not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. There is significant authority for my view. <em>See United States v. Ince, 21 </em>F.3d 576, 580 (4th Cir.1994) (\"Federal evidence law does <em>not </em>ask the judge ... to crawl inside the prosecutor\u2019s head to divine his or her true motivation.\u201d); <em>United States v.
