We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the BIA order for substantial evidence and will uphold the BIA\u2019s determination unless the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-23\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Rokni\u2019s past experiences do not rise to the level of persecution. \u201c[Pjersecution is an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive.\u201d <em>Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1431 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-24\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Rokni does not have a well-founded fear of persecution if he returned to Iran. <em>See Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 964 (9th Cir.1996) (en bane). Rokni testified and submitted documents to support his claim of a well-founded fear. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>The IJ and BIA did not find Rokni\u2019s testimony or the documents incredible. Rather, the documents were given little weight because they were not authenticated and did not indicate the reasons why the Iranian authorities were interested in Rokni upon his return. The evidence does not compel a reversal of the BIA\u2019s determination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Because Rokni failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he has necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Movsisian v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1095, 1097 (9th Cir. 2005). Rokni has also failed to meet the standard for CAT relief. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156-57 (9th Cir. 2003); <em>Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1284 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b853-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
