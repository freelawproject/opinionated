On August 24, 2007, we granted the parties\u2019 joint motion to waive oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b752-8\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">Tyrone Williams entered a guilty plea to conspiracy to produce child pornography. He was sentenced to a term of 360 months in prison, the statutory maximum. Williams now appeals, arguing that the district court mistakenly considered, as relevant conduct, evidence that he gave minors drugs and alcohol to encourage them to have sex with him. Williams also challenges two enhancements that were applied in formulating his advisory guideline range: one for leading and organizing the conspiracy and another for distributing child pornography. Finally, he claims that he was wrongly denied a three-level reduction in his guideline range for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">Williams, who was born in 1972 and was in his midtwenties or early thirties during certain times in this case, enjoyed having sex with young teenagers while photographing and videotaping the liaisons. Pleased with his handiwork, he frequently shared the photos and videos with others. One of the girls Williams had sex with was Sarah Smith, whom he met in 1998. She was 12 years old at the time and working, sadly to be sure, as a prostitute.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">About five years later, Smith introduced Williams to a 14-year-old girl, \u201cD.B\u201d, whom Smith had taken under her wing. Smith asked Williams to teach D.B. how to \u201cact\u201d like a prostitute. Williams had sex with D.B. on more than 100 occasions, usually after giving her drugs and alcohol. He photographed and videotaped these encounters, storing the images on his computer\u2019s hard drive, a flash drive, and compact discs.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-12\">Sometime in 2004, Williams and Smith (who was now 18 years old) met several other young girls ranging in age from 12 to 16. Some of these girls went to Williams\u2019 home for alcohol and marijuana. He then, often, had sex with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-13\">In December 2004, Williams took D.B. and Smith to the home of Douglas Evans and Rocky May. There, D.B. posed in several pictures, including one of D.B. exposing her breasts and another of D.B. and Williams simulating sexual acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-14\">Later that day, Williams drove Smith and D.B. to meet two of his cousins, Robert and Kevin Williams. After picking up Robert and Kevin at their apartment, Williams drove the entire group to a nearby Bloomington, Illinois, motel, where he paid cash for a room for the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-15\">In the crowded motel room, Williams (and Robert) gave D.B. alcohol and marijuana. Williams also took explicit pictures and videos of D.B., during which he played <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>director, instructing others to pose for the camera.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Williams recorded various scenes: Smith performing oral sex on D.B.; Williams having sex with D.B. while passing a marijuana cigarette; a nude D.B., Smith, and Williams, with Williams kissing Smith and D.B.\u2019s breasts; Robert kissing D.B.\u2019s breasts; and Kevin naked in the shower with Smith and D.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">On March 28, 2005, Williams and D.B. stayed another night in a Bloomington motel. Williams gave D.B. alcohol and marijuana, had sex with her, and instructed her to pose in several pictures and videos. These included photographs and videos of D.B. exposing her breasts. Williams also videotaped D.B. wearing only underwear, doing a handstand. On the video, Williams repeatedly asks D.B. to stand on her head and thrust her genitals up and down. D.B. did as directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">On April 23, 2005, D.B. went to Williams\u2019 home, where Williams took pictures of D.B. exposing her breasts. Williams also photographed and videotaped D.B. dancing provocatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">In December 2005, D.B., Williams, and his 15-year-old son, D.J., gathered at the home of Brian Isaac, where Williams then lived. Williams directed everyone to pose for the camera. He instructed Isaac to rub D.B.\u2019s genitals over her pants and rub her breasts over her shirt. Isaac also had sex with D.B. Williams took pictures of D.J. having sex with D.B., D.B. exposing her breasts, and D.B. and Williams having oral sex. One image depicted D.B. wiping her face after Williams had ejaculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">In mid-January 2006, Bloomington police received an anonymous tip about Williams\u2019 activities with underage girls. After executing a search warrant for Williams\u2019 home, the police found a digital camera, video camera, computer, compact discs, and videotapes. They also found three videotapes and at least twenty images of child pornography. This led to his indictment in federal court on numerous counts. After pleading guilty to the conspiracy count, which covered a one-year period ending in December of 2006, several other counts were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-11\">At Williams\u2019 sentencing hearing, after ruling on the parties\u2019 objections, the district court concluded that Williams\u2019 offense level was 47. With a criminal history category of III, the statutory maximum sentence for the offense-360 months-became the advisory guideline sentence. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 5Gl.l(a). That sentence was then imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-12\">Williams first argues that the district court should not have considered, as relevant conduct, evidence that he provided alcohol and drugs to several minors (other than D.B.) to encourage them to have sex with him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review relevant conduct determinations for clear error. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>342 F.3d 731, 734 (7th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-13\">At sentencing, Williams identified as irrelevant to the offense of conviction-conspiracy to produce child pornography\u2014 information in paragraph 11 of the presentence report (PSR), which says that \u201c[sjometime in 2004,\u201d Williams and Smith met seven minors (other than D.B.). According to the PSR, Williams provided many of these minors with alcohol and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>drugs to encourage them to have sex with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Because Williams never objected to the accuracy of this information before the district court, we need not consider his current argument that the government presented insufficient evidence to support a finding that he was involved with other minors. <em>See United States v. Barevich, </em>445 F.3d 956, 958 (7th Cir.2006) (defendant\u2019s concessions about relevant conduct limited his claims on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">According to paragraph 11 of the PSR, Williams <em>met </em>seven minors in 2004. It is unclear, however, when exactly he gave these minors drugs and alcohol and attempted to seduce them. This question is important because, under USSG \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(A), relevant conduct must have taken place during one of three periods: the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense. According to the indictment, the facts of which Williams could not contest after entering his guilty plea, <em>United States v. Tolson, </em>988 F.2d 1494, 1500 (7th Cir.1993), the conspiracy began \u201cin or about December, 2004\u201d and continued \u201cthrough in or about December, 2005.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Thus, only if Williams\u2019 involvement with these minors took place during the conspiracy \u2014 roughly between December 2004 and December 2005 \u2014 can these activities be considered relevant conduct. Williams\u2019 testimony at sentencing cleared up the ambiguity in the PSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Williams testified that in December 2005, he hosted several children at his home:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-8\">Q: How many children are in your house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-9\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-10\">Q: How many children?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-11\">A: It was my son, my nephew, D.B., and my son and friends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-12\">Q: And about six other kids, Bianca; right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-13\">A: Yes'.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-14\">Williams further testified that, during this gathering, he took nude photos of T.W., one of the minors identified in paragraph 11 of the PSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-15\">In ruling on Williams\u2019 objection, the district court concluded that Williams\u2019 own testimony established that \u201cthere w[ere] other minor girls that [Williams] was involved with besides DB.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-16\">From the combination of paragraph 11 of the PSR and Williams\u2019 testimony at sentencing, the district court could properly conclude that Williams did, in fact, seduce minor children (other than D.B.) during the period of the conspiracy. As a result, the district court did not clearly err in identifying as relevant conduct Williams\u2019 involvement with minors other than D.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-17\">Williams next argues that, the district court mistakenly enhanced his guideline range by two levels under USSG \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(3) for distributing material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-18\">At the sentencing hearing, Williams argued that images of D.B.\u2019s exposed breasts and of Williams licking D.B.\u2019s exposed breasts did not reflect conduct serious enough to constitute \u201csexual exploitation of a minor.\u201d As a result, he argued, these photos cannot form the basis of the distribution enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-19\">In response, the government told the court that another photo was much more graphic: it depicted Smith and D.B. engaged in oral sex. A witness, Bloomington Police Officer Michael Fazio, confirmed this description.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-20\">Williams\u2019 counsel acknowledged that -a photo depicting oral sex between Smith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>and D.B. would, in fact, reflect \u201csexual exploitation\u201d that could properly serve as the basis for a distribution enhancement. Williams\u2019 counsel, however, argued that because his version of the photo was blacked out, he could not determine whether the photo depicted \u201csimulated or real\u201d oral sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The government then volunteered to show Williams\u2019 attorney an untouched version of the photo. Williams\u2019 counsel responded that \u201c[he didn\u2019t] need to see it.\u201d Instead, the attorney suggested that \u201c[they] just put [the photograph] in the record and ... let the Court decide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Based on the government\u2019s proffer and Officer Fazio\u2019s testimony, the district court adopted the probation officer\u2019s position and imposed the two-level enhancement. The photo was introduced into evidence at the conclusion of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">First, we disagree with the government that, by requesting that the court rule on the content of the photo, Williams\u2019 counsel waived Williams\u2019 right to appellate review of this issue. The government is correct that Williams\u2019 counsel represented at sentencing that \u201cif the photograph in fact depicted oral sex being performed on a minor, ... [then] the enhancement would apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">Waiver principles, however, are construed liberally in favor of the defendant. <em>United States v. Ortiz, </em>431 F.3d 1035, 1038 (7th Cir.2005). We interpret the suggestions of Williams\u2019 counsel \u2014 that the photo be admitted into evidence and that the court make its factual finding on the content \u2014 as statements relating to procedure. Through these statements, Williams communicated his decision not to make his own proffer to the court, cross-examine Officer Fazio, or introduce other evidence relating to the photo\u2019s content. Nowhere, however, does Williams\u2019 counsel communicate an intention to abandon Williams\u2019 right to an appellate review of the court\u2019s factual finding. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">Since Williams has preserved his right to challenge the court\u2019s factual findings relating to the photo, we may now turn to the argument Williams makes on appeal. He contends that \u201cunless the photo shows an act of oral intercourse as represented, rather than a mock pose, ... this enhancement does not apply.\u201d But whether that claim is right or wrong is immaterial because the district court was on solid ground when it concluded \u2014 based on the government\u2019s proffer, Officer Fazio\u2019s corroborating testimony, and no conflicting evidence \u2014 that the untouched version of the photo reflected Smith performing real, not simulated, oral sex on D.B. Thus, the district court properly enhanced Williams\u2019 sentence by two levels for distributing material involving Smith\u2019s sexual exploitation of D.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">In his next challenge, Williams contends that the district court erred in enhancing his guideline range by four levels under USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) for leading or organizing a criminal activity involving five or more people. Whether a defendant served in a leadership capacity is a finding of fact that we review for clear error. <em>See United States v. Reneslacis, </em>349 F.3d 412, 416 (7th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-12\">Williams first claims that the conspiracy did not involve at least five people, nor was it \u201cotherwise extensive.\u201d At sentencing, Williams argued that because the court should not count the minor victims as \u201cparticipants,\u201d the magic number of five was not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-13\">Unfortunately for Williams, the number five is very much alive. In his brief, Williams shoots himself in the foot by acknowledging that he and four other adults \u2014 Sarah Smith, Kevin Williams, Robert Williams, and Brian Isaac \u2014 partid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>pated in one of two \u201csex parties\u201d in December 2004 and December 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Additionally, according to the PSR, two other adults, Evans and May, were involved in the conspiracy. Because Williams counts as a \u201cparticipant,\u201d <em>United States v. Schweihs, </em>971 F.2d 1302, 1318 (7th Cir.1992), the total number of participants is seven. Thus, because the conspiracy involved over five participants, we need not consider whether D.B. and other minors can be properly added to this total. The district court correctly imposed the leadership enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Williams\u2019 second challenge to the district court\u2019s application of the leadership enhancement requires no arithmetic. Williams denies that he directed and controlled others to participate in the conspiracy. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">In assessing whether Williams was a leader or organizer of the conspiracy, we consider his exercise of decision-making authority, the nature of his participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree he participated in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority he exercised over others. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">It is clear that Williams was the bellwether of this operation. He recruited accomplices, including his own cousins. Williams was the common denominator of each of the sex parties. He played the role of \u201cdirector,\u201d frequently instructing those present to pose for the digital camera and video camera, both of which he owned. Williams also claimed the fruits of the crime \u2014 the sexually explicit photos and videos, some of which he posted on his Web site. Because Williams \u201cmarshall[ed] other individuals for the purpose of executing the crime,\u201d <em>United States v. Wasz, </em>450 F.3d 720, 730 (7th Cir.2006), the district court properly labeled him a leader or organizer of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">Lastly, Williams argues that he accepted responsibility for his participation in the conspiracy and, as a result, deserved a downward adjustment in his range under USSG \u00a7 3E1.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">When the probation officer recommended, in the. PSR, that Williams get an acceptance of responsibility credit, the government initially had no objection. After Williams \u201cfrivolously and falsely\u201d objected to certain facts in the PSR, however, the government objected to the downward adjustment. The government argued that by contesting certain facts relating to his participation in the crime, Williams disavowed his responsibility for the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">The district court agreed with the government and denied Williams an acceptance of responsibility adjustment. The court emphasized that Williams downplayed the magnitude of his conduct and denied that he gave liquor and marijuana to minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">On appeal, Williams argues that he did, in fact, acknowledge responsibility for his role in the conspiracy. He asserts that he admitted that he both supplied marijuana to minors and \u201cfacilitated\u201d the minors\u2019 consumption of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">While Williams consistently admitted that he provided marijuana to minors, he acknowledged only that he indirectly facilitated the use of alcohol. By falsely denying or frivolously contesting relevant conduct that the district court determined was true, Williams acted in a manner inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 1(a); <em>see also United States v. Leahy, </em>464 F.3d 773, 791-92 (7th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Moreover, the district court properly concluded that Williams minimized the magnitude of his conduct. During his allocution, Williams stated that he \u201caccept[ed] everything that [he] did.\u201d In the same breath, however, Williams suggested that his conduct was harmless, stating that \u201c[he] basically [didn\u2019t] consider [himself] as trying to make a grown man or a grown woman do something that they [sic] don\u2019t want to do.\u201d Williams also suggested that he played an unremarkable role in the conspiracy, complaining that \u201ceverybody pointed [him] out like [he was] the bad guy\u201d and that \u201c[he didn\u2019t] consider [him]self [to be] a ring leader.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Thus, the district court properly denied Williams the acceptance of responsibility adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b753-9\">. As the government notes, it is unclear to what extent the court\u2019s consideration of this conduct affected Williams\u2019 sentence. This information was not used to calculate Williams\u2019 offense level or to determine any specific offense characteristics. It is possible, however, that the district court denied Williams an acceptance of responsibility adjustment, in part, because he denied that he provided alcohol to minors.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
