To the extent petitioner challenges the discretionary denial of his application for cancellation of removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a), petitioner has failed to raise a colorable constitutional or legal claim to invoke our jurisdiction over the petition. <em>See Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001). Accordingly, the court <em>sua sponte </em>dismisses this petition for review for lack of jurisdiction with respect to the denial of cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Montero-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>277 F.3d 1137, 1144 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-24\">We also conclude that the Board of Immigration Appeals did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s motion to remand to apply for asylum because petitioner failed to establish prima facie eligibility for that form of relief. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>\u00a7 1003.2(c); <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Ordonez v. INS, </em>345 F.3d 777, 785 (9th Cir.2003). Accordingly, this petition is denied in part because the questions raised by this petition for review with respect to the denial of petitioner\u2019s request for remand are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">All other pending motions are denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part, DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b820-25\"> pjjjg disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
