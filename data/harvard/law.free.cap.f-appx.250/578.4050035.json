The district court found Sanmiguel was a leader or organizer of a conspiracy consisting of at least five members and therefore found a four-level enhancement to Sanmiguel\u2019s offense level was proper pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 3B1.1(a) (2005). The court sentenced Sanmiguel to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment, at the bottom of the applicable sentencing guidelines range, and Sanmiguel appealed. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">On appeal, Sanmiguel contests only the USSG \u00a7 3B1.1(a) enhancement. We review the district court\u2019s determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense for clear error. <em>United States v. Sayles, </em>296 F.3d 219, 224 (4th Cir.2002). To qualify for a four-level increase under \u00a7 3B1.1(a), a defendant must have been \u201can organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d After reviewing the relevant materials, including the transcript of the sentencing hearing, we find no clear error in the district court\u2019s application of the four-level enhancement for Sanmiguel\u2019s leadership role.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Accordingly, we affirm Sanmiguel\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
