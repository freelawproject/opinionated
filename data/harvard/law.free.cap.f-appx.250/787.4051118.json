We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Rossi v. Motion Picture Ass\u2019n of Am. Inc., </em>391 F.3d 1000, 1002 (9th Cir.2004), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">According to defendants\u2019 affidavits Kitts was identified as the primary suspect in an armed robbery and in his attempt to flee, he drove his vehicle toward two police officers. <em>See Arpin v. Santa Clara Valley Transp. Agency, </em>261 F.3d 912, 921 (9th Cir.2001) (outlining factors in excessive force analysis \u2014 severity of the crime, immediacy of the threat the suspect poses, and whether the individual is actively resisting arrest or attempting to flee). Kitts\u2019 affidavit failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendants\u2019 use of force was unreasonable under the circumstances. <em>See Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 397, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989) (police may use only such force as is objectively reasonable under the circumstances); <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001) (\u201cIf no constitutional right would have been violated were the allegations established, there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b814-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
