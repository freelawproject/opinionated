Williams argues that his sentence of 78 months of imprisonment, which was within the applicable advisory sentencing guidelines range, is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Williams asserts that his sentence should have been lower than the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-20\">Williams did not raise a specific objection in the district court to the reasonableness of his sentence, which could result in review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Martinez, </em>485 F.3d 270, 272 (5th Cir.2007). We need not decide whether plain error applies, however, because even under a reasonableness standard, Williams\u2019s arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-21\">There is no dispute that the guidelines range was properly calculated. Thus, Williams\u2019s sentence is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 553-54 (5th Cir.2006). In order to review a sentence for reasonableness, this court must examine whether the district court\u2019s sentence failed to \u201caccount for a factor that should have received significant weight,\u201d gave \u201csignificant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor,\u201d or represented \u201ca clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 376 (5th Cir. 2007), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(May 21, 2007)(No. 06-11834). A review of the record results in the finding that Williams\u2019s sentence does not fall \u201cso far afoul\u201d of one of these standards. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Williams also argues that his sentence is unreasonable as a matter of law because this court\u2019s application of a presumption of reasonableness to sentences imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is in violation of the Sixth Amendment and the principles announced in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He concedes that the argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent but raises it to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Williams\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-66, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), wherein the Supreme Court affirmed the use of a presumption of reasonableness to review sentences imposed within the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b110-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
