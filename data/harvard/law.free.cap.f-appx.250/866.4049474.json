O\u2019BRIEN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b892-16\">James K. Cooper (Cooper) pled guilty to several drug and theft-related charged in March 2005. He was sentenced to four 10-year terms and a one-year term for his convictions. Cooper did not seek post-conviction relief in state court until May 18, 2006, which was denied as untimely. The state court\u2019s denial was subsequently affirmed by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals. Cooper, appearing pro se,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> then filed his Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 on December 21, 2006, in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. The petition was dismissed due to untimely filing. Cooper\u2019s argument for equitable tolling was specifically discussed and rejected by the district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-19\">Cooper moved for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (ifp) on appeal and applied for a Certificate of Appealability (COA). The district court granted his ifp request, but denied a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-20\">Cooper renews his request for a COA application in this Court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A); Fed. R.App. P. 22(b)(1). A COA is a jurisdictional prerequisite to our review. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). We will issue a COA only if Cooper makes \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make this showing, he must establish \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether ... the petition should have been resolved [by the district court] in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotations and citations omitted). In his application, Cooper argues the merits of his \u00a7 2254 petition, but does not address the reason it was dismissed \u2014 untimeliness.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-21\">We have carefully reviewed Cooper\u2019s arguments and agree with the district court. His petition is barred by the time limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1) and is not subject to equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>We DENY Cooper\u2019s application for a COA and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b892-17\">.
