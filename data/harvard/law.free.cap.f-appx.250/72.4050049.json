He filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion challenging his conviction and sentence. The district court dismissed the motion and granted Nnaji a certificate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>of appealability (COA) on the issue whether the Supreme Court decision in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004) applies retroactively to cases on collateral review. We have since held that <em>Crawford </em>does not apply retroactively to such cases, and the district court\u2019s judgment in that regard is affirmed. <em>See Lave v. Dretke, </em>444 F.3d 333, 336 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1482, 167 L.Ed.2d 227 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Nnaji also requests that this court expand the scope of the district court\u2019s grant of COA. He argues that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel due to counsel\u2019s failure to investigate the facts of his case prior to Nnaji\u2019s suppression hearing. He also argues that counsel should have moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of all of the evidence. He contends that the district court erred in finding that appellate counsel performed reasonably in raising only one issue on direct appeal. He maintains that the district court\u2019s use of facts not found beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury to enhance his sentence was structural error under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). He disagrees with the district court\u2019s determination that several of his proposed amended claims did not relate back to the core facts raised in his \u00a7 2255 motion and were, thus, time-barred. Nnaji lists, without elaboration, several claims that he contends were not addressed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">To obtain a COA, Nnaji must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). He must show that \u201creasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of [his] constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. For claims that the district court dismissed on procedural grounds, Nnaji must show \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nnaji has not made such a showing. Accordingly, his motion for COA on these additional issues is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">AFFIRMED; COA DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b98-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
