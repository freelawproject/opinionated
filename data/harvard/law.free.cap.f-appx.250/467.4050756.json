As explained below, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-21\">Sparrow was convicted in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio of various crimes, including three counts of armed bank robbery, for which he is serving a sentence of 540 months\u2019 imprisonment. After the United States Court of Appeals for Sixth Circuit Court affirmed, Sparrow unsuccessfully challenged his conviction and sentence via 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and a subsequent motion pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-22\">Sparrow then filed a \u00a7 2241 petition in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, this time alleging that the United States lacks jurisdiction to enforce federal criminal law in Ohio because that state\u2019s legislature has not accepted or consented to federal jurisdiction. The District Court dismissed the petition, explaining that Sparrow must present his claims via \u00a7 2255. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appellee has moved for summary affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>As the District Court correctly explained, Sparrow\u2019s claim falls under \u00a7 2255 and may not be presented via \u00a7 2241 unless the \u201csavings clause\u201d in \u00a7 2255 applies to him. It does not. Section 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d only if Sparrow were \u201cin the \u2018unusual position\u2019 of a prisoner with no prior opportunity to challenge his conviction for a crime that an intervening change in substantive law could negate with retroactive application.\u201d <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002). Plainly, this language does not describe Sparrow\u2019s claim. As a result, the appeal does not present a sub-' stantial question and we grant the appellee\u2019s motion for summary affirmance.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b493-24\">. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and review the District Court\u2019s judgment <em>de novo. Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
