On appeal, counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that there are no meritorious claims on appeal but raising the following issue: whether the district court\u2019s sentence was erroneous. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-21\">We do not find that Moon\u2019s sentence is plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1813, 167 L.Ed.2d 325 (2007) (stating review standard). Moon was sentenced within a properly-calculated advisory sentencing range of three to nine months. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 7B1.4(a), p.s. (2006) (revocation table). Accordingly, we find no error in his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-24\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the revocation order and the sentence imposed. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b598-16\"> Moon was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but failed to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
