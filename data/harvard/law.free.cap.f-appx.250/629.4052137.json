On appeal, Menzies advanced four claims of sentencing error: miscalculation of his Guidelines offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(1)(C), based on the court\u2019s finding that he possessed between eight and twelve firearms as a convicted felon; the sentencing court incorrectly included two prior felony convictions in calculating his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K1.2(a)(2) and incorrectly determined his criminal history category at IV; the sentencing court abused its discretion in rejecting his request for a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1; and the sentence imposed was unreasonable. Two months after Menzies filed his appellate brief, the government filed a motion to vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing, which a motion panel of this court ordered carried with the case on appeal. In support of its motion, the government conceded that the district court misapplied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K1.2(a)(2), but the government did not address the remaining charges to the district court\u2019s Guidelines calculation raised by Menzies on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-19\">We have reviewed the briefs of the parties and the record on appeal, as well as the government\u2019s extensive motion to vacate and the appendices thereto, and we conclude that the government\u2019s position is principled, well reasoned, and meritorious. As both the government and Menzies seek vacatur of his sentence, we grant the government\u2019s motion, vacate Menzies\u2019s sentence, and remand the case to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-20\">MOTION GRANTED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b656-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Or.
