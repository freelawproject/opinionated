Young\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing the sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-23\">We conclude Young\u2019s advisory Guidelines imprisonment range was correctly determined by the district court, and his sentence at the bottom of that range is not unreasonable. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-68, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (allowing appellate presumption of reasonableness); <em>United States v. Denton, </em>434 F.3d 1104, 1113 (8th Cir.2006) (holding a within-Guidelines sentence is presumptively reasonable). The district court stated it had considered all of the statutory goals of sentencing, and it mentioned several specific factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Moreover, nothing in the record indicates the court overlooked a relevant factor, gave significant weight to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>an improper factor, or made a clear error of judgment in imposing the sentence. <em>See United States v. Haack, </em>403 F.3d 997, 1004 (8th Cir.2005) (stating the factors used to review a sentence for reasonableness). After reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">We grant counsel leave to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b794-15\">.
