Further, she claims Hughes stated that he would bring the matter to the attention of the district attorney. Ms. Howe claims that these statements, made in regards to her termination of employment, violated her constitutionally protected liberty interest in her reputation and the right to clear her name. These state and federal due process claims fail, however, because, at the very least, she admitted to the truth of Hughes\u2019s statements; there were financial discrepancies and she did hire her husband, even if only on a volunteer basis. <em>Codd v. Velger, </em>429 U.S. 624, 627-28, 97 S.Ct. 882, 51 L.Ed.2d 92 (1977); <em>Rosenstein v. Dallas, </em>876 F.2d 392, 395-96 (5th Cir.1989). Her argument that Louisiana state due process law, as it relates to this claim, is broader than federal law is unavailing. <em>State v. Smith, </em>614 So.2d 778, 780 (La.Ct.App.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Ms. Howe\u2019s state law defamation claim also fails because she admitted to the truth of Hughes\u2019s statement. Further, the public statement made by Hughes does not imply that Ms. Howe\u2019s actions were criminal. The statement merely suggests that Hughes believed the matter warranted further investigation by the district attorney to determine <em>whether </em>Ms. Howe\u2019s actions were criminal. Therefore, Ms. Howe\u2019s admissions need not admit to criminal conduct to admit to the truth of Hughes\u2019s statements. Based on her admissions and without a presumption of defamation, Ms. Howe is unable to support her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">Lastly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Kenneth Howe\u2019s state law defamation claim. That claim is not part of the same case or controversy as Ms. Howe\u2019s underlying federal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b626-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
