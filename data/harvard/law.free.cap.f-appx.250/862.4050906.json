McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b888-18\">Petitioner, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se, seeks a certificate of appealability to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 habeas petition. Petitioner contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in his trial for distributing crack cocaine because his attorney had him testify in support of an entrapment defense when the attorney should have known that the facts would not sustain a jury instruction on entrapment. Petitioner points out that the trial court\u2019s decision not to instruct the jury on entrapment was affirmed by this court on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Corber, </em>159 Fed.Appx. 54 (10th Cir.2005). He argues that he would not have testified had the attorney realized, as he should, that the entrapment defense \u201ccould not prevail\u201d and indeed that Petitioner\u2019s testimony would prejudice his defense. (Doc. 85, Petitioner\u2019s Memorandum at 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b888-23\">The district court denied the habeas petition, ruling that defense counsel\u2019s strategy was not unreasonable under the standard set out in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The district court pointed out that defense counsel\u2019s legal arguments and citations to authority at trial and on appeal showed that he was aware of the relevant law and of the facts of this case. Although counsel\u2019s attempts to submit an entrapment defense to the jury were unsuccessful, the court concluded that this was insufficient to prove that counsel\u2019s performance was unreasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>Boyd v. Ward, </em>179 F.3d 904, 914 (10th Cir.1999) (\u201cFor counsel\u2019s performance to be constitutionally ineffective, it must have been completely unreasonable, not merely wrong.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b888-24\">To obtain a certificate of appealability, Petitioner must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2006). In order to meet this burden, Petitioner must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">We have carefully reviewed Petitioner\u2019s filings, the district court\u2019s disposition, and the record on appeal. Nothing in these materials raises an issue which meets our standard for the grant of a certificate of appealability. For substantially the reasons set forth by the district court, we DENY Petitioner\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b888-19\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
