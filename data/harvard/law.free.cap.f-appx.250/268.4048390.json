Harold Albritton, III, United States District Judge for the Middle District of Alabama, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b295-19\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b295-20\">Roberto Delgado appeals his convictions and sentence of 360 months of imprisonment for possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon, possession with intent to distribute cocaine, and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) &amp; 924(c)(1)(A)(i); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Delgado argues that (1) there was no probable cause to support the traffic stop that led to his arrest and the search of his vehicle; (2) there is insuffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>cient evidence to support his conviction for carrying a firearm \u201cduring and in relation to\u201d a drug trafficking crime; and (3) the court should have instructed the jury on the lesser included offense of simple possession of cocaine. Delgado also argues that the district court erred when it denied him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3E1.1 (Nov. 2005), erroneously classified him as a career offender, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 4A1.2, and imposed an unreasonable sentence. We discuss each argument in turn and affirm the convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">The arresting officer had probable cause to stop Delgado\u2019s car because he had reason to believe at least two traffic violations \u2014 illegal window tinting and unilluminated license tag \u2014 had occurred. <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 810, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 1772, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996). Because probable cause existed to stop the vehicle, the officer lawfully ordered Delgado out of the car, confiscated the firearm Delgado carried in plain view, investigated Delgado\u2019s driver\u2019s license, and performed a protective search of both driver and vehicle. <em>Ohio v. Robinette, </em>519 U.S. 33, 38-39, 117 S.Ct. 417, 136 L.Ed.2d 347 (1996); <em>United States v. Purcell, </em>236 F.3d 1274, 1277-78 (2001). The district court did not err when it denied Delgado\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Delgado\u2019s argument that there is insufficient evidence to support his convictions for carrying a firearm \u201cduring and in relation to\u201d a drug trafficking crime also fails. We review <em>de novo </em>the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a criminal conviction and view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>248 F.3d 1065, 1084 (11th Cir.2001). The evidence suggested that the firearm at least had \u201cthe potential of facilitating\u201d the drug trafficking offense because it was loaded, close to the cocaine, and readily accessible to Delgado. <em>United States v. Timmons, </em>283 F.3d 1246, 1251 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Delgado argues for the first time in his reply brief that the district court erroneously denied his request for a jury instruction on the lesser included offense of simple possession of cocaine. \u201cUnder the law of this Circuit, an issue not raised in a party\u2019s initial appellate brief is considered waived, and the party is prohibited from raising the issue later in the appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Silvestri, </em>409 F.3d 1311, 1338 n. 18 (11th Cir.2005). As a result, Delgado waived this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Delgado\u2019s arguments about sentencing also fail. We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error, <em>United States v. Jordi, </em>418 F.3d 1212, 1214 (11th Cir.2005), and we review a sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). First, the district court did not clearly err when it determined that Delgado was not entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility because Delgado put the government to its burden of proof both before and during trial. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 2; <em>see also United States v. Smith, </em>127 F.3d 987, 989 (1997) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Second, the district court was correct to classify Delgado as a career offender. According to section 4A1.2 of the Guidelines, \u201c[p]rior sentences imposed in unrelated cases are to be counted separately.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2. The Guidelines Commentary states: \u201cPrior sentences are not considered related if they were for offenses that were separated by an intervening arrest....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2 cmt. n. 3. Delgado was arrested for the first offense in January 1995 before he commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>ted the second offense in April 1995, so the second offense was an intervening arrest. <em>United States v. Hunter, </em>323 F.3d 1314, 1322-23 (11th Cir.2003). The district court was correct to conclude that the two prior sentences were unrelated and sentenced Delgado as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Third, Delgado\u2019s sentence of 360 months of imprisonment was reasonable. The district court considered permissible sentencing factors, stated its reasons for the particular sentence on the record, and sentenced Delgado at the low end of the Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1361 (11th Cir. 2006); <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 787-88. Delgado cannot establish that his sentence fails to further the sentencing purposes of section 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Delgado\u2019s convictions and sentence, therefore, are</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
