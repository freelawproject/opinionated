He was sentenced to fifty months in prison. On appeal, counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there were no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether trial counsel provided effective assistance of counsel. Mathes has filed a supplemental brief, providing further details and allegations concerning the alleged ineffective assistance. The Government elected not to file a responsive brief. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-23\">An ineffective assistance of counsel claim is generally not cognizable on direct appeal, but should instead be asserted in a post-conviction motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>See United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). However, we have recognized an exception to the general rule when \u201cit \u2018conclusively appears\u2019 from the record that defense counsel did not provide effective representation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the record does not conclusively establish that counsel was ineffective, we conclude that Mathes\u2019 claim is not cognizable on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-24\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
