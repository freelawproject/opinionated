For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-22\">Adous was convicted of assault and battery of a family member under Va.Code \u00a7 18.2-57.2. He contends that because battery does not require bodily injury or intent to inflict bodily injury under Virginia law, his crime is not one of moral turpitude. It is unnecessary for us to resolve this point, however, because Adous was not convicted merely of battery. Rather, he was convicted of assault and battery pursuant to a statute that has been construed to require an intent to inflict bodily injury on the victim. <em>See Leal v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 525, 559 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>874, 878 (2002), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, Commonwealth v. Leal, </em>265 Va. 142, 574 S.E.2d 285 (2003). Adous\u2019 failure to successfully inflict the harm he intended does not lessen the weight given to his crime. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review on the reasoning provided by the Board. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
