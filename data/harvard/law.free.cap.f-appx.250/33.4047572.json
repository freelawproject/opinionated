He challenges the decision to enhance his offense level 16 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) based on a determination that his 1994 Texas conviction of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon is a crime of violence. He contends that the offense, as set forth in Texas Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 22.01(a)(2) and 22.02(a), is not among those enumerated in \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.1(B)(iii)), and does not have \u201cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d The Texas aggravated-assault statute, \u00a7 22.02, is substantially similar to the definition of \u201caggravated assault\u201d found in the Model Penal Code and thus qualifies as the enumerated offense of \u201caggravated assault\u201d under the guidelines. <em>See United States v. Guillen-Alvarez, </em>489 F.3d 197, 199-201 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-22\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Reyes-Gomez challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This court has held that that issue is \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Aug. 28, 2007) (No. 07-6202).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-23\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b59-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
