Sichel pretermitting his application for asylum and denying his applications for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT. <em>In re Abdoulaye Sow, </em>No. A78 698 612 (B.I.A. Oct 10, 2006), <em>affg </em>No. A78 698 612 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 21, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-21\">As an initial matter, we deem Sow\u2019s claims for asylum and relief under the CAT abandoned. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir. 2005) (issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal). In his brief to this Court, Sow neither raised his CAT claim, nor challenged the IJ\u2019s finding that his asylum application was untimely. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Therefore, we review only the denial of Sow\u2019s application for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yu Yin Yang v. Gonzales, </em>481 F.3d 84, 85 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. I.N.S., </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 304-05 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law, including what quantum of evidence will suffice to discharge an applicant\u2019s burden of proof. <em>See Islami v. Gonzales, </em>412 F.3d 391, 396 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">We ultimately conclude that the BIA properly determined that Sow failed to establish past persecution or a likelihood of future persecution. Sow testified that, if he went back to the Congo, he feared that \u201cthe rebel who had come in our house\u201d would kill him. But when the IJ probed as to the basis for that fear, Sow failed totally to provide any reason. When the IJ asked Sow whom he feared now, Sow stated unresponsively, \u201cRight now, if I know that my family is there, because right now, I don\u2019t know where my family is, so I cannot go back.\u201d The IJ asked again, \u201cAll right, but sir, who is it, what person or group in your country do you fear now?\u201d Sow replied, \u201cRight now, in my country, there are problems. So when I came here, I had come over here to save my life. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s all.\u201d Given the IJ\u2019s attempts to ascertain the reasons for Sow\u2019s fear of return, Sow\u2019s inability to provide any legitimate reason for that fear was a valid ground for finding that he did not establish a clear probability of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">While questions arise as to whether the agency correctly followed the steps enunciated by this court in <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 290 (2d Cir.2000), regarding corroborative evidence, no remand is required because we can confidently predict that the agency would reach the same conclusion even upon clear application of <em>Diallo. See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 338-39 (2d Cir.2006). The BIA\u2019s determination that Sow neither established past persecution nor a likelihood of future persecution was otherwise supported by convincing substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
