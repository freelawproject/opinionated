He argues that the district court erred by imposing a sentence that exceeded the pertinent guidelines recommendation. Our review of the record, including the exhaustive reasons given by the district court in support of its judgment, shows no reversible error in connection with Espinosa-Hernandez\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 706-08 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-21\">Espinosa-Hernandez also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. Espinosa-Hernandez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Espinosa-Hernandez properly concedes that his argument is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b664-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
