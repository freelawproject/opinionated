Shanklin appeals a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cCAVC\u201d) affirming a refusal by the Board of Veterans Affairs (\u201cBoard\u201d) to reopen his previously-denied claims for service connection. We <em>dismiss.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b334-15\">Bloyce F. Shanklin is a veteran who was on active duty from June 1959 until May 1960. Since at least 1979, Mr. Shanklin has been pursuing a claim for service connection related to head and knee injuries he sustained in 1959. And since the mid-1990s, Mr. Shanklin has also been pursuing a claim for service connection for neck and spine problems. The Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) Regional Office (\u201cRO\u201d) has consistently denied Mr. Shanklin\u2019s claims in spite of his repeated attempts to reopen those claims on the basis of new and material evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-16\">The present appeal arises from requests by Mr. Shanklin in November 1995 and October 2000 to reopen his claims related to his spine, neck, and knee problems. The RO denied the first request in August 1996 and denied the second request in February 2002, each on the basis that Mr. Shanklin had not submitted any new and material evidence. Mr. Shanklin appealed both denials to the Board. The claims were subsequently remanded in June 2004 to the RO to ensure compliance with the notice provisions of the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (\u201cVCAA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat.2096. In March 2005, the RO sent Mr. Shanklin a letter to that end.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>In June 2005, and apparently before the RO issued any post-March 2005 decision on the remanded claims, the Board determined that any new evidence submitted by Mr. Shanklin was not sufficiently material to justify reopening his claims. In so doing, the Board concluded that although the March 2005 letter was sent after (rather than before) the RO\u2019s denials in 1996 and 2002, any resultant legal error was harmless:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">The Board ... finds that all necessary development has been accomplished. The RO has made reasonable and appropriate efforts to assist the appellant in obtaining the evidence necessary to substantiate his claims, including VA treatment records. The appellant has also been afforded the benefit of VA examinations during the appeal period, the veteran was provided with the opportunity to attend hearings. The veteran attended a Decision Review Officer (DRO) hearing in March 1997. The appellant has not indicated, and there is otherwise no indication that there exists, any pertinent outstanding evidence that is necessary for a fair adjudication of the claims that has not been obtained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">On appeal to the CAVC, the Board\u2019s decision was affirmed. Mr. Shanklin now appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">This court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear appeals from the CAVC is limited by statute. Our review is strictly limited to questions of law; we have no power to review \u201c(A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292. Mr. Shanklin makes several arguments, each of which we discuss below.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">Mr. Shanklin first argues that he was denied due process and equal protection of the law because the CAVC \u2014 knowing that he was in the hospital on March 20, 1979, and that he was scheduled for monthly exams and treatments thereafter \u2014 concluded that he did not timely appeal rating decisions in 1979, 1988, 1995. We fail to see how his intermittent hospitalization or monthly exams and treatments would have prevented him from filing an informal appeal to the Board. Therefore, these arguments must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">Mr. Shanklin also makes several related assertions of error: (1) \u201cCAVC actions \u2022failed to afford appellant mutual professional respect as to validity of benefit of doubt argument based on [the Board\u2019s] inability to point to veteran service medical records between June, 1959 to May, 1960 to decide merits of the case\u201d; (2) \u201cCAVC decision failed to equally weigh appellant\u2019s evidentiary arguments in the same light as opposing party\u201d; (3) \u201cCAVC actions failed to equally comply with procedural requirements in deciding if a fact issue existed\u201d; and (4) \u201cCAVC decision prejudicially failed to afford appellant procedural protection under 2000 VCAA requirements for claims previously denied prior to November 9, 2000 as not well grounded, and failed to identify what information or evidence RO would obtain, has obtained, failed to obtain, or notified appellant to obtain after RO failure to obtain.\u201d We understand each of these alleged errors to be challenges to the CAVC\u2019s application of law to fact, which, of course, we do not have jurisdiction to review. Therefore, these arguments must be rejected as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">The only other arguments by Mr. Shanklin are raised for the first time in his reply brief. While we do not normally consider such arguments, we are satisfied that Mr. Shanklin continues to challenge matters beyond our jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">For the reasons stated, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
