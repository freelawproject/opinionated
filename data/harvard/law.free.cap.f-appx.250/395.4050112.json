Nov. 20, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam); <em>Jin Ming Liu v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 109, 111 (2d Cir.2006). \u201cAccording to BIA regulations, \u2018[a] motion to reconsider a decision must be filed with the Board within 30 days after the mailing of the Board decision,\u2019 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2), whereas a motion to reopen \u2018must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered,\u2019 <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1003.2(c)(2).\u201d <em>Jie Chen v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 76, 77 n. 2 (2d Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"Ab\">Whether construed as a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider, Hong\u2019s September 2006 motion was untimely because a final order was issued in April 1997. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(b)(2), (c)(2). There are no exceptions to the time limitation for motions to reconsider a BIA decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b). However, where ineffective assistance of counsel prevents an alien from presenting her case for relief, the deadline for filing a motion to reopen a BIA decision may be equitably tolled. <em>See Cekic v. INS, </em>435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir.2006) (citations omitted). In addition, there is no time limit for filing a motion to reopen if it is \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(i). Here, we find that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in holding that Hong\u2019s arguments of ineffective assistance of counsel and changed country conditions did not excuse the untimeliness of her motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">As a threshold matter, we do not review the denial of Hong\u2019s second motion to reconsider the BIA decision. \u201cThe BIA does not abuse its discretion by denying a motion to reconsider where the motion repeats arguments that the BIA has previously rejected.\u201d <em>Jin Ming Liu, </em>439 F.3d at 111. In this case, the BIA had previously considered \u2014 and rejected \u2014 Hong\u2019s complaints about the preparer of her initial asylum application. Therefore, it was not an abuse of discretion for the BIA to refuse to consider her argument a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">Regarding her second motion to reopen the BIA decision, Hong claims that any delay in the filing of this motion resulted from the ineffective assistance of the counsel she hired to file that motion. \u201cWe generally require that ineffective assistance [of counsel] claims be presented in the first instance to the BIA, either through a motion to reopen or on direct appeal.\u201d <em>Yi Long Yang v. Gonzales, </em>478 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir.2007). To prevail on such a claim, the alien must first comply with certain procedures set forth in <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), <em>aff'd sub nom., Lozada v. INS, </em>857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir.1988). <em>Id. </em>Specifically, the alien must file a motion with the agency that includes: \u201c(1) an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement with former counsel concerning what action would be taken and what counsel did or did not represent in this regard; (2) proof that the alien notified former counsel of the allegations of ineffective assistance and allowed counsel an opportunity to respond; and (3) if a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>violation of ethical or legal responsibilities is claimed, a statement as to whether the alien filed a complaint with any disciplinary authority regarding counsel\u2019s conduct and, if a complaint was not filed, an explanation for not doing so.\u201d <em>Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 59 (2d Cir.2005). \u201c[A]n alien who has failed to comply substantially with the <em>Lozada </em>requirements in her motion to reopen before the BIA forfeits her ineffective assistance of counsel claim.... \u201d <em>Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>409 F.3d 43, 47 (2d Cir.2005). However, \u201cslavish adherence\u201d to Lozada\u2019s requirements is not necessary, and a finding of substantial compliance is possible where the facts supporting a \u201cclaim of ineffective assistance are clear on the face of the record.\u201d <em>Yi Long Yang, </em>478 F.3d at 142-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">In this case, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in declining to address Hong\u2019s complaint against her attorney because Hong made no effort to comply with <em>Lozada </em>other than submitting her affidavit. Moreover, we cannot conclude that Hong substantially complied with <em>Lozada </em>on the ground that the facts supporting an ineffective assistance claim are clear on the face of the record. <em>See id. </em>On the contrary, Hong was eventually able to file her second motion with the assistance of different counsel and the BIA considered her evidence of changed country conditions. <em>See Rabiu v. INS, </em>41 F.3d 879, 882 (2d Cir.1994) (recognizing, in the immigration context, that an applicant must demonstrate that she was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s performance to prevail on an ineffective assistance claim). Accordingly, we find that the agency did not abuse its discretion in denying Hong\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to comply with <em>Lozada.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">Hong next argues that her case should be remanded pursuant to <em>Shou Yung Guo v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 109 (2d Cir.2006). In <em>Shou Yung Guo, </em>we remanded to the BIA to consider more fully evidence of changed circumstances in China that the BIA had heard but ignored. 463 F.3d at 114-15. However, we will not remand to the BIA for consideration of such evidence, where, as here, the \u201cdocumentary evidence ... was not in the record before the BIA ... and ... the agency regulations set forth procedures to reopen a case before the BIA for the taking of additional evidence.\u201d <em>Xiao Xing Ni v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 260, 262 (2d Cir.2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here, Hong presented the evidence of changed country conditions to the BIA, and federal regulations set forth procedures for the BIA to reopen a case to take additional evidence. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c). Therefore, we will not remand to the BIA on <em>Shou Yung Guo </em>grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-6\">. Moreover, it is unlikely that the BIA would consider said documents evidence of changed country conditions excusing the filing deadline of a motion to reopen. <em>See, e.g., In re S-Y-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 247, 258 (BIA 2007) (holding that the <em>Shou Yung Guo </em>documents do not \"indicate that conditions in China have changed materially ... such that the applicant would have an objective well-founded fear of persecution upon return to China\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
