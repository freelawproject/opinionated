Both the Merit Systems Protection Board and this court have made clear that the eligibility standards for LEO status are exacting and that even positions in which the incumbents have significant law enforcement responsibilities frequently do not qualify for LEO status. Petitioner Mary A. Taber sought LEO retirement credit for several positions that she held with the National Park Service in which she performed vari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>ous law enforcement functions. After the Department of the Interior denied her request for LEO status, she appealed that decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board. Following a hearing, the Board sustained the agency\u2019s decision, holding that Ms. Taber did not satisfy the applicable standards for LEO retirement credit. Docket No. DE-0842-04-0445-I-4. We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Ms. Taber served in a number of different positions with the National Park Service between 1988 and 1994. She served as Park Technician, Park Ranger, and Supervisory Park Ranger at Yellowstone National Park, and she occupied the position of Park Ranger at Joshua Tree National Monument. Because her service through the years involved various kinds of policing activity, she asked her agency to certify her for the special statutory retirement benefits that come with LEO status.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Among other things, LEO status entitles an employee to retire at age 50 with full benefits after only 20 years of service. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8836(c), 8412(d)(2). Because the benefits to those who enjoy LEO status are expensive for the government and because the early retirement option results in the loss of many experienced employees years before they would otherwise leave the government, the statutes that provide for LEO eligibility have been strictly construed. <em>See Watson v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>262 F.3d 1292, 1298 (Fed.Cir.2001); <em>Hannon v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>234 F.3d 674, 677 (Fed.Cir.2000); <em>Bingaman v. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, </em>127 F.3d 1431, 1435 (Fed.Cir. 1997). By statute and regulation, only those federal employees whose duties include \u201cprimarily the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States\u201d qualify as LEOs. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8331(20), 8401(17); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 831.902, 842.802. Congress \u201cclearly intended to make eligibility for LEO credit restrictive and not to extend the LEO benefits to all persons who work in law enforcement in some capacity.\u201d <em>Luke v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>320 F.3d 1377, 1382-83 (Fed.Cir.2003). In particular, employees whose primary duties involve \u201cmaintaining law and order, protecting life and property, [and] guarding against or inspecting for violations of law\u201d do not qualify for LEO retirement credit. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 831.902, 842.802; <em>see Watson, </em>262 F.3d at 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Applying those standards, the Department of the Interior denied Ms. Taber\u2019s request to be accorded LEO credit under either the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS) for the various Park Ranger and Park Technician positions she held between 1983 and 1994. The agency denied her request on the ground that her various positions did not satisfy the strict standards for LEO eligibility, but instead principally involved nonqualifying activities such as visitor protection, search and rescue, resource management, emergency medical work, patrolling, and campground management.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Ms. Taber appealed the agency\u2019s decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board. Following an evidentiary hearing, the administrative judge who was appointed to the case upheld the agency\u2019s decision denying Ms. Taber\u2019s request for LEO retirement benefit credit for the contested positions. After reviewing in detail each of the positions Ms. Taber held and the responsibilities she performed in those positions, the administrative judge noted that Congress did not intend to extend LEO benefits to all persons who worked in law enforcement in any capacity and concluded that Ms. Taber had failed to satisfy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>statutory definition of a \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d in that she had failed to show that her primary duties involved the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of federal criminal offenses. She now petitions this court for review of the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Ms. Taber first argues that the administrative judge violated the Board\u2019s own regulations because the administrative judge\u2019s initial decision did not constitute a reasoned opinion providing an adequate basis for review. <em>Spithaler v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>2 MSPB 2, 1 M.S.P.R. 587, 588-89 (1980) (citing 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.111(b)(1)). She contends that the administrative judge \u201csimply provided a cursory gloss on what he believed the applicable law to be and then recited a series of what were essentially uncontroverted facts, followed by a summary determination that the Petitioner did not meet her burden of proof.\u201d The fact that the transcript of the evidentiary hearing was 139 pages long and the administrative judge\u2019s opinion summarized the evidence in only 13 pages indicates, according to Ms. Taber, that the administrative judge\u2019s opinion failed to comply with the requirements imposed by the Board\u2019s regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">We reject that argument for several reasons. As the Board has explained, the pertinent Board regulation requires administrative judges to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMz\">identify all material issues of fact, summarize the evidence on each such issue sufficiently to disclose the evidentiary basis for the presiding official\u2019s findings of fact, set forth those findings clearly and explain how any issues of credibility were resolved and why, describe the application of burdens of proof and address all material legal issues in a fashion that reveals the presiding official\u2019s conclusions of law, legal reasoning and the authorities on which that reasoning rests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-9\"><em>Spithaler, </em>1 M.S.P.R. at 589 (quoting 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.111(b)(1)). In the <em>Spithaler </em>case, on which Ms. Taber relies, the Board held that a three-sentence initial decision, which simply announced the administrative judge\u2019s disposition of the case without any analysis, failed to satisfy that regulatory requirement. In this case, by contrast, the administrative judge wrote a 13-page opinion that identified the principal legal issue, summarized the facts bearing on that issue, and made clear the legal reasoning that led the administrative judge to reject Ms. Taber\u2019s claim. Ms. Taber argues that the administrative judge failed to address \u201cany number of material issues,\u201d yet she cites only one such issue \u2014 her argument that her service prior to 1989 should have been evaluated under the legal standards applicable to CSRS employees rather than those applicable to FERS employees. As the government points out in its brief, however, the standards for those two classes of employees are similar, and the differences were not material to the administrative judge\u2019s analysis of Ms. Taber\u2019s case. Because the administrative judge\u2019s failure to address that legal question had no effect on the outcome of this case, it was not critical that the administrative judge distinguish between those periods of Ms. Taber\u2019s service that were subject to the CSRS standards and those that were subject to the FERS standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">More generally, the question whether an administrative judge has complied with the Board\u2019s regulatory requirements regarding the contents of an initial decision is primarily a question for the Merit Systems Protection Board, not this court, to decide. The Board has frequently had occasion to address whether administrative judges have complied with regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>tory requirements that the Board has imposed on them, and the Board has developed standards for the adequacy of such opinions. <em>See Smart v. Dep\u2019t of the Army, </em>105 M.S.P.R. 475, 480 (2007); <em>Mahaffey v. Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>105 M.S.P.R. 347, 355 (2007); <em>Hagen v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>103 M.S.P.R. 595, 599 (2006). But in the absence of some asserted statutory or constitutional inadequacy\u2014 and no such inadequacy is claimed here \u2014 an asserted departure from the standards that the Board has imposed regarding the adequacy of administrative judges\u2019 opinions mil normally not serve as a basis for reversal by this court. <em>See Haebe v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>288 F.3d 1288, 1302 n. 32 (Fed.Cir.2002) (Board\u2019s requirements for initial decisions are \u201cgeneral internal procedural requirements that the MSPB has established for its adjudicative processes, and our review of the AJ\u2019s fulfillment of these procedural processes is in that light\u201d); <em>Wissman v. Social Sec. Admin., </em>848 F.2d 176, 178 (Fed.Cir.1988) (Board\u2019s standard for drafting initial decisions \u201cis nothing more than the board\u2019s directive to its subordinate officials to proceed according to established regulatory procedures\u201d). Ms. Taber has cited no case from this court in which asserted noncompliance with the Board\u2019s regulation governing the contents of initial decisions has resulted in reversal of a Board decision, and we have found none.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Even assuming that it is part of this court\u2019s reviewing responsibility to scrutinize an administrative judge\u2019s compliance with the Board\u2019s regulations governing how Board decisions should be mitten, we disagree with Ms. Taber that the administrative judge\u2019s opinion in this case violated the regulatory requirements. The opinion set forth the pertinent legal standard, summarized the facts in great detail, and set forth the administrative judge\u2019s conelusion that the facts did not satisfy the legal standard for establishing Ms. Taber\u2019s claim to LEO status. Despite Ms. Taber\u2019s protestations, the factual summary in the administrative judge\u2019s opinion was amply sufficient. While the legal analysis could have been more extensive, we are satisfied that it was sufficient to demonstrate the administrative judge\u2019s reasoning and to permit informed judicial review. We therefore reject Ms. Taber\u2019s argument on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Ms. Taber next argues that the administrative judge erred in his characterization of the legal test for determining LEO status. With this court\u2019s approval, the Board has adopted a \u201cposition-oriented\u201d approach to determining LEO status. <em>See Crowley v. United States, </em>398 F.3d 1329, 1337 (Fed.Cir.2005); <em>Watson, </em>262 F.3d at 1297-1301. That is, the Board and this court have held that the primary question in deciding whether an employee is entitled to LEO status is whether the employee\u2019s position is one that exists for the purpose of investigation, apprehension, or detention of persons suspected or convicted of violating federal criminal laws. The question is not how the employee in question actually spends his or her time, but what duties the employee\u2019s position entails. Of course, as this court has explained, the employee\u2019s actual tasks may bear1 on what the position entails, and thus be relevant to the ultimate \u201cposition-oriented\u201d inquiry. <em>See Watson, </em>262 F.3d at 1301-02. In the end, however, the question turns on the nature of the employee\u2019s position, not the particular tasks to which the particular employee is assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Ms. Taber argues that the administrative judge misapplied those principles by failing to give weight to Ms. Taber\u2019s actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>duties in determining whether any of her positions were entitled to LEO status. She focuses in particular on the administrative judge\u2019s statement that \u201cif the [incumbent\u2019s] position does not exist for the purpose of investigation, apprehension, or detention of persons suspected or convicted of violating the criminal laws of the United States, the incumbent is not entitled to LEO credit no matter how long she spends each day performing LEO-type duties.\u201d That statement is potentially confusing, as it could be taken, standing alone, as suggesting that Ms. Taber\u2019s actual duties are irrelevant to whether her position is entitled to LEO status. In context, however, we do not interpret the administrative judge\u2019s statement in that manner. Following the statement in question, the administrative judge described in detail the actual duties that Ms. Taber performed in her various positions. That lengthy discussion of Ms. Taber\u2019s actual duties would have been wholly unnecessary if the administrative judge had regarded her actual duties as irrelevant to determining LEO eligibility for each of the disputed positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Moreover, as indicated, the administrative judge\u2019s summary of Ms. Taber\u2019s actual duties, with which Ms. Taber does not take issue, demonstrates that those duties did not consist primarily of qualifying LEO activities. The OPM regulations indicate that \u201cprimary\u201d duties are those that are \u201cparamount in influence or weight; that is, constitute the basic reasons for the existence of the position,\u201d occupy \u201ca substantial portion of the individual\u2019s working time over a typical work cycle,\u201d and are assigned \u201con a regular and recurring basis.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 831.902, 842.802. Duties that are performed on an emergency, incidental, or temporary basis are not primary. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The evidence recited by the administrative judge showed that, under the applicable tests, qualifying LEO activities did not constitute the \u201cprimary\u201d duties of Ms. Taber\u2019s position, either as described or as performed. For example, the administrative judge noted that although Ms. Taber was involved in criminal investigations and helped in making arrests and transporting prisoners from time to time, the record showed that she made only four arrests during one year and five during another year. During most of the period at issue, according to the record, a major portion of her work consisted of patrolling roads in Yellowstone National Park and issuing traffic citations. Occasionally that activity resulted in arrests. Our cases have established, however, that the type of activity in which she was engaged, such as patrolling, enforcing traffic laws, and acting as a first responder to emergencies or potential crimes, does not constitute qualifying LEO activity unless the employee\u2019s primary responsibilities include the investigation and apprehension of criminal suspects. <em>See Watson, </em>262 F.3d at 1304; <em>Luke, </em>320 F.3d at 1381. Accordingly, in light of the findings made by the administrative judge, we sustain the Board\u2019s conclusion that Ms. Taber is not entitled to LEO credit for the periods of her service that are at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">In her reply brief, Ms. Taber contends that the Board\u2019s decision in this case conflicts with the Board\u2019s decision in an earlier case, <em>Ferrier v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>66 M.S.P.R. 241 (1995). Setting aside the fact that Board decisions are not binding on this court, the facts of that case suggest that the employee was more extensively involved in the investigation and apprehension of criminal suspects. Moreover, the Board itself has not applied <em>Ferrier </em>in a manner that dictates that Ms. Taber\u2019s positions would qualify for LEO status. In a series of cases following the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Board\u2019s decision in <em>Watson, </em>the Board has held that activities such as patrolling for purposes of property protection and traffic control are not ordinarily considered LEO-qualifying activities. <em>See Fagergren v. Dep\u2019t of the Interior, </em>98 M.S.P.R. 649, 653 (2005); <em>Street v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>90 M.S.P.R. 652, 660 (2002); <em>Koenig v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>91 M.S.P.R. 1, 9-10 (2001). The Board has made clear that it would no longer regard as authoritative the decisions prior to <em>Watson </em>that suggested that such activities constituted LEO activities. <em>See Koenig, </em>91 M.S.P.R. at 10. Those cases, rather than <em>Ferrier, </em>indicate how the Board currently approaches claims for LEO eligibility by persons in positions similar to Ms. Taber\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Finally, Ms. Taber argues that the administrative judge improperly declined to permit her attorney to make a closing statement at the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing in her case. The Board has held that the question whether to permit closing argument is a matter committed to the discretion of the administrative judge. <em>See Ford v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>43 M.S.P.R. 495, 500 (1990). A Board regulation, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.58(a), makes the same point by clear implication. That regulation provides that the record of a hearing will ordinarily close at the conclusion of the hearing, but that \u201c[wjhen the judge allows the parties to submit argument,\u201d the record will remain open for that purpose. The regulation thus plainly contemplates that in some cases the administrative judge will not permit the parties to present closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Ms. Taber has not shown that the administrative judge abused his discretion in this case by declining to hear closing argument. Instead, she merely points to what she regards as the administrative judge\u2019s legal errors in the case as indicating that the administrative judge should have permitted closing argument so as to avoid making those errors. It is open to question whether an administrative judge\u2019s refusal to permit closing argument could ever constitute reversible error on a petition for review to this court. But even if there might be a case in which denial of closing argument would be reversible error on appeal to this court, this is certainly not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">In sum, although the positions at issue in this ease involved many activities that would ordinarily be regarded as constituting law enforcement, the statutory and regulatory standards for obtaining LEO retirement credit are restrictive. Based on those standards, we hold that the Board did not commit reversible legal error in the proceedings leading to its decision in this case and that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that the positions in question were not LEO positions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
