In a brief filed under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), his counsel argues (1) Peinado-Juarez\u2019s sentence was improperly calculated under the Guidelines, and (2) the sentence is too harsh. In a pro se supplemental brief, Peinado-Juarez argues the court improperly relied on his prior state drug sentence in determining his offense level and criminal history category because the sentence was imposed more than 15 years before his involvement in the instant offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-22\">We enforce the broad appeal waiver included in Peinado-Juarez\u2019s plea agreement: the plea colloquy reflects that Peinado-Juarez understood and voluntarily accepted the terms of the plea agreement, including the waiver; this appeal falls within the scope of the waiver; and no injustice would result. <em>See United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886, 889-92 (8th Cir.2003) (en banc) (discussing enforceability of appeal waiver); <em>see also United States v. Estrada-Bahena, </em>201 F.3d 1070, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>1071 (8th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (enforcing appeal waiver in <em>Anders </em>case).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Having reviewed the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), for any nonfrivolous issue not covered by the waiver, we find none. Accordingly, we enforce the waiver and dismiss the appeal. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b784-15\">. The Honorable Richard G.
