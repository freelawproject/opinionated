He was sentenced principally to a term of 51 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-24\">Cilia concedes that the government presented evidence that would support a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>finding that he used \u201cextortionate means\u201d in an attempt to collect money from victim-borrower, later turned government informant, Antonio Marquis. He seeks to overturn his conviction, however, by questioning the time sequence of the creation of Marquis\u2019s debt and the threats employed against him. This argument fails because, at a minimum, a January 25, 2005 tape-recorded conversation between Cilia and Marquis reflects that Marquis admitted to owing Cilia one hundred and twenty thousand dollars, and Cilia agreed to defer this debt for \u201ca couple of days.\u201d We reject Cilia\u2019s mistaken assumption that a few days waiting period is too brief in duration to establish an extension of credit, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Boulahanis, </em>677 F.2d 586, 590 (7th Cir.1982) (suggesting deferment of payment for one night can constitute an extension of credit), and note that after this conversation Cilia threatened violence against Marquis in a series of voice mail messages. The evidence, therefore, is sufficient to establish that Cilia extended credit to Marquis before any extortionate collection methods were used. <em>See United States v. Bufalino, </em>576 F.2d 446, 452 (2d Cir.1978) (upholding defendants\u2019 conviction under \u00a7 894 where funds obtained through fraud \u201cgave rise to a claim\u201d). Accordingly, we need not address the government\u2019s contention that an extension of credit existed prior to January 25, 2005, and find that Cilia failed to meet the \u201cheavy burden\u201d placed on him to prevail on his challenge. <em>United States v. Masotto, </em>73 F.3d 1233, 1241 (2d Cir.1996) (describing defendant\u2019s burden for challenging a conviction based on the sufficiency of the evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Second, we reject Cilia\u2019s argument that the district court committed reversible error by excluding testimony relating to Marquis\u2019s state of mind. Because it is not necessary for the government to prove a victim-borrower\u2019s state of mind in a \u00a7 894 prosecution, <em>see United States v. Natale, </em>526 F.2d 1160, 1168 (2d Cir.1975), the district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding the proffered hearsay testimony under the circumstances in which the statements were made, <em>see United States v. Tracy, </em>12 F.3d 1186, 1195 (2d Cir.1993) (setting forth the standard of review to overturn a trial judge\u2019s determination under Rule 403).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Third, Cilia challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his request for an entrapment instruction. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Cilia, <em>see United States v. Anglada, </em>524 F.2d 296, 298 (2d Cir.1975), and thus accepting that Marquis was acting as an agent of the government, there is still no basis to find that Cilia was entrapped. Notably, the record is devoid of any indication that the idea of threatening Marquis was initiated by Marquis himself. As we stated in <em>United States v. Gambino, </em>566 F.2d 414, 419 (2d Cir.1977), \u201c[n]o one asked [defendant] to threaten the FBI agent.... There is no entrapment in such a situation, any more than the flashing of a roll of bills on a public street is the entrapment of an alert robber.\u201d And, even if Marquis could be said to have induced the extension of credit, as Cilia claims, the government produced unrebuttable evidence that Cilia was predisposed to extend credit. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in declining to instruct the jury on entrapment. <em>See United States v. Hurtado, </em>47 F.3d 577, 585 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Fourth, Cilia argues that the jury was improperly instructed on the meaning of the phrase \u201cother criminal means.\u201d We review this challenge for plain error because Cilia failed to object to the charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>below on this specific ground. Fed. R.Crim.P. 30(d), 52(b). As an initial matter, the error was not plain. While the law in this Circuit might indicate that the word \u201cpressure\u201d is not synonymous with the application of \u201cforce,\u201d it requires an inference that is not obvious or egregious enough to constitute plain error. <em>See United States v. Gore, </em>154 F.3d 34, 43 (2d Cir.1998) (stating that the error must be \u201cso egregious and obvious as to make the trial judge and prosecutor derelict in permitting it, despite the defendant\u2019s failure to object\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Furthermore, Cilia cannot show that the error caused him any prejudice. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 735, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (normally requiring a showing of prejudice to satisfy the \u201caffecting substantial rights\u201d prong of Rule 52(b)). Conduct falling into the category of \u201cother criminal means\u201d forms an alternate basis for conviction under \u00a7 894. Because the jury heard overwhelming evidence that Cilia\u2019s use of \u201cextortionate means\u201d included direct and explicit threats to physically harm Marquis \u2014 conduct itself sufficient to sustain his conviction \u2014 Cilia is unable to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that any errors affected the outcome of his trial. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Ness, </em>466 F.3d 79, 82-83 (2d Cir.2006) (upholding conviction because a properly instructed jury could sustain defendant\u2019s conviction on an alternate basis).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Fifth, Cilia submits that the district court erred in imposing a two-level increase in his guideline offense level based on his perjured trial testimony. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. The district court did not commit clear error when determining that Cilia intended to obstruct justice and committed perjury by falsely testifying that he did not know what his threats to Marquis meant and his only threat was to turn Marquis in to his probation officer. <em>See United States v. Zagari, </em>111 F.3d 307, 328-29 (2d Cir.1997) (setting forth the factual predicates necessary for a finding of perjury). We thus affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that an obstruction-of-justice adjustment was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Finally, Cilia argues that this case should be remanded to a different judge due to Judge Casey\u2019s allegedly excessive interventions, improper bolstering of prosecution witnesses, and exhibited animosity toward defense counsel. \u201cReversal for judicial bias is appropriate only where an examination of the entire record demonstrates that the jurors have been impressed with the trial judge\u2019s partiality to one side to the point that this became a factor in the determination of the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Salameh, </em>152 F.3d 88, 128 (2d Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). After reviewing the record in its entirety, we conclude that Cilia has not made the requisite showing and therefore reject his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">We have considered Cilia\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the reasons discussed, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
