He asserts that the district court erred by increasing his offense level by two for possession of a dangerous weapon, <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) (2005 &amp; Supp.2006), and by not reducing his offense level pursuant to the safety valve provision of USSG \u00a7 5C1.2. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-16\">Section 2Dl.l(b)(l) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a two-level increase if the defendant possessed a firearm or dangerous weapon. USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The commentary explains that a defendant possesses a firearm if \u201cthe weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.3). Application of this enhancement requires only that the weapon is involved in the offense conduct as a whole. <em>See United States v. Falesbork, </em>5 F.3d 715, 720-21 (4th Cir.1993). \u201c[Pjossession of the weapon during the commission of the offense is all that is needed to invoke the enhancement. The sentencing court is not required to find any more of a connection between the possession of the weapon and the commission \u2022 of the drug offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Apple, </em>962 F.2d 335, 338 (4th Cir.1992). When the offense of conviction is conspiracy, the court has applied the two-level increase \u201cwhen the weapon is discovered in a place where the conspiracy was carried out or furthered.\u201d <em>Id.; see United States v. Harris, </em>128 F.3d 850, 852 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-17\">Here, the district court found that the enhancement applied, noting that a heavy \u2014 duty scale, duct tape, and sandwich bags \u2014 all drug paraphernalia-were found in the bathroom of Cano\u2019s residence, and a gun was located in his bedroom. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>The court noted that wiretap conversations established that Cano and his mother, also a co-conspirator, had discussed the potential delivery of drugs to his residence, and that two kilograms of cocaine were buried in Cano\u2019s mother\u2019s garage \u2014 which was 50 to 75 yards from Cano\u2019s residence \u2014 in just the manner in which Cano and his mother had discussed in another wiretap conversation. We find no clear error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that these facts were sufficient to justify the enhancement for possession of the weapon. <em>See United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir.2001) (providing standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Having found that Cano possessed a firearm and that it was not clearly improbable that the possession was in connection with the conspiracy offense, USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), comment, (n. 3), we find that the district court did not plainly err <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> in determining further that Cano possessed a firearm in connection with the conspiracy offense and thus did not qualify for the safety valve reduction. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">In conclusion, we affirm Cano\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b616-8\"><em> </em>Because Cano did not present this argument in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
