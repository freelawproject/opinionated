Leon, appeals from the District Court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">Leon is a federal prisoner who pled guilty to various drug charges in Rhode Island in 2004. He was sentenced to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment and is currently confined at the Federal Correctional Institution in Allenwood, Pennsylvania. Leon petitioned the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-15\">While Leon\u2019s habeas petition was pending, he filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania seeking transcripts of the Grand Jury proceedings and any related documents under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B). For reasons that are not clear, the District Court construed this complaint as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Having done so, the Court dismissed the complaint without prejudice because it sought relief that is not available under the federal habeas statutes. Leon filed a motion for reconsideration in which he argued that it was inappropriate to dismiss his complaint on these grounds because he was seeking relief under FOIA, not under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The District Court denied reconsideration, and Leon filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-17\">We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and undertake plenary review of the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint, accepting as true all factual allegations in the complaint and viewing them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>See AT&amp;T Corp. v. JMC Telecom, LLC, </em>470 F.3d 525, 529 (3d Cir.2006). \u201cWe may affirm the District Court on any ground supported by the record.\u201d <em>Azubuko v. Royal, </em>443 F.3d 302, 303 (3d Cir.2006) (citations omitted). We review the District Court\u2019s denial of reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>See Alston v. Parker, </em>363 F.3d 229, 233 (3d Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>We agree with appellant\u2019s contention that his complaint should not have been denied as an improper habeas petition. In refusing to grant reconsideration on this issue, the District Court abused its discretion. Nonetheless, we will affirm the dismissal of Leon\u2019s complaint because it failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Under Exemption 3 of FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3), disclosure of Grand Jury materials is governed by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6. <em>See McDonnell v. United States, 4 </em>F.3d 1227, 1246-47 (3d Cir.1993); Fed R. Crim P. 6(e). Rule 6 establishes a presumption of nondisclosure of Grand Jury materials. <em>See McDonnell, 4 </em>F.3d at 1246-47. Because Leon\u2019s complaint does not allege any grounds for disclosure of Grand Jury materials under Rule 6(e)(3), it was subject to dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>See id. </em>at 1248 (\u201c[A] FOIA plaintiff may not obtain disclosure by relying on Rule 6(e)(3)(C)(i) as an exception to the general rule of secrecy under Rule 6(e)(2).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
