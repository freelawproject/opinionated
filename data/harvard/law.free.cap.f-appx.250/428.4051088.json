M.H. ex rel. A.H. v. Monroe-Woodbury Cent. Sch. Dist, </em>No. 04-cv-3029, 2006 WL 728483 (S.D.N.Y. Mar.20, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-15\">Reviewing <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and its application of the IDEA\u2019S statutory and regulatory provisions to the facts of this ease, <em>see Cerra v. Pawling Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>427 F.3d 186, 191 (2d Cir.2005), we agree with Monroe that the district court failed to give \u201cdue weight\u201d to the findings of the state review officer (\u201cSRO\u201d) and independent hearing officer (\u201cIHO\u201d). <em>See Walczak v. Fla. Union Free Sch. Dist., </em>142 F.3d 119, 129 (2d Cir.1998) (stating that federal courts are required to give \u201cdue weight\u201d to state administrative proceedings under the IDEA). A district court must grant particular deference to the administrative proceedings when, as in this case, its decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>is based solely on the same evidence in the administrative record. <em>See M.S. ex rel. S.S. v. Bd. of Educ. of Yonkers, </em>281 F.3d 96, 105 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">The district court reversed the conclusion of the SRO that Monroe\u2019s individualized educational plan (\u201cIEP\u201d) was \u201creasonably calculated to enable [A.H.] to receive educational benefits,\u201d <em>see Cerra, </em>427 F.3d at 192, citing to evidence that suggested A.H. had progressed while at the specialized Windward School and reasoning that he would only continue to progress in a similar educational environment. The district court failed to acknowledge that the record contains contrary evidence with respect to many of the indicia of progress that it relied upon, such as results from clinical educational experts on whether A.H. had progressed in areas of educational deficit, A.H.\u2019s grades, and his teacher evaluations. The SRO considered these indicia, along with other factors, and concluded that Monroe\u2019s proposed IEP was appropriate to meet A.H.\u2019s educational needs. To the extent the district court suggested that the SRO and IHO misstated or misconstrued the record in reaching their conclusions, we do not agree. To the extent the district court found a lack of evidentiary support for the SRO and IHO decisions, it failed to consider the full record, mindful that plaintiffs bear the ultimate burden of proof, <em>see Schaffer ex rel. Schaffer v. Weast, </em>546 U.S. 49, 62, 126 S.Ct. 528, 163 L.Ed.2d 387 (2005) (holding that the burden of proof in an IDEA impartial hearing rests on the party seeking relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">We hold that the district court misapplied the standard of review applicable in IDEA cases by not according \u201cdue weight\u201d to the administrative findings and that the record does not demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that Monroe\u2019s IEP was inadequate to meet A.H.\u2019s educational needs. <em>See Gagliardo v. Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>489 F.3d 105, 112 (2d Cir.2007) (stating that federal courts must review the administrative proceedings under a preponderance of the evidence standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Because we do not conclude that the IEP was inadequate to meet A.H.\u2019s educational needs, plaintiffs are not entitled to tuition reimbursement for placing A.H. in private school. <em>See Walczak, </em>142 F.3d at 129 (holding that parents are entitled to tuition reimbursement when \u201cit appears (1) that the proposed IEP was inadequate to afford the child an appropriate public education, and (2) that the private education services obtained by the parents were appropriate to the child\u2019s needs\u201d) (citing <em>Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>471 U.S. 359, 370, 105 S.Ct. 1996, 85 L.Ed.2d 385 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the judgment below and REMAND to the district court with instructions to enter judgment in favor of Monroe.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
