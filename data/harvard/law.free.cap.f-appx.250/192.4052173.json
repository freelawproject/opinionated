At sentencing, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> determined that Wainwright\u2019s advisory Guidelines imprisonment range was 41-51 months, noted its consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and sentenced Wainwright to concurrent 46-month prison terms, to be followed by 5 years of supervised release. Wainwright appeals, and in a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), counsel raises issues concerning the reasonableness of Wainwright\u2019s prison sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">We review a sentence for reasonableness, affording a presumption of reasonableness if the sentence is within a correctly calculated Guidelines range. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (approving presumption of reasonableness for sentences within advisory Guidelines range). Upon careful review of the record, we conclude that the district court correctly calculated Wainwright\u2019s advisory Guidelines imprisonment range and reasonably sentenced him within that range. <em>See United States v. Two Shields, </em>497 F.3d 789, 795-96 (8th Cir.2007) (defendant overcomes presumption of reasonableness if district court failed to consider relevant factor that should have received significant weight, gave significant weight to improper or irrelevant factor, or weighed appropriate factors in clearly erroneous way).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-16\">After reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no non-frivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm, and we grant counsel leave to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-13\">. The Honorable Fernando J. Gaitan, Jr., Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
