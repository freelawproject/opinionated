Manion does not challenge whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. Instead, she maintains the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) did not properly develop the record and committed procedural errors by: sending treating physicians follow-up interrogatories; and ordering a consultative examination from a non-treating physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-21\">In applying for disability insurance benefits, Manion claimed disability due to fibromyalgia, neuropathy, acid reflux, gall stones, and high blood pressure. After the Commissioner denied her application, Manion requested, and received, an administrative hearing. She submitted five medical assessments from her treating physicians to the ALJ for review. The ALJ then sent each treating physician a request for supporting documentation. In addition, the ALJ solicited a non-treating physician to perform a consultative examination upon Manion.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-22\">The ALJ held: Manion was not under a \u201cdisability\u201d, as defined in the Social Security Act; and she retained the residual functional capability to, <em>inter alia, </em>continue her past work as a beautician. The Appeals Council denied Manion\u2019s request for review, leaving the ALJ\u2019s decision to stand as the final decision of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-23\">Procedural perfection is not required in administrative proceedings; accordingly, we \u201cwill not vacate a judgment unless the substantial rights of a party have been affected\u201d. <em>Mays v. Bowen, </em>837 F.2d 1362, 1364 (5th Cir.1988); <em>see also Morris v. Bowen, </em>864 F.2d 333, 335 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-24\">Essentially for the reasons stated by the district court, summary judgment was proper. An ALJ may contact a treating physician to obtain clarification of a previously submitted medical report. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512(e). Additionally, when a consultative examination is ordered, it is not mandatory that it be performed by a treating physician. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1519h.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>The assertion that the ALJ did not properly develop the record was not raised in district court. Accordingly, it is waived. <em>E.g., Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999) (\u201cThis Court will not consider an issue that a party fails to raise in the district court absent extraordinary circumstances.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b43-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
