Lamb denying petitioner\u2019s application for cancellation of removal. <em>In re Egerton Barrington Stewart, </em>No. A41 648 468, 2006 WL 3252568 (B.I.A. Aug. 24, 2006), <em>affg </em>No. A41 648 468 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 14, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts of this case, its procedural posture, and the decisions below.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-18\">Eligibility for cancellation of removal requires, <em>inter alia, </em>that a permanent resident, such as Petitioner, not have been convicted of an aggravated felony. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3). This Court has adopted the hypothetical federal felony approach, which treats a state conviction as a conviction for an aggravated felony for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>cancellation of removal purposes if it is analogous to an aggravated felony under federal law, regardless of how the state itself classifies the crime. <em>Aguirre v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 315, 317-18 (2d Cir.1996). Petitioner does not argue that he has not committed an aggravated felony under the hypothetical federal felony approach; rather, he asks us to overrule <em>Aguirre. </em>This we cannot do. <em>See United States v. Snow, </em>462 F.3d 55, 65 n. 11 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201c[A] prior decision of a panel of this court binds all subsequent panels \u2018absent a change in law by higher authority or by way of an in banc proceeding\u2019 .... \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. King, </em>276 F.3d 109, 112 (2d Cir. 2002))).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Petitioner also asserts that the BIA violated due process by not ruling on his application for relief under \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (now repealed). Relief under that section \u201cis not available with respect to convictions arising from plea agreements made on or after April 1, 1997,\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(h)(3), and Petitioner was charged with removability based on a 1999 guilty plea. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the BIA\u2019s failure to consider this claim was error, remand on such a patently meritless claim would be futile. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 158 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The petition for review is therefore DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
