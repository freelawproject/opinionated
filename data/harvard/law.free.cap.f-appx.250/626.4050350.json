Dominguez argues that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) based upon the determination that his 2004 convictions under Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 21.11(a) for indecency with a child were crimes of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Sexual abuse of a minor is an enumerated offense which qualifies as a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). <em>United States v. Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d 601, 604-05 (5th Cir.2000), held that a violation of \u00a7 21.11(a) is sexual abuse of a minor as that term is used in its \u201cordinary, contemporary, [and] common meaning.\u201d As such, the district court did not plainly err in applying the enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Dominguez also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This court has held that this issue is \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b652-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
