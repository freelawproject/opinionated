Brown, Linda Ruiz, and Kathleen Ousey appeal pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing, for failure to state a claim, his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging various constitutional violations by County of Santa Barbara officials related to the development of an experimental medical treatment. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Cholla Ready Mix, Inc. v. Civish, </em>382 F.3d 969, 973 (9th Cir.2004), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">The district court properly dismissed Brown\u2019s co-plaintiffs, Linda Ruiz, Kathleen Ousey, and Margaret Cousins, for lack of standing. <em>See Covington v. Jefferson County, </em>358 F.3d 626, 637-38 (9th Cir. 2004) (outlining requirements for standing). These three plaintiffs failed to allege any actual or imminent injury, asserting only hypothetical violations of Brown\u2019s rights based on the potential development of experimental treatments. <em>See id. </em>at 637-38 (standing requires, inter alia, an injury in fact that is concrete and actual or imminent).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">The district court properly dismissed the claims against defendant Stark on the basis of issue preclusion. <em>See Reyn\u2019s Pasta Bella, LLC v. Visa USA, Inc., </em>442 F.3d 741, 746 (9th Cir.2006) (outlining issue preclusion requirements).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">The district court properly dismissed the claims against defendants Montes de Oca and Egar because Brown did not allege they were acting under color of state law. <em>See Kirtley v. Rainey, </em>326 F.3d 1088, 1093 (9th Cir.2003) (holding public defender does not act under color of state law when performing a traditional function as counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-13\">The district court properly dismissed Brown\u2019s claims against defendants Sneddon and McLaughlin on the grounds of prosecutorial immunity. <em>See Milstein v. Cooley, 257 </em>F.3d 1004, 1008 (9th Cir.2001) (holding prosecutors are entitled to absolute immune from a civil suit for damages under section 1983 in initiating and prosecuting the State\u2019s case).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-14\">The district court properly dismissed Brown\u2019s claims against the County of Santa Barbara because a municipality can not be held liable under section 1983 on a respondeat superior theory. <em>See Hart v. Parks, </em>450 F.3d 1059, 1071 (9th Cir.2006) (holding municipal liability under section 1983 exists only for constitutional violations occurring pursuant to an official government policy or custom).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-15\">The district court properly dismissed Brown\u2019s claims against Commissioner Sterne on the basis of judicial immunity. <em>See Swift v. California, </em>384 F.3d 1184, 1188 (9th Cir.2004) (\u2018When judicial immunity is extended to officials other than judges, it is because then- judgments are \u2018functionality] comparab[le]\u2019 to those of judges \u2014 that is, because they, too, \u2018exercise a discretionary judgment\u2019 as part of their function.\u201d) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-16\">Brown\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b805-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
