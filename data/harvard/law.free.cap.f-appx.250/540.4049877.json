Bah entered the United States as a non-immigrant visitor in November 1996 and filed for asylum in 1997. His asylum application was denied. Bah converted his non-immigrant visa into a student visa in May 1997. In March 2003, the Department of Homeland Security served Bah with a Notice to Appear, alleging he was in violation of Section 237(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, currently codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(C)(i) (2000), for failing to comply with the conditions of his student visa. Bah conceded the charges and requested relief from removal in the form of asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-25\">An immigration judge denied Bah\u2019s requests for relief from removal. The judge stated that Bah\u2019s testimony \u201cis incredible with reference to his [political party] membership, and incredible with reference to his alleged two arrests, and that he has suffered past persecution or that anyone is seeking to harm him should he return to Guinea on account of alleged UNR activi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>ties.\u201d The immigration judge additionally found Bah had not met his burden of proof for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture. On appeal, the Board adopted and affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s decision, finding Bah failed to demonstrate the immigration judge committed clear error in its adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The INA authorizes the Attorney General to confer asylum on any refugee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a) (2000). It defines a refugee as a person unwilling or unable to return to his native country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000). An applicant can establish refugee status based on past persecution in his native country on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">This court accords broad, but not unlimited, deference to credibility findings supported by substantial evidence. <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir. 2004). A trier of fact who rejects an applicant\u2019s testimony on credibility grounds must offer specific, cogent reasons for the rejection. <em>Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989). This court defers to an immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination that is \u201csupported by substantial evidence on the record \u2018considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272, 278 (4th Cir.2004) (citing <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). \u201c \u2018If the [immigration judge\u2019s] adverse credibility finding is not based on a specific, cogent reason, but, instead is based on speculation, conjecture, or an otherwise unsupported personal opinion,\u2019 it cannot be upheld because \u2018it will not have been supported by substantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tewabe v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 533, 538 (4th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228, 250 (3d Cir.2003) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Considering the record as a whole, the reasons the immigration judge provided to support its adverse credibility finding are not cogent, and the finding is not supported by substantial evidence. The immigration judge provided several reasons in support of the adverse credibility determination, including several reasons identified as \u201cimplausibilities,\u201d however, we conclude none are either cogent or supported by the record considered as a whole. <em>See Tewabe, </em>446 F.3d at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">Because the adverse credibility finding is not supported by substantial evidence, we grant the petition for review, vacate the Board\u2019s order, and remand for further proceedings for the immigration judge to determine, without consideration of the previous adverse credibility determination, whether Bah can meet his burden of proving all the elements of his claim to asylum or other requested relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">\n<em>PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
