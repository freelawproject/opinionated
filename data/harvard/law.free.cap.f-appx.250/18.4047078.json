Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001), which rejected a Commerce Clause challenge to the felon-in-possession-of-a-firearm statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), and by <em>United States v. Dancy, </em>861 F.2d 77, 81-82 (5th Cir.1988), which held that a conviction under \u00a7 922(g) does not require proof that the defendant knew that the firearm had an interstate nexus or that he was a felon. Guerrero also raises arguments that are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Schmidt, </em>487 F.3d 253, 254-55 (5th Cir.2007), which rejected challenges based on <em>Staples v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 600, 114 S.Ct. 1793, 128 L.Ed.2d 608 (1994), and <em>Bryan v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 184, 118 S.Ct. 1939, 141 L.Ed.2d 197 (1998), to the validity of <em>Dancy. </em>The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b44-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
