Davis, </em>226 F.3d 346, 348 (5th Cir.2000). Davis now seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion challenging those convictions and sentences. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-22\">During the pendency of this appeal, Davis was released from prison, and he completed his term of supervised release. As a result, Davis\u2019s claims have been rendered moot. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998); <em>Bailey v. Southerland, </em>821 F.2d 277, 278-79 (5th Cir.1987). Therefore, this appeal is dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-23\">Davis\u2019s motions for COA and to supplement the record on appeal are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-24\">Davis\u2019s abuse of the judicial system warrants the imposition of a sanction. Davis was warned in a prior appeal in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 proceeding that further frivolous filings would result in the imposition of sanctions. <em>Davis v. Wendt, </em>173 Fed. Appx. 335 (5th Cir.2006)(unpublished). Accordingly, concomitantly with any other sanction already imposed by this or any other court, Davis is no longer allowed to file any documents or pleadings in this court or in any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction without first obtaining permission from a judge of this court. The Clerk of this Court and the clerks of all federal district courts within this Circuit are directed to refuse to file any pro se civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>complaint or appeal by Davis unless Davis submits proof that he has obtained the permission of this court. If Davis attempts to file any further notices of appeal or original proceedings in this court the clerk will docket them for administrative purposes only. Any other submissions which do not show proof that the sanction has been satisfied will be neither addressed nor acknowledged.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTIONS DENIED; SANCTION IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b663-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
