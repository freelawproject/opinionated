Adair argues that the district court violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment by refusing to allow him to represent himself at trial and that the court erred at sentencing by considering the testimony of a cooperating witness in determining the quantity of drugs on which it based Adair\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-21\">Although Adair expressed dissatisfaction with his attorney, he did not clearly and unequivocally request to proceed pro se at trial. <em>See Brown v. Wainwright, </em>665 F.2d 607, 610 (5th Cir.1982) (en banc). There was no violation of Adair\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>269 F.3d 514, 518 n. 5 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-22\">For the first time on appeal, Adair argues that, in determining his base offense level, the sentencing court was prohibited from considering a cooperating witness\u2019s testimony concerning Adair\u2019s drug-trafficking activities because the court instructed the jury that the witness\u2019s testimony concerning extraneous criminal acts was relevant only as to Adair\u2019s motive, intent, and knowledge and not to his guilt or innocence. We find no error, plain or otherwise, in the sentencing court\u2019s consideration of the cooperating witness\u2019s trial testimony. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l). The determination of the quantity of drugs relevant to Adair\u2019s sentence is not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b676-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
