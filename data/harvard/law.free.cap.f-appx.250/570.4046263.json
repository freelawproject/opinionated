He argues that his sentence was plainly unreasonable because the district court relied on factors it was not authorized to consider to determine the length of the sentence, specifically, the seriousness of the offense and a desire to impose a just punishment, factors which are not enumerated in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007), as proper considerations under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2007). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Davila was convicted in South Carolina of cocaine trafficking in 1991, served his federal sentence, and began a term of five years supervised release in 2001. In 2005, Davila was charged in Florida with armed robbery, armed kidnaping, and armed sexual battery with a firearm. He pled guilty to armed burglary and served a two-year state sentence. In 2007, the district court revoked his supervised release. The Chapter 7<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> policy statements established a sentencing range of 24-80 months. At the revocation hearing, Davila disputed the allegation in the violation report that he had gone to his ex-girlfriend\u2019s residence, forced his way in, and raped her. Defense counsel argued for a sentence within the range prescribed under the Chapter 7 policy statements, anticipating that the court might depart upward because of the nature of the charges brought against Davila. Counsel related Davila\u2019s version of events, stating that Davila went to the victim\u2019s residence to collect belongings; that she asked him to stay and became angry when he refused; that he found a gun that was not his in the house which accidentally discharged; that he threw the gun into an empty lot next door; and that he was arrested after a neighbor called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The district court reviewed the documents provided by Davila: a medical report which was negative for sperm on the victim, the victim\u2019s statement to police, and two incident reports involving the couple from the prior month. The court determined that the victim\u2019s statement was more credible than Davila\u2019s version of events and that, at the least, he had \u201cterrorized\u201d her while armed with the gun. The court imposed a sentence of forty-eight months and one year of supervised release, stating that it had considered the statutory requirements and the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">In <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1813, 167 L.Ed.2d 325 (2007), we held that \u201crevocation sentences should be reviewed to determine whether they are \u2018plainly unreasonable\u2019 with regard to those \u00a7 3553(a) factors applicable to supervised release revocation sentences.\u201d Review of a revocation sentence involves both procedural and substantive considerations. <em>Id. </em>at 438. A sentence is procedurally reasonable if the court considered the Chapter 7 policy statements and the pertinent factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 440. It is substantively reasonable if the court stated a proper basis for its decision to impose the sentence. <em>Id. </em>Finally, \u201ca court\u2019s statement of its reasons for going beyond non-binding <em>policy statements </em>in imposing a sentence after revoking a defendant\u2019s supervised release need not be as specific as has been required when courts departed from <em>guidelines </em>that were, before <em>Booker, </em>[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] considered to be mandatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439 (quoting <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>424 F.3d 239, 245 (2d Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">Here, the court did not state a specific reason for imposing a sentence above the Chapter 7 sentencing range, but its comments indicate a concern with Davila\u2019s conduct, which the court observed involved a gun and either violence or the threat of violence, and a concern that he might commit similar acts in the future. These factors are proper concerns for sentencing under \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (nature and circumstances of the offense), (2)(B) (adequate deterrence to criminal conduct), and (2)(c) (protection of the public). Therefore, we conclude that the sentence is not plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-6\">. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>ch. 7, pt.
