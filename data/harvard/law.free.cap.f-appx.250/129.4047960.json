Specifically, Defendant challenges the district court\u2019s application of a four-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">On November 22, 2005, a federal grand jury indicted Defendant on one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). The conduct underlying the indictment occurred on March 6, 2005. Defendant had recently acquired a new rifle and apparently decided to test fire the weapon from the patio of his apartment. Officers on foot patrol in the apartment complex heard the gunfire and observed muzzle flashes,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> responded to the point of origin, and found Defendant there. Defendant admitted ownership of the weapon and confessed that he had fired it. Defendant had a previous felony conviction and, accordingly, the officers arrested him for possession of a firearm. Defendant pled guilty on June 9, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">In anticipation of sentencing, the U.S. Probation Officer compiled a Pre-Sentence Investigation Report (hereinafter \u201cPSR\u201d). Defendant\u2019s PSR provided for a base offense level of 20 under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (hereinafter \u201cthe Guidelines\u201d). The PSR applied a four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) of the Guidelines for use of a firearm in connection with another felony offense, thus yielding a total offense level of 24. An additional two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice pursuant to \u00a7 3C1.1 increased Defendant\u2019s offense level to 26. Defendant fell into Criminal History Category III and, accordingly, the PSR set forth an advisory Guidelines range of 78 to 97 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">On September 7, 2006, the district court conducted Defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing and heard testimony from government witnesses. The district judge rejected the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under \u00a7 3C1.1, finding it unwarranted in this case. Additionally, he credited Defendant with a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. However, over Defendant\u2019s objections, the district judge did apply the four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). Thus, the district judge calculated a total offense level of 21 which, when taken with a Criminal History Category III, yielded an advisory Guidelines range of 46 to 57 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>The district court expressly acknowledged the advisory nature of the Guidelines and, subsequently, invited counsel to discuss the relevant \u00a7 3558(a) factors. The government stressed the seriousness of Defendant\u2019s conduct and his criminal history, which included convictions for attempted second degree murder and aggravated assault. The government further argued that the need to deter similar conduct and to protect the community rendered a sentence within the Guidelines range appropriate. Defendant sought a downward departure on the basis of the \u201cunusual\u201d circumstances supporting the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement \u2014 specifically, that Defendant did not fire the gun with bad intent but merely did \u201ca real stupid thing.\u201d (J.A. at 44-45.) Ultimately, the district court sentenced Defendant to 48 months imprisonment and three years of supervised release. Defendant timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Whether the district court properly concluded that Defendant used or possessed a firearm in connection with another felony offense under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) of the Guidelines constitutes a mixed question of law and fact that this Court reviews <em>de novo. United States v. Layne, </em>324 F.3d 464, 468 (6th Cir.2003). This Court reviews the district court\u2019s underlying factual findings for clear error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">B. Guidelines Enhancement Pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5)</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">Defendant challenges the district court\u2019s application of a four-level sentencing enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) of the Guidelines. Before the district court below, Defendant filed a position paper in response to the PSR, raising an objection to the four-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). Defendant admitted to discharging the weapon, but claimed that he \u201cwas careful to aim it in the sky, not in the direction of any buildings, and certainly not in the direction of any person.\u201d (J.A. at 12.) Defendant further noted that the Tennessee state court charged him with misdemeanor reckless endangerment. At Defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing, he again objected to the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement, asserting many of the arguments articulated in his position paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">At the sentencing hearing, the prosecution called Officer Billy Gray, the arresting officer at the scene. Officer Gray testified that he and two other officers were patrolling the Pepper Tree Apartments on March 6, 2005 around 9:00 p.m. Gray recalled that, aside from the officers, others were present outside the apartment complex that night \u201cwalking to and from.\u201d (JA. at 38.) While on patrol, the officers heard several gunshots, and through the darkness outside, they observed muzzle flashes coming from a unit approximately 30 feet away. Officer Gray indicated that they were \u201call under the impression that the gun was shot in [their] direction\u201d and that they heard the bullets go over their heads before hitting a wall. <em>(Id. </em>at 31-32.) He surmised that the gun was pointed at an angle when fired and not straight up in the air. The officers identified a bottom-floor apartment as the origin of the shots, and they approached to investigate. Gray stated that they found three or four men standing on the porch when they arrived and identified a .22-caliber rifle against the porch wall. When asked by the officers, Defendant admitted ownership of the rifle and that he had fired it. The officers subsequently arrested Defendant for possession of the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">Following Officer Gray\u2019s testimony, the district court framed the issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>The question is, is it the type of reckless conduct that can result in injury and reckless endangerment. Nobody is saying that defendant \u2014 and the officer is not saying that the defendant was trying to shoot them or trying to shoot anybody. If he was trying to shoot somebody and there had been somebody fleeing, he was in some type of confrontation, the charge wouldn\u2019t have been reckless endangerment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">... The problem is that people get hurt from this type of activity. It is extremely thoughtless. It is dangerous just in and of itself, and that\u2019s the problem.... (J.A. at 37-39.) At the close of the hearing, just before imposing a sentence, the district judge again referenced the enhancement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">[Defense counsel has] convinced me that there was no malintent in firing the weapon, but he has also convinced me that it was a really bad idea, which it was, and I am convinced that someone could have been hurt, and that is reckless endangerment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-6\"><em>(Id. </em>at 47.) Thus, the court concluded that the four-level enhancement applied in Defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Section 2K2.1(b)(5) of the Guidelines provides for a four-level increase to a defendant\u2019s base offense level \u201c[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (2005). \u201cFelony offense\u201d is defined as \u201cany offense (federal, state, or local) punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, whether or not a criminal charge was brought, or a conviction obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 4. Moreover, \u201c[t]he burden is on the government to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a particular sentencing enhancement applies.\u201d <em>United States v. Dupree, 323 F.3d </em>480, 491 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">In Tennessee, reckless endangerment with a deadly weapon constitutes a Class E felony punishable for a term of imprisonment exceeding one year. Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-103; <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 40-35-111(b)(5). A defendant commits reckless endangerment with a deadly weapon if he \u201crecklessly engages in conduct that places or may place another person in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury.\u201d Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-103. Under the Tennessee code,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-9\">\u201cReckless\u201d refers to a person who acts recklessly with respect to circumstances surrounding the conduct or the result of the conduct when the person is aware of but consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the circumstances exist or the result will occur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ano\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 39-11-302(c). \u201cImminent danger\u201d occurs when a person is \u201cplaced in a reasonable probability of danger as opposed to a mere possibility of danger.\u201d <em>State v. Payne, </em>7 S.W.3d 25, 28 (Tenn.1999) (citing <em>State v. Fox, </em>947 S.W.2d 865, 866 (Tenn. Crim.App.1996)). Where the victim is the \u201cpublic at large,\u201d as permitted under Tennessee law, the government must show that at least one person was present within the \u201czone of danger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The \u201czone of danger\u201d consists of \u201cthat area in which a reasonable probability exists that the defendant\u2019s conduct would place others in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury if others were present in that zone or area.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">On appeal, Defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that his conduct placed others in imminent danger. Defendant\u2019s argument seems to hinge on the fact that Defendant fired the gun into the air, not in the direction of anyone in the surrounding area. Here, Defendant relies on <em>State v. Baldwin, </em>No. 01C01-9612-CR-00530, 1998 WL 426199 (Tenn.Ct.App. July 29, 1998) (un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>published). In <em>Baldwin, </em>the defendant shot a bartender in a small and narrow restaurant. <em>Id. </em>at *1, 4. On the theory that \u201cthe bullet could have ricocheted off one of the metal appliances\u201d to strike a customer seated directly behind the defendant, the trial court convicted the defendant of felony reckless endangerment of the customer. <em>Id. </em>at *4. The appeals court observed that \u201cdischarging a weapon under circumstances \u2018where a stray bullet might possibly strike another person\u2019 is insufficient to support a conviction for reckless endangerment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There, the conviction was based on \u201cmere speculation\u201d that the customer could have been hit, and the evidence was therefore insufficient to prove the elements beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">In our view, <em>Baldwin </em>does not control the instant case. First, as this Court previously observed in a factually similar case, \u201cthe applicable burden of proof in a criminal prosecution (beyond a reasonable doubt) is ... different from the standard of proof required for the application of a sentencing enhancement under the Guidelines (preponderance of the evidence \u2014 so long as the sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum).\u201d <em>United States v. Lester, </em>238 Fed.Appx. 80, 85 (6th Cir.2007) (unpublished). Second, it is factually inapposite. The defendant in <em>Baldwin </em>could only strike one person behind the bar, and endangerment of others necessarily would require the bullet to ricochet and continue on with enough force to cause harm. In the instant case, Defendant shot his rifle in the dark of night from his patio in a residential apartment complex in the general direction of another part of the complex. Additionally, Officer Gray testified that he heard bullets over his head and that besides the officers, other individuals were present outside the complex. The instant record supports more than \u201cmere speculation\u201d that the bullet could strike another person. Indeed, the officers and others were \u201csubjected to a much greater risk of harm than the customer in <em>Baldwin.\u201d Lester, </em>238 Fed.Appx. at 85-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Another Tennessee case, <em>State v. Fox, </em>947 S.W.2d 865 (Tenn.Crim.App.1996), is factually closer to the case at bar. In <em>Fox, </em>the defendant fired a pistol into the air or into a tree. <em>Id. </em>at 865. However, the Tennessee appeals court found insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction for reckless endangerment because there \u201cwas no testimony that anyone was either in the tree being fired upon or outside the apartment budding in the immediate vicinity of the [defendant].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Yet, the instant case is readily distinguishable. Again, Defendant fired the gun into the air, or on a diagonal trajectory, in the general direction of the officers. The officers were standing outside on the patio of another unit approximately 30 feet away, and Officer Gray heard a bullet fly over the officers\u2019 heads. Even if Defendant fired the bullet into the air, basic principles of gravity dictate that what comes up generally must come down. By shooting the gun into the air while others stood in the \u201cimmediate vicinity,\u201d Defendant placed those individuals in a \u201creasonable probability of danger.\u201d <em>See Payne, </em>7 S.W.3d at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">In the instant case, we find that the government met its burden, and accordingly, that the district court did not err in applying the enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) of the Guidelines. The record indicates that Defendant fired a gun into the air, or in a diagonal trajectory, in a residential apartment complex in the dark. The record further indicates that the officers heard bullets go over their heads before hitting a wall. Not only were the officers outside the complex, but other people were outside as well, \u201cwalking to and from.\u201d (J.A. at 28.) Defendant\u2019s conduct placed the officers and others outside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>\u201cin a reasonable probability of danger\u201d when he fired the rifle into the air in an area where others, including the arresting officer, were present. <em>See Payne, </em>7 S.W.3d at 28. As the district judge observed, a .22-caliber bullet that strikes a person at a range of 30 feet \u201ccould do some damage.\u201d (J.A. at 39.) Obviously, serious bodily injury, if not death, could follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Consequently, the district court did not err in applying \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) of the Guidelines to enhance Defendant\u2019s sentence by four levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">For the reasons set forth above, this Court AFFIRMS the district court judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b156-10\">.
