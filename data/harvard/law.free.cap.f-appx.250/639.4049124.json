Generally, this court has jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of motions to reconsider even though they are discretionary decisions. <em>See Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 302-03 (5th Cir.2005). The government correctly asserts, however, that this court lacks jurisdiction over Sudan\u2019s arguments challenging the original BIA order affirming the IJ\u2019s decision, except to the extent that they also challenge the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion for reconsideration. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394, 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(6) (1988 Supp. V) (recodified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(6))). Accordingly, we have no jurisdiction over Sudan\u2019s arguments that concerns for efficiency and uniformity require this court to remand to the BIA. <em>See id.; see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-20\">Sudan argues that his order of deferred adjudication for misdemeanor assault of a family member does not qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and that he is therefore eligible for cancellation of removal. Because he failed to raise the issue in his removal proceedings and motion to reconsider, and because failure to exhaust an issue creates a \u201cjurisdictional bar,\u201d <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir. 2001), we lack jurisdiction over this claim. \u00a7 1252(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-21\">Sudan contends that the BIA erred because he satisfies the four conditions set forth in \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1)(ii), making his application for adjustment of status amenable to the IJ\u2019s jurisdiction. The government argues that the use of the definite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>article \u201cthe\u201d in \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1)(ii)(A)-(D) means that, although the IJ would have had jurisdiction over the adjustment application that Sudan filed before leaving for India and that was based on his wife\u2019s relative visa petition, the new adjustment application he has filed based on a labor certification is not amenable to the IJ\u2019s jurisdiction. Under a plain reading of the regulation, the government\u2019s argument is unassailable; the adjustment application that Sudan wants an IJ to adjudicate is not <em>\u201cthe </em>previously filed application\u201d that was based on Sudan\u2019s wife\u2019s relative visa petition. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1)(ii)(B) (emphasis added); <em>see S.D. ex rel. Dickson v. Hood, </em>391 F.3d 581, 595 (5th Cir.2004) (\u201cWe have consistently held that a regulation should be construed to give effect to the natural and plain meaning of its words.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Sudan also avers that the \u201cnew regulation must be interpreted to cover new adjustment applications filed by the advance parolee,\u201d because the new rule, unlike the prior version of \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1), does not specify that an application filed by a paroled alien may be \u201crenewed.\u201d The section in which the word \u201crenewed\u201d formerly appeared has been completely rewritten, however, and the use of the definite article in the new rule demonstrates that only the previously-filed application is amenable to the IJ\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1245.2(a)(1) (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Next, Sudan argues that the BIA should have remanded to allow the IJ to consider granting a continuance pending the resolution of Sudan\u2019s new adjustment application before the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d). Here, as in the proceedings below, Sudan cites no law in support of this argument. <em>Cf. </em>\u00a7 1003.2(b)(1) (\u201cA motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d). Given that failure to present any basis for the BIA to remand to the IJ, the BIA\u2019s refusal to remand cannot be considered an abuse of discretion. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 1003.2(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Sudan argues that the new rule violates \u00a7 245(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). The government correctly notes that Sudan has never provided any evidence that his application for a labor certificate has been approved. Thus, there is no evidence in the record that \u201can immigrant visa is immediately available to him.\u201d \u00a7 1255(a). Accordingly, Sudan\u2019s claim that the BIA abused its discretion in its interpretation and application of the new rule by effectively denying him statutory eligibility to adjust his status before an IJ is without merit, because there is no record evidence that he is statutorily eligible in the first place. <em>See Singh, </em>436 F.3d at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">The petition for review of the denial of the motion to reconsider is DISMISSED in part for lack of jurisdiction and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b665-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
