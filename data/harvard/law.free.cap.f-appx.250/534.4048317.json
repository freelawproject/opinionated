The district court sentenced Scott to 204 months\u2019 imprisonment. Scott argues the district court erred in the factual finding underlying its denial of his motion to suppress. We find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">This court reviews factual findings underlying a district court\u2019s suppression determination for clear error and the district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo. <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, this court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Scott argues the district court\u2019s factual finding that police officers observed a bulge in his waistband was not supported by sufficient evidence. At the hearing on the motion to suppress, Officer Bearde testified that as he initially approached the vehicle during a traffic stop, he saw Scott, the passenger, \u201cleaning towards his left ... and ... his right hand ... was adjusting an unknown object in his waistband area.\u201d Bearde did not use the word \u201cbulge\u201d in his testimony. Bearde wrote in his statement of probable cause both that he saw Scott adjust an item in his waistband and that he saw \u201ca bulge sticking out from Scott\u2019s thin T-shirt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">The district court found the two police officers who conducted the traffic stop credible. The district court determined the police officers had \u201ca reasonable suspicion that Mr. Scott was armed or otherwise posed a threat of danger,\u201d based in part upon Bearde\u2019s observation of \u201cthe bulge in the pants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">The district court repeatedly referred to Bearde\u2019s testimony regarding \u201cthe bulge\u201d in its factual findings. On appeal, Scott challenges the district court\u2019s use of the word \u201cbulge,\u201d arguing the evidence in the record does not support such a finding. However, Scott did not argue this issue in district court nor object to the district court\u2019s references to \u201cthe bulge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">This court will generally not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993). \u201cExceptions to this general rule are made only in very limited circumstances, such as where refusal to consider the newly-raised issue would be plain error or would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The issue of the trial judge\u2019s references to \u201cthe bulge\u201d at Scott\u2019s waist instead of \u201cthe unidentified item\u201d in his waistband is not one of plain error, nor would refusing to examine the issue on appeal result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">In light of the possible danger of a roadside encounter with a suspect, a police officer may conduct a limited protective search aimed at finding concealed weapons, if the officer \u201cpossesses a reasonable belief based on \u2018specific and articulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant\u2019 the officer in believing that the suspect is dangerous and the suspect may gain immediate control of weapons.\u201d <em>Michigan v. Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 1049, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983) (quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">Observing a bulge that could be a weapon in a suspect\u2019s clothing \u201creasonably warrants a belief that the suspect is potentially dangerous.\u201d <em>United States v. Baker, </em>78 F.3d 135, 137 (4th Cir.1996). Similarly, seeing an object underneath a suspect\u2019s clothing that could be a weapon warrants a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>belief that the suspect is armed and dangerous, as Officer Bearde believed in this case. Thus, the two observations have the same legal significance. After hearing Bearde testify that he saw Scott reach with his right hand and adjust an unknown item hidden in his waistband, the district court simply summarized this testimony as an observation of a \u201cbulge,\u201d as did Scott\u2019s own counsel when explaining why this portion of Bearde\u2019s testimony was not credible. This generalized summary of the testimony does not constitute plain error or a fundamental miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Moreover, Bearde testified that in addition to seeing Scott adjust an unknown item in his waistband, Bearde conducted the stop in a high crime ai\u2019ea; as Bearde talked with the driver, Scott was visibly shaking, sweating, and looking straight ahead without making eye contact; and Bearde actually saw the handle of the gun when Scott raised his arms. The district court did not clearly err in finding the officers had reasonable suspicion that Scott was armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Scott\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
