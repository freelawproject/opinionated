We conclude that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in denying the continuance. We discern no error in the conclusion of the courts below that DHL failed to prove that the debtor had fewer than 12 creditors. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(b) (although a single qualified creditor may file an involuntary bankruptcy petition if there are fewer than 12 creditors, the statute requires three or more qualified creditors to file an involuntary bankruptcy petition if there are 12 or more such creditors).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We decline to address DHL\u2019s argument concerning payments to creditors post-petition, because it was not raised in the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-18\">. We also conclude that the appeal is not moot. The parties dispute whether the bankruptcy court made a ruling pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 305 (permitting a bankruptcy court to dismiss a case where \"the interests of creditors and the debtor would be better served by such dismissal.\u201d). The parties also dispute whether the district court's ruling based on \u00a7 305 was dicta. Assuming <em>arguendo, </em>but not deciding, that the courts below did dismiss the case relying alternatively upon \u00a7 305 as well as upon 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303, we nevertheless conclude that this appeal is not moot. The \u00a7 303 issue is a live issue because the pending claims for damages and attorney\u2019s fees depend upon the validity of the \u00a7 303 ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
