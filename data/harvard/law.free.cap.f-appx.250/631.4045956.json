An immigration judge (IJ) determined that Singh was ineligible for adjustment of status and ordered him removed to India. While Singh\u2019s appeal of the IJ\u2019s decision was pending before the BIA and after briefing had been completed by the parties, the Attorney General and Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued an interim rule repealing the regulations that barred Singh\u2019s eligibility for adjustment of status and clarifying where jurisdiction lies to adjudicate adjustment applications. Applying the interim rule, the BIA determined that the IJ lacked jurisdiction to consider Singh\u2019s adjustment application.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Singh argues that his due process rights were violated because the BIA decided his case pursuant to the interim rule, which the parties did not have an opportunity to address. Singh\u2019s argument is unavailing because \u201cdiscretionary relief from removal, including an application for adjustment of status, is not a liberty or property right that requires due process protection.\u201d <em>Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 440 (5th Cir .2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-13\">Singh makes no argument that the BIA otherwise misapplied the interim rule, that the interim rule is inapplicable to his case, or that the regulations amended by the interim rule are facially invalid in their current form. Singh has thus waived any such arguments. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986). Instead, Singh argues that remand is appropriate based on additional amendments presented in the interim rule for consideration and public comment. Singh argues that these prospective amendments could later be found to conflict with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). Singh\u2019s argument is not ripe for review. <em>See Chem. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, </em>870 F.2d 177, 233 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-14\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b658-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
