For the reasons discussed below, we dismiss the petition for review for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-21\">Under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) (West 2005), we lack jurisdiction, except as provided in 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (West 2005), to review the final order of removal of an alien convicted of certain enumerated crimes, including offenses covered in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2) (2000). Because Lagos was found removable for having been convicted of a controlled substance offense as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), we have jurisdiction \u201cto review factual determinations that trigger the jurisdiction-stripping provision, such as whether [Lagos] [i]s an alien and whether []he has been convicted of [a controlled substance offense].\u201d <em>Ramtulla v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 202, 203 (4th Cir.2002); <em>see Lewis v. INS, </em>194 F.3d 539, 542-43 (4th Cir.1999) (same). If the predicate conditions are found, then, under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D), we can only consider \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d <em>See Mbea v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 276, 278 n. 1 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-23\">Because we find that Lagos is indeed an alien who has been convicted of a controlled substance offense, <em>see Cruz-Garza v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 1125, 1128 (10th Cir. 2005); <em>Matter of Roldan-Santoyo, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 512 (B.I.A.1999), <em>vacated on other grounds sub nom Lujan-Armendariz v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 728 (9th Cir.2000), \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) divests us of jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>over the petition for review, except to the extent that Lagos raises a constitutional issue or question of law. He raises only one issue that arguably could be considered a question of law in his petition for review,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> namely, whether the ninety-day time period for filing a motion to reopen is subject to equitable tolling. Lagos does not challenge the legal standard for equitable tolling, however, but simply disagrees with the Board\u2019s factual determination that equitable tolling was not warranted in his case. We find that this is not a \u201cquestion of law\u201d within the meaning of the REAL ID Act and is merely a factual issue over which we lack jurisdiction. <em>See Boakai v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b589-15\"> Lagos does not raise any constitutional issues in his petition for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
