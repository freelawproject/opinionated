The district court dismissed the action finding that the Rooker-Feldman<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> doctrine applied where the plaintiffs were seeking an order finding that prior rulings in a state court were void. Accordingly, the district court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on the basis that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Plaintiffs then filed a motion for reconsideration which was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-22\">We review the dismissal of a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo. <em>Dale v. Moore, </em>121 F.3d 624, 626 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Behrens v. Regier, </em>422 F.3d 1255, 1259 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Swann v. S. Health Partners, Inc., </em>388 F.3d 834, 836 (11th Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-23\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court correctly applied the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine where the plaintiffs were requesting the district court to declare a final state court judgment void. Moreover, we observe that the plaintiffs\u2019 theory of liability against the defendant, who is a state court judge, is based entirely upon his status as Chief Judge of the 17th Judicial Court and does not relate to any act or omission on the defendant\u2019s part. In fact, the amended complaint does not allege that the defendant personally violated the plaintiffs\u2019 rights in any way. Indeed, the plaintiffs seek to hold the defendant vicariously liable for what the plaintiffs contend were erroneous rulings or acts committed by the other circuit court judges assigned to their case. The law is clear in this circuit that supervisory officials cannot be held liable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for the unconstitutional acts of their subordinates. <em>Gray v. Bostic, </em>458 F.3d 1295, 1308 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2428, 167 L.Ed.2d 1129 (2007); <em>Hartley v. Parnell, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>198 F.3d 1263, 1269 (11th Cir.1999).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court appropriately granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, and we affirm the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-18\">. <em>Rooker v.
