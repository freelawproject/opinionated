Because Fulton has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d this court denies his request for a COA and dismisses this appeal. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">After a Kansas jury trial, Fulton was convicted of felony murder, conspiracy to possess cocaine, and attempted possession of cocaine. <em>State v. Fulton, </em>269 Kan. 835, 9 P.3d 18, 20 (2000). His convictions were affirmed on direct appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 28. Fulton then filed a motion pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 60-1507, seeking state post-conviction relief. The motion was denied by the state district court and the Kansas Court of Appeals affirmed the denial. <em>Fulton v. State, </em>110 P.3d 1053 (Kan.Ct. App.2005) (unpublished disposition). The Kansas Supreme Court denied review on September 22, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">Fulton filed the instant \u00a7 2254 habeas application on December 29, 2005, raising allegations (1) the trial court committed multiple errors including failing to grant his motion for a mistrial and failing to give an accomplice witness instruction, (2) his rights under the Confrontation Clause were violated .by an ex parte communication between the trial court and a juror, and (3) the crime of attempted possession of cocaine cannot be used to support a felony murder conviction. Respondent moved to dismiss Fulton\u2019s \u00a7 2254 application, arguing it was untimely because it was not filed within the one-year statute of limitations applicable to federal habeas corpus petitions filed by state prisoners. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). The district court granted Respondent\u2019s motion and dismissed Fulton\u2019s habeas petition as untimely. Fulton then filed a Rule 59(e) motion, challenging the district court\u2019s determination his convictions became final on October 19, 2000, when the time for seeking a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court from the decision of the Kansas Supreme Court expired. Fulton argued his conviction did not become final until November 13, 2000, because, <em>inter alia, </em>under Kansas Supreme Court Rule 7.06 he had twenty days to file a petition for rehearing after the Kansas Supreme Court affirmed his conviction and that twenty-day period should be added to the ninety days he had to file a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>preme Court. The district court considered Fulton\u2019s arguments but concluded the Kansas Supreme Court Rule does not delay the start of the ninety-day period unless a petition for rehearing is actually filed. <em>Cf. Mills v. McKune, </em>186 Fed.Appx. 828, 880-31 (10th Cir.2006) (unpublished disposition).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">To be entitled to a COA, Fulton must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make the requisite showing, he must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (quotations omitted); <em>see also Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484-85, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (holding that when a district court dismisses a habeas petition on procedural grounds, a petitioner is entitled to a COA only if he shows both that reasonable jurists would find it debatable whether he had stated a valid constitutional claim and debatable whether the district court\u2019s procedural ruling was correct). In evaluating whether Fulton has satisfied his burden, this court undertakes \u201ca preliminary, though not definitive, consideration of the [legal] framework\u201d applicable to each of his claims. <em>Miller-El </em>at 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029. Although Fulton need not demonstrate his appeal will succeed to be entitled to a COA, he must \u201cprove something more than the absence of frivolity or the existence of mere good faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">This court has reviewed Fulton\u2019s appellate brief and application for COA, the district court\u2019s orders, and the entire record on appeal pursuant to the framework set out by the Supreme Court in <em>Miller-El </em>and concludes that Fulton is not entitled to a COA. The district court\u2019s resolution of Fulton\u2019s habeas petition is not reasonably subject to debate and his claims are not adequate to deserve further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, Fulton has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d and is not entitled to a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">This court denies Fulton\u2019s request for a COA and dismisses this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b291-6\">. In his application for a COA, Fulton asserts that the one-year statute of limitations should be equitably tolled. This assertion was not made in the district court and this court does not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Rhine v. Boone, </em>182 F.3d 1153, 1154 (10th Cir. 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
