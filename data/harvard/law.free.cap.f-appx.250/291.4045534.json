Because Petrella\u2019s action was time-barred by the six-month statute of limitations, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">We review a summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standard used by the district court. <em>Dadeland Depot, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>483 F.3d 1265, 1268 (11th Cir.2007). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">A limitations period of six months applies to Petrella\u2019s complaint. <em>See DelCostello v. Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, </em>462 U.S. 151, 169-172, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 2293-94, 76 L.Ed.2d 476 (1983). The timeliness of the complaint is \u201cmeasured from the date on which the employee knew or should have known of the union\u2019s final action.\u201d <em>Proudfoot v. Seafarer\u2019s Int\u2019l Union, </em>779 F.2d 1558, 1559 (11th Cir.1986). \u201cFinal action\u201d is defined as \u201cthe point where the grievance procedure was exhausted or otherwise broke down to the employee\u2019s disadvantage.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Petrella knew or should have known that the grievance procedure had broken down to his disadvantage more than six months before he commenced his action against CWA in January 2006. In a letter dated December 9, 2003, a representative of CWA informed Petrella that the union had processed his grievance, believed that there was \u201cvery little chance to win in arbitration,\u201d and would close the grievance if no internal appeal was pursued. After his appeals to the vice-president and president of CWA were denied, Petrella abandoned the internal appeal process. When Petrella\u2019s last appeal to CWA was rejected on April 15, 2004, and he failed to appeal the decision, Petrella knew or should have known that the grievance procedure had been exhausted or otherwise broken down to his disadvantage. Because Petrella\u2019s complaint was filed more than six months later, the district court correctly concluded that the complaint was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">The summary judgment against Petrel-la\u2019s complaint is</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
