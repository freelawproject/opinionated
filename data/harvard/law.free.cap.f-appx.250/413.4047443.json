We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-17\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. New York v. Nat\u2019l Serv. Indus., </em>460 F.3d 201, 206 (2d Cir.2006). \u201c[Sjummary judgment is appropriate where there exists no genuine issue of material fact and, based on the undisputed facts, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>D\u2019Amico v. City of New York, </em>132 F.3d 145, 149 (2d Cir.1998); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-18\">Having reviewed the record, we agree with the district court that the appellee did not improperly withhold any documents responsive to the appellant\u2019s Freedom of Information Act request. For the reasons stated by the district court, we conclude that there are no genuine issues of material fact warranting a trial on appellant\u2019s claims, and such claims are without merit. Therefore, we hold that appellant\u2019s claims were properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-19\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
