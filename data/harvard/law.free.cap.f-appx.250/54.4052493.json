For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-18\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b81-19\">This case comes to us on appeal for the second time. It arises out of a tragic event that resulted in the death of Roy and Carol Mudrick\u2019s (the \u201cMudricks\u201d or \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) son, Jonathan Mudrick (the \u201cDecedent\u201d), on October 17, 2002. The Decedent was employed by Cook Inlet Spill Prevention &amp; Response, Inc. (\u201cCISPRI\u201d) as an Oil Spill Technician (\u201cOST\u201d) aboard Barge 141 in Nikiski Bay, Alaska when he was struck in the head by a steel anchor cable that came off of the winch, manufactured by Cross Equipment, Ltd. (\u201cCross\u201d or \u201cDefendant\u201d), that he was using to wind the cable and raise the anchor.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-20\">As an OST, the Decedent was required to: conduct \u201cand/or direct the deployment, operation, and recovery of each of CIS-PRI\u2019s oil spill response systems ... to effectively control, contain, and clean-up oil spills\u201d; and to safely \u201coperate all CISPRI spill response and support equipment, vessels, vehicles, and heavy equipment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-21\">The education and experience required for the Decedent\u2019s OST position include: a \u201c[mjarine background with thorough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>knowledge of marine conditions which exist within the State of Alaska and specifically in the current CISPRI response area\u201d; vessel \u201coperating skills including navigation, seamanship, weather observations, operating in close proximity to other vessels and spill response equipment\u201d; and a \u201cMerchant Marine Document with Barge Tankerman ... endorsement \u2014 includes barge firefighting training.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The physical demands of the Decedent\u2019s job include: \u201cwalking, climbing ladders, work on vessels and barges\u201d; \u201cdriv[ing]/operat[ing] vehicles, vessels, and heavy equipment (including cranes)\u201d; \u201clifting small pumps and generators ... from vessel to vessel ... or on the deck of a vessel moving both up and down and side to side on iced or wet surfaces\u201d; \u201cclimb[ing] up and down a dock ladder ... and mov[ing] to or from a moving vessel on to the ladder\u201d; \u201cmaintain[ing] balance while moving from dock to vessel across railings ... onto a vessel that may be moving up and down as much as 4 feet\u201d; possessing \u201cunimpaired judgment and physical ability to perform as the Operator of a small vessel ... in seas up to 6 feet ... with up to 4 passengers or crew\u201d; \u201cpull[ing] ... lines ... on a large vessel\u2019s steel deck, which may be moving from side to side or up and down and may be coated with water, snow, or ice\u201d; assisting \u201cin the rescue of a co-worker from the water ... solo on a two man response vessel\u201d; and performing \u201croutine and emergency maintenance within the confines of a small vessel engine room.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The Mudricks sued Cross, as well as other parties who were subsequently dismissed, for negligence, strict liability, failure to warn, and breach of warranty under the Texas Wrongful Death Act. On August 31, 2005, Cross filed its first motion for summary judgment on the issues of the Decedent\u2019s Jones Act seaman status and the application of the general maritime law. The district court granted Cross\u2019s motion on December 9, 2005, 2005 WL 3359355, based primarily on evidence in the Decedent\u2019s time sheets that he had spent thirty-two percent of his time working on CISPRI vessels in navigation. The court determined that when combined with his job duties, the evidence established that the Decedent qualified as a seaman. On appeal, we vacated the summary judgment and remanded to the district court for reconsideration under the proper summary judgment standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">On remand, the district court again granted summary judgement for Cross on March 12, 2007, incorporating its first order into its second and determining that the Decedent was a Jones Act seaman, and that the general maritime law should apply, thus barring the Mudricks from recovering non-pecuniary damages under <em>Scarborough v. Clemco Industries, </em>391 F.3d 660 (5th Cir.2004). The Mudricks filed timely notice of appeal on April 9, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in that party\u2019s favor. <em>See Crawford v. Formosa Plastics Corp., </em>234 F.3d 899, 902 (5th Cir.2000). \u201cSummary judgment is proper when the evidence reflects no genuine issues of material fact and the nonmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)). \u201cA genuine issue of material fact exists \u2018if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">When, as here, the moving party bears the burden of proof on the relevant issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>at trial, the moving party \u201cmust establish beyond peradventure <em>all </em>of the essential elements of the claim or defense to warrant judgment in his favor.\u201d <em>Fontenot v. Upjohn Co., </em>780 F.2d 1190, 1194 (5th Cir. 1986) (emphasis in original); <em>see also Bernard v. Binnings Constr. Co., </em>741 F.2d 824, 827 (5th Cir.1984) (holding that the burden of proving seaman status is on the party claiming benefits therefrom). Then, the nonmoving party must present \u201cspecific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e); <em>see also Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 586-87, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). \u201cConclusional allegations and denials, speculation, improbable inferences, unsubstantiated assertions, and legalistic argumentation do not adequately substitute for specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>TIG Ins. Co. v. James, </em>276 F.3d 754, 759 (5th Cir.2002). \u201cIf the evidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 249-50, 106 S.Ct. 2505 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The dispositive issue in this case is whether the Decedent was a seaman under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30104. The Supreme Court has given us a two-pronged test to determine seaman status. First, \u201cthe worker\u2019s duties must contribute to the function of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission.\u201d <em>Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, </em>515 U.S. 347, 368, 115 S.Ct. 2172, 132 L.Ed.2d 314 (1995). Second, \u201cthe worker must have a connection to a vessel in navigation (or to an identifiable group of such vessels) that is substantial in terms of both its duration and its nature.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">The Supreme Court has endorsed the Fifth Circuit\u2019s benchmark for measuring whether a worker\u2019s connection is of a substantial duration, declining \u201cto find seaman status where the employee spent less than 30 percent of his time aboard ship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367, 115 S.Ct. 2172 (citing <em>Barrett v. Chevron, U.S.A., Inc., </em>781 F.2d 1067 (5th Cir. 1986) (en banc)) (listing Fifth Circuit cases applying the thirty percent benchmark). The Court added, however, that this \u201cfigure ... serves as no more than a guideline established by years of experience, and departure from it will certainly be justified in appropriate cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 371, 115 S.Ct. 2172.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Essentially, the \u201cfundamental purpose of this substantial connection requirement is to ... separate the sea-based maritime employees who are entitled to Jones Act protection from ... land-based workers who have only a transitory or sporadic connection to a vessel in navigation, and ... whose employment does not regularly expose them to the perils of the sea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 368, 115 S.Ct. 2172; <em>see also In re Endeavor Marine, Inc., </em>234 F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir.2000). In general, seaman status under the Jones Act is a mixed question of law and fact, usually determined by a jury. <em>In re Endeavor Marine, Inc., </em>234 F.3d at 290. \u201cNevertheless, summary judgment ... is mandated where the facts and the law will reasonably support only one conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">On appeal, the Mudricks challenge the district court\u2019s determination that the Decedent had a connection \u201csubstantial in terms of both its duration and its nature,\u201d <em>Chandris, </em>515 U.S. at 368, 115 S.Ct. 2172 to a fleet of CISPRI vessels in navigation. Cross argues that the Mudricks waived their specific arguments on appeal by failing to raise them with equal specificity to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>A. Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">In its brief to this court, Cross, relying on <em>Vogel v. Veneman, </em>276 F.3d 729, 733 (5th Cir.2002), argues that the Mudricks waived their arguments challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding that the Decedent\u2019s connection to a fleet of vessels in navigation was substantial because they did not raise them before the district court. Comparing the Mudricks\u2019 response to Cross\u2019s motion for summary judgment with their brief on appeal, we note that the Mudricks certainly parse the record with significantly more detail in their brief than they did below. However, the Mudricks did argue to the district court that the Decedent\u2019s time sheets were not sufficiently specific to establish that the Decedent spent at least thirty percent of his time working on CISPRI vessels. Further, they argued that the references to \u201cmarine work\u201d in the time sheets were not made by the Decedent, but by his supervisor well after the accident giving rise to this case occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Thus, although the Mudricks argue the facts much more meticulously on appeal than in their response to Cross\u2019s motion for summary judgment, them arguments challenging the sufficiency of the record are not waived because they \u201cargued all along\u201d that Cross could not establish the Decedent\u2019s substantial connection to a vessel or fleet of vessels based on the notations in his time sheets. <em>See Performance Autoplex II, Ltd. v. Mid-Continent Cas. Co., </em>322 F.3d 847, 855-56 n. 11 (5th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">B. Jones Act Seaman Status</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">In this case, the Mudricks dispute only \u201cthat the summary judgment evidence conclusively established the temporal requirement of seaman status.\u201d In order to meet its burden on summary judgment, Cross must present evidence that establishes \u201cbeyond peradventure,\u201d <em>Fontenot, </em>780 F.2d at 1194, that the Decedent had a connection to a vessel or fleet of vessels in navigation \u201cthat is substantial in terms of both its duration and its nature.\u201d <em>Chandris, </em>515 U.S. at 368,115 S.Ct. 2172. With respect to the duration inquiry, as a general rule, a \u201cworker who spends less than about 30 percent of his time in the service of a vessel in navigation should not qualify as a seaman under the Jones Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 371, 115 S.Ct. 2172.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">The nature and duration inquiries, while distinct, are not unrelated, <em>see id., </em>especially in the context of a maritime job such as an oil spill technician, which would inherently entail fluctuating time aboard a vessel in any given year depending on the frequency and severity of oil spills in the relevant coverage area. Just as a worker should not be permitted to \u201cwalk into and out of [Jones Act] coverage in the course of his regular duties,\u201d <em>Barrett, </em>781 F.2d at 1075 (citing <em>Longmire v. Sea Drilling Corp., </em>610 F.2d 1342, 1347 n. 6 (5th Cir. 1980)), seaman status should not depend on the inherent irregularity of oil spills.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-10\">The Supreme Court has noted that: the total circumstances of an individual\u2019s employment must be weighed to determine whether he had a sufficient relation to the navigation of the vessels and the perils attendant thereon. The duration of the worker\u2019s connection to a vessel and the nature of the worker\u2019s activities <em>taken together, </em>determine whether a maritime employee is a seaman because the ultimate inquiry is whether the worker in question is a member of the vessel\u2019s crew or simply a land-based employee who happens to be working on the vessel at any given time. <em>Chandris, </em>515 U.S. at 370, 115 S.Ct. 2172 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">To establish this substantial connection, Cross offered the mediation position state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>ments of the Decedent\u2019s wife, his estate, and CISPRI conceding that the Decedent was a Jones Act seaman. Cross also submitted the Decedent\u2019s job description, and his hand-written time sheets<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the year<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> leading up to his accident. With the time sheets, Cross submitted a memorandum from a CISPRI manager explaining that the Decedent\u2019s supervisor had reviewed the time sheets and, with special knowledge of the Decedent\u2019s assignments and the hours necessary to complete them, determined that the Decedent spent thirty-two percent of his time performing marine work aboard CISPRI vessels in navigation. This calculation is supported by the raw time and task data provided by the Decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">In response, to survive summary judgment, the Mudricks must present \u201cspecific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). Their burden is not met by showing \u201csome metaphysical doubt as to the material facts,\u201d <em>Matsushita, </em>475 U.S. at 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348 or by making \u201clegalistic argumentation.\u201d <em>TIG Ins. Co., </em>276 F.3d at 759. By this standard, even construing all inferences in favor of the Mudricks, they failed to present any evidence to contradict Cross\u2019s proof. The Mudricks argued that the Decedent was not referring to work aboard vessels in the time sheets, but his notations expressly mentioned traveling and working aboard specific vessels in the CISPRI fleet. They also argued that many of the hours included in calculating the thirty-two percent of his time that the Decedent spent working on a CISPRI vessel in navigation, such as time spent in barge firefighting training and working at Drift River, should not have been counted. The Decedent\u2019s direct supervisor, who has unique knowledge of what his assignments entailed, included these hours, and the Mudrieks offered no substantiated reasons they should not be counted. We have held that hours worked by a maritime employee aboard a vessel need not be hours spent at sea for the employee to qualify as a Jones Act seaman. <em>In re Endeavor Marine, Inc., </em>234 F.3d at 292. Thus, while we resolve factual controversies in favor of the nonmoving party, that is so \u201conly when there is an actual controversy, ... when both parties have submitted evidence of contradictory facts. We <em>do not, however, in the absence of any proof assume that the nonmoving party could or would prove the necessary facts.\u201d Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">While the Mudricks correctly assert that the Decedent is not a Jones Act seaman as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>a matter of law just because Cross made a showing that he spent more than thirty percent of his time working aboard a CISPRI vessel in navigation, when the evidence from the Decedent\u2019s time sheets is viewed in conjunction with his job description, the skills he was expected to perform in the course of his employment as an OST, and the actual task he was performing when this most tragic event occurred, \u201cthe total circumstances of\u2019 the Decedent\u2019s employment, <em>Chandris, </em>515 U.S. at 370, 115 S.Ct. 2172 lead to only one conclusion \u2014 that the Decedent was a Jones Act seaman.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b81-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-6\">. The Mudricks argue that none of the handwritten notations on the Decedent\u2019s time sheets were made contemporaneously by the Decedent. They suggest that CISPRI Operations Manager Dennis Rome, who did review the time sheets and compile an approximation of the Decedent's marine work for the mediation proceeding, made all the notations on the sheets. The record makes clear that Rome made the \u201cmarine work\" notations, but the Decedent wrote out his daily activities in the right-hand column of the sheet corresponding to the hours he logged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b85-7\">. The Mudricks further argue that one year\u2019s worth of time sheets is not sufficient to fulfill the requirement that the court determine seaman status based on the maritime worker\u2019s \"entire employment history.\" <em>Barrett, </em>781 F.2d at 1075. Unlike the plaintiff in <em>Barrett </em>who tried to establish seaman status based on a snapshot of eight days out of one year of employment, <em>id. </em>at 1074-75, Cross proffered time sheets for one year of the Decedent\u2019s twenty-three-month employment history as an OST working exclusively for CISPRI with CISPRI equipment and on CISPRI vessels. As opposed to eight days out of a year\u2019s employment, one year's time sheets are sufficient to satisfy the flexible requirement that we examine the Decedent's entire employment history to determine his status as a Jones Act seaman. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
