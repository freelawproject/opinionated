Perez appeals the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the denial of her claim for disability insurance benefits. Because the parties are familiar with the history of this case, we do not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b801-23\">The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) rejected the opinion of Dr. Deere, Perez\u2019s treating physician, that Perez was disabled and unable to return to work. In so doing, the ALJ did not sufficiently explain his reasons for finding Dr. Deere\u2019s assessments out of proportion with other evidence in the record, and thus failed to \u201cgive specific, legitimate reasons for disregarding the opinion of the treating physician.\u201d <em>Batson v. Comm\u2019r of the Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>359 F.3d 1190, 1195 (9th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>We also remand the case to the district court because the ALJ\u2019s findings regarding Perez\u2019s residual functional capacity are internally inconsistent and not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 1193. The ALJ found that Perez required \u201cthe option to alternate sitting and standing at will to relieve discomfort,\u201d but also found that Perez was \u201cable to stand and/or walk six hours in an eight-hour workday; able to sit six hours in an eight hour workday.\u201d The need to sit and stand at will is incompatible with the ability to either sit or stand for six hours in an eight-hour workday. Moreover, both vocational experts testified that the need to alternate between sitting and standing at will for anything more than a momentary reprieve would preclude all work or all sedentary work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy. Accordingly, the ALJ\u2019s finding that Perez can perform light and sedentary work is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">We affirm the district court on other claims raised by Perez. Substantial evidence supports the finding of the ALJ that Perez did not meet or equal a listed impairment under. 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1. <em>Batson, </em>359 F.3d at 1193. Substantial evidence also supports the ALJ\u2019s decision to discount Dr. Deere\u2019s assessment of Perez\u2019s residual functional capacity, as well as Perez\u2019s testimony regarding her subjective claims. <em>Bunnell v. Sullivan, </em>947 F.2d 341, 343 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b801-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
