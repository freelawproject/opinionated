After timely appealing his sentence, Nunez moved for a remand for resentencing pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106 and <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir. 2005). On June 6, 2006, this Court denied the motion, concluding that \u201cthe district court properly discharged its duty to consider the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 in imposing a reasonable sentence.\u201d Order, <em>United States v. Nunez, </em>No. 06-0647-cr (2d Cir. June 6, 2006) (citing <em>United States v. Fleming, </em>397 F.3d 95, 100 (2d Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">In his appeal, Nunez reasserts his argument. that he was improperly sentenced because there is no indication in the record that Judge Keenan considered defense counsel\u2019s arguments or the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and \u00a7 3583(e) in determining his sentence. The issue raised, whether Judge Keenan considered the factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553 prior to revoking Nunez\u2019s term of release as required under \u00a7 3583(e)(3), is the same as we addressed in disposing of Nunez\u2019s <em>Crosby </em>motion, where we held that the district court properly considered \u00a7 3553 in imposing his sentence. This argument is therefore barred by the law of the case doctrine. <em>See United States v. Uccio, </em>940 F.2d 753, 758 (2d Cir.1991) (\u201c[Under] the second branch [of the doctrine] ... when a court has ruled on an issue, that decision should generally be adhered to by that court in subsequent stages in the same case.\u201d (citation omitted)). \u201c[W]e will not depart from this sound policy absent cogent or compelling reasons,\u201d principally \u201can intervening change of controlling law, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Doe v. New York City Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>709 F.2d 782, 789 (2d Cir.1983) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Nunez presents no \u201ccogent\u201d or \u201ccompelling\u201d reasons for revisiting the prior panel\u2019s decision. <em>See id. </em>To the extent that Nunez alleges other improprieties by the sentencing judge, his claim is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
