The district court dismissed Howard\u2019s petition as time-barred under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AED-PA).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-19\">Howard argues that he is entitled to statutory and/or equitable tolling under AEDPA because materials supplied to him by the prison\u2019s inmate legal assistance program confused him. This court granted Howard a certificate of appealability because the record was not clear whether Howard received only page one of \u201cA Basic Explanation of the Appeals Process,\u201d which arguably could have led him to believe that he had three years to seek both postconviction and federal habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-20\">Howard\u2019s statements in the instant appeal establish that he received a \u201ccorrected packet\u201d in February 2002 and that it set forth a one-year limitations period for filing the instant \u00a7 2254 petition. The prison\u2019s failure to provide Howard with information relative to AEDPA\u2019s limitations period until February 2002 constituted an impediment to his filing a timely \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>See Egerton v. Cockrell, </em>334 F.3d 433, 438-39 (5th Cir.2003). Therefore, he is entitled to statutory tolling. <em>See id. </em>at 436. The one-year limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>tions period began when he received the packet. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Howard does not state and the record does not state what day in February Howard received the corrected packet. If he is given the benefit of the doubt, he received the corrected packet on February 28, 2002. Absent statutory tolling, he had until February 28, 2003, to file the instant petition. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). Howard\u2019s state habeas petition was pending from October 31, 2002, until April 10, 2003, and therefore tolled the limitation period. He then had until August 9, 2003, to file a timely \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(2); <em>Fields v. Johnson, </em>159 F.3d 914, 916 (5th Cir.1998). His petition, filed May 20, 2004, was therefore untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Howard\u2019s argument that he is entitled to equitable tolling because the information he received from the Inmate Legal Assistance program confused him is unavailing. <em>See Cousin v. Lensing, </em>310 F.3d 843, 848-49 (5th Cir.2002). Moreover, Howard did not diligently pursue \u00a7 2254 relief given that he waited more than a year from the date that he asserts he actually determined the limitations period to file the instant petition. <em>See Coleman v. Johnson, </em>184 F.3d 398, 403 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Accordingly, the district\u2019s court dismissal of Howard\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as time-barred is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b100-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under dle limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
