Judge Wilfred Feinberg, originally a member of this panel, has recused himself from consideration of this case.

May 18, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A37-354-340 (Immig. Ct. Naponach, N.Y. Jan. 24, 2007). He claims that he is a United States citizen and, therefore, not properly subject to removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-17\">Shortly before oral argument, the government conceded that the final order of removal should be vacated and that Petitioner\u2019s case should be \u201creopened and terminated.\u201d Accordingly, the parties are joining in asking the BIA to do this. Petitioner has now moved that we hold his petition for review in abeyance, pending action by the BIA. That motion is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Petitioner also sought bail, arguing that the rigorous standards for granting bail outlined in <em>Elkimya v. Department of Homeland Security, </em>484 F.3d 151, 154 (2d Cir.2007), and <em>Mapp v. Reno, </em>241 F.3d 221, 230 (2d Cir.2001), do not apply when the person held has a plausible claim of citizenship. The government at first opposed the motion for bail. It contended that the <em>Elkimya-Mapp </em>standard governed, even as to plausible citizens, and that, under that standard, bail should be denied. The government has \u2014 seemingly applying a standard different from that in <em>Elkimya </em>and <em>Mapp </em>\u2014 now, however, agreed that the release of Petitioner was appropriate, and Lee has been released. Accordingly, the petition for bail is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The motion to hold Lee\u2019s petition for review in abeyance is GRANTED; the petition for bail is DISMISSED as moot; this Panel will retain jurisdiction pending action by the BIA.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
