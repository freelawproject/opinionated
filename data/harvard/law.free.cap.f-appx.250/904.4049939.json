Duong seeks a COA so he can proceed with his appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of the motion he brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(b) (providing a petitioner may not appeal the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion unless he first obtains a COA). Because Duong has not made \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d this court denies Duong\u2019s request for a COA and dismisses the appeal. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-20\">Following a jury trial, Duong was convicted of drug and money laundering offenses. On direct appeal, Duong raised three allegations: (1) the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions, (2) the trial court erred by denying his motion to reveal the identity of a confidential informant, and (3) the trial court improperly allowed the admission of his tax returns and financial records. This court rejected Duong\u2019s allegations of error and affirmed his convictions. <em>See United States v. Duong, </em>85 Fed.Appx. 99 (10th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-21\">Duong filed the instant \u00a7 2255 motion on March 16, 2005. In addition to a claim his conviction was obtained by the unconstitutional failure of the Government to disclose exculpatory evidence, Duong raised several allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, including assertions counsel (1) failed to effectively utilize an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>interpreter, (2) failed to call key witnesses or present exculpatory evidence, (3) failed to conduct an adequate pre-trial investigation, and (4) failed to adequately cross-examine the Government\u2019s key witness. Duong also claimed the cumulative errors of his trial counsel effectively denied him adequate counsel. After an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied Duong\u2019s motion, setting out its findings of fact and legal conclusions in a comprehensive memorandum opinion and order. Specifically, the court ruled there was an \u201centire failure of proof\u2019 on all issues except those related to the interpreter. As to that claim, the court applied the test set out in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and concluded Duong was not entitled to habeas relief because he failed to show his counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. In the alternative, the court concluded Duong failed to carry his burden of establishing he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">This court cannot grant Duong a COA unless he can demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted). In evaluating whether Duong has carried his burden, this court undertakes \u201ca preliminary, though not definitive, consideration of the [legal] framework\u201d applicable to each of his claims. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Duong is not required to demonstrate his appeal will succeed to be entitled to a COA. He must, however, \u201cprove something more than the absence of frivolity or the existence of mere good faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">This court has reviewed Duong\u2019s appellate brief, the district court\u2019s memorandum and order, and the entire record on appeal pursuant to the framework set out by the Supreme Court in <em>Miller-El </em>and concludes Duong is not entitled to a COA. Duong has wholly failed to sustain his burden of demonstrating he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s alleged deficient performance in failing to effectively utilize the court-appointed interpreter. <em>See United States v. Orange, </em>447 F.3d 792, 796-97 (10th Cir. 2006) (\u201cBecause [a defendant] must demonstrate both <em>Strickland </em>prongs to establish his claim, a failure to prove either one is dispositive.\u201d (citation omitted)). Further, Duong has abandoned the other four claims raised in his \u00a7 2255 motion by failing to include them in his appellate brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">The district court\u2019s resolution of Duong\u2019s claims is not reasonably subject to debate and the claims are not adequate to deserve further proceedings. Accordingly, Duong has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). This court denies his request for a COA and dismisses this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
