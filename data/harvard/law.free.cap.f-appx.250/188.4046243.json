The IJ credited her claim that she was at times harassed or discriminated against by fellow Indonesians because she is Christian, but found her testimony about specific instances of harm not credible due to unexplained discrepancies with her earlier affidavit. The IJ determined that the incidents of harassment did not rise to the level of persecution or give rise to a well founded fear of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), 1158(b)(1) (asylum eligibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">After careful review of the record, we conclude that the denial of her application for asylum is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Eta-Ndu v. Gonzales, </em>411 F.3d 977, 982-83 (8th Cir.2005) (standard of review); <em>Gemechu v. Ashcroft, </em>387 F.3d 944, 947-48 (8th Cir.2004) (IJ\u2019s credibility findings are entitled to deference if supported by specific, cogent reasons); <em>Krasnopivtsev v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 832, 839 (8th Cir.2004) (\u201cHarassment by private citizens does not rise to the level of persecution.\u201d). Because we agree with the BIA that Tuwaidan failed to prove eligibility for asylum, her claim for withholding of removal necessarily fails as well. <em>See Turay v. Ashcroft, </em>405 F.3d 663, 667 (8th Cir. 2005) (withholding of removal standard is more rigorous than asylum standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">Accordingly, the petition for review is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-9\">. Tuwaidan has waived her CAT claim by failing to present any meaningful argument on the claim in her opening brief. <em>See ChayVelasquez v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 751, 756 (8th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
