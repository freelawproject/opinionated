Apr. 7, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir. 2005). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted). Moreover, where, as here, we are reviewing a \u201cfinal order of removal\u201d issued against a deportable criminal alien, we are deprived of jurisdiction to review the petition except insofar as it raises \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C)-(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Arias argues that the BIA abused its discretion in that (1) it \u201cfailed to even acknowledge that [his] motion ... was [also] filed pursuant to the regulations found at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44\u201d; (2) it was obligated to use its authority to grant his motion <em>sua sponte </em>given that he \u201craised a colorable claim to entitlement to \u00a7 212(c)\u201d relief under <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001); (3) his motion to reopen was not untimely because its untimeliness should be judged under the standards set by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3, which carries no time limit, rather than 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44; and (4) his motion \u201craised a colorable claim that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, thereby tolling the time period for motions to reopen under <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) and <em>Iavorski v. INS, </em>[232 F.3d 124, 134 (2d Cir.2000) ].\u201d More generally, Aidas asserts that the failure of the BIA to consider his 212(c) claim on the merits deprived him of due process. To the extent these arguments raise questions of law or a claims with a constitutional dimension, we find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Notwithstanding his contention that the BIA abused its discretion in analyzing the motion to reopen exclusively under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c) and not treating it, in the alternative, as a \u201cspecial motion\u201d under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44, Arias did not actually file a special motion and had he done so, the BIA would have been under no compulsion to grant it. Although he listed \u201c8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44\u201d among the authorities for his motion, Arias did not comply with the procedural requirements for filing a special motion by labeling the motion with the \u201cnotation \u2018special motion to seek 212(c) relief \u201d and \u201csubmitting] a copy of the Form 1-191 application\u201d along with the motion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44(f). Even more critical, he did not file his motion until March 6, 2006, almost eleven months after the deadline for filing \u201cspecial section 212(c) motions\u201d had elapsed. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44(h) (stating the deadline to file such motions is \u201con or before April 26, 2005\u201d). Finally, that he sought to reopen proceedings to challenge his criminal convictions based on ineffective assistance of counsel took his motion well beyond the scope of a \u201cspecial 212(c) motion,\u201d which is intended \u201csolely for ... adjudicating the application for section 212(c) relief.\u201d <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">We reject Arias\u2019s contention that the timeliness of his motion should be judged by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3, which specifies no time limitation, rather than 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44, which does. First, Arias did not pursue this argument with the BIA. Accordingly, it is forfeited. <em>See Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 121-22 (2d Cir.2007) (issues not raised before the BIA are generally not considered in petition to review BIA\u2019s decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>In any event, the argument lacks merit. Section 1003.44 was adopted after <em>St. Cyr, </em>it amended and replaced authorizations previously provided by \u00a7 1212.3. It provided a time limit for \u201cspecial motions to seek \u00a7 212.(c) relief\u2019 of six months from the promulgation of the regulation. <em>See </em>69 Fed.Reg. 57,826, 57,832 (Sept. 28, 2004). Section 1212.3, when initially promulgated in 2001, similai\u2019ly provided a deadline of six months from its promulgation (to July 23, 2001) for the renewal of \u00a7 212(e) motions that had been denied in improper reliance on the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). <em>Id. </em>Section 1212.3 was retained, rather than repealed, because there were timely filed motions under it which had not yet been adjudicated. <em>Id. </em>Its time limitation provision was, however, repealed, apparently because of the perception that the motions to be filed under \u00a7 1212.3 had been filed long ago, and it was anticipated that new filings would invoke the authority in \u00a7 1003.44. The Attorney General made clear at the time of promulgation of the new \u00a7 1003.44 that \u201c[t]his rule does not extend the deadline of July 23, 2001,\u201d for motions under \u00a7 1212.3. <em>Id. </em>We conclude that these regulatory changes were not intended to eliminate any time limitations for a motion under \u00a7 1212.3, but rather to substitute \u00a7 1003.44\u2019s deadline of April 26, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">As to the claim that the BLA abused its discretion in failing to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen the ease, we have \u201cjoin[ed] our sister circuits in holding that a decision of the BIA whether to reopen a case <em>sua sponte </em>under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) is entirely discretionary and therefore beyond our review-in other words, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to reopen ... immigration proceedings <em>sua sponte.\u201d Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The contention that the BIA abused its discretion by declining to invoke principles of equitable tolling under \u00a7 1003.2(c) is equally unavailing here because Arias\u2019s motion relates to a removal order that became final on July 21, 1997, meaning he was required to file his motion to reopen no later than October 19, 1997. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Even if one were to grant Arias the benefit of a renewed 90-day period running from either the date of the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>St. Cyr </em>decision or the enactment of the regulations implementing it, his motion was still years late.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Furthermore, while Arias argues that he was entitled to equitable tolling because his counsel in the criminal case was ineffective in not informing him of the consequences of his plea agreement, his chief authority for this claim is <em>Iavorski, </em>232 F.3d at 134, and <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Both of those cases addressed reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel at an earlier stage in <em>immigration </em>proceedings, and are not obviously relevant to a request for reopening predicated on a claim of ineffective assistance in a <em>criminal </em>proceeding. In any case, as the BIA noted, Arias surely knew that he had received ineffective assistance by 1997 when the order of removal in his case became final. That he then waited almost ten years to file for relief cannot, on any fair account, be attributed to the failings of his counsel in the criminal case and qualifies as a lack of reasonable diligence. <em>See Iavorski, </em>232 F.3d at 134 (requiring diligent action once the ineffective assistance \u201cis, or should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>have been, discovered by a reasonable person in the situation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Finally, the argument that \u201cby literally denying the existence of evidence presented regarding the Petitioner\u2019s right to apply for \u00a7 212(c) relief, the BIA violated [Arias\u2019s] constitutional right to a fundamentally fair hearing and due process\u201d lacks merit as a constitutional claim. The regulations implemented in the wake of <em>St. Cyr </em>afforded Arias a sufficient window to raise his \u00a7 212(c) claims, the BIA acted reasonably when it determined that equitable tolling was not appropriate, and Arias cannot now recast his dismay with the result as a matter of due process. <em>See Johnson v. Gonzales, </em>478 F.3d 795, 798-99 (7th Cir.2007) (upholding the BIA\u2019s adherence to the deadline in \u00a7 1003.44 on the ground that the \u201crule does not eliminate relief; it simply imposes a deadline for requesting relief, the sort of procedural limitation that is commonly found in the law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, the stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
