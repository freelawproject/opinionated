Wallace filed a complaint in the United States Court of Federal Claims alleging, among other things, that proceedings in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Oklahoma resulted in the conversion of his assets. He asserted that the bankruptcy trustees denied him \u201call federally protected rights under Chapter 11-Reorganiza-tion.\u201d After explaining that it had no jurisdiction to conduct a collateral review of the decisions of another federal court, the Court of Federal Claims dismissed Mr. Wallace\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim for which relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">On appeal, Mr. Wallace contends that the \u201ctrial court refused to take into account six separate filings which the trial court removed from the Record without explanation.\u201d However, Mr. Wallace provides no evidence that these pleadings were properly filed with the trial court. Furthermore, the pleadings simply reiterate his challenges to decisions made during his bankruptcy proceedings, which the Court of Federal Claims lacks jurisdiction to review. <em>See Allustiarte v. United States, </em>256 F.3d 1349, 1351 (Fed.Cir.2001). Therefore, even if these pleadings had been properly filed and considered by the trial court, they do not raise issues that the Court of Federal Claims has authority to address. Accordingly, we <em>affirm </em>the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Wallace\u2019s complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
