Straus, denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Guerrier Printemps, </em>No. A78 617 201 (B.I.A. Dec. 5, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A78 617 201 (Immig. Ct. Hartford, Conn. June 21, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-21\">Here, the IJ rested his decision primarily on an adverse credibility determination but also provided Printemps\u2019 failure to meet his burden of proof as an alternative ground for denying Printemps\u2019 application. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision but addressed only the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>determination. Because the BIA did not explicitly \u201cadopt and affirm\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision in its entirety, it is not clear whether the BIA intended to affirm the IJ\u2019s burden of proof finding or even considered that portion of the IJ\u2019s decision. Accordingly, we review only that portion of the IJ\u2019s decision that the BIA discussed and expressly affirmed-the IJ\u2019s finding that Printemps was not credible. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Here, the IJ\u2019s finding that Printemps was not credible was supported by substantial evidence. The IJ based his adverse credibility determination largely on two significant discrepancies between the statements Printemps made at his asylum interview and the testimony he gave at his hearing. <em>See Maladho Djehe Diallo v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 624, 632 (2d Cir.2006). First, Printemps stated at his asylum interview that he had been arrested in May 2000 as well as in September 2000, while he testified at his hearing that he had only been arrested once. Second, Printemps testified at his hearing that his brother had been killed by the Lavalas Party in Haiti in 2001 because of Printemps\u2019 political activities, but he failed to mention his brother\u2019s death during his asylum interview. Our review of the record gives us no reason to doubt the reliability of the record of Printemps\u2019 asylum interview, and such substantial inconsistencies were a proper basis for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">Moreover, the IJ offered Printemps an opportunity to explain these discrepancies, but found Printemps\u2019 explanations inadequate and was not obligated to credit them. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005). In addition, the IJ reasonably found that, even when pressed for detail, Printemps\u2019 testimony was vague and lacking in sufficient detail with respect to a beating incident he allegedly suffered in November 2000. <em>Cf. Jin Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 104, 114 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Taken together, these discrepancies and omissions were a sufficient basis for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, and the IJ properly denied Printemps asylum claim on that basis. <em>Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006) (internal citations omitted). Because the only evidence that Printemps had been or would be subjected to persecution or torture in Haiti depended upon his credibility, the IJ also properly denied Printemps\u2019 withholding of removal and CAT claims. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
