Petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen contended that his motion to reopen was not untimely under the changed country conditions exception of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii) and that he had been falsely accused of domestic abuse. However, the changed country conditions exception to the 90-day requirement for submitting motions to reopen is not applicable to petitioner because he failed to submit any evidence regarding a material change in the treatment of Hindu persons. <em>See Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cThe critical question is ... whether circumstances have changed sufficiently that a petitioner who previously did not have a legitimate claim for asylum now has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d). Additionally, petitioner is prohibited from collaterally attacking the propriety of his state court domestic abuse convictions in immigration proceedings. <em>See Urbina-Mauricio v. INS, </em>989 F.2d 1085, 1089 (9th Cir.1993). Therefore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the motion to reopen time and number limits still applied and that petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen was barred under both. <em>See Iturribama v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion for summary disposition is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b830-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
