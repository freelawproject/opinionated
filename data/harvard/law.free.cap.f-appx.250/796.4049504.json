INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093-94 (9th Cir. 2002). The BIA therefore correctly concluded that, as a matter of law, petitioner was ineligible for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Further, the administrative record demonstrates petitioner cannot meet the requisite ten year continuous physical presence requirement because she departed from the United States for a period exceeding 180 days as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(2). The BIA therefore correctly concluded that, as a matter of law, petitioner was ineligible for cancellation of removal on this ground as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">Accordingly, respondent\u2019s unopposed motion for summary disposition is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">The temporary stay of removal and voluntary departure confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) and <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">All other pending motions are denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"Afx\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publi- - cation and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
