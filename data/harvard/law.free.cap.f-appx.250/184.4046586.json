The district court sentenced him to a total of 264 months\u2019 imprisonment. More than four years after the entry of judgment, Allen filed what he styled as a motion to vacate the judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). He claimed that his guilty pleas were involuntary because neither the prosecutor nor his own counsel told him about the Statutes at Large \u2014 a failure that, according to Allen, prevented him from understanding the robbery charges. The district court summarily denied the motion, and Allen appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"At9\">Allen\u2019s motion presents a claim for relief that is substantively within the scope of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 \u00b6 1, and so the government argues that the submission <em>is </em>a motion under \u00a7 2255 and that we should dismiss this appeal because Allen did not obtain a certificate of appealability. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Carraway, </em>478 F.3d 845, 849 (7th Cir.2007); <em>Melton v. United States, </em>359 F.3d 855, 857 (7th Cir.2004). The district court did not say what characterization it gave the motion, though the absence of any warning to Allen suggests that the court rejected the reading now urged by the government. <em>See Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 383, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003); <em>Melton, </em>359 F.3d at 857. In any event, Allen\u2019s submission is frivolous, and in this court he con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>cedes that \u201cthe district court had no grounds to grant the motion.\u201d Allen offers a different claim here \u2014 that his trial lawyer failed to file a notice of appeal as directed \u2014 and whereas that contention is not raised in Allen\u2019s motion it is thus waived. <em>See Estremera v. United States, </em>442 F.3d 580, 587 (7th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
