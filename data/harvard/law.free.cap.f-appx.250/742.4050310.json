Federal officials apprehended Diaz in 2004 and charged him with being in the United States without permission after his removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Diaz pleaded guilty in March 2005, and a year later, after two changes of counsel, the district court sentenced him (below the guidelines range calculated by the court) to 50 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release. Diaz filed a notice of appeal, but his appointed lawyer has moved to withdraw because he cannot discern a nonfrivolous argument for appeal. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel\u2019s supporting brief is facially adequate, and Diaz has not responded to counsel\u2019s motion, <em>see </em>Cir. R. 51(b). Our review of the record is limited to the potential issues counsel has identified. <em>See United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-20\">Counsel represents that Diaz does not wish to withdraw his guilty plea or challenge his conviction; therefore, counsel properly omits any discussion of the plea and conviction. <em>See United States v. Knox, </em>287 F.3d 667, 670 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-21\">Counsel first considers whether Diaz could challenge the district court\u2019s calculation of his offense level, criminal history score, or guidelines imprisonment range. Counsel does not dispute the district court\u2019s calculation of the total offense level, but notes that the court improperly excluded one of Diaz\u2019s previous convictions from his criminal history score. But this error did not harm Diaz, so we agree with counsel that it would be frivolous to challenge his sentence on this ground. <em>See id. </em>at 671. (\u201c[I]t is no failure of advocacy to leave well enough alone\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-23\">Counsel also examines whether Diaz could argue that the district court did not adequately account for various sentencing factors, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), or that the court should have lowered his sentence in light of fast-track programs that exist in other jurisdictions. Counsel properly con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>eludes that raising these potential issues would be frivolous. At sentencing the district court noted the letters of reference submitted on Diaz\u2019s behalf, but concluded that the nature and number of his prior convictions weighed against him. Moreover, Diaz\u2019s prison sentence is 27 months below the low end of the applicable guidelines range, and counsel does not point to a factor that would have compelled a further reduction. With regard to the fast-track \u201cdisparity,\u201d we have repeatedly rejected this argument. <em>See United States v. Roche-Martinez, </em>467 F.3d 591, 595-96 (7th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>453 F.3d 458, 462-63 (7th Cir. 2006) . Finally, counsel mentions that the district court erred in failing to specify the number of drug tests Diaz must undergo when his period of supervised release begins. Counsel, though, properly concludes that this potential issue would be frivolous because Diaz did not object at sentencing and the error is not one that we would deem to be plain error. <em>See United States v. Tejeda, </em>476 F.3d 471, 475-76 (7th Cir. 2007) .</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Therefore, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
