Flores-Hernandez pleaded guilty to illegal reentry after deportation following a conviction for an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). Flores-Hernandez contends that the district erred in applying the sentence enhancement, because (1) his prior robbery conviction does not qualify as a crime of violence, and (2) \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">I. Facts &amp; Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">In 2001, Flores-Hernandez was convicted under the name Enrique Gayton for \u201cstrong-arm robbery\u201d in violation of Florida Statute \u00a7 812.13. He was sentenced to \u201c18.9 months\u201d in custody of the Florida Department of Corrections. On March 24, 2005, Flores-Hernandez was deported to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">On May 2, 2006, Flores-Hernandez was found in Brownsville, Texas. He admitted to border patrol agents that he is a Mexican citizen who had illegally reentered the United States by swimming across the Rio Grande. Flores-Hernandez subsequently pleaded guilty before a magistrate judge to a one-count indictment charging him with being an alien found illegally in the United States after previous deportation, subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony. There was no plea agreement. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a), Flores-Hernandez was assigned a base offense level of eight. The PSR recommended a sixteen-level increase because Flores-Hernandez had been deported after a conviction for a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">Flores-Hernandez objected to the sixteen-level increase, asserting that his prior robbery conviction could not be considered a crime of violence. He also objected to the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b). At the sentencing hearing, the district court overruled both objections. The court sentenced Flores-Hernandez to 80 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. Flores-Hernandez timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-14\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b112-15\">\n<em>1. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b112-16\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the federal sentencing guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We accept the district court\u2019s findings of fact unless clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>we ultimately review the sentence to determine whether it is reasonable in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-17\">\n<em>2. Crime of Violence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b112-18\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii), the offense level for illegal reentry is increased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>by sixteen levels if the defendant was previously convicted of a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d A crime of violence is either: (1) any specified enumerated offense, or (2) \u201cany offense under fedei\u2019al, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The list of enumerated offenses includes robbery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">As the enhancement provision does not define robbery, we must first assign the term its generic and contemporary meaning; that is, its ordinary and common meaning.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This meaning is uniform and independent of the state\u2019s own criminal code designation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Sources of generic, contemporary meaning include the Model Penal Code (\u201cMPC\u201d), federal and state laws, dictionaries, and treatises.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We take a common sense approach and recognize that categorical offense designations like \u201crobbery\u201d are usually intended \u201c \u2018to capture all offenses of a certain level of seriousness.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">After determining the generic, contemporary meaning of the term, we must then compare it to the statute governing the prior conviction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We follow a categorical approach to evaluating the correspondence between generic contemporary meaning and the statutory definition of the underlying offense.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If the statute governing the prior conviction follows the generic definition with only minor variations, or is narrower than the generic crime, the sentence enhancement may be applied.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The elements of the offense need only \u201csubstantially correspond\u201d to the generic definition of the enumerated offense to pass muster under the categorical approach.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In making this determination, we examine the elements of the prior offense of conviction, not the defendant\u2019s underlying conduct.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-15\">When we address the sources for generic contemporary meaning, we find that, even though states differ as to the precise definition of robbery, \u201cthe generic form of robbery \u2018may be thought of as aggravated larceny,\u2019 containing at least the elements of \u2018misappropriation of property under circumstances involving [immediate] danger to the person.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is the element of immediate danger that makes robbery \u201c\u2018deserving of greater punishment than that provided for larceny\u2019 and extortion.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-16\">According to the MPC, a person commits robbery if, in the course of committing a theft, he:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-17\">(a) inflicts serious bodily injury upon another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-18\">(b) threatens another with or purposely puts him in fear of immediate serious bodily injury; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-19\">(c) commits or threatens immediately to commit any felony of the first or second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>degree<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Under the MPC, \u201c[a]n act shall be deemed \u2018in the course of committing a theft\u2019 if it occurs in an attempt to commit theft or in flight after the attempt or commission.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>defines \u201crobbery\u201d as: \u201cthe illegal taking of property from the person of another, or in the person\u2019s presence, by violence or intimidation; aggravated larceny.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Webster\u2019s </em>defines \u201crobbery\u201d as \u201cthe act or practice of robbing,\u201d and \u201clarceny from the person or presence of another by violence or threat.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> To \u201crob\u201d is defined as \u201cto take something away from another by force\u201d or \u201cto remove valuables without right from (a place).\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">At the time of Flores-Hernandez\u2019s conviction in 2000, the Florida statute in question defined the offense of \u201crobbery\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-6\">(1) the taking of money or other property which may be the subject of larceny from the person or custody of another, with intent to either permanently or temporarily deprive the person or owner of the money or other property, when in the course of the taking there is the use of force, violence, assault, or putting in fear.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">\u201cThe fear contemplated by the statute is the \u2018fear or death or great bodily harm.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Flores-Hernandez argues that the Florida statute is overly broad and therefore outside the generic definition of robbery, because a defendant can be convicted without the intentional use or threat of force. Flores-Hernandez mistakenly relies on <em>State v. Hawkins </em>to support his interpretation of the statute.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In <em>Hawkins, </em>the Florida appellate court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support a robbery conviction when the defendant had stolen an unoccupied truck in which the keys had been left in the ignition, and the defendant had continued driving away when the victim attempted to resist the taking by hanging on the side of the vehicle.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> According to Flores-Hernandez, <em>Hawkins </em>demonstrates that a defendant is not required to use force purposely to be convicted under the Florida statute. Contrary to this argument, however, the court in <em>Hawkins </em>held that the defendant\u2019s act of driving away, while the victim was hanging onto the side of the car, \u201cwas an act of force <em>intended, </em>in part, to overcome the resistance to the taking.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Therefore, this case does not support the contention that a defendant may be convicted under the Florida statute without purposefully using force or putting the defendant in fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-16\">Although the Florida statute does not specifically state that the defendant must intentionally use force or place the victim in fear of bodily harm, the statute does require that the defendant use force or fear as a means of acquiring the property. Thus, the Florida statute contains the essential elements of robbery \u2014 the misap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>propriation of property involving danger to a person. That the Florida statute does not use the words purposefully or intentionally is not sufficient to keep the statute outside of the generic definition of robbery. The district court did not err by enhancing Flores-Hernandez\u2019s sentence for his prior conviction under the Florida law of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\"><em>3. </em>Apprendi <em>Challenge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Flores-Hernandez also contends that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey.</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>He acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>but raises it to preserve it for further review.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> As we have repeatedly held, <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding despite Apprendi.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Accordingly, Flores-Hernandez\u2019s argument that \u00a7 1326 is unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi </em>fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Flores-Hernandez\u2019s guilty plea conviction and the sentence imposed are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b112-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
