Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), and the Federal Tort Claims Act. Montero-Melendez maintains the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his health and safety because they failed to maintain sanitary prison conditions during his pretrial detention at the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) in Otisville, New York, and, as a result, he contracted a Heliobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacterial infection.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-21\">A summary judgment is reviewed de novo. <em>Hart v. Hairston, </em>343 F.3d 762, 764 (5th Cir.2003); <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. Because Montero-Melendez\u2019s assertions are based on acts or omissions related to his health and safety, they are properly characterized as episodic acts or omissions. <em>See Olabisiomotosho v. City of Houston, </em>185 F.3d 521, 526 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Flores v. County of Hardeman, Tex., </em>124 F.3d 736, 738 (5th Cir.1997). If a pretrial detainee bases his claim upon a prison official\u2019s \u201cepisodic acts or omissions\u201d, the standard of subjective deliberate indifference enunciated in <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994), is the measure of culpability. <em>Hare v. City of Corinth, Miss., </em>74 F.3d 633, 643 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc). For an official to act with deliberate indifference, he \u201cmust both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference\u201d. <em>Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-22\">Montero-Melendez has not shown the district court erred in granting summary judgment against the deliberate-indifference claim. Montero-Melendez produced no competent summary-judgment evidence establishing his infection was caused by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>unsanitary prison conditions at FCI Otis-ville. Furthermore, he produced no probative evidence showing the defendants were: aware the prison conditions at FCI Otisville were conducive to the spread of H. pylori; and deliberately indifferent to that risk. Montero-Melendez\u2019s allegations maintaining the defendants were, or should have been, aware of the unsanitary conditions at FCI Otisville and of the existence of H. pylori bacteria do not equate to knowledge of a condition posing a substantial risk of harm; moreover, the allegations fail to provide the requisite summary-judgment evidence to establish a genuine issue of material fact on whether the defendants actually drew the inference that inmates faced a risk of harm and deliberately ignored it. <em>See id. </em>at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b668-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
