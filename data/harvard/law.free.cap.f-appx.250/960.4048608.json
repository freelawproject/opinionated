By the time she requested a hearing before an administrative law judge in January 2004, Powell narrowed her claim to focus on the effects of her \u201cacute\u201d bowel syndrome which she said caused her to go the bathroom \u201call the time\u201d and made her \u201cvery rundown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b987-18\">After Powell\u2019s March 2005 hearing, the ALJ issued his decision concluding that Powell was not entitled to the benefits she sought. In reaching that decision, the ALJ followed the \u201cfive-step sequential evaluation process\u201d set out in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520 and 416.920. In the first step, he found that Powell currently was not performing any \u201csubstantial gainful activity.\u201d In the second and third steps, the ALJ determined that only two of her various claimed impairments \u2014 adhesions from her bowel resection surgery and her internal rectum prolapse \u2014 were \u201csevere,\u201d though they were not so severe as to \u201cmeet or medically equal\u201d any of the impairments listed in the Social Security regulations that would have conclusively established her disability. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1. Finally, in the fourth step, the ALJ determined Powell\u2019s \u201cresidual functional capacity.\u201d In particular, he found that Powell\u2019s \u201cmedical<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>ly determinable impairment[s]\u201d would not prevent her from performing her \u201cpast relevant work\u201d as a trampoline maker, a sewing machine operator or inspector, or a supervisor. This last finding meant that Powell \u201cwas not under a \u2018disability\u2019 as defined in the Social Security Act.\u201d Because of the ALJ\u2019s finding under the fourth step, he found it unnecessary to proceed to the fifth-step inquiry, which addresses a claimant\u2019s ability to perform other jobs available in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">After the appeals council within the Social Security Administration denied Powell\u2019s request for review of the ALJ\u2019s decision, she appealed to the district court. There, a magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation urging affirmance of the ALJ\u2019s decision. The district court entered an order overruling Powell\u2019s objections and adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, and Powell timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">Our review of the district court\u2019s order is <em>de novo, </em>but we are mindful that the federal courts\u2019 \u201creview of the [ALJ\u2019s] decision is limited to an inquiry into whether there is substantial evidence to support [its] findings ... and whether the correct legal standards were applied.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">On appeal, Powell first contends that the ALJ erred in the second step of his analysis by not finding that her claimed mental impairments were severe. She says that it was wrong for the ALJ to discount two medical opinions supporting such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">Powell received the first of these opinions in mid-December 2003 after being referred to psychologist Dr. Mark Eaton by the Social Security Administration\u2019s disability adjudication section. Dr. Eaton concluded that Powell had \u201cgeneralized anxiety disorder\u201d and \u201cborderline intellectual functioning\u201d that caused a variety of social deficiencies, including, as the ALJ put it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-10\">poor to no ability to relate to co-workers and relate predictability in social situations; no ability to deal with the public, deal with work stresses; and poor ability to interact with supervisors, function independently, maintain attention/concentration, understand, remember, and carry out complex job instructions; behave in an emotionally stable manner; and demonstrate reliability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b988-11\">However, the ALJ assigned this opinion \u201cno evidentiary value at all\u201d as a result of his findings that Powell \u201chas not had an intervening head injury, stroke, or other health-related problem to cause any change in her ability to deal with usual work stresses, other people, or changes in the work environment\u201d and that \u201cnothing has changed to [validate] Dr. Eaton\u2019s opinion that [Powell] is unable to perform these activities as she did in the past.\u201d With Dr. Eaton\u2019s opinion out of the way, the ALJ deemed Powell\u2019s mental impairments to be \u201cnon-severe\u201d and moved on to other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-12\">The thrust of Powell\u2019s argument here is that in fact she did suffer some \u201cintervening ... health-related problem\u201d that worked a \u201cchange in her ability\u201d to navigate the everyday stresses of a work environment. That intervening problem was her September 2003 bowel resection surgery which involved the removal of approximately three feet of her intestines and which resulted in her frequent incontinence. It was error to disregard this intervening event, Powell argues. Only after the surgery did she begin experiencing the severe mental impairments, and pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>surgery evidence suggesting that she has no mental impairments does not amount to substantial evidence undermining Dr. Eaton\u2019s post-surgery conclusion to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">We disagree. Without some indication that the mental impairments identified by Dr. Eaton arose as a result of Powell\u2019s bowel surgery, there is nothing to set Dr. Eaton\u2019s assessment apart from the other evidence in the record suggesting that Powell has no mental impairments. In other words, considering the record as a whole, Dr. Eaton\u2019s evaluation of Powell stands as just one piece of evidence among many. For example, the ALJ cited: (1) Powell\u2019s statements in October 2002 that she was able to perform her normal daily functions and that she attributed no functional limitations to her mental state; (2) Powell\u2019s statements to Dr. Eaton that she had never needed treatment for psychological issues; and (3) Powell\u2019s failure in an October 2003 (post-surgery) daily living questionnaire to relate any of her functional limitations to a mental impairment. Moreover, in his brief the Commissioner pointed to additional evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s finding, such as: (1) Dr. Khalid Maqsood\u2019s February 2002 finding that Powell had a normal mental status; (2) Dr. Stanley Wallace\u2019s August 2002 assessment that Powell \u201crelates well\u201d; and (3) a June 2004 (post-surgery) report from the Satilla Mental Health Center indicating that Powell\u2019s psychiatric condition was \u201cnormal.\u201d Any one of these items constitutes evidence contradicting Dr. Eaton\u2019s assessment. Together, they amount to substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">The other medical opinion at issue is the one from the Satilla Mental Health Center in December 2004 diagnosing Powell with depression, poor memory, and antisocial behavior. We agree with Powell that the ALJ should not have discarded this opinion solely because she went to the mental health center \u201cat her counsel\u2019s request.\u201d <em>See generally </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d) (explaining the relative weight an ALJ must accord medical opinions). But it is apparent from the evidence we have just recounted that this error in the ALJ\u2019s reasoning is of no consequence. At the end of the day, the ALJ\u2019s finding that Powell suffers from no severe mental impairments rests squarely on evidence a \u201creasonable person would accept as adequate to support [his] conclusion.\u201d <em>Martin v. Sullivan, </em>894 F.2d 1520, 1529 (11th Cir.1990) (explaining the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard). Under our highly deferential standard of review, then, we must affirm the ALJ\u2019s finding that Powell suffered from no severe mental impairments. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">Next, Powell contends that the ALJ erred when he found certain aspects of her testimony at the hearing to be \u201cnot fully credible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">The ALJ made this finding while conducting his assessment of Powell\u2019s residual functional capacity. To do this, the ALJ began by recounting the definition of that term, the types of evidence he must consider, and Powell\u2019s testimony bearing on the subject. Powell\u2019s testimony included the facts that: (1) her incontinence required her to go to the bathroom three to four times per hour on good days and five to seven times per hour on bad days; and (2) that she suffered from swelling and pain in her left anide.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">Before setting out his finding of Powell\u2019s residual functional capacity, the ALJ explained the weight he would give Powell\u2019s testimony. He wrote, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADA\">The undersigned has considered the claimant\u2019s own subjective allegations and has found them not fully credible, because there is a lack of objective evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>dence to support her alleged symptoms/eomplaints. The claimant testified that her bowel incontinence precludes her from walking, standing, or doing any physical activities and she reports that her left ankle swells and it hurts to put it on the floor; however, she reports that she walks on the treadmill daily [citation omitted]. Also in February 2004, the claimant denied having any right lower quadrant pain and Dr. Bates noted she appeared to be progressing satisfactorily.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">As one would expect, the ensuing statement of Powell\u2019s residual functional capacity reflected this view of Powell\u2019s testimony. It found that \u201cthe claimant\u2019s pace might be disrupted once or twice a day,\u201d but did not specifically mention Powell\u2019s ankle pain or persistent incontinence.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">On appeal, Powell does not challenge the ALJ\u2019s finding with respect to her claimed ankle pain. Instead, she argues only that the ALJ erred when he rejected her claims of bowel incontinence. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">To begin, we must note that the ALJ miseharacterized Powell\u2019s testimony when he wrote that \u201c[t]he claimant testified that her bowel incontinence precludes her from walking, standing, or doing any physical activities.\u201d If that was the substance of Powell\u2019s testimony, we would agree with the ALJ that \u201cthere is a lack of objective evidence to support\u201d that claim. However, we have closely examined the transcript of Powell\u2019s hearing, and have found no sweeping claims of this sort. Powell provided a more nuanced account of the limitations, noting, for example, that she could drive but only did so to visit her doctor or her lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">Armed with a more accurate understanding of Powell\u2019s testimony about her bowel problems, we conclude that neither of the ALJ\u2019s two reasons for discrediting that testimony amounts to substantial evidence in support of his adverse credibility finding. The fact that Powell walks on the treadmill each day may explain why the ALJ rejected Powell\u2019s claim of ankle pain, but it does not support the decision to discredit Powell\u2019s claim of frequent incontinence. It is entirely possible to go to the bathroom with the frequency Powell claims she must go and still do the treadmill exercise to the extent she claims to do it. Powell testified that she walks on the treadmill for only about fifteen minutes daily. So even on a \u201cbad\u201d day, when Powell must go to the bathroom five to seven times in one hour (and thus never has an uninterrupted fifteen-minute window of time), it is possible that she splits up her exercise into several-minute increments and performs her exercise in between bathroom breaks.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">Moreover, Dr. Bates\u2019 February 2004 report entry \u2014 the only other evidence the ALJ cited for discrediting Powell\u2019s testimony \u2014 consists of only two sentences. In them entirety, they read: \u201c[Powell] is presently without pain in terms of her right lower quadrant. She appears to be progressing satisfactorily.\u201d That is all. We do not see how those two sentences support the ALJ\u2019s decision to reject Powell\u2019s testimony about her incontinence.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">Powell presented at least two doctors\u2019 reports associating her incontinence with the severe physical impairments the ALJ found her to have. So if anything, the medical evidence in the record provides an independent basis for accepting Powell\u2019s claims about her incontinence. At any rate, because neither of the ALJ\u2019s reasons for discrediting Powell\u2019s incontinence testimony amounts to substantial evidence supporting his decision to reject that testimony, we must remand this case so that the ALJ can re-assess the effect of Powell\u2019s claimed incontinence after either accepting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>her testimony or by articulating an adequate reason to reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">Powell\u2019s final contention is that the ALJ erred by \u201cnot even discuss[ing], reviewing], crediting], or discrediting]\u201d the statements of her sisters confirming Powell\u2019s accounts of her constant diarrhea. Not mentioning the sisters\u2019 statements, Powell says, violated the ALJ\u2019s duty to \u201cstate specifically the weight accorded to each item of evidence.\u201d <em>Cowart v. Schweiker, </em>662 F.2d 731, 735 (11th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">Because the sisters\u2019 statements basically duplicate Powell\u2019s own testimony, it makes sense that the ALJ would treat the two sets of evidence in the same manner. <em>See Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1211 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (\u201c[T]here is no rigid requirement that the ALJ specifically refer to every piece of evidence in his decision, so long as the ALJ\u2019s decision ... [enables us] to conclude that [the ALJ] considered her medical condition as a whole.\u201d) And since our disposition of this case requires reconsideration of Powell\u2019s claims of frequent incontinence, we will leave consideration of the sisters\u2019 statements, along with the other evidence in the record, to the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
