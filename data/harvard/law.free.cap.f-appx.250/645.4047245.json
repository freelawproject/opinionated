Jenkins\u2019 claim for Disability Insurance Benefits and/or Supplemental Security Income benefits, and the district court affirmed the decision. As discussed <em>infra, </em>the denial of benefits is supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-27\">Jenkins filed an application for disability insurance benefits on 31 July 2000, claiming a work-related leg injury in 1993 rendered him unable to work. Upon the claim\u2019s being denied, Jenkins requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). Benefits were denied by the ALJ, but the Appeals Council remanded the case for further proceedings. On remand, benefits were again denied; again, the Appeals Council remanded the case. The third ALJ hearing also resulted in a denial of benefits, which was upheld by the Appeals Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>As a result, Jenkins filed this action in district court. The district judge adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The Commissioner\u2019s decision is reviewed \u201conly to ascertain whether (1) the final decision is supported by substantial evidence and (2) whether the Commissioner used the proper legal standards to evaluate the evidence\u201d. <em>Newton v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000) (citations omitted). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\u201d, <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (internal quotation marks omitted); it must be \u201cmore than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance\u201d. <em>Johnson v. Bowen, </em>864 F.2d 340, 343 (5th Cir.1988). Jenkins asserts: the ALJ applied improper legal standards; and his determination is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Jenkins first maintains the ALJ did not properly consider, and give weight to, the testimony of two vocational-rehabilitation experts. Regarding step 5 of the well-established sequential evaluation process, the experts opined, in response to hypothetical questions posed by Jenkins\u2019 counsel: a person who needed to take breaks every 30 minutes for an indefinite duration could not find work in significant numbers in the national economy. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(v), 416.960(c)(1). The ALJ, however, did not give credence to that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">When hypothetical testimony by a vocational expert is unsupported by the evidence, the ALJ may properly disregard that testimony. <em>Owens v. Heckler, </em>770 F.2d 1276, 1282 (5th Cir.1985). Jenkins\u2019 treating physician, Dr. Waldman, whose opinion is afforded considerable weight, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2), opined Jenkins could sit for prolonged periods of time, so long as his leg was positioned in a manner he found desirable. The opinions of Jenkins\u2019 other examining physicians l\u2019eiterated Dr. Waldman\u2019s findings. Two specialists, whose opinions are also afforded additional weight, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(5), found Jenkins\u2019 ability to perform work that required sitting would not be impaired. Because there is substantial evidence that the hypothetical questions posed to the vocational experts were unsupported by medical evidence, the ALJ\u2019s decision to disregard them testimony was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">The ALJ rejected Jenkins\u2019 contention that his injury caused him debilitating pain. Jenkins contends this ruling improperly discredited his testimony. \u201cIt is within the ALJ\u2019s discretion to determine the disabling nature of a claimant\u2019s pain, and the ALJ\u2019s determination is entitled to considerable deference.\u201d <em>Chambliss v. Massanari, </em>269 F.3d 520, 522 (5th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted). To this end, the ALJ is required to make \u201caffirmative findings regarding a claimant\u2019s subjective complaints [of pain]\u201d, <em>Falco v. Shalala, </em>27 F.3d 160, 163 (5th Cir.1994), and such findings \u201cshould be upheld if supported by substantial evidence\u201d. <em>Chambliss, </em>269 F.3d at 522 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">Substantial evidence exists to support the ALJ\u2019s discrediting Jenkins\u2019 subjective complaints of pain. As the ALJ found, Jenkins takes only minor pain medication consisting of aspirin and Naprosyn, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent. Moreover, the ALJ found no evidence of the Naprosyn prescription\u2019s being filled since 2002. In addition, Jenkins\u2019 treating physician released him to do sedentary work as far back as 1998. Finally, the ALJ found Jenkins\u2019 failure to receive further treatment undercut his subjective claims of pain. On this point, Jenkins asserts the ALJ failed to recognize that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>Jenkins\u2019 physician, Dr. Drury, found Jenkins had reached \u201cmaximum medical improvement\u201d and did not require further treatment. This assertion is unavailing. Having reached \u201cmaximum medical improvement\u201d does not corroborate Jenkins\u2019 claims; there is no evidence Jenkins ever complained to Dr. Drury of ongoing pain after his initial consultation in 2003 or sought a refill of his Naprosyn prescription. In the light of these factors, as well as the deference afforded the ALJ\u2019s determinations regarding disabling pain <em>vel non, </em>there is substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit Jenkins\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">For his final contention, Jenkins contends the ALJ erroneously used Jenkins\u2019 1998 earnings to discredit his assertion that he had done only minimal lawn-service work since his last ALJ hearing. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>the ALJ erred in considering those earnings in determining Jenkins\u2019 credibility, the error was harmless. <em>See Audler v. Astrue, </em>501 F.3d 446, 448-49 (5th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Morris v. Bowen, </em>864 F.2d 333, 334 (5th Cir.1988)). As discussed, the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination was based on substantial evidence. Therefore, it is immaterial whether it was error additionally to consider the 1998 earnings on that credibility point.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b672-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
