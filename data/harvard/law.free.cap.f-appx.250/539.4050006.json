In No. 07-1069, she challenges the Board\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen removal proceedings. In No. 07-1331, she challenges the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider the denial of her motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-23\">We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s orders and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying either Lakew\u2019s motion to reopen or her motion to reconsider. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2007); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992) (standard of review of denial of motion to reopen); <em>Jean v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 475, 481, 482-83 (4th Cir.2006) (standard of review of denial of motion to reconsider). We therefore deny both petitions for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In Re: Lakew, </em>No. A76-949-751 (B.I.A. Dec. 29, 2006 &amp; Mar. 21, 2007). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-24\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
