See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159-60 (9th Cir. 2002). Accordingly, the court <em>sua sponte </em>dismisses the petition for review in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Petitioners contended that the BIA\u2019s February 16, 2007 finding that they were barred from cancellation of removal because they failed to depart pursuant to a grant of voluntary departure was erroneous. The BIA agreed in its order on the motion to reconsider. Nonetheless, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to reconsider its February 16, 2007 denial of petitioners\u2019 untimely motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). The regulations provide, with certain exceptions that do not apply to this case, that a motion to reopen \u201cmust be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened.\u201d <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Accordingly, the court <em>sua sponte </em>denies the petition for review in part because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard)</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">All other pending motions are denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">The temporary stay of removal confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b824-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
