Aug. 14, 2006); <em>In re Wei Lin, </em>No. A73 654 920 (B.I.A. Aug. 14, 2006); and (2) a December 28, 2006 order denying their motion to reopen, <em>In re Xiao Lan Ye and Wei Lin, </em>No. A72 434 575/73 654 920 (B.I.A. Dec. 28, 2006).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">[I] <em>The BIA\u2019s August 2006 Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">First, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the BIA erred in concluding that it lacked the authority to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel, that error was harmless. The issuance of a letter by the Executive Office for Immigration Review mistakenly informing Ye that she had been granted asylum' does not constitute \u201caffirmative misconduct by the government\u201d warranting invocation of the estoppel doctrine. <em>See Rojas-Reyes v. INS, </em>235 F.3d 115, 126 (2d Cir.2000). The BIA had previously denied Ye\u2019s asylum application and she was therefore not eligible for an adjustment of status despite the mistaken letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">Second, we lack the authority to review the BIA\u2019s decision to decline to exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>powers to reopen or reconsider Ye\u2019s case, <em>see Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">Third, although the BIA\u2019s discussion of Ye\u2019s changed country conditions was limited, we cannot \u201cconclude that the BIA acted inappropriately by failing to consider the record as a whole when it issued its opinion denying the remand, [or] failed' to issue a reasoned opinion when it purportedly did consider the entire record.\u201d <em>Anderson v. McElroy, </em>953 F.2d 803, 806 (2d Cir.1992). In relevant part, the BIA denied Ye\u2019s motion on the'.basis that the \u201cobjective evidence of background information\u201d did not support Ye\u2019s motion to reopen, \u201cespecially in view of [the agency\u2019s] finding in [its previous decision] that the testimony of the two respondents regarding the sterilization was at odds and the lead respondent\u2019s testimony regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>the coercive nature of the sterilization was not credible.\u201d <em>In re Xiao Lan Ye, </em>No. A72 434 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Finally, Ye did not challenge the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief therefore this argument is waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">[II] <em>The BIA\u2019s December 2006 Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that Ye failed to comply with the requirements of <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). While Ye\u2019s affidavit described a discussion with her translator about filing a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s September 2002 decision, there is no indication that Ye \u201calleged, let alone established, that [her] former counsel ever agreed to [file a petition for review] or was engaged to undertake the task.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, Ye has forfeited her ineffective assistance of counsel claim and we need not consider the underlying merits. <em>See Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>409 F.3d 43, 46-47 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petitions for review are DENIED. The pending motions for a stay of removal are DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-8\">. Ye was the primary applicant for asylum. Wei Lin, her son, was a derivative of her claim. As Lin has no independent basis for asylum, we refer to Ye alone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b406-14\">. Because Ye did not timely petition for review of the BIA's September 2002 and December 2003 orders, we lack jurisdiction to . consider those decisions. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
