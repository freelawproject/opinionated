EBEL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b919-26\">Defendant Jose D. Martinez-Martinez pled guilty to distribution of at least 50 grams of methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). This conviction subjected the Defendant to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(viii). In the plea agreement however, the Govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>ment agreed to recommend the application of the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 safety valve provision if the Defendant \u201ctruthfully provided ... all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5). The safety valve provision would have allowed the district court to impose a sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">After the Defendant refused to debrief the Government, the district court accepted the Defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>statements to the arresting officers in satisfaction of \u00a7 501.2(a)(5). During the sentencing hearing however, the Defendant addressed the court and disavowed his post-arrest statements. After the district court verified that the Defendant understood that his denial would make him ineligible for the safety valve exception, the court imposed the statutory minimum sentence of 120 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">On appeal, counsel for the Defendant filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), which presented the Defendant\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s refusal to impose a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 5C1.2. In addition, Counsel moved for leave to withdraw as Defendant\u2019s counsel. Neither the Defendant nor the Government filed a brief responding to Counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief. We have independently reviewed the record as required by <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. Based on that review, we find that the district court did not err by denying Defendant the \u00a7 5C1.2 safety valve exception and that the record presents no additional non-frivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">We review the district court\u2019s decision regarding the Defendant\u2019s eligibility for \u00a7 5C1.2 for clear error. <em>See United States v. Roman-Zarate, </em>115 F.3d 778, 784 (10th Cir.1997). Thus, we will reverse the district court only if its decision was \u201cwithout factual support in the record,\u201d or if after our review of the record, \u201cwe are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>United States v. Beaulieu, </em>893 F.2d 1177, 1182 (10th Cir. 1990). The Defendant bears the burden of showing \u2014 by a preponderance of the evidence \u2014 the applicability of \u00a7 5C1.2. <em>United States v. Verners, </em>103 F.3d 108, 110 (10th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-12\">If the Defendant satisfies five criteria, \u00a7 5C1.2 allows district courts to impose a sentence pursuant to the sentencing guidelines, rather than a longer statutory mandatory minimum sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. In this case, only the fifth criterion is in dispute. The record indicates that the Defendant refused to debrief the Government and disavowed his statements to the arresting officers. Thus, we find that the factual record supports the district court\u2019s decision to deny the Defendant the safety valve exception and that therefore, it was not clear error for the court to refuse to apply \u00a7 5C1.2. <em>See Beaulieu, </em>893 F.2d at 1182. The Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>dant\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED and we GRANT Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b919-18\"> After examining appellant\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b920-6\">.
