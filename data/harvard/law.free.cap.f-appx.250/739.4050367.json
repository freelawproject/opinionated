We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-15\">Miles, an African-American male, works as an Information Technology Specialist for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in Lisle, Illinois. In December 2005 Miles filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission seeking to represent a class of African-American males who he claimed his employer had discriminated against on the basis of race and gender. After his petition for class certification was denied, Miles rejected the EEOC\u2019s offer to process his charge as an individual complaint. He instead filed suit in federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-16\">In federal court, Miles again sought to represent a class of African-American males who he claimed were the victims of race and gender discrimination in hiring and promotions. The district court cautioned Miles, who was representing himself, not to seek class certification before developing the facts of his individual claim, but Miles insisted that he would only continue the case as a class action. The district court denied Miles\u2019s oral motion for class certification and, as promispd, Miles refused to continue litigating his individual claim. In response, the court dismissed Miles\u2019s individual claim \u201cfor plaintiffs lack of desire to pursue this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>On appeal Miles first argues that the district court should have certified a class with him as class representative <em>and </em>as class counsel. This contention is easily disposed of as it is well settled that a nonlawyer, such as Miles, cannot act as legal counsel for a class. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Ou, </em>368 F.3d 773, 775 (7th Cir. 2004). Because the district court gave Miles more than enough time to hire a lawyer, denial of his oral motion for class certification was, therefore, not an abuse of discretion. <em>Payton v. County of Carroll, </em>473 F.3d 845, 847 (7th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Miles also contends that the district court erred when it dismissed his individual claim of discrimination due to Miles\u2019s \u201clack of desire to pursue\u201d it. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b), a district court has the power to sua sponte dismiss a claim for failure to prosecute, and we will reverse such dismissals only if the district court abused its discretion. <em>Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., </em>370 U.S. 626, 630-33, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962); <em>James v. McDonald\u2019s Corp., </em>417 F.3d 672, 681 (7th Cir.2005). In this case the record is plain that Miles did not wish to continue prosecuting his case after class certification was denied. Miles\u2019s contention that the record does not demonstrate the type of extreme conduct that would normally warrant dismissal for failure to prosecute is beside the point. As Miles explains in his reply brief, he sought and continues to seek \u201cto litigate his individual claims of discrimination in a class-action context.\u201d But once the district court correctly denied that context to him, Miles refused to continue litigating his case. The district court warned Miles that it would dismiss based on his refusal to pursue his individual claim, <em>see Ball v. City of Chi, 2 </em>F.3d 752, 755 (7th Cir.1993), and Miles refused to change his position. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it took the only course of action that Miles left it and dismissed his individual claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Finally, Miles claims that the transcripts themselves are \u201ctainted\u201d and \u201cdo not correctly reflect the statements actually made during the status hearings held in the District Court.\u201d But Miles does not identify which part of the transcripts he believes to be incorrect or any statements made at the hearings that were not included in the transcripts, so we could deem the argument waived. <em>Weinstein v. Schwartz, </em>422 F.3d 476, 477 n. 1 (7th Cir.2005). Instead, we will address it more directly under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 10(e)(1), which states, \u201cIf any difference arises about whether the record truly discloses what occurred in the district court, the difference must be submitted to and settled by that court and the record conformed accordingly.\u201d <em>See also </em>Cir. Rule 10(b); <em>United States v. Banks, </em>405 F.3d 559, 567 (7th Cir.2005). In other words, we are simply unable to consider in the first instance an argument that a certified transcript from the district court is \u201ctainted.\u201d <em>See Zimmerman v. Chi. Bd. of Trade, </em>360 F.3d 612, 622 (7th Cir.2004); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753 (explaining that certified transcript is \u201cdeemed prima facie a correct statement of the testimony taken and proceedings had\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
