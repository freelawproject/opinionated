The district court found a base offense level and assessed a six-level \u201cofficial-victim\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(e)(l). \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l), in relevant part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">(c) If, in a manner creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury, the defendant or a person for whose conduct the defendant is otherwise accountable\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">(1) knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that a person was a law enforcement officer, assaulted such officer during the course of the offense or immediate flight therefrom ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Here, Delgado concedes that he recklessly endangered others when fleeing enforcement officers and that a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2 would be appropriate. He argues, however, that the district court erred because the evidence did not establish that he intended to injure law enforcement officials and therefore failed to show that he committed aggravated assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir.2006). A district court is permitted to draw reasonable inferences from the facts, and the inferences are also reviewed for clear error. <em>Id. </em>This court \u201cwill uphold a district court\u2019s factual finding on clear error review so long as the enhancement is plausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-16\">We do not address the question of whether the Government is required to prove a defendant\u2019s intent to injure law enforcement officials to warrant the \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l) enhancement because defendant has failed to show that the district court\u2019s factual findings based on trial testimony and the PSR were clearly erroneous, and our precedent supports enhancement under these circumstances. Although Delgado\u2019s first collision with Agent DiMarco\u2019s patrol car was accidental,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the second collision was a \u201chead-on\u201d ramming of a manned, marked law enforcement vehicle.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When the police officer then ran to Delgado\u2019s car, Delgado \u201cfloored\u201d the accelerator.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>United States v. Gillyard, </em>261 F.3d 506, 510 (5th Cir.2001) the defendant did not hit the patrol car but struck other vehicles, drove into a median where construction workers were standing, drove on the shoulder of a highway past eighteen-wheeler trucks \u2014 nearly hitting a patrol car, and finally \u201ccaromed off a concrete piling.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We upheld the district court\u2019s \u00a7 3A1.2 and \u00a7 3C1.2 enhancements for assault against officers and reckless endangerment during flight, determining that the district court\u2019s factual findings of a \u201chigh-speed chase\u201d which \u201cendangered both police officers and others\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> were not clearly erroneous. Similarly, the district court\u2019s findings here are not clearly erroneous.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number><footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b56-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b57-10\">. The officer who was driving the patrol car indicated: \"He lost control of the car. I think he cut the corner too sharp ... and he ended up making contact with my unit....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b57-11\">. The officer testified: \"I started to make a u-tum. When I got pretty much to the apex of that u-turn, he was mobile again and he came straight at me and hit my unit head-on.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b57-12\">. Delgado\u2019s reasons for flooring the accelerator are unclear. His vehicle was pinned against the officer\u2019s vehicle, and the officer testified: \"he kept pumping the gas pedal as if trying to push the unit aside or I don\u2019t know what he was thinking.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b57-18\">. <em>Gillyard, </em>261 F.3d at 508.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b57-19\">. One of the enhancements in <em>Gillyard </em>was also for an assault of an officer \"during the course of the offense or immediate flight therefrom ... in a manner creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury,\u201d which was then U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(b). <em>Gillyard, </em>261 F.3d at 511.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b58-17\">. The court found: \"I can see if all we had was the first [impact], how that argument I think would be a strong argument, that it really wasn\u2019t an assault ... But when we have then the second impact as well as once he is up against the fence and the attempt to escape then, I think that we have sufficient [evidence] here to establish an assault.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
