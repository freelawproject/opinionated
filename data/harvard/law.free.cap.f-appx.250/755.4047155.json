Maggard\u2019s counsel moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting the concurrent 96-month prison sentences are unreasonable in light of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and the district court abused its discretion in requiring alcohol abstention and successful participation in approved counseling as special conditions of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">We conclude Maggard\u2019s prison sentences are not unreasonable: they were within the undisputed Guidelines range of 77-96 months, and were imposed following the district court\u2019s proper consideration of relevant section 3553(a) factors. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-68, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (allowing appellate presumption of reasonableness); <em>United States v. Denton, </em>434 F.3d 1104, 1113 (8th Cir.2006) (holding a within-Guidelines sentence is presumptively reasonable); <em>United States v. Haack, </em>403 F.3d 997, 1004 (8th Cir.2005) (discussing appropriate consideration of \u00a7 3553(a) factors). After reviewing the unobjectedto special conditions of supervised release for plain error, <em>see United States v. Morey, </em>120 F.3d 142, 143 (8th Cir.1997) (per curiam) (standard of review), we further conclude the conditions, are supported by the record and reasonably related to the statutory factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d) (stating conditions of release must reasonably be related to factors in \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), and (a)(2)(D)), <em>see United States v. Cooper, </em>171 F.3d 582, 586-87 (8th Cir. 1999) (upholding the prohibition of the consumption of alcohol and the requirement that defendant obtain substance-abuse and mental-health counseling, where there was some evidence of alcohol and drug abuse and defendant had a history of mental instability). After reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-15\">We grant counsel leave to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-12\">.
