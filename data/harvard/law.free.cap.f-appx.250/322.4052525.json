Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>105 M.S.P.R. 575 (2007). The Board determined that the petition for review of the first appeal was untimely filed without a showing of good cause for delay and therefore affirmed the dismissal of the second appeal based on the doctrine of res judicata. Id For the reasons stated herein, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b349-15\">Ms. Triplett applied for disability retirement under the Federal Employees\u2019 Retirement System (\u201cFERS\u201d) following an alleged on-the-job injury as a Distribution Clerk with the United States Postal Service (\u201cUSPS\u201d). The Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) determined that Ms. Triplett was not disabled within the meaning of retirement law and denied her application. On August 26, 2003, Ms. Triplett filed a timely appeal with the Board\u2019s regional office. On August 29, 2003, the administrative judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) mailed an acknowledgment and close-of-record orders to a 62nd Street address that Ms. Triplett had provided three days earlier. USPS returned the mail to the regional office indicating that Ms. Triplett\u2019s address had changed to 43rd Street, but that the forwarding time to that address had expired. The AJ then remailed the orders to the 43rd Street address by commercial overnight delivery service. The mail was again returned as undeliverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-16\">In a memorandum of record, the AJ stated that because \u201cthe Board does not have a proper address to forward the necessary documentation for the appellant to pursue her appeal, it appears that I will have to dismiss this appeal for failure to prosecute.\u201d On January 26, 2004, after four months without any further contact from Ms. Triplett, the AJ issued an initial decision in which he dismissed Ms. Triplett\u2019s appeal for failure to prosecute (\u201cthe first decision\u201d). Ms. Triplett did not file a petition for review (\u201cPFR\u201d), and the first decision became final on March 1, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-17\">Meanwhile, Ms. Triplett filed a second application for disability retirement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>OPM denied in both an initial decision and a reconsideration of that decision. Ms. Triplett filed a second appeal with the Board\u2019s regional office. In response, OPM filed a motion to dismiss based on the doctrine of res judicata because it had determined that the first and second applications were based on the same medical condition. Ms. Triplett argued that she had never received the first decision dismissing her first appeal for failure to prosecute. OPM rescinded its final reconsideration decision, and the AJ dismissed Ms. Triplett\u2019s second appeal without prejudice to refiling upon the issuance of OPM\u2019s new final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Ms. Triplett filed a PFR. Because the record did not indicate that OPM would issue a new final decision, the Board reopened the appeal on its own motion, vacated the initial decision, and remanded the appeal to the regional office. The Board noted, however, that \u201cOPM may ultimately prevail with respect to its argument that the Board should dismiss this appeal on the grounds of res judicata.\u201d On remand, in an order dated January 13, 2006, the AJ instructed Ms. Triplett: \u201cI now inform the appellant that if she wishes to file a petition for review of the January 26, 2004 decision, she must file her petition with the Clerk of the Board, as stated in the appeal rights of both the first and second initial decisions.\u201d Ms. Triplett alleged to have just learned that the dismissal of her first appeal \u201cwould carry over\u201d to her second appeal. On August 4, 2006, the AJ dismissed Ms. Triplett\u2019s second appeal based on res judicata (\u201cthe second decision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Ms. Triplett filed a PFR on August 31, 2006, which the Board construed as a PFR of both the first and second decisions. The Board found that the record established that OPM provided Ms. Triplett with a copy of the first decision as part of its file following the Board\u2019s December 2005 remand of her second appeal to the regional office. The Board noted that even if Ms. Triplett did not receive a copy of the first decision until February 22, 2006, as she claimed, her PFR was still untimely by more than five months. It determined that Ms. Triplett\u2019s actions did not reflect diligence or ordinary prudence under the circumstances and therefore dismissed her PFR of the first decision as untimely filed without a showing of good cause for delay. Because the first decision remained final, the Board affirmed the second decision based on res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Ms. Triplett filed an appeal to this court from the Board\u2019s decision. This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9)..</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">The scope of our review in any appeal from the Board is limited. Generally, we must affirm the decision of the Board unless it is: (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c). In appeals from the Board regarding disability retirement under FERS, however, our review is even further limited. OPM\u2019s decisions regarding disability retirement are \u201cfinal and conclusive and are not subject to review.\u201d <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8461(d). Thus, this court is \u201cwithout authority to review the substantive merits of disability determinations, or the factual underpinnings of such determinations.\u201d <em>Gooden v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>471 F.3d 1275, 1278 (Fed.Cir.2006) (citing <em>Lindahl v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>470 U.S. 768, 791, 105 S.Ct. 1620, 84 L.Ed.2d 674 (1985)); <em>accord Anthony v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>58 F.3d 620, 626 (Fed.Cir.1995). Rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>review is limited to determining \u201cwhether there has been a substantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some like error going to the heart of the administrative process.\u201d <em>Gooden, </em>471 F.3d at 1278 (quoting <em>Lindahl, </em>470 U.S. at 791, 105 S.Ct. 1620) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Board regulations require that a PFR be filed within 35 days after the date of issuance of the initial decision or, if the petitioner shows that the initial decision was received more than five days after the date of issuance, within 30 days after the date the petitioner received the initial decision. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.114(d). The Board may only waive the time limit for filing a PFR if the petitioner shows good cause for delay. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.114(f). \u201cDelay is excusable where, under the circumstances, a petitioner exercises diligence or ordinary prudence.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>966 F.2d 650, 653 (Fed.Cir.1992) (citing <em>Phillips v. United States Postal Serv., </em>695 F.2d 1389, 1391 (Fed.Cir.1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Accepting Ms. Triplett\u2019s statement as correct that she failed to receive a copy of the first decision until February 22, 2006, she had to file a PFR of that decision within 30 days. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.114(d). However, she filed the PFR on August 31, 2006, which was untimely by more than five months. Thus, the relevant time period for which Ms. Triplett must establish good cause is from February 22, 2006, the date she received a copy of the first decision, through August 31, 2006, the date she filed a PFR of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Ms. Triplett has not provided an explanation of her activities during that period. In her informal brief to this court, Ms. Triplett argues that the Board failed to account for her \u201czero dollar income\u201d from March 2001 through October 2003. She also renews allegations that: (1) USPS sabotaged her first appeal by intentionally withholding delivery of her mail in 2003; and (2) she received incorrect information during a visit to the regional office on November 6, 2003. While these arguments and allegations may address the reasons for Ms. Triplett\u2019s delay in receiving a copy of the first decision until February 22, 2006, they do not address the specific reasons for her delay in filing a PFR of that decision until August 31, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Ms. Triplett also relies on the arguments set forth in the dissenting opinion below, which concludes that the regional office could have forwarded her response to OPM\u2019s motion to dismiss to the Board to be processed as a timely PFR of the first decision. The regional office, however, did not forward that response, nor was it under an obligation to do so. Petitioners are responsible for filing timely PFRs with the Board in accordance with the instructions provided at the end of the decision. Significantly, the AJ\u2019s January 13, 2006 order specifically instructed Ms. Triplett to file a PFR of the first decision. Armed with this information, Ms. Triplett did not exercise diligence or ordinary prudence in waiting until the Board actually dismissed her second appeal based on res judicata. \u201cA petitioner who ignores an order of the Administrative Judge does so at his or her peril.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>966 F.2d at 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">Under these circumstances, we do not find a \u201csubstantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some like error going to the heart of the administrative process\u201d in the Board\u2019s decision to deny Ms. Triplett a waiver of the regulatory time limit for failure to show good cause for delay. <em>See Gooden, </em>471 F.3d at 1278 (quoting <em>Lindahl, </em>470 U.S. at 791, 105 S.Ct. 1620).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">We conclude that the Board properly dismissed Ms. Triplett\u2019s petition for review of the first appeal as untimely filed without a showing of good cause for delay and properly affirmed the dismissal of the second appeal based on the doctrine of res judicata. The decision of the Board is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
