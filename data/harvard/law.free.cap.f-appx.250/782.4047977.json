R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b809-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">Paul William Jensen, a California state prisoner, appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging that officials at Mule Creek State Prison violated his constitutional rights by denying him a diabetic diet, confiscating his religious books, and housing him with an inmate who smokes. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a dismissal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Andrews v. Cervantes, </em>493 F.3d 1047, 1052 (9th Cir. 2007). We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">The Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) prohibits a prisoner from proceeding <em>in forma pauperis </em>if three or more of his prior federal actions were dismissed because they were frivolous, malicious, or failed to state a claim, \u201cunless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). The district court concluded that Jensen\u2019s allegations regarding conditions at Mule Creek State Prison did not meet the \u201cimminent danger\u201d exception because, after Jensen filed his initial complaint, he was transferred to Pleasant Valley State Prison where, presumably, he was no longer in danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">After the district court issued its opinion, we held in <em>Andrews v. Cervantes, </em>that \u201cthe availability of the exception turns on the conditions a prisoner faced at the time the complaint was filed, not at some earlier or later time.\u201d 493 F.3d at 1053. Because the district court did not have the benefit of <em>Andrews </em>when it issued its dismissal order, we reverse and remand for the district court to reconsider whether Jensen\u2019s complaint meets the \u201cimmediate dangei\u2019\u201d exception in section 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-13\">Because we reverse on other grounds, we do not consider whether the district court properly treated an action dismissed pursuant to <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), as a strike under the PLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-14\">Jensen\u2019s motion for judicial notice is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-15\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b809-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
