We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-18\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b36-19\">On April 19, 2004, Allen pleaded guilty to one count of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2)(A) for the receipt and distribution of child pornography. He was sentenced to sixty-three months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-20\">On December 10, 2003, Allen\u2019s adult stepdaughter, Stephanie Best, contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) in Lufkin, Texas and related that her mother and stepbrother believed that there were images of child pornography on their home computer. FBI personnel told her that if her mother had equal access to the computer and believed that it contained images of child pornography, then her mother could bring the computer to the FBI office and sign a consent-to-search form.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-21\">On December 29, 2003, Allen\u2019s wife, Yvonne Allen, brought the computer to the Lufkin FBI office and was interviewed by Special Agent Goodson. Yvonne Allen had been told by her twenty-one-year-old stepson, Damon Allen, that his father, Jeffrey Allen, had accessed Web sites and downloaded child pornography. She stated that on several occasions, Damon Allen had ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>cessed the computer after Jeffrey Alen, viewed Web sites that his father had visited, and showed them to her. Yvonne Alen stated that she had seen at least two pictures of naked eight- or nine-year-old girls, and that Damon told her about other child pornography he had seen on the computer. Yvonne Alen told Goodson that she had always had full access to the computer and usually played solitaire on it. She signed a consent form authorizing the FBI to search the computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">On December 30, 2003, Damon Alen was interviewed and said that he had seen video clips on the computer that he believed to be child pornography. He described how to access those video clips on the computer, but did not mention the existence of any password-protection. Damon Alen\u2019s only mention of passwords during the interview were those used by his father to access an online service, not files on the computer\u2019s hard-drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">In a report dated January 17, 2004, computer forensic examiner Donald Wills of the North Texas Regional Computer Forensic Laboratory described his examination of Alen\u2019s computer. Besides indicating that there was possible child pornography on the computer, Wills\u2019 report stated that the computer\u2019s Windows software was registered to \u201cJeff,\u201d the e-mail account associated with the computer\u2019s Internet service provider was \u201cjallen954,\u201d a newsgroup account was in the name of \u201cjallen9543@directway.com,\u201d and the computer held a folder entitled \u201cjallen9543.\u201d Wills extracted selected files from the computer. The report does not indicate that any files were password-protected nor that the examiner used software to decrypt or bypass password-protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">At the time of his arrest on February 9, 2004, Alen said that he knew he was being arrested because he had inappropriate material on his computer. He stated that the images of child pornography on his computer had been downloaded without his knowledge and without the knowledge of anyone in his household. He said that many things had appeared on his computer without his knowledge over the years and argued that someone else could have downloaded the images on his computer while it was on.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">After sentencing, Alen filed a notice of appeal on September 24, 2004, but it was dismissed for being filed out of time. On December 20, 2004, Alen filed a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">During those proceedings, Alen\u2019s trial counsel, Gregory Waldron, provided an affidavit to the district court. Waldron\u2019s affidavit reiterated the information that Yvonne and Damon Alen provided to the FBI and indicated that Waldron reviewed their statements and all discovery with Alen. Alen did not object to the statements of his wife and son. Based upon those statements, Waldron concluded that Yvonne Alen had authority to give consent to search the computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-11\">Alen now appeals the dismissal of his motion to vacate his conviction on two grounds. He claims that the search of his computer was unlawful and that his claim on this point was not waived by his guilty plea. He also claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when Waldi\u2019on did not file a motion to suppress the evidence seized during the search of the computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-12\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b37-13\">In reviewing the denial of a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, this Court reviews factual findings for clear error and conclusions of law <em>de novo. United States v. Faubion, </em>19 F.3d 226, 228 (5th Cir.1994). Because ineffective assistance of counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>claims are mixed questions of law and fact, they are subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">A. Lawfulness of the Computer Search</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">\u201cA plea of guilty admits all the elements of a formal criminal charge and waives all non-jurisdictional defects in the proceedings leading to conviction. The plea waives claims of governmental misconduct during the investigation and improper motives for prosecution.\u201d <em>United States v. Cothran, </em>302 F.3d 279, 285-86 (5th Cir.2002) (internal quotations omitted). Allen pleaded guilty on April 19, 2004. He makes no argument and cites no authority to suggest that he did not waive his right to challenge the search of his computer when he pleaded guilty. The district court did not err in dismissing this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">To evaluate an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, this Court first determines whether the counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. <em>Turner v. Quarterman, </em>481 F.3d 292, 298 (5th Cir.2007). \u201cThis requires [the defendant to show] that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)). \u201cThe proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Second, this Court determines whether the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Turner, </em>481 F.3d at 298. \u201cThis requires [the defendant to show] that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052). To demonstrate prejudice in the context of a guilty plea, \u201cthe defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">Allen claims Yvonne Allen lacked authority to consent to the search, particularly to consent to the search of password-protected files on the computer. Allen argues that Waldron\u2019s failure to move to suppress the evidence seized during the search of the computer. constituted deficient performance that prejudiced his decision to plead guilty. To determine whether Waldron\u2019s performance was deficient, we must determine whether his decision not to move to suppress the evidence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-11\">To justify a warrantless search based on consent received from a third party, the Government must prove that the third party had either actual or apparent authority to consent. <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>121 F.3d 928, 938 (5th Cir.1997). \u201cTo establish that a third party had actual authority to consent, the government must demonstrate mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). To establish whether a third party had apparent authority to consent, the Government \u201cneed demonstrate only that the officers reasonably believed that the third party was authorized to consent.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-12\">The first question Waldron faced was whether the law regarding consent searches of other containers applied to consent searches of computers. Although this Court has not addressed the issue, other courts had by December 2003. In <em>Trulock v. Freeh, </em>the Fourth Circuit ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>plied the law of consent searches to a personal computer used by two people living together. 275 F.3d 391, 402-03 (4th Cir.2001). In that case, the court held that the third party did not have authority to consent to a search of password-protected files on the computer because they were \u201canalogous to [a] locked footlocker inside [a] bedroom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 403. In <em>United States v. Smith, </em>a district court denied a motion to suppress evidence seized during the consent search of a computer based on the apparent authority of the defendant\u2019s live-in girlfriend. 27 F.Supp.2d 1111, 1116 (C.D.Ill.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Although unpublished decisions are of limited persuasive authority, they would have helped Waldron determine the applicability of consent search law to a computer. In an unpublished decision, the Fourth Circuit upheld the search of a computer disk turned over to police by the defendant\u2019s wife based on her common authority over the property. <em>United States v. Mannion, </em>54 Fed.Appx. 372, 373-74 (4th Cir.2002). Also in an unpublished decision, the Sixth Circuit upheld the consent search of a computer based upon the apparent authority of a third party, because the defendant \u201cnever told [the third party] she could not use the new computer nor restricted her access with password protections.\u201d <em>United States v. Aaron, </em>33 Fed. Appx. 180, 184 (6th Cir.2002). Most importantly, no circuit has held that different principles apply to searches of computers than those that apply to the searches of other containers.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">While applying this law to the facts of the case before him, Waldron had read Yvonne and Damon Allen\u2019s statements to Special Agent Goodson. According to Goodson\u2019s report, Yvonne Allen told him that she had equal access to the computer and \u201cusually play[ed] solitaire on it.\u201d From Waldron\u2019s perspective, he had no reason to believe that Yvonne Allen\u2019s access to the computer was exclusively limited to playing solitaire. Also, Yvonne Allen brought the computer to the FBI office and turned it over to Goodson. Damon Allen\u2019s easy access to what he believed to be child pornography suggested that all family members had full access to the computer. Nothing suggested to Waldron that agents were unreasonable in their belief that Yvonne Allen had authority to consent to a search of the computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Allen relies on <em>Trulock </em>to suggest that Waldron should have challenged the search of password-protected files on the computer to which only Allen had access. If there were any evidence in the record that the files were protected by a password, Allen\u2019s claim might have merit. But to the contrary, the record shows that no password-protection existed for files on the hard drive of the computer. Allen\u2019s son accessed what he believed to be child pornography on the computer. He even gave directions on how to open those files, and did not indicate that any password was necessary to open them. The computer examination report did not mention passwords nor did it mention any software used to break or circumvent passwords. Most of all, Allen\u2019s statement to arresting agents that any child pornography on the computer must have been downloaded by someone else suggests that no password-protection existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">Assuming for the purpose of argument that the files were locked and only Allen had access to them, Waldron\u2019s decision was still reasonable. Waldron reviewed the FBI interview reports of Allen\u2019s wife and son with Allen, including his son\u2019s assertion that he had accessed files on the computer that he believed to contain child pornography without mentioning a password, even though he described passwords that Allen used to access online services. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Yet, Allen never told Waldron that his son\u2019s statements were false \u2014 that those files were protected by a password that only he knew. In <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>the Supreme Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-4\">The reasonableness of counsel\u2019s actions may be determined or substantially influenced by the defendant\u2019s own statements or actions. Counsel\u2019s actions are usually based, quite properly, on informed strategic choices made by the defendant and on information supplied by the defendant. In particular, what investigation decisions are reasonable depend critically on such information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">466 U.S. 668, 691, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Waldron had no indication that any computer files were protected by a password, and Allen had ample opportunity to inform Waldron if any were. This Court cannot say that Waldron\u2019s decision was unreasonable when both the law and facts indicated that the motion to suppress the evidence seized from the computer would have been denied. The district court did not err in dismissing Allen\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b36-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b40-9\">. Because Allen has failed to show that Waldron's performance was deficient, we have no need to explore whether his actions prejudiced Allen.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
