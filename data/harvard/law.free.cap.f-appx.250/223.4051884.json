We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">To qualify for withholding of removal, Mazilanghan must demonstrate that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened\u201d if he is returned to Germany, on account of his \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b). In addition, Mazilanghan must demonstrate that the agent of his persecution would be \u201cthe government or ... persons or organizations which the government is unable or unwilling to control.\u201d <em>Reyes-Reyes v. Ashcroft, </em>384 F.3d 782, 788 (9th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). Mazilanghan has presented no argument that the German government was either directly involved in his alleged persecution, or that they were \u201cunwilling or unable\u201d to control those persons responsible for his alleged mistreatment. As a result, the argument is waived, <em>see Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir.1996), and the Board\u2019s decision stands on this independently dispositive ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-16\">Furthermore, substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s determination that the harm suffered by Mazilanghan in Germany did not rise to the level of \u201cpersecution.\u201d <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2003) (single act of physical violence along with harassment and threats did not compel a finding of past persecution). The Board made no mention of credibility, and so any error in the Immigration Judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination is irrelevant. Mazilanghan failed to raise any challenge to the Board\u2019s determination that he is ineligible for asylum from Germany because he is firmly resettled in Germany, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. 1158(b)(1)(A), or to articulate a basis for relief under the Convention Against Torture, and so any such claims are waived. Mazilanghan\u2019s due process challenges are \u201cprocedural in nature,\u201d and are waived along with his remaining procedural claims because he failed to raise them to the Board. <em>Barron v.
