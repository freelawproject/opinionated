The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed, but allowed Acheampong to depart voluntarily. Acheampong appeals and we affirm because the record does not compel a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-21\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b184-22\">Acheampong, a native and citizen of Ghana, used her sister-in-law\u2019s documents to enter the United States on April 20, 1992. She filed for asylum with the agency then known as the INS in 1992. The application was referred to the Executive Office of Immigration Review in 1995, but no decision was reached. According to Acheampong\u2019s testimony before the IJ, in 1995 Acheampong was introduced to Hosea Evans, a United States citizen, by her sister-in-law. After four dates, Evans proposed and the pair married in Toledo on March 29, 1996. On October 9, 1996, Acheampong adjusted her status to \u201cconditional permanent resident\u201d based on the marriage. The couple filed a joint petition to remove the condition on her residency on July 15, 1998, slightly more than two years after the marriage as required by the statutory scheme. In 1999, Officer Daniel Wells of the INS reviewed Acheam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>pong\u2019s petition, interviewed the couple, and became suspicious because the couple \u201cknew very little about one another\u201d and \u201cdid not reside together.\u201d He submitted the case for further action, but for reasons not in the record the case was returned to him in 2001 without any further action having been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Wells re-interviewed the couple in November of 2001. This time the interview was videotaped, and the couple brought counsel. Before the interview, Wells learned that both Acheampong and Evans filed their taxes as \u201cHead of Household\u201d from separate addresses and that their joint bank account showed minimal activity. At the interview, Acheampong and Evans told different stories on multiple subjects, including whether they knew certain members of each other\u2019s family and when and where they lived together. Acheampong could not give the names or ages of Evans\u2019s children from his previous marriage or give any information about his hospitalization following a recent stroke. Despite being a Registered Nurse, she misidentified which side of his body the stroke harmed and could not identify any of the medicines he was taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">On April 10, 2002, the INS denied Acheampong\u2019s petition and on April 11 issued her a Notice to Appear in removal proceedings. Acheampong appeared before an IJ on April 4, 2003 and denied removability, challenged the termination of her status as a permanent resident, and renewed her asylum claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A full hearing was held on February 9, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">At the hearing, Acheampong admitted that she has not listed Evans as a beneficiary on her health insurance or her retirement plan. She could not say where he attends church. When confronted with the separate tax returns, she blamed the preparers. She claimed that the couple began living together after their marriage, lived apart from July 2001 to late 2004 because of personal problems, financial problems, and Evans\u2019s stroke, but then began living together again when they purchased a home in November 2004. When shown loan documents listing both Acheampong and Evans as single people residing at separate addresses, Acheampong once again claimed ignorance and blamed the preparers.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">Evans testified that he suffered a stroke in 2000 that prevented him from working and created memory problems. He said that the couple lived together \u201con and off.\u201d When asked to clarify that statement, he replied \u201c[w]ell, she worked and I worked and we lived together because, on and off because it seemed like it was better that way.\u201d Later, when asked where he lived immediately after he married Acheampong, he answered \u201cwith my daughter (from a previous marriage).\u201d As to the taxes and the loan applications, he also blamed the preparers. His testimony repeatedly conflicted with Acheampong\u2019s, but the BIA discounted those inconsistencies because of Evans\u2019s poor health.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">The only other witnesses were Officer Wells and Acheampong\u2019s brother, who testified that he was present at the couple\u2019s wedding ceremony. Acheampong submitted evidence that the couple owned a joint bank account, but it showed minimal activity. Acheampong also submitted \u201cLetters of Support\u201d from six people who claimed to know the couple well, but four of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>letters contained only identical two-sentence statements. The others came from Acheampong\u2019s brother and sister-in-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">On February 10, 2005, the IJ ruled that Acheampong\u2019s marriage was a sham. He discussed the lack of documentary evidence and stated that he still could not determine whether Acheampong and Evans had lived together before 2004. He stressed that it was not the fact that they lived apart that was troubling, but the \u201cinability of the respondent and her own witnesses, the petitioning spouse and the brother, to agree on when they lived together\u201d that made him skeptical.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">When Acheampong appealed to the BIA, the BIA acknowledged certain \u201cirregularities\u201d in the 2001 interview<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and also noted Evans\u2019s medical condition at the 2005 hearing. Therefore, the BIA placed only limited weight on the inconsistencies at the 2001 interview and Evans\u2019s testimony at the 2005 hearing. Nevertheless, the BIA pointed to seven other facts that supported the IJ\u2019s decision and affirmed. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">At trial, the government must prove that an alien\u2019s marriage is fraudulent and that the alien is therefore removable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1186a(c)(3)(D). However, on appeal we ask only if the BIA\u2019s decision, under the proper standard, was supported by substantial evidence. <em>Klawitter v. INS, </em>970 F.2d 149, 151 (6th Cir.1992). Under this standard, \u201c[a] factual determination by the Board that an alien\u2019s marriage was entered for the purpose of gaming entry into the United States is conclusive if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence in the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Bazzi v. Ashcroft, </em>118 Fed.Appx. 953, 956 (6th Cir.2004). This is a deferential standard; we cannot reverse merely because we would have decided the case differently. Indeed, the Supreme Court has told us that \u201c[t]o reverse [a] BIA finding we must find that the evidence not only <em>supports </em>that conclusion, but <em>compels </em>it.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (emphasis in original). The deferential standard dictates our decision to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">An alien who marries a United' States citizen can apply for lawful permanent resident status. For the first two years, the alien is given only conditional permanent residence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1186a(a)(1), (g)(1). After two years, the alien and his or her spouse must file a petition to remove the condition. This is what Acheampong did. In normal cases, the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>ment will grant permanent resident status, but if the Attorney General finds that \u201cthe qualifying marriage ... was entered into for the purposes of procuring the alien\u2019s admission as an immigrant\u201d the Attorney General may notify the parties, terminate the alien\u2019s conditional permanent resident status, and begin removal proceedings. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1186a(b)(1)(A). A marriage formed to help one spouse circumvent immigration law and not as the couple\u2019s good faith attempt to start a life together is called a \u201cfraudulent or sham marriage, and has not been recognized as enabling an alien spouse to obtain immigration benefits.\u201d <em>Matter of McKee, </em>17 I. &amp; N. Dec. 332, 333 (BIA 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Federal regulations explain that whether a marriage was formed in good faith depends on \u201c \u2018the amount of commitment by both parties to the relationship.\u2019 \u201d <em>El-Hadi v. INS, </em>No. 98-4282, 1999 WL 825042, at *4 (6th Cir. Oct.8, 1999) (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 216.5(e)(2)). Evidence of commitment includes \u201cdocumentation relating to the degree to which assets and liabilities were combined, the length of time the parties cohabited, birth certificates for children born to the marriage, and \u2018[o]ther evidence deemed pertinent by the director.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Additional relevant evidence includes \u201cproof that the petitioner\u2019s spouse has been listed on insurance policies, property leases, income tax forms, or bank accounts, and testimony or other evidence regarding courtship, wedding ceremony, shared residence, and experiences.\u201d <em>Matter of Soriano, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 764, 766 (BIA 1988). The seminal case explained that courts must consider the evidence and ask whether the parties \u201cintend[ed] to establish a life together at the time they were married.\u201d <em>Bark v. INS, </em>511 F.2d 1200, 1201 (9th Cir.1975). Conduct after the marriage is evidence of the couple\u2019s state of mind at the time they married. <em>Id. </em>at 1202. Our court has quoted both the BIA opinions and <em>Bark </em>with approval. <em>See Ayyoub v. INS, </em>93 Fed. Appx. 828, 832 (6th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Bark); El-Hadi, </em>1999 WL 825042, at *4 (quoting <em>Bark </em>and <em>McKee).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Applying the standard of review and the governing law, we ask whether substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Acheampong and Evans did not intend to establish a life together when they married. <em>See Klawitter, </em>970 F.2d at 151; <em>Bark, </em>511 F.2d at 1201. The BIA found the following facts persuasive: (1) The parties\u2019 repeated decision to file separate tax returns each claiming \u201cHead of Household\u201d status and each using a different address from the other; (2) Acheampong\u2019s failure to list Evans as a beneficiary on her life insurance or pension; (3) the loan application listing both Acheampong and Evans as single adults; (4) Acheampong\u2019s failure to produce witnesses other than her brother who knew the couple when they first married; (5) lack of evidence of shared finances; (6) Acheampong\u2019s ignorance of Evans\u2019s religion, income, or medication; and (7) lack of consistent evidence that the couple shared a home before removal proceedings began. We review the record and find all these conclusions factually supported by the evidence and legally relevant based on our cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">For the first eight years of their marriage, Acheampong and Evans filed separate tax returns claiming \u201cHead of Household\u201d status and giving separate addresses. Failure to file a joint tax return is evidence that the marriage is a sham. <em>Sinadinovski v. INS, </em>No. 95-3730, 1996 WL 435606, at * 1 (6th Cir. Aug.l, 1996). Acheampong blames the tax preparers. Tax preparers may make mistakes, but they also rely on the information they are given. Eight consecutive years of filing as separate \u201cHeads of Household\u201d from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>separate addresses suggests separate lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Acheampong admitted that she did not list Evans as a beneficiary on her life insurance or pension. Listing or failing to list a spouse on such policies is relevant evidence. <em>Sinadinovski, </em>1996 WL 435606, at *3; <em>Matter of Soriano, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 764, 766 (BIA 1988). Acheampong offers alternative explanations for these inconvenient facts, but the mere existence of a plausible alternative explanation does not disprove the government\u2019s assertion or the BIA\u2019s findings. An ambiguous fact consistent with both Acheampong\u2019s position and the BIA\u2019s finding does not <em>compel </em>us to agree with Acheampong and thus reverse the BIA. <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 481 n. 1,112 S.Ct. 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Identical analysis applies to the loan application listing Acheampong and Evans as single adults living at separate addresses. Acheampong once again blames the third-party preparer, but we repeat that the preparer can only use information she is given. More importantly, the application is consistent with two people who do not hold themselves out as married unless the immigration authorities are watching.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Acheampong\u2019s failure to produce witnesses, other than her brother, who knew the couple at the time of marriage is telling given that the focus is on the parties\u2019 intent at the time of the marriage. As mentioned earlier, the record includes several \u201cLetters of Support\u201d by people claiming to know the couple, but a majority of the letters come from people who did not know the couple before 2000 and consist solely of the same two sentences. None of the authors appeared at the hearing to face cross-examination. Our court has relied on a lack of witnesses to a couple\u2019s relationship to affirm the BIA. <em>See El-Hadi, </em>1999 WL 825042, at *4.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the couple did not share financial resources. Acheampong presented records of a shared bank account. However, an account listing two names without evidence that both parties actually <em>used </em>the account is not evidence of shared finances. <em>Ayyoub, </em>93 Fed.Appx. at 832-33. Acheampong\u2019s first account, with Michigan National Bank, shows minimal activity. The second account, with Comerica, shows slightly more activity, with a small deposit every one to two months. But the second account is less persuasive because it was established only after removal proceedings began. Nowhere is there evidence of a joint account that was consistently used by both parties. Acheampong relies on photocopies of three checks she wrote to Evans for groceries as evidence of shared finances. But three checks, for a total of $130, is not the kind of evidentiary record that \u201ccompels\u201d us to disagree with the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Acheampong could not give the court information about Evans\u2019s job, religion, or even the medication he takes. Neither this court nor the BIA expects spouses to know everything about each other, but it is telling when a nurse cannot be sure what medication her husband takes for his stroke.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">Finally, there is the question of living arrangements. At both the 2001 interview and at the 2005 hearing, the couple gave conflicting stories about when they lived together. While they were living together from November 2004 onwards (after removal proceedings began), there is no documentary evidence that they lived together before that time. The parties admit they often lived apart between 2001 and 2004. As the IJ pointed out, even Acheampong and her own witnesses could not agree when the couple lived together before July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>of 2001. The best the couple could say is that they lived together \u201con and off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Merely living apart does not make the marriage a sham, but \u201cwe have on several occasions viewed evidence of an alien\u2019s living separately from his or her spouse as support for the conclusion that the marriage is not bona fide.\u201d <em>Ly v. Gonzales, </em>185 Fed.Appx. 451, 454-55 (6th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Bangura v. Hansen, </em>434 F.3d 487, 503 (6th Cir.2006) and <em>United States v. Kone, </em>307 F.3d 430, 434 (6th Cir.2002)). Sporadically living together is also evidence that a marriage is not bona fide. <em>Ayyoub, </em>93 Fed.Appx. 828, 833 (6th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Acheampong contends that <em>Bark </em>and <em>McKee </em>preclude the BIA from finding that her marriage was a sham simply because she did not live with her husband. Her contention is correct but irrelevant. The BIA did not reach its decision based on living arrangements alone, but on all of the evidence previously mentioned. <em>Bark </em>itself says that evidence of separation \u201cis relevant in ascertaining whether they intended to establish a life together when they exchanged marriage vows.\u201d <em>Bark, </em>511 F.2d at 1202; <em>see also McKee, </em>17 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 334 (\u201calthough separation in and of itself is no longer a valid basis for denial, ... it is a relevant factor in determining the parties\u2019 intent at the time of the marriage, i.e., whether the marriage is a sham.\u201d). The BIA correctly treated separation as relevant but not dispositive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Acheampong also cites <em>McKee, </em>arguing that the BIA may not deny her petition because it finds that her marriage is \u201cnot viable.\u201d <em>McKee, </em>17 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 333. But that is not what the BIA did. Viability deals with the ongoing status of a marriage and current relationship between the parties. Fraud looks to the intent of the parties when the marriage was formed. <em>See ibid. </em>Viability is irrelevant because the BIA found her marriage fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Finally, we note that this court has repeatedly affirmed BIA decisions finding a sham marriage on records similar to the one before us now. In <em>El-Hadi </em>we affirmed the BIA where there was no credible evidence of joint ownership of property, commingling of finances, or documentation that the parties entered the marriage in good faith. <em>El-Hadi, </em>1999 WL 825042, at *4. In <em>Ayyoub </em>we affirmed the BIA\u2019s finding where the parties often lived apart, the joint checking account showed no evidence of joint use, there was no joint property, and the parties knew little of each other. <em>Ayyoub, </em>93 Fed.Appx. at 833. The Seventh Circuit affirmed an IJ\u2019s finding that a marriage was not bona fide when, as with Acheampong, the couple told different stories about the marriage, had a short period of cohabitation, misrepresented their addresses, and could not show that they shared any assets or liabilities. <em>Nikrodhanondha v. Reno, </em>202 F.3d 922, 925 (7th Cir.2000). Most recently, we affirmed the BIA when the spouses gave different addresses on an immigration form and one spouse missed an immigration hearing. <em>See Ly, </em>185 Fed.Appx. at 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">Most of the facts in these cases are also present in Acheampong\u2019s case. As in <em>Ayyoub, </em>here the parties often lived apart, cannot provide basic information about each other, and the joint bank account shows no evidence of joint use. As in <em>El-Hadi, </em>here we see a lack of commingled finances and documentation. <em>Nikrodhanondha </em>is most on point because there, as here, the parties told different stories about the marriage, cohabited sporadically, gave different addresses, and could not show shared finances. Indeed, Acheampong presents an even stronger case for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>affirming the BIA, given the loan form listing the parties as single with separate addresses and the eight years of tax returns where Acheampong and Evans filed as separate \u201cHeads of Household\u201d from separate addresses. The BIA had substantial evidence for its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">We therefore AFFIRM the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b185-8\">. Acheampong also filed a claim under the Convention Against Torture. She based the asylum and the torture claim on three arrests She ultimately acknowledged that the political situation in Ghana had changed, admitted that she had returned to Ghana at least twice since she left, and withdrew her asylum claims at the February 9, 2005, hearing before the IJ.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b186-8\">. The irregularities were that Wells misled the couple at the 2001 interview about whether a prior investigation had been conducted on their marriage and that Wells told a trainee that he thought Acheampong was Nigerian and that Wells had prior experience with Nigerians and credit card fraud. Wells defended his statement about credit card fraud as giving the trainee more information for future cases and said it played no role in his decision about Acheampong. While we do not condone Wells\u2019s conduct, we see no way that it prejudiced the hearing before an independent IJ, especially given the BIA's minimal reliance on Wells's interview.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b186-13\">. Acheampong\u2019s brief alleges that the BIA wrongly altered this burden of proof by pointing out her \"failure to produce witnesses, other than her brother, who knew the couple when they first married,\u201d among six other persuasive facts that support the IJ\u2019s decision. However, listing a lack of witnesses <em>among other persuasive facts </em>does not amount to requiring Acheampong to produce witnesses in order to prevail or switching the burden of proof, and we reject her attempt to characterize it as such.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
