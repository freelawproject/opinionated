Nicholson, </em>No. 05-1258, 2006 WL 3895047 (Vet.App. Dec. 1, 2006). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">Mr. Dulin served on active duty in the United States Army from July 1961 to June 1964. His service medical records indicate no diagnosis or treatment for skin cancer or related symptoms during that time. In November 1995, Mr. Dulin filed a claim for service connection for skin cancer, which he contends was caused by sunburn suffered during his military service. The claim was denied by the Veterans Administration\u2019s (\u201cVA\u201d) regional office (\u201cRO\u201d) in June of 1996. In November 2000, Mr. Dulin sought to reopen his claim, but the RO again denied the claim. In July 2003, after Mr. Dulin submitted additional medical records, the Board remanded the claim to the RO to obtain a medical opinion regarding the potential nexus between Mr. Dulin\u2019s skin cancer and his military service.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-14\">Mr. Dulin was examined by Dr. Ronnie D. Rasberry, who stated that although sunburn can accelerate the onset of skin cancer, it is a person\u2019s cumulative lifetime sun exposure that triggers skin cancer, rather than a single set of events. Accordingly, Dr. Rasberry could not definitively conclude that Mr. Dulin\u2019s skin cancer was caused by sun exposure during his three years of military service, and he noted that the exact cause of Mr. Dulin\u2019s cancer \u201ccannot be resolved without speculation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-15\">In February 2005 the Board determined that Mr. Dulin\u2019s skin cancer was unrelated to his military service, and therefore denied his claim for service connection benefits. The Board emphasized medical evidence of risk factors beyond Mr. Dulin\u2019s service-related sun exposure and concluded that the weight of the evidence was against his claim. <em>In re Dulin, </em>No. 02-05 150 (Bd.Vet.App. Feb. 23, 2005). The Veterans Court subsequently affirmed the Board\u2019s decision. <em>Dulin, </em>2006 WL 3895047, at *4. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-17\">Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(c), this court has exclusive jurisdiction to \u201creview and decide any challenge to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof.\u201d Except for constitutional issues, we may not review any \u201cchallenge to a factual determination\u201d or any \u201cchallenge to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"AHq\">On appeal, Mr. Dulin asserts that the Veterans Court erroneously interpreted the term \u201cnegative evidence\u201d as found in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5107(b). Because Mr. Dulin challenges the Veterans Court\u2019s legal interpretation of a statute, we have jurisdiction under 38 U.S.C. 7292(c). This court reviews \u201cstatutory interpretation by the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims de novo.\u201d <em>Andrews v. Principi, </em>351 F.3d 1134, 1136 (Fed.Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">A claimant for veterans benefits is required to present evidence in support of his or her claim. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5107(a) (2000). The VA, in turn, has a duty to assist veterans in obtaining evidence necessary to support their claims. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 5103A. Evidence relating to a veteran\u2019s claim is subject to the \u201cbenefit of the doubt\u201d rule, codified at 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5107(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">The Secretary shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case before the Secretary with respect to benefits under laws administered by the Secretary. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIg\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5107(b). Under this provision, where the pertinent evidence is in relative equipoise, or \u201capproximate balance,\u201d a claimant enjoys the benefit of the doubt and his or her claim for service connection will be granted. However, where the preponderance of the evidence clearly weighs for or against the veteran\u2019s claim, i.e., where the positive and negative evidence are not in \u201capproximate balance,\u201d the benefit of the doubt rule has no application. <em>See Ortiz v. Principi, </em>274 F.3d 1361, 1365 (Fed.Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">According to Mr. Dulin, the Veterans Court misinterpreted 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5107(b) \u201cwhen it implicitly concluded that an inadequate record may constitute a preponderance of \u2018negative evidence.\u2019\u201d Mr. Dulin asks us to hold that, as used in Section 5107(b), the term \u201cnegative evidence\u201d cannot be interpreted to include \u201ca lack or absence of evidence.\u201d We understand Mr. Dulin to be arguing that, when determining whether there is \u201can approximate balance of positive and negative evidence\u201d under Section 5107(b) the Veterans Court may not consider as negative evidence the absence of evidence in favor of the veteran. In making this argument, Mr. Dulin relies upon the dissenting statement in <em>Forshey v. Principi, </em>that \u201c[t]he absence of actual evidence is not substantive \u2018negative evidence.\u2019\u201d 284 F.3d 1335, 1363 (Fed.Cir. 2002). Aside from the fact that dissenting opinions are not binding legal authority, the majority en banc in <em>Forshey </em>interpreted negative evidence to mean that \u201cwhich tends to disprove the existence of an alleged fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1358. The absence of evidence in support of an alleged fact clearly is an evidentiary circumstance that weighs against the existence of the alleged fact. In short, to the extent the Veterans Court viewed the lack of evidence in Mr. Dulin\u2019s favor as a circumstance amounting to negative evidence, it did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">In a related vein, Mr. Dulin argues that a veteran is entitled to disability benefits \u201cin the absence of evidence which negates entitlement to such benefits.\u201d This is simply incorrect. Under Section 5107(a), a veteran must adequately present and support his claim for government benefits. If a veteran fails to come forward with evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>dence in support of his or her claim, the claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Finally, Mr. Dulin argues that the Veterans Court and the Board erred in not applying the benefit of the doubt rule. This point requires little discussion. Aside from the fact that the argument turns on the application of law to fact, a matter beyond our jurisdiction, it is premised upon Mr. Dulin\u2019s view of what may constitute negative evidence under Section 5107(b). As we have explained, that view is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Veterans Court affirming the Board\u2019s denial of Mr. Dulin\u2019s claim for service connection for skin cancer is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
