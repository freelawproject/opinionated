BPA did not conduct a public proceeding for the development of these contracts and did not publish the accompanying Record of Decision in the <em>Federal Register. </em>In October 2003, in response to a FOIA request from <em>The Oregonian, </em>BPA produced the contracts with PacifiCorp and PSE and posted the documents on its website. Petitioners filed this suit within 90 days of BPA posting the contracts on its website. A more comprehensive explanation of the 2001 LRAs and BPA in general can be found in our opinion, <em>Pub. Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish County v. BPA </em>506 F.3d 1145 (9th Cir.2007), filed concurrently with this memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-23\">As an initial matter, we must determine whether we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal. Under the Northwest Power Act, we have \u201coriginal subject matter jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>tion over BPA\u2019s \u2018final actions and decisions\u2019 taken pursuant to the Act.\u201d <em>Portland Gen. Elec. v. BPA </em>501 F.3d 1009 (9th Cir.2007) (quoting 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 839f(e)(5)). We lack jurisdiction to adjudicate challenges to decisions taken by BPA that are not \u201cfinal actions\u201d or the implementation of a \u201cfinal action.\u201d <em>Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish County, </em>506 F.3d at 1151. There is no dispute that the 2001 LRAs are final agency actions under <em>Bennett v. Spear, </em>520 U.S. 154, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 137 L.Ed.2d 281 (1997); the question is whether Petitioner filed a timely challenge to the final action. Section 839f(e)(5) of Title 16 requires a petitioner to file suit \u201cwithin ninety days of the time such action or decision is deemed final, or, <em>if notice of the action is required by this chapter to be published in the Federal Register, within ninety days from such notice, </em>or be barred\u201d (emphasis added). If BPA was not required to publish the ROD in the <em>Federal Register, </em>then the petition is untimely. Thus, our authority to adjudicate the case depends on whether the Northwest Power Act required BPA to publish the ROD.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">We need not make this determination here, as we address the issue of the \u201clitigation penalty\u201d in <em>Pub. Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish County, </em>506 F.3d at 1154-55, filed concurrently with this memorandum. Because we have addressed the issue in our opinion and remanded to BPA for further proceedings, we dismiss the petition for review as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b846-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
