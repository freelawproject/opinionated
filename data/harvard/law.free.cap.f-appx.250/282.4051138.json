Although the district court\u2019s local rules require that \u201c[a] bill of costs must be filed by the prevailing party within thirty (80) days after the entry of judgment,\u201d N.D. Ga. R. 54.1, the district court found that the bill was timely filed by relying on its Local Rule 6.1. That rule provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-8\">For time periods greater than eleven (11) days, the three (8) day mail extension of [Fed.R.Civ.P.] 6(e) is added to the stated response time to create a lengthened time period. For example, a response time of thirty (80) days becomes a response time of thirty-three (33) days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">N.D. Ga. R. 6.1. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(e), in turn, gives parties an additional three days \u201c[wjhenever a party must or may act within a prescribed period after service,\u201d as long as service is made in certain ways that are not here relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">On appeal, Pope contends that the district court misinterpreted Local Rule 6.1. She emphasizes that the three-day extension provided under Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(e) and referenced in Local Rule 6.1 applies only to time periods in which \u201ca party must or may act within a prescribed period after service.\u201d And since the thirty-day time period for filing a bill of costs is a period that begins to run \u201cafter the <em>entry of judgment,\u201d </em>N.D. Ga. R. 54.1 (emphasis added), the three-day extension is unavailable. In other words, she says, since judgments are not subject to \u201cservice,\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 6(e) and (accordingly) Local Rule 6.1 do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">Pope\u2019s interpretation of these rules seems reasonable to us, and it may even be the interpretation we would follow were we to decide the issue in the first instance. <em>See, e.g., Cavaliere v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>996 F.2d 1111, 1113-14 (11th Cir.1993) (holding that the three-day grace period in Fed. R.Civ.P. 6(e) does not apply to motions for a new trial under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59, in part because the time period for filing those motions begins to run from \u201centry of judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">The problem with her argument, however, is that it doesn\u2019t explain why the district court\u2019s reading of Local Rule 6.1 is unreasonable. By its terms, that rule applies to \u201ctime periods greater than eleven (11) days.\u201d The district court very well could have read that phrase to mean <em>all </em>\u201ctime periods greater than eleven (11) days.\u201d The rule\u2019s grant of extensions to \u201cresponse time[s]\u201d is similarly subject to multiple, reasonable interpretations. Although one plausibly could read that phrase as referring only to time periods triggered by some sort of service, we think the district court also could have reasonably read it as referring to any time period within which a party must act.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-14\">All these details aside, we must remember that we are to give \u201cgreat deference to a district court\u2019s interpretation of its local rules.\u201d <em>Clark v. Housing Authority, </em>971 F.2d 723, 727 (11th Cir.1992). \u201cA district court is the best judge of its own rules,\u201d <em>id. </em>(citing <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. v. Lawrenson, </em>334 F.2d 464, 467 (4th Cir.1964) (internal quotation marks omitted)), and all that is required is that the interpretation be reasonable, <em>see id. </em>at 728. Because that is the case here, we must affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
