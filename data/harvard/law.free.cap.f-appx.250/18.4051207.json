The district court dismissed Newton\u2019s claim for failing to exhaust administrative remedies. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b45-17\">Newton was a Business Development Manager at Securitas in Dallas. In November 2003, Newton alleges that her immediate supervisor, John Williams, sexually harassed her. On January 6, 2004, Newton reported the harassment to the Senior Branch Manager. Securitas investigated Newton\u2019s claim, which led to the termination of Williams\u2019s employment. Then, in summer 2004, Securitas placed Newton on probation for poor sales performance. Newton received written notice from Securitas on November 1, 2004, stating that her employment would be terminated effective November 15, 2004, because her sales performance had not improved.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-18\">Newton filed a precharge questionnaire with the EEOC on September 6, 2005, and then filed a charge on February 27, 2006. The EEOC notified Newton on June 13, 2006, that her charge was untimely and, therefore, the EEOC was dismissing it. Newton filed her present Title VII claim on September 6, 2006, alleging she was fired in retaliation for reporting William\u2019s sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-19\">On Securitas\u2019s summary judgment motion, the district court dismissed Newton\u2019s claim, holding that the 300 day limitations period began to run on the date she re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>ceived the notice of termination \u2014 November 1 \u2014 and not on the date that her employment actually ended \u2014 November 15. Thus, the limitations period in which Newton had to file a charge with the EEOC expired on August 28, 2005 \u2014 and Newton filed nothing with the EEOC until September 6. Because Newton failed to timely file with the EEOC, the district court dismissed her Title VII claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">The court held in the alternative that even if the limitations period ran from November 15, Newton\u2019s claim was still untimely as the precharge questionnaire filed on September 6 was insufficient to meet 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\u2019s charge requirement. Newton did not file her actual charge with the EEOC until February 27, 2006, which was more than 300 days after November 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\u201cThis court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the trial court. Summary judgment is proper if the evidence shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The Court views all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draws all reasonable inferences in that party\u2019s favor.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Section 2000e-5(e)(l) \u201cis a charge filing provision that \u2018specifies with precision\u2019 the prerequisites that a plaintiff must satisfy before filing suit.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The section requires that the plaintiff \u201cmust file a charge within the statute time period.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cIn a state that, like Texas, provides a state or local administrative mechanism to address complaints of employment discrimination, a title VII plaintiff must file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC within 300 days after learning of the conduct alleged.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-17\">Newton contends that the district court erred in treating her claim as a \u201ctraditional\u201d retaliation claim and that her claim is better analogized to a \u201chostile work environment claim\u201d and subject to the \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d doctrine. As evidence of a \u201ccontinuing violation,\u201d Newton submitted an affidavit alleging that her two final pay checks were incorrect; that she was not paid her final commissions for the period ending thirty days from the date of her termination as provided in her employment agreement; that others similarly situated were taken off probation; and that an internal memorandum dated 5 May 2005 showed that Securitas was still trying to \u201cjustify\u201d her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-18\">Newton\u2019s arguments do not persuade. Her complaint only alleges termination as the discriminatory conduct. As the Supreme Court has explained, termination is a \u201cdiscrete act,\u201d and \u201cdiscrete discriminatory acts are not actionable if time barred, even when they are related to acts alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>in timely filed charges.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cA discrete retaliatory or discriminatory act \u2018occurred\u2019 on the day that it \u2018happened.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here, that day was when Newton received written notice of her termination:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cThe operative date from which the ... filing period begins to run is \u2018the date of note of termination, rather than the final date of employment.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">As we have previously explained, the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Morgan </em>makes clear that the continuing violations doctrine does not apply to discrete acts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As the Court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">The Court of Appeals applied the continuing violations doctrine to what it termed \u201cserial violations,\u201d holding that so long as one act falls within the charge filing period, discriminatory and retaliatory acts that are plausibly or sufficiently related to that act may also be considered for the purposes of liability. With respect to this holding, therefore, we reverse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">Discrete acts such as termination, failure to promote, denial of transfer, or refusal to hire are easy to identify. Each incident of discrimination and each retaliatory adverse employment decision constitutes a separate actionable \u201cunlawful employment practice.\u201d Morgan can only file a charge to cover discrete acts that \u201coccurred\u201d within the appropriate time period.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-13\">Newton\u2019s complaint did not raise a hostile workplace claim, and therefore we do not consider how, under <em>Morgan, </em>a \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d would there apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-14\">As the district court properly concluded Newton\u2019s filings with the EEOC were untimely,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b45-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
