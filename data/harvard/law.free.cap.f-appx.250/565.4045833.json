He was determined to be an armed career criminal and sentenced to 230 months\u2019 imprisonment. His counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there were no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising for the court\u2019s consideration whether Jones\u2019 rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments were violated because his statutory sentence was increased based on prior convictions not in the indictment or proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Jones was given the opportunity to file a pro se supplemental brief, but declined. The Government did not file a brief. After reviewing the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-23\">Jones did not dispute the fact of his prior convictions, and the fact of a prior conviction need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 233-36, 243-44, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 351-54 (4th Cir.) (reaffirming continuing validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>after <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number><em>States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)). Thus, the district court was not required to make any factual findings concerning Jones\u2019 pri- or criminal record, but could rely on \u201cthe conclusive significance\u201d of his record, <em>see Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 25, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), as set out in the presentence report. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 285 (4th Cir.2005) (sentencing judge entitled to rely on undisputed information in presentence report that \u201cbears the earmarks of derivation from <em>Shepard-approved </em>sources such as the indictments and state-court judgments from [defendant\u2019s] prior convictions\u201d). Therefore, we find the district court did not violate Jones\u2019 constitutional rights when it considered his prior convictions in determining his statutory sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Jones\u2019 conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Jones, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Jones requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
