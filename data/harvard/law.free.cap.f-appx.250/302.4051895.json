Rose (\u201cRose\u201d) appeals from a final judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans Court\u201d), affirming a decision by the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) that denied entitlement to service connection for acquired immune deficiency syndrome and associated psychosis, claimed as human immunodefiency virus. <em>Rose v. Nicholson, </em>No. 04-2121, 2006 WL 3888224 (Vet.App. Nov. 22, 2006). Because Rose\u2019s arguments on appeal relate to issues over which we do not have jurisdiction, <em>see </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, we <em>dismiss.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">This court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear appeals from the Veterans Court is strictly limited to questions of law; we have no jurisdiction to review \u201c(A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292. Although Rose contends that the Veterans Court\u2019s decision involved the validity or interpretation of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1219, that statute governs the validity of signed statements relating to the origin, incurrence, or aggravation of a disease or injury. Neither that statute nor the type of statements it covers were presented to, addressed by, or relied upon by the Board or the Veterans Court. Rather, the \u201cstatements\u201d that Rose points to as violative of section 1219 were actually the arguments that Rose presented to the agency in an effort to establish that his disability was contracted while serving with the Army National Guard in May 1992. Because the Veterans Court\u2019s decision did not involve the validity or interpretation of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1219, Rose\u2019s arguments based on that statute are not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">Rose\u2019s remaining arguments all relate to error in the Board\u2019s finding that there was no service connection. Such arguments are directed to factual determinations and the application of law to facts \u2014 issues that exceed the scope of our jurisdiction. Accordingly, because Rose fails to present an issue over which we have jurisdiction, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
