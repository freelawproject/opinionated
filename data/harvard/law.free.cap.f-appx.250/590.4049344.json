Sadhvani, a native and citizen of Togo, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) vacating its previous grant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Sadhvani\u2019s motion to reopen and considering the motion as withdrawn in light of his removal from the United States. In rendering its decision, the Board relied on 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1008.2(d) (2007), which provides that \u201c[a]ny departure from the United States, including the deportation or removal of a person who is the subject of exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings, occurring after the filing of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider, shall constitute a withdrawal of such motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">We recently found this regulation to be invalid in <em>William v. Gonzales, </em>499 F.3d 329 (4th Cir.2007). Accordingly, we grant the petition for review and remand to the Board for further proceedings in light of our holding in <em>William. </em>We grant Sadhvani\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">\n<em>PETITION GRANTED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
