Both defendants were convicted of one count of RICO conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(d), and one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine base, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Defendant Carlos Lopez argues that the district court erred in applying the Guideline provision for the federal offense of first-degree murder, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A1.1, because the jury was not asked to find premeditation when convicting him for the RICO conspiracy that involved the racketeering activity of second-degree murder under New York state law. This argument fails under <em>United States v. Minicone, </em>960 F.2d 1099 (2d Cir.1992), and its progeny. When the underlying conduct in a RICO conspiracy violates state law, the Guidelines require the district judge to apply the \u201coffense level corresponding to the most analogous federal offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2E1.1 cmt. n. 2; <em>see also Minicone, </em>960 F.2d at 1110. <em>Minicone </em>upheld the district court\u2019s determination that \u201cthe most analogous federal offense [to the New York offense of second degree murder] was first degree murder under [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1111.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Carr, </em>424 F.3d 213, 231 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">Defendants argue that retroactive application of the remedial holding in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), to their sentencing violates due process and the <em>ex post facto </em>clause because they did not have fair warning of the potential penalties they faced. <em>See United States v. Vaughn, </em>430 F.3d 518, 524 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that retroactive application of BookeVs remedial holding on direct appeal does not violate <em>ex post facto </em>principles inherent in the Due Process Clause when defendants had \u201cfan* warning that their conduct was criminal, ... [and] fair warning of the potential penalties they faced\u201d for that conduct); <em>see also United States v. Fairclough, </em>439 F.3d 76, 78-79 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam) (applying <em>Vaughn </em>to district court sentencing). Carlos Lopez contends that he did not have fair warning that he could be sentenced under the First Degree Murder Guideline because this Court did not decide <em>Minicone </em>until 1992, after he committed the second-degree murder offense. Nonetheless, the Guidelines at the time of Carlos Lopez\u2019s crime stated that the sentencing court would apply the offense level for the \u201cmost analogous federal offense,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2E1.1, and that the First Degree Murder Guideline could apply not only to premeditated killing, but also \u201cwhen death results from the commission of certain felonies.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 663 (amending U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A1.1 and stating previous language). Rafael Lopez argues that he did not receive fair warning because the amount of drugs the jury found would have resulted in a Guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>lines range of 151-188 months. Without addressing whether Rafael Lopez\u2019s calculation is correct, this argument ignores our holding in <em>Vaughn </em>that the relevant statutory maximum is sufficient to provide a defendant fair warning of the potential penalties he faces. <em>See Vaughn, </em>430 F.3d at 524. Carlos and Rafael Lopez received fair warning under the applicable statutes in this case. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963(a) (prescribing, for violation of \u00a7 1962, a maximum penalty of 20 years or \u201clife if the violation is based on a racketeering activity for which the maximum penalty includes life imprisonment\u201d); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) (prescribing a sentence of \u201cnot ... less than 10 years or more than life\u201d for violation of \u00a7 841(a)); \u00a7 846 (same for conspiracy). Finally, Defendants\u2019 argument that <em>Booker\u2019s </em>construction of the Sentencing Reform Act to include a \u201csavings clause\u201d constitutes a \u201clegislative adjustment\u201d does not alter our <em>ex post facto </em>analysis. <em>See Rogers v. Tennessee, </em>532 U.S. 451, 461, 121 S.Ct. 1693, 149 L.Ed.2d 697 (2001) (holding that <em>ex post facto </em>analysis of judicial decisions must be conducted under the Due Process Clause and that retroactive application of judicial interpretation does not\u2019 violate due process unless the change was \u201c \u2018unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Bouie v. City of Columbia, </em>378 U.S. 347, 354, 84 S.Ct. 1697, 12 L.Ed.2d 894 (1964))); <em>see also Vaughn, </em>430 F.3d at 524. Sentencing a defendant to the maximum penalty he could face under an applicable statute governing the conduct at issue is not so \u201cunexpected and indefensible\u201d as to violate due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Both Carlos and Rafael Lopez argue that their sentences for life imprisonment and 360 months\u2019 imprisonment, respectively, are unreasonable. We review a district judge\u2019s Guidelines sentence; for reasonableness, <em>see United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 26 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261-62, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)), without presuming that it is so, <em>cf. Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Our \u201c[rjeasonableness review does not entail the substitution of our judgment for that of the sentencing judge. Rather, the standard is akin to review for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 27. The district court sentenced Carlos Lopez to life imprisonment, the maximum within the applicable Guidelines range, based on \u201cthe facts adduced at trial \u2014 particularly the chilling evidence of the murder of Edward Montalvo.\u201d Our reversal of Carlos Lopez\u2019s obstruction of justice murder conviction for failure to produce sufficient evidence of the requisite federal nexus does not disturb the jury\u2019s fact-finding on the second-degree murder offense as part of the racketeering activity. With respect to Rafael Lopez, the district court modified the sentence from life imprisonment to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment, based on a review of the factors under \u00a7 3553(a), including the seriousness of the offense and Rafael Lopez\u2019s criminal history. Neither Carlos nor Rafael Lopez has met his burden of showing that Judge Gleeson \u201cexceeded the bounds of allowable discretion[,] ... committed an error of law in the course of exercising discretion, or made a clearly erroneous finding of fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>475 F.3d 468, 474 (2d Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration and omission in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Rafael Lopez also challenges the district court\u2019s understanding that computation of his sentence would commence on November 11, 2002. The district court committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>no error because, as Judge Gleesoris order implicitly recognizes, \u201c[t]he Bureau of Prisons, and not the courts, determines when a defendant\u2019s sentence starts and whether the defendant should receive credit for any prior time spent in custody.\u201d <em>United States v. Montez-Gaviria, </em>163 F.3d 697, 700-01 (2d Cir.1998); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585 (addressing when a sentence commences and when a defendant should receive credit for time in custody).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Carlos and Rafael\u2019s remaining arguments are foreclosed because they were previously considered and rejected by this Court on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>100 Fed.Appx. 32 (2d Cir.2004) (summary order) (rejecting, <em>inter alia, </em>arguments that (i) the jury instructions constructively amended the indictment; (ii) the government impermissibly vouched for the credibility of witnesses; (iii) predicate acts charged in RICO conspiracy were multiplicitous; and (iv) the district court impermissibly found that racketeering activity 3 in Count I of the indictment charged a narcotics conspiracy involving 50 grams or more of cocaine base).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\">. Carlos Lopez was also convicted of obstruction of justice murder under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(a)(1)(C), but an earlier panel of this Court overturned that conviction on appeal. See <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>372 F.3d 86 (2d Cir.2004), <em>vacated for reconsideration in tight of Booker by </em>544 U.S. 902, 125 S.Ct. 1613, 161 L.Ed.2d 273 (2005) (mem.).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
