Rule 50(b) and 59 motions; and the September 29, 2006 order again denying Maersk\u2019s F.R.C.P. Rule 50(b) and 59 motions which were renewed after the entry of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">Defendant-Appellant makes two arguments: first, that the district court erred in denying Maersk\u2019s motion for summary judgment and its subsequent motions for judgment as a matter of law; and second, that the district court erred in its jury instructions. First, we review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b). <em>See Bronx Household of Faith v. Bd. of Educ., </em>492 F.3d 89 (2d Cir.2007); <em>Armstrong v. Brookdale Univ. Hosp. &amp; Med. Ctr., </em>425 F.3d 126, 133 (2d Cir.2005). In so doing, we apply the \u201csame standard as the district court itself was required to apply.\u201d <em>Diesel v. Town of Lewisboro, </em>232 F.3d 92, 103 (2d. Cir.2000). Specifically, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, giving that party the benefit of all reasonable inferences that the jury might have drawn in its favor. <em>See id. </em>(noting that reviewing court cannot itself \u201cassess the weight of conflicting evidence, pass on the credibility of witnesses, or substitute [its] judgment for that of the jury\u201d). On such a deferential review of the record, we will reverse the denial of a disappointed litigant\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law \u201conly if there is such a complete absence of evidence supporting the verdict that the jury\u2019s findings could only have been the result of sheer surmise and conjecture, or such an overwhelming amount of evidence in favor of the movant that reasonable and fair minded men could not arrive at a verdict against [the moving party].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>LeBlanc-Sternberg v. Fletcher, </em>67 F.3d 412, 429 (2d Cir.1995) (alteration in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">The Second Circuit reviews, de novo, a district court\u2019s findings with respect to the existence of negligence. <em>Payne v. United States, </em>359 F.3d 132 (2d Cir.2004). However, in negligence cases, the Second Circuit\u2019s gives deference to the trial court, and the factfinding body. As the Second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Circuit explained in 2004 in <em>Payne, </em>359 F.3d at 137:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">[T]he question of the existence of negligence \u2014 of the \u201cought,\u201d so to speak \u2014 has become primarily one for the factfinder to determine on the basis of the specific and complex events of each individual case.... As such, the issue today is only very rarely whether the trial court has applied the correct <em>legal </em>standard. For under present law, such standards are, in New York as elsewhere, unlikely to be determinative. And the primary responsibility inevitably falls, instead, on the factfinder \u2014 whether it be court or jury \u2014 to assess what, in the circumstances, is appropriate conduct; what the \u201creasonable person\u201d ought to have done....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">... We have held, for example, that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s finding should ordinarily stand unless the court manifests an incorrect conception of the applicable law.\u201d <em>Esso Standard Oil, S.A. v. S.S. Gasbras Sul, </em>387 F.2d 573, 580 (2d Cir. 1967) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have suggested that the rule only applies to cases \u201cwhere contrary decisions rest on <em>exactly the same set of facts.\u201d Dinnerstein v. United States, </em>486 F.2d 34, 37 n. 2 (2d Cir.1973) (internal quotation marks omitted)(emphasis added). And in a few cases, we have failed to apply the rule at all, upholding district courts\u2019 determinations of negligence after declaring that we could not find them \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Matthews v. CTI Container Transport Int'l, Inc., </em>871 F.2d 270, 280 (2d Cir. 1989).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">With these standards in mind, the district court did not err in denying Maersk\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law. The issue of duty is not easily separated from the issues of forseeability and risk of harm, rather \u201c[t]he New York Court of Appeals has expressed its inclination to correlate the duty of care owed to a plaintiff with the risk of harm reasonably to be perceived ... and concurrently consider the question of forseeability.\u201d <em>Michalski v. Home Depot, Inc., </em>225 F.3d 113, 121 (2d Cir.2000)(quoting <em>Basso v. Miller, </em>40 N.Y.2d 233, 241, 386 N.Y.S.2d 564, 352 N.E.2d 868 (N.Y.1976)). In this way, it cannot be argued that the district court erred in determining that questions pertaining to whether Maersk discharged its duty to the plaintiffs through its actions, and whether the plaintiffs were engaged in repairs so as to warrant application of the repair doctrine, were issues to be resolved by the jury, and not by the court on a motion for a judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">Second, Maersk argues that the district court erred in its jury instructions. When a proper objection is made below to preserve the issue for our consideration, we review claims of error in jury instructions de novo. <em>Gordon v. New York City Bd. of Educ., </em>232 F.3d 111, 116 (2d Cir.2000); <em>see LNC Invs., Inc. v. First Fidelity Bank, </em>173 F.3d 454, 460 (2d Cir.1999). A defendant who challenges a jury instruction must establish that he requested an instruction that \u201caccurately represented the law in every respect.\u201d <em>United States v. Yousef, </em>327 F.3d 56, 130 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cA jury instruction is erroneous if it misleads the jury as to the correct legal standard or does not adequately inform the jury on the law.\u201d <em>LNC Invs., Inc., </em>173 F.3d at 454 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cAn erroneous instruction requires a new trial unless the error is harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An error is harmless only if the court is convinced that the error did not influence the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See id. </em>at 462. However, a trial court has considerable discretion in the formulation and style of jury instructions. <em>See Parker v. Sony Pictures Entm\u2019t, Inc., </em>260 F.3d 100, 106 (2d Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>2001). Thus, a new trial is only warranted if, taken as a whole, the jury instructions gave a misleading impression or inadequate understanding of the law. <em>Plagianos v. American Airlines, </em>912 F.2d 57, 59 (2d Cir.1990). In this case, the district court\u2019s jury instructions did not give a misleading impression or inadequate understanding of the law and thus were not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment imposed by the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
