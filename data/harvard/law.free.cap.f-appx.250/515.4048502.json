Mercado argues that his conviction for \u201cendangering the welfare of a child\u201d under N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:24-4(a) does not constitute \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d We disagree. Accordingly, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-16\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b542-17\">We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a), as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231. <em>See Stubbs v. Attorney Gen., </em>452 F.3d 251, 253 n. 4 (3d Cir.2006). Further, \u201cwe have always had jurisdiction to determine our own jurisdiction by engaging in an analysis of whether an alien was convicted of a non-reviewable aggravated felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review <em>de novo </em>the legal question of whether Mercado\u2019s offense is an aggravated felony. <em>Id. </em>Because we write primarily for the benefit of the parties, we will forgo a lengthy recitation of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-18\">Mercado was admitted to the United States in 1992 as a lawful permanent resident. In 1996, Mercado pled guilty in New Jersey Superior Court to a charge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Endangering the Welfare of a Child in the Third Degree, in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:24-4(a), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">Any person having a legal duty for the care of a child or who has assumed responsibility for the care of a child who engages in sexual conduct which would impair or debauch the morals of the child, or who causes the child harm that would make the child an abused or neglected child as defined in R.S. 9:6-1, R.S. 9:6-3 and P.L.1974, c. 119, \u00a7 1 (C. 9:6-8.21) is guilty of a crime of the second degree. Any other person who engages in conduct or who causes harm as described in this subsection to a child under the age of 16 is guilty of a crime of the third degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">N.J.S.A. \u00a7 2C:24-4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">On September 29, 2004, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency served Mercado with a notice to appear, charging him as removable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony: sexual abuse of a minor. Mercado did not dispute the factual allegations, but objected to the charge that he had been convicted of an aggravated felony. After several hearings before an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), the IJ issued a seven-page decision finding that Mercado\u2019s conviction under N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:24-4(a) constituted an aggravated felony. As such, Mercado was ordered removed. Mercado appealed the decision to the BIA, and on May 12, 2006, the Board affirmed. Mercado then filed a timely appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">On June 29, 2006, after the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s removal order in this case, but before appellate briefing began, our Court had occasion to address the very question now before it: Does a conviction for \u201cendangering the welfare of a child\u201d under N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:24-4(a) constitute \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d and thus an aggravated felony under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d)? In <em>Stubbs v. Attorney General, </em>452 F.3d 251, 256 (3d Cir.2006), we held that \u2014 based on the record before us \u2014 the petitioner\u2019s conviction did not constitute an aggravated felony for INA purposes. Based on the record before us in <em>this </em>case, however, <em>Stubbs </em>compels the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">In <em>Stubbs, </em>we reviewed the text of N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:24-4(a), determined that the statute is divisible, and concluded that it was therefore appropriate to consider the particular facts underlying the petitioner\u2019s conviction in assessing whether he had been convicted of an aggravated felony. Section 2C:24-4(a) \u201cprovides for conviction of a person who either (a) \u2018engages in sexual conduct which would impair or debauch the morals of the child\u2019 or (b) \u2018causes the child harm that would make the child an abused or neglected child as defined in [state protective-welfare statutes].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 254. Looking to the charging instrument in <em>Stubbs, </em>we first found that the petitioner had been convicted under the prong of section 2C:24-4 that prohibits \u201cengaging] in sexual conduct which would impair or debauch the morals of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255. We then examined the record for evidence that the petitioner\u2019s conduct constituted \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d as defined by the BIA,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and found none. <em>Id. </em>The charging instrument tracked the language of the statute of conviction and stated only that the petitioner was charged with \u201cengaging] in sexual conduct which would impair or debauch the morals of a child under the age of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>sixteen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We concluded that this was not enough:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-4\">The BIA\u2019s definition of \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d requires that a past act with a child actually occurred, while the New Jersey statute of conviction does not necessarily require that an act with a child took place. Under \u00a7 3509(a)(8), a conviction will lie only when there has been, for example, coercion or enticement of a child. In contrast to the New Jersey statute, it is not enough under \u00a7 3509(a)(8) that a person engaged in conduct that <em>would </em>coerce or entice a child (whatever that means); the enticement or coercion must have occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQ2\"><em>Id. </em>at 256. Thus, we \u201cc[ould] not say with assuredness\u201d that the petitioner\u2019s conviction under section 2C:24-4(a) constituted \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d as defined by the BIA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">In this case, however, we <em>can </em>say with assuredness that Mercado\u2019s conviction constituted \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d Looking to the charging instrument, plea colloquy, and \u201cexplicit factual findings by the trial judge\u201d \u2014 as we are permitted to do under, <em>inter alia, Alaka v. Attorney General, </em>456 F.3d 88, 106 (3d Cir.2006) \u2014 it is clear that Mercado had sexual intercourse with a minor and thus, did \u201cuse ... a child to engage in ... sexually explicit conduct.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3509(a)(8); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3509(a)(9)(A) (defining \u201csexually explicit conduct\u201d to include, <em>inter alia, </em>actual or simulated intercourse).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">First, Mercado\u2019s indictment states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">\n<em>Count Two:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-10\">The Grand Jurors of the State of New Jersey, for the County of Middlesex, upon their oaths, present that ALBERTO MERCADO, between May 1, 1995 and July 23, 1995, in the township of Woodbridge, in the County of Middle-sex, aforesaid, and within the jurisdiction of this Court, did engage in sexual conduct which would impair or debauch the morals of a child under the age of 16, to wit: M.F. born July 24, 1979; contrary to the provisions of N.J.S.A. [\u00a7 ]2C:24:4a and against the peace of this state, the Government and dignity of the same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">(App. 7 (emphasis added) (quoting Indictment).) Mercado pled guilty to this count and was thus convicted of the prong of section 2C:24-4(a) directed at persons who \u201cengage in sexual conduct which would impair or debauch the morals of a child under the age of 16\u201d \u2014 the very same prong under which the petitioner in <em>Stubbs </em>was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">Looking next to the plea colloquy, we see that Mercado admitted that the victim of the offense was under 16, and that he had engaged in sexual relations with her.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">Finally, at Mercado\u2019s sentencing hearing, the trial court made a factual finding that Mercado had \u201cconsensual sex\u201d with the child victim on numerous occasions and that the victim became pregnant as a result of that sexual activity. (A.R.175.) This finding was further reflected in the court\u2019s Judgment of Conviction. (A.R.271.)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Thus, the charging document reflects that Mercado pled guilty to \u201cengag[ing] in sexual conduct which would impair or debauch the morals of a child under the age of 16\u201d; the plea colloquy reflects that Mercado and the child had intercourse; and the trial judge made an \u201cexplicit factual finding\u201d that Mercado and the child had consensual sex on more than one occasion, resulting in a pregnancy. It is clear that Mercado engaged in \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). Accordingly, his petition must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will DENY the Petition for Review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b542-11\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) states that \"no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section ... 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) [aggravated felony].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b543-10\">. \u201cIn <em>[Matter of Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>22 I. &amp; N.
