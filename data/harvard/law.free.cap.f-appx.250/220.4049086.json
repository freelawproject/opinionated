Zurita-Vasquez conceded below, and the IJ found, that a 2002 forgery conviction renders him removable as an aggravated felon pursuant to INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(R). The IJ further found Zurita-Vasquez ineligible 'for any form of discretionary relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-20\">1. We have jurisdiction to review a finding of statutory ineligibility for discretionary relief, <em>Moran v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1089, 1091 (9th Cir.2005), but Zurita-Vas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>quez is not eligible for any of the discretionary relief he seeks. His argument that he is eligible to apply for cancellation of removal is unavailing, as the statute plainly excludes aliens who have been \u201cconvicted of any aggravated felony.\u201d INA \u00a7 240A(a)(3). His argument that he is eligible to apply for a waiver under former INA \u00a7 212(c) for a 1991 conviction also fails, as the 1991 conviction was not the ground on which he was found removable.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">2. Zurita-Vasquez also challenges the IJ\u2019s failure to grant a continuance so that he could file a motion in California Superi- or Court to vacate his 2002 forgery conviction. As he presents no constitutional claims or questions of law with respect to this issue, however, we lack jurisdiction to review the decision. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">3. One week before oral argument, Zurita-Vasquez moved to remand the case to the BIA because the vacatur of two California Superior Court orders sentencing him for probation violations allegedly reduced his sentence for the forgery conviction to less than one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The proper vehicle for introducing new evidence is by motion to the BIA to reopen removal proceedings, a step that ZuritaVasquez has not taken. Although such a motion may now be untimely, see 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), Zurita-Vasquez could seek the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s joinder in the motion or could ask the BIA to reopen the case <em>succ sponte. See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a), (c)(3)(iii). As this Court\u2019s review is limited to the administrative record, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A), we cannot consider the new evidence submitted with the motion. The motion to remand is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">Petition for review DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b246-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
