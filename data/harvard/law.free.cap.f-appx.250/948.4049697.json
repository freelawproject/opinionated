We affirm Rincon\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-25\">Rincon asserts the district court erred in denying him a minor-role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). Rincon contends the court failed to compare his conduct to the conduct of his co-conspirators. Rincon asserts he was clearly less culpable than the other participants because he had no independent knowledge of the conspiracy details and his only function was to introduce the confidential source (CS) to a co-conspirator, Pompilio Gutierrez, for a small fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>\u201cThis Court has long and repeatedly-held that a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). The defendant, as the proponent of the downward adjustment, bears the burden of proving the mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">The Sentencing Guidelines permit a court to decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two points if it finds the defendant was a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the criminal activity. U.S.S.G \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A minor participant is a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.5). In determining whether a minor-role reduction is warranted, a district court \u201cshould be informed by two principles discerned from the Guidelines.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940. Under the first prong, which may be dispositive in many cases, \u201cthe district court must measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which [he] was held accountable at sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. Relevant conduct is the \u201cconduct attributed to the defendant in calculating [his] base offense level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941. Under the second prong, \u201cthe district court may also measure the defendant\u2019s role against the other participants, to the extent that they are discernable, in that relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. A defendant, however, \u201cis not automatically entitled to a minor role adjustment merely because [he] was somewhat less culpable than the other discernable participants. Rather, the district court must determine that the defendant was less culpable than <em>most other participants </em>in [the] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">Rincon did not satisfy the first prong because his actual conduct, a substantial role in a conspiracy to import ten kilograms of cocaine into the United States, was identical to the relevant conduct for which he was sentenced. Because Rincon was only held accountable for the drugs that were imported due to his personal conduct, \u201c[the] district court [could] legitimately conclude that [Rincon] played an important or essential role in the importation of those drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">As to the second prong, Rincon\u2019s argument the district court erred by failing to compare his conduct to the other participants\u2019 conduct is not supported by the record. Although at the sentencing hearing the district court did not make specific findings comparing Rincon\u2019s conduct to that of Gutierrez, the court did state it had \u201cdiscussed the matter with the probation officer, and [agreed] with the probation officer\u2019s conclusion.\u201d In his conclusion, the probation officer included both an assessment of Rincon\u2019s conduct and a comparison between Rincon\u2019s and Gutierrez\u2019s roles. The probation officer determined that Rincon and Gutierrez had similar roles because they \u201cwere both contacts the CS spoke with on a regular basis regarding the cocaine shipment [and t]hey both had knowledge of details regarding the manner in which the cocaine would be smuggled, as well as when and where.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">In contrast to Rincon\u2019s argument, he had a larger role in the conspiracy than just recruiting the CS. He also remained in contact with both the CS and Gutierrez regarding the cocaine shipment, participated in conversations planning the smuggling of the drugs, relayed information to the CS to further the smuggling operation, and arranged to receive $2,500 in exchange for introducing the CS to Gutierrez. Although each participant had different roles in the conspiracy, these differences do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>indicate that either co-conspirator was more culpable than Rincon. We have recognized that it is entirely possible for conspiracies to exist where no co-conspirator\u2019s conduct warrants an adjustment for role in the offense. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">We conclude the district court did not clearly err in denying Rincon a minor-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
