Maranga subsequently applied for asylum, withholding of removal, protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), and voluntary departure. The immigration judge (\u201cthe IJ\u201d) denied all four applications and held that Maranga\u2019s asylum application was frivolous. The Board of Immigration Appeals adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. Maranga now petitions this court for review of that decision. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-23\">The IJ denied asylum relief to Maranga because she failed to file her asylum application within one year of her arrival in the United States. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). We lack jurisdiction to review this finding of untimeliness. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Yakovenko v. Gonzales, 477 </em>F.3d 631, 635 (8th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-24\">The IJ denied withholding of removal, and Maranga failed to address this issue in her brief. We are unable to review her withholding claim because she abandoned the issue. <em>See Hacker v. Barnhart, </em>459 F.3d 934, 937 n. 2 (8th Cir.2006) (\u201cA party\u2019s failure to raise or discuss an issue in his brief is to be deemed an abandonment of that issue.\u201d) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-25\">The IJ denied protection under CAT to Maranga and held that Maranga\u2019s asylum application was frivolous. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>\u00a7 1158(d)(6) (providing that if an applicant \u201cknowingly made a frivolous application\u201d and received notice of the consequences of such an application, the applicant is permanently ineligible for immigration benefits). Maranga failed to appeal these decisions to the Board. We are unable to review the denial of relief under CAT or the finding of frivolousness because she failed to exhaust administrative remedies by not raising these issues before the Board. <em>Frango v. Gonzales, </em>437 F.3d 726, 728 (8th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">For these reasons, the petition for review is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
