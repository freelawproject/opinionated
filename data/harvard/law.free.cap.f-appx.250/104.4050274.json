Fields\u2019 60 month sentence included an upward departure from criminal history category VI pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. Fields argues that the district court failed to clearly articulate the reasons in support of its upward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-14\">Pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court ultimately reviews sentences for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 706 (5th Cir.2006). An upward departure from an advisory guideline sentence is normally reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006). Because Fields did not object to the district court\u2019s lack of reasons for the departure, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Gracia-Cantu, </em>302 F.3d 308, 310 (5th Cir.2002). Regardless whether this court applies the abuse of discretion or the plain error standard of review, Fields cannot establish that the district court committed reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-15\">The district court indicated at sentencing that it was basing its decision to upwardly depart based upon the information contained in the presentence investigation report (PSR), which indicated that Fields\u2019 criminal history category substantially under represented his prior offenses or the likelihood that he would commit other crimes in the future. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a). The court\u2019s written statement of reasons similarly relied upon \u00a7 4A1.3(a). The PSR detailed that Fields had 14 adult convictions by the time he reached age 24. Fields\u2019 convictions, for which he was assessed criminal history points, included possession of marijuana, possession of controlled substances, theft, failure to identify, and criminal trespass. In addition, Fields was facing several state charges when he committed the instant offense. In light of Fields\u2019 criminal history category and the nature of Fields\u2019 prior offenses, the district court did not reversibly err in determining that Fields\u2019 prior criminal history was under represented. <em>See United States v. Zu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number><em>niga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 348-49 (5th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2954, 165 L.Ed.2d 975 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Moreover, the extent of the upward departure was reasonable. The district court\u2019s 60-month sentence was 23 months more than the top of the advisory guidelines range but well below the 10-year statutory maximum for the offense. <em>See United States v. Simkanin, </em>420 F.3d 397, 419 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Daughenbaugh, </em>49 F.3d 171, 175 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b131-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
