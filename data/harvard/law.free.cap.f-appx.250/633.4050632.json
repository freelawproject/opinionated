The government concedes error. The parties request that this court modify the judgment by vacating the additional term of supervised release and otherwise affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">A district court may revoke a term of supervised release and require a defendant to return to prison. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Where the offense that results in the term of supervised release is a class D felony, as was Garcia\u2019s 2002 drug offense, the defendant may not be required to serve more than two years in prison. M; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(3); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Under the provision of \u00a7 3583(h), as that section provided at the time of Garcia\u2019s drug offense in 2002, the district court was also permitted to impose a term of supervised release to be served after imprisonment, but only where the term of imprisonment was less than the maximum term of imprisonment authorized under \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Although \u00a7 3583(h) has since been amended; the amendment will not be applied retroactively absent a plain statement that Congress so intended. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 702-03, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">The parties correctly argue that, because Garcia was sentenced to the maximum term of imprisonment under \u00a7 3583(e)(3), the district court was prohibited under the applicable version of \u00a7 3583(h) from imposing a subsequent term of supervised release. Accordingly, we MODIFY the judgment by VACATING the three-year term of supervised release, and we AFFIRM the judgment AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b660-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
