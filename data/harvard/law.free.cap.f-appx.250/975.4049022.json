No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">We first address Santana-Guzman\u2019s challenge to his conviction. Santana-Guzman asserts that the district court should have dismissed the indictment charging him with attempted illegal reentry because the indictment failed to allege that Santana-Guzman acted with specific intent to commit this offense. Santana-Guzman concedes that we rejected his argument in our decision in <em>United States v. Peralt-Reyes, </em>131 F.3d 956 (11th Cir.1997). We are bound to follow our prior precedent; and we affirm Santana-Guzman\u2019s conviction. <em>See United States v. Steele, </em>147 F.3d 1316, 1317-18 (11th Cir.1998) <em>(en </em>banc) (\u201cUnder our prior precedent rule, a panel cannot overrule a prior one\u2019s holding....\u201d); <em>Cargill v. Turpin, </em>120 F.3d 1366, 1386 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cThe law of this circuit is emphatic that only the Supreme Court or this court sitting <em>en banc </em>can judicially overrule a prior panel decision.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">We now address Santana-Guzman\u2019s challenges to his sentence. Santana-Guzman argues that the district court erred in not considering his acceptance of responsibility when determining his sentence. Before the district court, Santana-Guzman argued that he should receive a one-level decrease in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(b). He acknowledged that the district court could apply this one-level reduction only upon a motion by the government, which was not made in this case; but Santana-Guzman still asserted that the district court could consider his acceptance of responsibility in imposing a reasonable sentence. On appeal, Santana-Guzman contends that the district court should have reduced his sentence for his timely acceptance of responsibility under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review a sentence for reasonableness in the light of the factors set out at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244-46 (11th Cir.2005). Under section 3553(a), a district court should consider, among other things, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for adequate deterrence and protection of the public, policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, provision for the medical and educational needs of the defendant, and the need to avoid, unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(7). \u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential\u201d; and \u201cthe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of [the] record and the factors in section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Here, as we have discussed, Santana-Guzman argued at sentencing that the district court should consider that he did not receive an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction; and in sentencing Santana-Guzman to the low end of his advisory Guidelines range, the district court explained that it considered the statements of the parties, the section 3553(a) factors, and Santana-Guzman\u2019s Guidelines range. <em>See id. </em>(noting that \u201cordinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable\u201d). The Supreme Court has recently explained that \u201ca court of appeals may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a district court sentence that reflects a proper application of the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">The district court was not required to discuss all of the section 3553(a) factors at the sentencing hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the section 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the section 3553(a) factors\u201d). Nothing in the record convinces us that Santana-Guzman\u2019s sentence was unreasonable in the light of the section 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">Santana-Guzman also contends that the district court violated the Fifth Amendment by enhancing his sentence based on a prior conviction not charged in his indictment. We review Santana-Guzman\u2019s constitutional challenge <em>de novo. See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-13\">Under <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which remains binding precedent, \u201cthe government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1315 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 963 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains good law \u201cuntil the Supreme Court determines that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is not controlling precedent\u201d) (internal quotation omitted). Because we continue to follow <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the district court did not err in using Santana-Guzman\u2019s prior conviction to enhance his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-14\">We affirm Santana-Guzman\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">. Although it is not entirely clear, it appears that Santana-Guzman also argues that the district court erred by misconstruing his argument \u2014 which supported a reduction in his sentence for acceptance of responsibility \u2014 as an objection to the government's failure to move for such a reduction and then overruling that objection. Even if we assume that the district court construed Santana-Guzman\u2019s argument as he described, Santana-Guzman clarified for the district court that he had not raised an objection because he could not receive an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction unless the government filed a motion supporting that reduction. In response to that statement by Santana-Guzman, the district court instructed the parties to disregard its ruling. We see no reversible error here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">. And Santana-Guzman cites no authority for his argument that, in calculating his sentence, the district court should have considered the government\u2019s failure to file a motion for a sentence reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
