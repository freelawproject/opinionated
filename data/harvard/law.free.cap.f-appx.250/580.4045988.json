We have carefully reviewed the record and the administrative order and conclude that Lennon has waived his right to file a petition for review of the order. Accordingly, we grant the Attorney General\u2019s motion to dismiss Lennon\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-21\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
