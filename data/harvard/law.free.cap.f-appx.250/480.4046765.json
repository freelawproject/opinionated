For the following reasons, we will dismiss this appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-31\">On January 10, 2005, Appellant, an inmate at Schuylkill Federal Correctional Institution, initiated a combined Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Tort Claim Act and Bivens<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> action against Timothy P. Wood, Linda Edwards, and the United States alleging that the Defendants, in their individual and official capacities, performed an \u201cintrusive search and confiscation\u201d of his legal materials. On March 31, 2006, 2006 WL 859543, the District Court entered an order granting Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dismissing Appellant\u2019s complaint. Appellant claims he was not notified of the judgment and never received a copy of the District Court\u2019s order. On April 30, 2007, Appellant filed a motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On May 4, 2007, the District Court denied Appellant\u2019s motion. On May 21, 2007, Appellant filed a notice of appeal from that order and the order granting summary judgment for the Defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">We review the denial of a Rule 60(a) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>See Pfizer Inc. v. Uprichard, </em>422 F.3d 124, 129 (3d Cir.2005). The District Court\u2019s dismissal of Appellant\u2019s Rule 60(a) Motion was entirely appropriate. Appellant does not allege clerical error; he claims that he did not receive notification of the court\u2019s order. Appellant is attempting to use Rule 60(a) to re-open a final judgment in order to restart the clock for Fed. R.App. P. 4(a) purposes. Unfortunately for Appellant, our case law is clear: a Rule 60(a) motion does not affect the time limits within which an appeal must be taken. <em>See Gillis v. Hoechst Celanese Corp., </em>4 F.3d 1137, 1139 n. 1 (3d Cir.1993); <em>Barris v. Bob\u2019s Drag Chutes &amp; Safety Equip., </em>717 F.2d 52, 55 (3d Cir.1983). Moreover, had the District Court liberally construed Appellant\u2019s motion under the more appropriate Rule 60(b), the denial would still be appropriate. A district court may not supersede the timeliness requirements of Fed. R.App. 4(a) by using a Rule 60(b) motion to reopen the judgment. See <em>West v. Keve, </em>721 F.2d 91, 97 (3d Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">In sum, because Oriakhi\u2019s appeal lacks arguable legal merit, we will dismiss it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-6\">. In <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), the Supreme Court recognized a private cause of action to recover damages against a federal agent for violations of constitutional rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b507-7\">. Rule 60(a), Relief from Judgment or Order, in pertinent part states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">Clerical mistakes in judgments, orders or other parts of the record and errors therein arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at any time of its own initiative or on the motion of any party and after such notice, if any, as the court orders. During the pendency of an appeal, such mistakes may also be corrected before the appeal is docketed in the appellate court, and thereafter while the appeal is pending may be so corrected with the leave of the appellate court.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b507-13\">. As Appellant realizes, we lack appellate jurisdiction to review the District Court\u2019s order granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. A notice of appeal in a case in which the United States is a party \u201cmay be filed by any party within 60 days after the judgment of order appealed from is entered.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B). Appellant filed his notice of appeal from the District Court's order granting summary judgment for the Defendants a full year after the order was entered. Thus, we lack appellate jurisdiction to review that order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
