To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence [s]he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Mbang fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that she seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-23\">Additionally, we uphold the denial of Mbang\u2019s request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because Mbang fails to show that she is eligible for asylum, she cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-24\">We also find that substantial evidence supports the finding that Mbang fails to meet the standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2006). We find that Mbang failed to make the requisite showing before the immigration court. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review in No. 06-1416.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">In No. 06-2078, Mbang contends that the Board abused its discretion in denying her motion to reopen immigration proceedings based on new evidence. We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that no abuse of discretion occurred. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2007). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In Re: Mbang, </em>No. A97-624-334 (B.I.A. Sept. 7, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
