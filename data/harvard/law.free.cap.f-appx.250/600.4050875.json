The BIA adopted the immigration judge\u2019s findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-16\">We have jurisdiction to review a determination of the timeliness of an asylum claim only if the finding implicates a constitutional claim or depends on a question of law. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 594-95 (5th Cir.2007). De Leon does not argue that the denial of his application as untimely turned on a such a claim or question. Accordingly, the portion of De Leon\u2019s petition seeking review of the denial of his asylum application is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-17\">With regard to the denial of withholding of removal, De Leon failed to prove his claim that he would suffer persecution because of his ethnicity or his religion if he were to be returned to Indonesia. \u201c[T]here is no \u2018persecution\u2019 absent proof that the [harm] is condoned or orchestrated by the ... government.\u201d <em>Shehu v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 435, 438 (5th Cir.2006). Neither of the two incidents \u2014 occurring in about 1976 and in 1998 \u2014 to which De Leon pointed to demonstrate past persecution was shown to have been caused or condoned by the government of Indonesia. Additionally, De Leon testified that he had never been tortured, had never been discriminated against in employment on account of his ethnicity or religion, and had not been prevented from practicing his Catholic faith. The BIA\u2019s conclusion on this issue is supported by substantial evidence, and the record does not compel a contrary conclusion. Accordingly, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>portion of De Leon\u2019s petition must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Finally, De Leon\u2019s brief did not address the question whether it was error to have denied him relief under CAT. Accordingly, we deem that issue to have been waived. <em>Zhu, </em>493 F.3d at 593 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b627-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
