GUY COLE, JR., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">Plaintiff-Appellee Arnita Force brought this suit against Defendant-Appellant Ameritech Corporation, Inc. (\u201cAmeritech\u201d), alleging wrongful termination of her long-term disability (\u201cLTD\u201d) benefits under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). The district court, 452 F.Supp.2d 744, concluded that Ameritech\u2019s decision to terminate Force\u2019s LTD benefits was arbitrary and capricious. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-14\">A. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b690-15\">Arnita Force was employed by Ameritech from September 1978 to July 1994. As a result of a car accident that occurred on July 4, 1994, Dr. Howard Schwartz diagnosed Force with cephalalgia (i.e., headaches or head pain), cervical strain, and right shoulder strain. X-rays conducted after the accident indicated \u201costeophytic spurring of C5[-]C6 with a fracture of the osteophyte inferior plate[, and djiminished disc space at C4-C5.\u201d (JA 217.) Dr. Schwartz indicated on Disability Certificates dated August 5, 1994 and September 9, 1994 that Force was precluded from \u201cbending, lifting, twisting, and prolonged standing,\u201d and that she was \u201cdisabled.\u201d (JA 218-24.) Due to these injuries, Force applied for and received short-term disability benefits for fifty-two weeks, from August 1994 to August 1995. Following the expiration of her short-term disability benefits, Force applied for and received LTD benefits from August 1995 through May 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-16\">On June 21, 1995, Dr. Schwartz completed an \u201cAttending Physician\u2019s Statement of Functional Capacity,\u201d which noted that Force was severely limited in her ability to walk, stand, and sit, and characterized Force as \u201ctotally disabled for [her] occupation.\u201d (JA 252-53.) In a September 11, 1996 letter, Dr. Schwartz stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIJ\">[Force\u2019s] primary diagnosis is chronic pain syndrome, low grade cervical and lumbar radiculopathy, and tendinitis of the right wrist. She should avoid any and all activities that would cause reaching, pushing, repetitive movements, climbing, bending, stooping, or operating any equipment or machinery that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>endanger her or coworkers. She should also avoid any prolonged sitting (not more than 30 minutes), or standing (not more than 10 minutes), because of her chronic pain. It is advisable and necessary that she have bed rest several times during the course of the day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-5\">I believe that she should not do any lifting of any sort of weight, and this should be avoided completely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">(JA 239.) Dr. Schwartz also advised that \u201c[u]nless and until [Force\u2019s] condition significantly improves, she will remain totally disabled from any employment.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">On September 13, 1996, two days after Dr. Schwartz\u2019s letter, MetLife, a third-party administrator for the Ameritech Disability Service Center, informed Force that she might be eligible for Social Security disability benefits and encouraged her to apply. The letter also stated that Met-Life had forwarded Force\u2019s information to Kennedy &amp; Associates, a law firm specializing in obtaining such benefits. Subsequently, Force applied for and received Social Security disability benefits retroactive to July 1994. On June 18,1997, Force repaid Ameritech $26,396.67, because LTD benefits are offset by any Social Security disability benefits the employee receives.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Time did not alleviate Force\u2019s health problems. Roughly three years after the car accident, on January 25, 1997, a CT scan revealed spinal stenosis at C5-C6, a mild diffuse bulge at C2-C3, narrowing of the left L4-L5 neural foramen, and \u201cevidence of a congenital anomaly involving L5 vertebra and the upper sacrum [associated] with a rotary scoliosis.\u201d (JA 261-62.)</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">Dr. Schwartz referred Force to Dr. Armando Ortiz, a specialist in neurological surgery, who examined Force on March 11, 1997. Dr. Ortiz found that Force had \u201cslight limitation of movements of the cervical spine in all directions because of discomfort\u201d but otherwise concluded that she had \u201cno other focal localized neurological findings.\u201d (JA 256.) Dr. Ortiz also noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-11\">[t]he motor, sensory and coordination of the upper extremities is intact. Although she states that there might be a little difference in the perception of sensation to pinprick on the right, compared to the left, I find no definite pattern for this involvement. The same happened in the area of the C2 dermatome, where she may have some hypesthesia in the C2 on the right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">(JA 257.) Ultimately, Dr. Ortiz concluded that \u201c[Force] has evidence of cervical spondylosis.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Dr. Ortiz questioned \u201cwhether the spondylosis [was] ... due to the trauma [of the car accident] ...,\u201d but opined, \u201cI am inclined to believe that there was a pre-existing condition which was definitely aggravated by the accident, and is causing now the subjective complaints that the patient has.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-13\">On December 22, 1997, Force underwent a Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) at Ameritech\u2019s request. The FCE report, dated January 12, 1998, was written by Scott McKay, a non-physician occupational therapist. The report explained that \u201c[t]he evaluation was performed to assess the client\u2019s physical abilities and limitations related to her present level of functioning.\u201d (JA 133.) Under the heading \u201cPhysical Demand Level,\u201d the report stated that Force \u201cdemonstrated the physical ability to work at the SEDENTARY Physical Demand Level for the 6 hours of the evaluation\u201d and explained that sedentary \u201cis defined by the Dictionary of Occupational Titles ... as lifting 10 [pounds] infrequently.\u201d (JA 134.) Under the heading \u201cDigital Tenderness Mapping,\u201d the report stated that Force\u2019s \u201cresult[s] appear to correlate with true medical impairment and disability.\u201d (JA 134-35.) The report concluded that \u201cForce exhibited minimal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>symptom/disability exaggeration behavior by our criteria ...and it then stated that \u201cduring the evaluation Ms. Force\u2019s comments in regard to her limited abilities could be [construed] as symptoms exaggeration, as her comments were consistently underestimating her abilities.\u201d (JA 135.) Ultimately, the report concluded that \u201cMs. Force presents significant impairments which may adversely affect return to work,\u201d classified her \u201cfunctional abilities\u201d as consistent with a work demand of \u201csedentary-light,\u201d and recommended that \u201cForce may benefit from a Work Conditioning program emphasizing strength, fitness, stabilization principles and body mechanics.\u201d (JA 135-36.)</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">On March 9, 1998, Kathleen Roche, a non-physician \u201cReturn-To-Work Specialist,\u201d sent Connie Neier, an LTD specialist with Ameritech, a transferable skills analysis for Force, addressing \u201cForce\u2019s ability to work in a Sedentary position.\u201d (JA 125.) The letter stated that \u201c[t]he analysis is based on review of chart notes and medical records, which include her restrictions and limitations; the [claimant\u2019s] education and vocational history; and review of vocational reference materials.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Based on Dr. Ortiz\u2019s letter and the FCE report, Roche concluded that Force \u201chas the physical capacity to perform sedentary work\u201d and \u201cwould be able to perform her [previous] job duties as a Manager, Publishing Graphic Center.\u201d (JA 126.) Roche also listed ten additional jobs that Force could perform, since all were classified as sedentary work.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">On March 24, 1998, Neier, in a written letter, informed Force that Ameritech was terminating her LTD benefits because she was no longer \u201celigible ... under the Ameritech Long Term Disability Plan.\u201d (JA 111-12.) Force then requested an administrative appeal. Upon reassessing Force\u2019s LTD claim, the Employees\u2019 Benefit Committee at Ameritech upheld the denial of benefits on October 21, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">B. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Force then instituted the present lawsuit in federal district court on April 15, 2003 under Section 502 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). Shortly thereafter, the case was stayed upon agreement of the parties to allow Ameritech to reevaluate Force\u2019s claim. Pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulation, Ameritech enlisted the SBC Medical Absence and Accommodations Research Team Quality Review Unit (the \u201cUnit\u201d) to reconsider Force\u2019s appeal and conduct an independent assessment. The Unit in turn referred Force\u2019s entire disability claim file to Dr. Vernon Mark, a board-certified specialist in neurosurgery, for independent review. Through a letter dated September 27, 2004, Dr. Mark informed the Unit that, based on his review of prognosis notes from Force\u2019s previous medical consultations, the FCE report from December 1997, and the Transferable Skills Analysis from March 1998, Force \u201cwas not disabled from her regular job on the basis of objective findings.\u201d (Supp. JA 380.) Although Dr. Mark found \u201csome limitation on [Force\u2019s] range of neck movement, a slightly decreased biceps jerk and some degree of central stenosis at C5/C6,\u201d in his estimation, these conditions did not \u201cimpair ... her ability to perform her own occupation or any sedentary job duty.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Overall, Dr. Mark concluded that Force had an \u201cessentially normal neurological evaluation.\u201d (Supp. JA 381.)</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">On the basis of Dr. Mark\u2019s evaluation, the Unit determined that Force\u2019s medical condition was not so severe as to prevent her from performing her primarily sedentary duties at Ameritech and recommended that the denial of Force\u2019s LTD benefits be affirmed. Accordingly, Ameritech sent a final letter to Force, dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>November 8, 2004, upholding its termination decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Following this final denial later, Force re-instituted her case in federal district court. Force again alleged that Ameritech wrongfully terminated her LTD benefits under Section 502 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). The case was assigned to a magistrate judge who issued a Report and Recommendation on September 5, 2006. In his report, the magistrate judge recommended that Force\u2019s motion should be granted on the basis of (1) a conflict of interest between Ameritech\u2019s role in both determining benefits eligibility and paying those benefits; (2) Ameritech\u2019s disregard of the Social Security Administration\u2019s determination that Force was disabled; and (3) existing medical evidence. On September 19, 2006, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and thereby determined that Ameritech had wrongfully denied Force\u2019s claim for LTD benefits. Ameritech timely appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">When an ERISA plan administrator \u201chas no discretion to determine benefits eligibility,\u201d this Court engages in a <em>de novo </em>review of the benefits eligibility decision. <em>Calvert v. Firstar Fin., Inc., </em>409 F.3d 286, 291 (6th Cir.2005). If, however, the plan administrator or fiduciary has discretionary authority to determine benefits eligibility or to construe the terms of the plan, then this Court employs \u201cthe highly deferential arbitrary and capricious standard of review.\u201d <em>McDonald v. </em>W.-S. <em>Life Ins. Co., </em>347 F.3d 161, 168 (6th Cir. 2003) (quoting <em>Yeager v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 88 F.3d </em>376, 380 (6th Cir.1996)); <em>see also Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 115, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989). Under the arbitrary-and-capricious standard of review, the administrator\u2019s decision is upheld if it is \u201crational in light of the plan\u2019s provisions\u201d and \u201cwhen it is possible to offer a reasoned explanation, based on the evidence, for a particular outcome....\u201d <em>McDonald, </em>347 F.3d at 169 (quoting <em>Williams v. Int\u2019l Paper Co., </em>227 F.3d 706, 712 (6th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">It is well established that the arbitrary- and-capricious standard \u201cis the least demanding form of judicial review of administrative action.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>227 F.3d at 712. Nevertheless, this Court explained in <em>McDonald </em>that \u201c[deferential review is not no review, and deference need not be abject.\u201d 347 F.3d at 172 (quoting <em>Hess v. Hartford Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>274 F.3d 456, 461 (7th Cir.2001), and <em>Gallo v. Amoco Corp., </em>102 F.3d 918, 922 (7th Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">Here, the district court correctly reviewed Ameritech\u2019s denial of LTD benefits under an arbitrary-and-capricious standard of review because Ameritech\u2019s Long-Term Disability Plan grants Ameritech, through the Employee Benefits Committee, the right to grant or deny claims for benefits under the Plan. Thus, Ameritech, although not the direct plan administrator, is nonetheless a fiduciary <footnotemark>**</footnotemark> with discretionary authority to determine benefits eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">1. <em>Conflict of Interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The district court properly concluded that Ameritech\u2019s denial of LTD benefits to Force was arbitrary and capricious, based in part on an apparent conflict of interest. In <em>Glenn v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em>461 F.3d 660, 666 (6th Cir. 2006), this Court explained that where the employer \u201cis authorized both to decide whether an employee is eligible for benefits and to pay those benefits[,] [t]his dual function .creates an apparent conflict of interest.\u201d The Supreme Court elaborated in <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>489 U.S. at 115, 109 S.Ct. 948, that \u201cif a benefit plan gives discretion to an administrator or fiduciary who is operating under a conflict of interest, that conflict must be weighed as a \u2018facto[r] in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 187 cmt. d (1959)).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The district court here did just that. The magistrate judge considered Ameritech\u2019s conflict of interest as a factor in determining whether Ameritech\u2019s decision to deny Force LTD benefits was arbitrary and capricious. Specifically, the magistrate judge noted that \u201cAmeritech is the plan funder [sic], and has, through its Benefits Committee, the authority to grant or deny LTD benefits. In other words, Ameritech is authorized to decide eligibility for benefits and to pay those benefits creating an apparent conflict of interest.\u201d (JA 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Because Ameritech has the authority to determine eligibility for benefits and to pay out those benefits, the district court did not err in concluding that Ameritech was operating under a potential conflict of interest \u2014 a factor that is relevant to whether Ameritech\u2019s denial of LTD benefits was arbitrary and capricious. <em>Calvert, </em>409 F.3d at 292 (explaining that the defendant\u2019s possible conflict of interest is a relevant factor in determining whether its benefits eligibility decision was arbitrary and capricious). Although MetLife, an independent third party, plays a role in administering LTD benefits, Ameritech\u2019s LTD Plan neither mentions MetLife nor makes clear MetLife\u2019s specific functions. In fact, the Plan itself states that Michigan Bell Telephone Company (\u201cMichigan Bell\u201d) is the plan administrator. Michigan Bell is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ameritech, and therefore is not an independent third-party administrator. Further, the \u201cPlan Administration\u201d section states that \u201c[t]he Employees\u2019 Benefit Committee which is appointed by the Company, has the right to grant and deny initial claims for benefits under the Plan and to review on appeal claims it has denied.\u201d (JA 343.) Thus, under the Plan, a committee selected by Ameritech has the power to determine benefits eligibility and to interpret the terms of the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">2. <em>Medical Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">The district court also properly concluded that, based on the medical evidence, Ameritech\u2019s termination of Force\u2019s LTD benefits was arbitrary and capricious. Ameritech argues that the district court erred by relying exclusively on Ameritech\u2019s denial letters of March 1998 and October 1998 in reaching this conclusion, because the November 2004 letter superseded these previous letters. To the extent that the district court based its findings on the two 1998 letters, however, we find this error harmless, because the 2004 denial letter suffers from similar deficiencies to those contained in the prior letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-11\">Specifically, the records Ameritech relied on to deny Force LTD benefits have several inconsistencies. Along with the January 1998 and March 1998 denial let<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>ters, the 2004 denial letter, which incorporated the findings of Dr. Mark, focused primarily on the FCE report from January 1998. In his report to Ameritech, Dr. Mark noted that \u201c[t]he summary of the [FCE] reported that Ms. Force\u2019s functional abilities were consistent with sedentary work demands.\u201d (Supp. JA 381.) The FCE report, however, was prepared by a non-physician and was based on a single evaluation of Force.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Furthermore, the FCE report is internally inconsistent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">Although the report concludes that [Force] is capable of at least sedentary employment, it also notes that she has \u2018significant impairments which may adversely affect return to work,\u2019 and states that digital tenderness mapping (DTM) results \u2018appear to be associated with a specific low back pain syndrome. This result appears to correlate with true medical impairment and disability. (JA 23 (internal citations omitted).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Additionally, although the basis of the 2004 denial letter was Dr. Mark\u2019s independent review, Dr. Mark did not personally examine Force. Rather, he issued his findings based solely on the contents of Force\u2019s medical file. The facts surrounding the 2004 denial letter are therefore nearly indistinguishable from those in <em>Calvert, </em>where this Court concluded that the denial of LTD benefits was arbitrary and capricious. 409 F.3d at 295-97. In <em>Calvert, </em>despite the evidence showing that Calvert was disabled, her employer denied her benefits by basing its decision on the opinion of a doctor, who reviewed Calvert\u2019s medical file but did not personally examine her. <em>Id. </em>at 296. This Court detected several flaws in the doctor\u2019s report because he \u201cdid not describe the data he relied on in reaching his conclusion\u201d and \u201chis conclusion suggested that he might have disregarded certain tests and examination results.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 296-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">In this case, Dr. Mark\u2019s report suffers from similar deficiencies. Dr. Mark did not provide a sufficient description of the data leading to his conclusion. Rather than pointing to specific medical examinations supporting his findings, he instead summarily stated that he determined Force\u2019s lack of disability \u201cbased on the information available for review and from a neurosurgical perspective.\u201d (Supp. JA 380.) The only clinical findings Dr. Mark referenced in any detail were \u201csome limitation on [Force\u2019s] range of neck movement, a slightly decreased biceps jerk and some degree of central stenosis on C5/C6 on MRI.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Dr. Mark\u2019s letter does not make clear, however, whether he considered the results of the CT scan on January 25,1997, Dr. Schwartz\u2019s findings of chronic pain syndrome and tendinitis of the right wrist, and Dr. Ortiz\u2019s finding of \u201csome hypesthesia in the C2 on the right.\u201d (JA 257.) The vagueness of this description leads this Court to conclude that, as in <em>Calvert, </em>Dr. Mark may have disregarded, or at least discounted, certain tests and examination results.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">3. <em>The Social Security Administration\u2019s Benefits Determination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">Lastly, the district court was correct in factoring into its arbitrary-and-capricious calculus Ameritech\u2019s failure to consider the SSA\u2019s finding that Force was disabled and therefore entitled to disability benefits. To qualify for Social Security benefits a person must be disabled, which is defined as an \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). Under Ameriteeh\u2019s LTD Plan, a person is disabled if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXa\">a sickness or injury ... prevents the employee from performing the duties of his/her occupation or employment. \u201cDisability\u201d after the one year period immediately following the Waiting Period shall mean that the employee is <em>prevented by reason of such sickness or injury from engaging in any occupation or employment for which the employee is qualified, or may reasonably become qualified, based on training, education or experience. </em>An employee shall continue to be considered disabled if deemed incapable of performing the requirements of a job as a Salaried Employee other than one whose rate of pay is less than 50% of the employee\u2019s Base Pay at the time the disability commenced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">(JA 111 (emphasis added).)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Despite the definitional overlap between eligibility for Social Security benefits and eligibility for LTD benefits, Ameritech\u2019s 2004 decision to deny Force LTD benefits made no reference to the SSA\u2019s benefits determination. As this Court stated in <em>Calvert, </em>\u201cthe SSA determination, though certainly not binding, is far from meaningless.\u201d 409 F.3d at 294. In that case, the Court was persuaded that the SSA\u2019s determination of Calvert\u2019s eligibility for benefits was relevant because such a determination, \u201cat a minimum, provides support for the conclusion that an administrative agency charged with examining Calvert\u2019s medical records found, as it expressly said it did, objective support ...\u201d for a conclusion that Calvert was disabled. <em>Id.; accord Glenn, </em>461 F.3d at 667 (\u201cThe courts have recognized that a disability determination by the [SSA] is relevant in an action to determine the arbitrariness of a decision to terminate benefits under an ERISA plan.\u201d). Likewise, in this case, we are persuaded that the SSA\u2019s grant of benefits to Force constitutes objective support of her disability and that Ameritech\u2019s refusal to at least consider this determination is arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">For the preceding reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b693-8\"> Under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002, Ameritech is a fiduciary because it exercises \u201cdiscretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of [the ERISA LTD] plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of [the Plan\u2019s] assets.\u201d Under the Plan, the Employee Benefits Committee, selected by Ameritech, \u201cdetermines conclusively for all parties all questions arising in the administration of the Plan\" and further has \u201cthe right to grant and deny initial claims for benefits under the Plan____\u201d (JA 343.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
