He argues that the BIA erred in denying his nationality claim because he met all of the requirements for citizenship under then applicable INA \u00a7 321, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432 (repealed) and that, as a consequence, he derived citizenship by operation of law via the naturalization of his adoptive mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-15\">Section 321 is inapplicable on its face. The only subsection that could possibly apply to Puentes is \u00a7 321(a)(3), under which he was required to establish either (1) the naturalization of his adoptive mother and a legal separation of his parents or (2) the naturalization of his adoptive mother and that he was born out of wedlock with unestablished paternity. INA \u00a7 321(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432(a)(3)(repealed). As Puentes had only one adoptive parent, he could not establish a legal separation of his adoptive parents. Nor did he establish that he was born out of wedlock with unestablished paternity. Therefore, Puentes failed to satisfy the requirements for derivative citizenship under \u00a7 321(a)(3). The BIA did not err in denying his nationality claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-20\">Equally without merit is Puentes\u2019s claim that there are material fact issues that require remand to the district court. His assertion that his potential out-of-wedlock status and his paternity are at issue is not supported by the record. He provides no evidence that he was born out of wedlock or that his paternity was not established such that he could qualify for derivative citizenship under former \u00a7 321(a)(3). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(b) <em>&amp; </em>(5)(A)-(B). Additionally, Puentes concedes that there are no facts \u201cat issue in the present case\u201d unless we find that such issues are in dispute, in which case we must remand to the district court. He fails to explain which facts we might identify as being in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-21\">Puentes challenges the IJ\u2019s determination that he did not fall within the defini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>tion of \u201cchild\u201d in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(c)(1) because his adoption did not take place in the United States, but rather, occurred in Colombia. We agree with the BIA that this contention need not be addressed, since Puentes cannot qualify for derivative citizenship under 821(a)(3) as the child of a single adoptive parent, no matter where he was adopted. Moreover, we do not review an IJ\u2019s determination if that determination did not impact the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Puentes argues that the BIA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 321 violates the equal protection guarantee of the Constitution by treating differently adopted alien children who have two parents and adopted children who have only one parent. Under the applicable rational basis review, <em>see De Fuentes v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 498, 503 (5th Cir.2006), the distinction here advances the interests of (1) \u201censuring that a child who becomes an American citizen has a real relationship with a family unit, and with the United States, and is not a mere beneficiary of a legal relationship created in a foreign court; and (2) deterring immigration fraud by those who, without this restraint, could pose as adoptive parents and fraudulently secure derivative citizenship for children by engaging in adoptions in foreign courts.\u201d <em>Smart v. Ashcroft, </em>401 F.3d 119, 122 (2d Cir.2005) (all internal quotations omitted). Both are legitimate government interests sufficient to withstand a rational basis challenge. <em>See e.g., id.; Villanueva-Jurado v. INS, </em>482 F.2d 886, 887-88 (5th Cir.1973); <em>Hein v. INS, </em>456 F.2d 1239, 1240 (5th Cir.1972). Puentes\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 321 is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Puentes also argues that the BIA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 321 violates the canons of statutory construction by raising \u201cserious constitutional issues\u201d that could be avoided through alternative statutory interpretations. Here, there are no applicable alternative statutory interpretations that apply; the plain language of the statute excludes alien children of adoptive parents when the children are not born out of wedlock or the adoptive parent is not legally separated.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b52-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
