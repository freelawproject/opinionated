Baez argues that his sentence of 77 months of imprisonment, which was within the applicable advisory sentencing guidelines range, is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a). Baez asserts, as he did in the district court, that his sentence should have been lower than the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">With regard to Baez\u2019s challenge to the reasonableness of his sentence, he has not shown that the sentence was unreasonable or that this court should not defer to the district court\u2019s determinations at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). Given his extensive criminal history, Baez presents no arguments to show that his circumstances are \u201cspecial enough that, in light of \u00a7 3553(a), they require a sentence lower than the sentence the Guidelines provide.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2470, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"A00\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
