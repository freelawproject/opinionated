We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-17\">Wilar applied for asylum and related relief claiming that he fears persecution in Indonesia because he is a practicing Christian and ethnically Chinese.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He did not file his application for asylum within one year of arriving to the United States, however, as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). The Immigration Judge (IJ) and the BIA both determined that he had failed to present the kind of extraordinary circumstances or material change in eligibility that would warrant accepting his untimely application. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-21\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Wilar\u2019s challenge to this discretionary factual determination. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Ismailov v. Reno, </em>263 F.3d 851, 854-55 (8th Cir.2001). Although we do have jurisdiction to consider his purely legal argument that the United States is bound by its international obligations to accept his asylum application, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (limit on judicial review does not apply to questions of law), we find the argument to be without merit. <em>See Purwantono v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d 822, 824-25 (8th Cir.2007) (rejecting similar challenge to filing deadline).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-22\">We also conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s determination that Wilar failed to meet his burden of proof for withholding of removal. <em>See Eta-Ndu v. Gonzales, </em>411 F.3d 977, 982-83 (8th Cir.2005) (standard of review). Wilar testified that he suffered physical harm in Indonesia on one occasion in 1996 when he was beaten up by a Muslim mob, although he did not seek medical attention for his injuries. The BIA reasonably concluded that this one incident, which was carried out by private citizens, did not amount to persecution, especially since he remained in Indonesia for five more years without further injury. <em>See Kondakova v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 792, 797 (8th Cir.2004). Moreover, his family continues to reside in Indonesia unharmed, undermining the reasonableness of his fear of future persecution. <em>See Krasnopivtsev v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 832, 839 (8th Cir.2004). Wilar also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>failed to present evidence that would compel a conclusion that there is a pattern or practice of persecution against Christian Chinese for which the government bears any responsibility. <em>See Ming Ming Wijono v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 868, 874 (8th Cir.2006) (noting Indonesian government efforts to protect Christian Chinese and general improvement of situation).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Wilar\u2019s challenge to the denial of his CAT claim must fail as well. There is substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s determination that Wilar did not establish a reasonable fear of torture as the result of government action or acquiescence. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. 1208.18(a)(1); <em>see also Tolego v. Gonzales, </em>452 F.3d 763, 767 (8th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Accordingly, the petition for review is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-23\">. Wilar testified that he is one quarter Chinese.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
