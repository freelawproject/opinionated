Frank Prater appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition for habeas corpus brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Petitioner challenges a determination by the Oregon Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision denying him rerelease on parole and imposing a 79-month sanction for violation of parole terms. The district court found that Petitioner had procedurally defaulted on his federal claims by failing to raise them on appeal in his state habeas petition. On December 23, 2005, approximately one month prior to the district court\u2019s entry of judgment on January 30, 2006, 2006 WL 240534, Petitioner was released on parole.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioner remains subject to the jurisdiction of the Board, and the maximum expiration date of his remaining sentence is January 1, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">We conclude that Prater\u2019s appeal became moot prior to the district court\u2019s entry of judgment. The \u201ccase or controversy\u201d requirement of Article III, \u00a7 2 \u201c \u2018subsists through all stages of federal judicial proceedings, trial and appellate____The parties must continue to have a \u201cpersonal stake in the outcome\u201d of the lawsuit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998) (quoting <em>Lewis v. Cont\u2019l Bank Corp., </em>494 U.S. 472, 477-78, 110 S.Ct. 1249, 108 L.Ed.2d 400 (1990)). Throughout the litigation, \u201cthe plaintiff must have suffered, or be threatened with, an actual injury traceable to the defendant\u201d and able \u201cto be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). In cases where a parolee challenges the validity of his incarceration, \u201csome concrete and continuing injury other than the now-ended incarceration or parole \u2014 some \u2018collateral consequence\u2019 of the conviction \u2014 must exist if the suit is to be maintained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Prater\u2019s challenge is to the imposition of a parole sanction, as opposed to the validity of his original conviction, the burden is on Prater to demonstrate such consequences. <em>Id. </em>at 10-11, 14, 118 S.Ct. 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-15\">Petitioner argues that he has suffered injury in the form of the extended period of time he spent in prison due to the Board\u2019s allegedly unconstitutional application of Oregon law. He suggests this injury is redressable because the court could shorten his parole term by the additional amount of time he spent in custody. This argument is unavailing. Under Oregon law, Prater\u2019s underlying conviction determines the maximum duration of his sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>tence, and his ultimate sentence termination date is not dependent on whether he was held in prison as a parole sanction. <em>See Burnett v. Lampert, </em>432 F.3d 996, 997-1000 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Barnes v. Thompson, </em>159 Or.App. 383, 977 P.2d 431, 432 (1999). Therefore, Prater has shown no injury which this court may redress.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Burnett, </em>432 F.3d at 1000-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Petitioner\u2019s appeal became moot on the day he was rereleased on parole, approximately one month before the district court\u2019s entry of judgment. Therefore, we VACATE the judgment of the district court and REMAND with instructions to DISMISS the petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b245-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
