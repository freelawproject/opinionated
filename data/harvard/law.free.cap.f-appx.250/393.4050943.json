Nov. 6, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. See <em>Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">As a preliminary matter, to the extent that Aboehoayra attempts to reargue the merits of the underlying denial of his asylum and withholding of removal application, that decision is not properly before this Court. Only the BIA\u2019s November 2006 decision is before us as that is the only decision from which a petition for review was timely filed. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">The BIA did not exceed its allowable discretion in finding that Aboehoayra failed to present material evidence of changed country conditions to justify granting his motion to reopen. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); <em>Poradisova v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 70, 78 (2d Cir.2005). The BIA appropriately found that the evidence Aboehoayra submitted described ongoing human rights abuses but did not demonstrate a change in country conditions in Egypt. Moreover, the BIA properly noted that the evidence did not reflect any changes relevant to Abochoayra\u2019s specific claim as a Sunni Muslim considered suspect due to his association with non-Sunni Muslims. Indeed, Abochoayra\u2019s allegations that abuses \u201ccontinued\u201d and that the Egyptian government\u2019s support for human rights \u201cremained\u201d poor do not, on their face, support that there has been any change.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">Nor did the BIA exceed its allowable discretion in denying Abochoayra\u2019s motion to reopen based on the birth of his daughter. The BIA appropriately found that Aboehoayra failed to identify the relevancy of his daughter\u2019s birth to his eligibility for any relief from removal. <em>See Kaur, </em>413 F.3d at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
