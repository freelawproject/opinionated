BATCHELDER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b160-19\">A federal grand jury indicted Terry Hronek and two co-defendants for conspiracy to possess marijuana with the intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 &amp; 841(a)(1), and money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(B)(i). Hronek pleaded guilty to both counts of the indictment and the court sentenced him to 125 months in prison. The plea agreement required him to forfeit various properties, including a home located on Lake Rockwell Road in Ravenna, Ohio. Hronek\u2019s lawyer had erroneously advised Hronek that he would be able to repurchase this home and the government had also indicated that such a repurchase was possible. But after signing the plea agreement and pleading guilty, Hronek discovered that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(h) prohibited him from repurchasing forfeited property.' On December 19, 2002, the district court filed its 35-page final order of forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-20\">Following an unsuccessful direct appeal, Hronek moved the district court to \u201cVacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence,\u201d pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, based on \u201cineffective assistance of counsel during plea negotiations,\u201d due process violations, newly-discovered evidence, and <em>United States v. Booker. </em>The district court denied the petition, explaining that Hronek was not prejudiced by his lawyer\u2019s ignorance about the forfeiture laws because \u201cthe letters petitioner provides in which his attorney discusses the erroneous application of the forfeiture laws are all dated <em>after </em>he entered his plea,\u201d and \u201c[ojther than petitioner\u2019s self-serving affidavit, there is simply no evidence that petitioner\u2019s counselor pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>vided erroneous advice prior to the time he changed his plea.\u201d The court also found that \u201cthe vacation taken by petitioner\u2019s attorney did not result in ineffective assistance of counsel. Rather, it was petitioner\u2019s own inability to provide assistance, which resulted in the government ceasing its cooperation efforts with petitioner.\u201d The court found that Hronek had procedurally defaulted on his alleged due process violations by failing to raise them on direct appeal, and that his alleged \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d was neither newly discovered nor exculpatory. Finally, the court explained that <em>Booker </em>does not apply retroactively. Hronek appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">After carefully reviewing the record, the law, and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court\u2019s opinion correctly sets out the applicable law and correctly applies that law to the facts contained in the record. The issuance of a full written opinion by this court would serve no useful purpose. Accordingly, for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s opinion, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
