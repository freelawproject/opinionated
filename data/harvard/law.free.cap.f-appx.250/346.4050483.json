Roberts petitions for review of the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) that affirmed the decision of the Office of Personnel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) finding him unsuitable for federal employment and instructing his employing agency, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), to remove him from his position with the IRS. <em>Roberts v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>DE-0731-06-0407-I-1, 105 M.S.P.R. 222 (M.S.P.B. Feb. 27, 2007) <em>(\u201cFinal Decision </em>\u201d). <em>We affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">At the time of his removal, in 2006, Mr. Roberts was employed by the IRS as a Clerk. He previously had been employed as a civilian Supply Technician with the Department of the Air Force at Hill Air Force Base in Utah. However, he was removed from that position on September 29, 1999, based on charges of failure to follow instructions regarding the unauthorized use of government equipment and making false or misleading statements to cover up his unauthorized use of government equipment. On appeal to the Board, his removal was sustained. <em>See Roberts v. Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, </em>DE-0752-00-0006-I-1 (Initial Decision, Feb. 24, 2000), <em>review denied, </em>88 M.S.P.R. 306 (Table, Mar. 15, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">In March of 2002, Mr. Roberts began his employment with the IRS. On November 30, 2001, as part of the hiring process leading up to that employment, he completed an Optional Form 306 (\u201cOF 306\u201d). The form asked him, at question 12, whether during the five-year period prior to completion of the form he had been fired from any job for any reason, whether he had quit any job after being told he would be fired, whether he had left any job by mutual agreement because of specific problems, or whether he had been debarred from federal employment. Signing the form as an applicant, Mr. Roberts answered this question \u201cno.\u201d On March 5, 2002, Mr. Roberts re-executed the OF 306, this time as an appointee rather than an applicant. In doing so, he left \u201cno\u201d as the answer to question 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">Subsequently, based upon information received from the IRS, OPM conducted a further investigation of Mr. Roberts. This investigation revealed that Mr. Roberts had been r\u00e9moved from his position with the Air Force. Thereafter, on February 27, 2006, OPM proposed, <em>inter alia, </em>(i) instructing the IRS to remove Mr. Roberts from his position and (ii) debarring him from competing in examinations or accepting competitive appointments in the federal service for a period of up to three years. OPM based its proposal on the charge of \u201cmaterial, intentional false statement or deception or fraud in examination or appointment.\u201d The charge arose from Mr. Roberts\u2019 negative answer to question 12 on the OF 306 forms that he completed on November 30, 2001, and March 5, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">On June 16, 2006, after considering Mr. Roberts\u2019 response to the proposed action, OPM instructed the IRS to remove Mr. Roberts from his position. At the same time, it cancelled his eligibilities for federal employment or reinstatement and debarred him from any federal employment until June 16, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-13\">Mr. Roberts appealed to the Board. On November 1, 2006, based upon the written submissions of the parties, the administrative judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) to whom the appeal was assigned issued an initial decision in which he sustained OPM\u2019s action. <em>Roberts v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>DE-0731-06-0407-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Nov. 1, 2006) <em>(\u2018Initial Decision </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-14\">The <em>Initial Decision </em>became the final decision of the Board on February 27, 2007, after the Board denied Mr. Roberts\u2019 petition for review for failure to meet the criteria for review set forth at 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.115(d). <em>Final Decision. </em>This ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>peal followed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Our scope of review in an appeal from a decision of the Board is limited. Specifically, we must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless we find it to be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law\u201d; \u201cobtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed\u201d; or \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000); <em>Kewley v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Sews., </em>153 F.3d 1357, 1361 (Fed.Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">We see no error in the decision of the Board. First, the Board applied the correct law. When determining whether an individual is suitable for employment, OPM may take into account a \u201c[mjaterial, intentional false statement or deception or fraud in examination or appointment.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 731.202(b)(3) (2007). At the same time, to the extent that OPM deems them pertinent to a given case, it is required to consider the factors set forth at 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 731.202(c). One of these factors is \u201c[t]he nature and seriousness of the conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 731.292(c)(2). The Board found (i) that when Mr. Roberts applied for his position with the IRS and was appointed to the position, he knew or should have known that he had been fired from his Air Force job and (ii) that his false statements on the OAF 306s that he had not been fired were material. <em>Initial Decision </em>at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">As far as the sufficiency of the evidence is concerned, Mr. Roberts argues that the Board failed to consider his \u201cthoughts and intent\u201d and that OPM should have been required to produce a \u201cprofessional opinion\u201d of his thoughts and intent. We see no merit in this argument. Contrary to Mr. Roberts\u2019 assertion, the Board did address the intent issue. <em>Id. </em>In addition, it was not necessary for OPM to come forward with opinion evidence concerning Mr. Roberts\u2019 intent. The facts of the case, as outlined above and as set forth in the <em>Initial Decision, </em>speak for themselves. Based upon those facts, the Board did not err in finding it \u201cinherently improbable\u201d that Mr. Roberts went through the prior Board appeal and administrative proceedings in Utah that focused on the reasons why he had been discharged by the Air Force without knowing that he had been fired by the Air Force. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">Neither are we persuaded by Mr. Roberts\u2019 claims of procedural error. In making these claims, Mr. Roberts appears to focus on two matters: the Board\u2019s discovery rulings and its granting of OPM\u2019s request for an extension of time for the filing of its brief. We review the Board\u2019s rulings to determine whether they represent an abuse of discretion. <em>Curtin v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>846 F.2d 1373, 1378 (Fed.Cir.1988). We see no abuse of discretion in this case. The discovery requests by Mr. Roberts that the Board denied were not relevant to the issue before the Board: whether OPM had established that Mr. Roberts intentionally provided material false information in connection with his application for IRS employment and his subsequent hiring by the IRS. The short answer to Mr. Roberts\u2019 complaint about the extension of time granted to OPM for the filing of its brief is that it is not unusual for such extensions to be granted and that Mr. Roberts has not even attempted to show how he was prejudiced by the extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">We have considered Mr. Roberts\u2019 additional arguments and have found them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the final decision of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
