After the death of A, bis widow S, the tenant for life, married D in 1812. In 1814 1) entered into a written contract wi*h C, the remainder-man, by which (' agreed to sell him all his interest in the estate for \u00a710,000, payable in three equal annual payments, the first to he paid the 25th Dicem* ber in the same year, and all, except \u00a72,800 bearing interest till paid. I) was to give bond, with security, for the payment of the purchase money in manner before mentioned, and\u00f3n payment thereof, C was to execute a conveyance of the land to 1) in fee. Endorsed on this contract was this agreement \u2014 \u201cIt is understood that the legacies, charged by the will of A, to be paid out of his real estate, are not to be satisfied by I), but that the land Is to be exonerated by C, from the payment theieof \" The first instalment under the contract was paid by I), and bond with security' given for the balance. On this bond judgment was rendered at law against D, one of the legacies charged upon the estate being still outstanding, and the other having been purchased by D. A bill was then filed by' D, praying an injunction to stay proceedings on the judgment. After the filing of the hill, the outstanding legacy was purchased by C,</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b353-6\"><em>Held, </em>1. That the true construction of the agreement endorsed on the contract of purchase between I) &amp; C, was that the estate itself was to be freed from all liability to pay' the legacies with which it was charged, and not mere.lv that 1) was tobe personally indemnified from their payment; and that though it was an agreement which C might have some difficulty in complying with, it was not an impossible one, and that he was bound to perforin it before be could call on D for the whole purchase money.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b353-7\"><em>Held, </em>2. That as the money was tobe paid in instalments, and the said agreement was in general terms that the land was to he exonerated from the outstanding legacies, C had, <em>until the last instalment became due, </em>to comply with the agreement; and that therefore, upon tile instalments, which fell due before that, time, D was bound to pay interest, although the legacies were not discharged, having by bis contract expressly agreed to pay interest. That D could not have relieved himself from the payment of this interest unless he had actually tendered the amount clue.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b353-8\"><em>Held, </em>3. That upon the last instalment interest could not be charged for the whole time, as the legacies were still outstanding, and C refused to exonerate the bond from their payment, supposing that he was not bound to do so, but merely to give I) a personal indemnity against them. That it would however be otherwise, and interest might be charged, if IJ could be considered as having taken possession under bis purchase, or to have been in the reception of the rents and profits of the estate sold.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b353-9\"><em>Held, 4. </em>That D was to be considered as only' the purchaser of a dry remainder, there being a tenant for life, in possession.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b353-10\"><em>Held, 3. </em>That the wearing out of a life-estate, in a case of this kind, is not, os a general rule, equivalent to the taking of the profits so as to charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>the purchaser of the remainder with interest, unless the purchaser has \u25a0 <em>himself been in default, </em>and the delay in the completion of the contract has been owing to such default.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b354-5\"><em>Held, </em>6.

That D was not entitled to be credited for the legacy bought in by him, with what he paid for it, but only with its fair value at the date <em>of </em>the purchase; and that that value was to be estimated by analogy to the rule adopted in the court of chancery in this state, for ascertaining a woman\u2019s allowance in lieu of dower in land sold under a decree of that court, and not by a reference to <em>Dr. Halley\u2019s </em>table of observations.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b354-8\"><em>Held, </em>9. That each party, being in some respects in default, was to pay his own costs in the court of chancery.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-9\">Appeal from a decree of the Court of Chancery. The facts of this case are sufficiently stated in the final decree of the chancellor. The bill, which was filed by the appellant, (and (S'. <em>Chapman </em>his surety, who is since dead,) against the appellee, on the 20th of December 1819, prayed an injunction to stay proceedings on judgments at law obtained by the appellee against the appellant, and his surety. The injunction was granted, and on a motion to dissolve it, on the coming in of the answer, the following decretal order was passed at July term,, 1820, by</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-10\">Kilty, Chancellor. The motion to <em>dissolve the </em>injunction, in this case, was fully argued at the present term, and the proceedings have been considered. The rule recognized in the case of <em>Colegate vs. Lynch, </em>2 <em>Ilarr. \u00a1f Johns. </em>34, which was referred to, is considered a proper one, and has been since acted on; but it might be oppressive where the sum was small, and the party to be affected by it not in fault. In this case the credit claimed was $300, but it appears that $257 were credited, leaving only $43 to be further allowed, and it is not stated that <em>Smith </em>was called on to correct the mistake. There is, however, no occasion to rely on that rule, it being clear that the answer, and the exhibit referred to, do not constitute such a denial of the equity of the bill, as to entitle the defendant to a dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>solution of the injunction. The equity of the bill arises on the agreement in writing exhibited, and more particularly on the addition thereto respecting the legacies. The court is not called on at this time to decide finally on the means by which the land is to be exonerated; but as the legacies are not to be satisfied by <em>C. Dorsey, </em>it would seem that he ought to be secured from the risk of his being hereafter obliged to satisfy them, even though he might eventually be repaid; and on this question the answer of the defendant, although taken as true in respect to the facts, cannot extend to change the terms of the written agreement, or to establish its legal meaning and construction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-5\">Commissions afterwards issued to take testimony, which was taken, and the cause set down for hearing, and then referred to the'auditor to state and audit the accounts. On the coming in of the auditor\u2019s report, the following decree was pronounced by</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-6\">Johnson, Chancellor, (March term 1824.) <em>Henry J2. Smith, </em>by his last will, dated the 17th of July 1802, devised to his wife <em>Dicandia Smith, </em>\u201cduring her life, all the land whereon I now live, near and adjoining <em>Benedict Leonard Town, </em>in <em>Charles </em>county.\u201d To each of his two sisters he bequeathed <em>\u00a3 </em>175, and directed that so much of his personal property, as should be necessary, should be sold for the purpose of paying those legacies. To his wife, charged with the legacies, he gave all his personal property. The remainder, after the death of his wife, in the land devised to her for life, he gave to his brother <em>Charles S, Smith, </em>the defendant, in fee, charged with the payment of the sum of J3500 to each of his two sisters, <em>Margaret, </em>and <em>Mary Wheatley, </em>to be paid \u201cin one year after my brother enter into the possession of the above land;\u201d that is, in one year after the death of his wife, to whom the life-estate was given. On the death of the testator his widow possessed the property, and in the year 1812 intermarried with <em>Clement Dorsey, </em>one of the complainants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-7\">On the 13th of March 1814, <em>Dorsey </em>entered into a contract with <em>Smith </em>for the purchase of his remainder in the land, inaccurately termed his \u201creversionary interest.\u201d By \u00a1he agreement in writing signed by the parties, <em>Smith </em>\u201csells, and here* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>by agrees to sell unto the said <em>Clement Dorsey, </em>and his. heirs, all his <em>reversionary interest, </em>(being a fee simple in and to that tract or parcel of land devised by a certain <em>Henry </em>\u00ab#. <em>Smith, </em>lately deceased, to his wife <em>Dicandia Smith, </em>now <em>Dorsey,) </em>to and for the price of ten thousand dollars, payable in three equal annual payments; the first whereof to be paid on the 25th of December in the present year, and all of which money, except the sum of two thousand eight hundred dollars, bearing an interest <em>from </em>the date hereof till paid; and upon payment of which said purchase money, with the interest, the said <em>Smith </em>or his heirs, is to execute to said <em>Dorsey </em>a deed or release in fee simple; 'and the said <em>Dorsey </em>agrees to pay him the said money, with interest thereon as aforesaid; and further to execute to the said <em>Smith, </em>with <em>Philip Stuart, </em>or such security as <em>Smith </em>shall approve, a bond conditioned for the payment of the money as aforesaid, with interest thereon as aforesaid.\u201d On the agreement is the following endorsement signed by <em>Dorsey </em>and <em>Smith: </em>\u201cIt is Understood that the legacies charged by the will of <em>Henry A. Smith </em>to bes paid out of his real estate, are not to be satisfied by <em>C. Dorsey, </em>but that the land is to be exonerated by <em>Charles S. Smith </em>from the payment thereof.\u201d The controversy between the parties principally arises from this endorsement. The first instalment wa's paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-4\">On the 23d <em>of </em>March 1815, in pursuance of the stipulation that bond with approved security should be given for the purchase money, <em>Dorsey, </em>together with <em>Samuel Chapman,- </em>the other complainant, executed a bond to <em>Smith, </em>conditioned to .pay the sum of $6,666y as follows: $3,333$, with legal interest on the sum of $4,888 89, from the 25th of December 1814, on or before the 25th of December 1815; and the further sum of $3,333$, being the residue thereof, with interest on $2,444 44, from the. 25th of December 1815, on or before the 25th of December 1S16.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-5\">In the very commencement of the dealing between <em>Dorsey </em>and <em>Smith, </em>the instruments of writing, intended to meet the engagements of the parties, appear so inaccurately or hastily drawn, that there <em>i\u00e1 </em>nothing surprising in finding a difference of .opinion as to their true character and effect. In the original 'agreement, instead of stipulating that all the money, except the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>the sum of $2,666*, (that being the \u00bf01000 legacies charged on the laud,) bearing an interest from the date of the agreement, the whole, except the sum of $2,800, is to bear interest \u2014 a plain and manifest mistake. And the bond executed by <em>Dorsey </em>and <em>Chapman </em>varies most materially from the contract, under which-the bond was given, with the intention, so far, of executing that contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-5\">As early as the 14th of April 1815, it appears that a difference of opinion existed as to the true meaning of the original contract, so far as related to the sum of money exempted from interest on account o\u00ed the legacies; the one, Smith, contending that one third of that sum was to bo paid as the instalments became due; the other, that no part of that sum was to be paid until the last payment. The subject matter of <em>this </em>difference, they referred to the decision of a mutual friend; no opinion, however, appears to have <em>been </em>expressed by <em>him. On the same </em>day the error in the bond having been discovered, by an endorsement thereon signed by Smith, he agreed that \u201cthe condition of the preceding bond may be defeated by the following payments, to wit; $3,333$, with interest thereon from the 13th of March 1814, on or before the 25th of December 1815, and the further sum of $3,333$, with interest on $666 |., from the 13th of March 1814, on or before the 25th of December 1816.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-6\">In the fall of 1815, when the second payment was becoming due, tiie hill alleges that <em>Smith </em>in a conversation with Dorsey, expressed his apprehensions of bank paper, when <em>Dorsey </em>asked him if he would take good bonds. This he refused; but subsequently informed <em>Dorsey </em>he would take bank notes, which were obtained, and then <em>Smith </em>refused to accept them; and <em>Smith, </em>on being told by <em>Dorsey </em>he could not afford to keep so much money by him, appeared to assent to a proposition made by <em>Dorsey, </em>that he must wait until the money was raised from his crops. Other grounds for relief are set forth in the bill, not deemed material to be mentioned. The great obstacle to a settlement by the parties, was the legacies charged on the land; and after various letters passing between the parties, the one insisting that the land must be exonerated from the legacies previous to the payment of the purchase money, the other the reverse, ultimately one of the legacies was purchased by ' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number><em>Dorsey. </em>Suits Were brought OH the bond, judgments in <em>Charles </em>cotmty court obtained', which were removed to the court of appeals, and there affirmed at June term 1819.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-4\">\u25a0 On the- 20th of December 1819, the present bill was filed, and injunctions obtained, which were Continued by my predecessor, on the motion to dissolve.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-5\"><em>Smith, </em>in his answer, denies most of the equitable grounds relied o\u00f1 by the complainants for the interposition of this court, except that he admits' two payments, one of $300, and the other Of $900, which do n\u00f3t appe\u00e1r to be credited on the judgments; although there is nothing in the cause by which it appears that credit for them was ever\" refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-6\">Since the filing of the bill, <em>Smilh </em>has purchased th\u00e9 other legacy which was charged on the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-7\">'After the argument of the cause an interlocutory decree passed, directing the auditor to stats accounts' in various ways;- and i\u00f1 that decree it was remarked, \u201cas the merits of the cause' have b'eeri fully argued, there will be rio necessity that further fitoe should be spent\" by an argument on the report; the report is designed to enable this court, as well as the court of appe\u00e1ls,(should the Case go before 'them,) finally to adjudicate on the subject By pronouncing a judgment in favour of the party- entitled for th\u00e9 sum which may appear to be justly due.

Halley, which are usually resorted to in order to ascertain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>the present value of a legacy made payable after the expiration of a life. The report and accounts having laid the usual time, the cause at this term stands for final decision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-5\">Several points arise in this <em>case </em>\u2014 First. Ought interest to-be charged, and from what time?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-6\"><em>Second. </em>Is <em>Dorsey </em>entitled to a credit on account of the legacy charged on the land; and if so, to what amount; that is. ought he to have credit for the price at which he purchased it, or for its real value at that time? And</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-7\"><em>Third. </em>How should the costs be taxed?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-8\">In respect to the <em>first </em>poi nt. It appears to me perfectly unimportant to enter into a historical account respecting interest; for although at one time it was not allowed, yet that period has long since, in <em>Great </em>Britain, and this state, passed by. Nor is it of consequence whether the interest be considered a part of the debt, or a consequence proceeding from it; and it is equally unimportant whether interest be allowed by way of damages, or for the <em>use </em>or <em>forbearance </em>of money. Nor is it material to the ease under consideration, that there are instances in which interest is not allowed; the question is, is the present .a case in which it ought, or ought not to be charged?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-9\">I shall consider the question, <em>first </em>on principle; and <em>second, </em>fey the authorities. One of the ancient reasons for excluding interest has long since been exploded, to wit, that it should never be permitted, because money could not produce money. The reverse of this is most true, for nothing can more readily produce money, than money itself; for if a person is fortunate enough not only to have money sufficient for his ordinary demands, that is for the comfortable accommodation of himself and family, but also a surplus, unless that surplus is permitted to lay idle, locked up in his chest, or be injudiciously employed, he will soon find it the most profitable fund he could possess. If you refuse interest on the ground that money cannot produce money, you might as well refuse to the owner a compensation for any other property of which he is deprived, or which is withheld from his possession. Land itself unemployed, or injudiciously used, will never produce money; the labour, industry, and attention of man, must be exercised before its produce can be turned into cash \u2014 without labour it must forever remain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>\u25a0unproductive; and yet, if <em>the </em>land be wrongfully detained, whether it be productive or not in the possession of the wrongdoer, he is bound to account to the true owner for what it might have produced had it been advantageously or judiciously managed. The same reasoning applies to every other species of property, the possession whereof the true owner is deprived; and as long as money, by being employed, can command an interest sanctioned by the laws of the country in which it is, so long is he, who <em>withholds </em>it from the proprietor, bound to pay an interest, whether the money be used or permitted to be idle. It is sufficient that the creditor, or true owner, has been deprived of receiving, and of course from using it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-4\">But in the case now before the court, the parties, by their .solemn agreement, have expressly stipulated that interest should be paid on the whole amount of the purchase money, except .on the sum of $?,866-|, from the date of the original contract \u2014 \u25a0 the bond and its defeasance endorsed thereon <em>renew </em>the stipulation. The parties, men of intelligence and information, fully apprised of the nature of the interest in the land, which was sold by the one and purchased by the other, fix on its value. It never entered into their minds that the sum of $10,000, agreed to be given, and to be received, was the value of the land if the remainder had taken effect in possession; in other words, if the life-estate had terminated. No doubt, if the purchase money was not to bear interest, a sum equal to the interest, when the payments became due, would have been added to the price agreed on. But, no objection against interest being paid, arises from the contracts themselves; that it ought not to be paid, is insisted on by the complainants, inasmuch as the defendant, on account of the outstanding legacies, was never able to comply with his part of the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-5\">This leads to an inquiry into the true construction of that contract. It is contended, on the part of <em>Dorsey, </em>that it was incumbent on <em>Smith, </em>before he could equitably claim Ihe purchase money, to take up the legacies, or obtain a release from the legatees to free the land from its responsibility. <em>Smith </em>in his answer, expressly states, that those legacies had for sometime been an obstacle to a contract between them, and that he agreed to take so small a sum as $10,000 for his interest, on the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>ground that ho might have the use of the money some considerable time before he could be called <em>on to </em>pay <em>them; </em>that he was always willing to indemnify <em>Dorset/, </em>and would have done so, but that he insisted, after the contracts were made, and before he would pay, on the previous removal or raising of the legacies, which was contrary to the previous understanding of the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-5\">Ey the original agreement, not one word is mentioned respecting the legacies. The $10,000 were to be paid in three equal payments, and although $\u00a3,666 66, a part thereof, were not to hear interest, yet, in order to make the payments equal, the contract appears to require that one third part of that sum should have been included in each payment, and not to be re-, tained for the last. A different interpretation would make the payments unequal, contrary to the express stipulation of the instrument. As the legacies were known to he a charge on the laud, <em>Dorsey </em>would have been hound <em>to </em>pay them when they became due, or rather, the land in his hands, or of those claiming under him, must have been responsible \u2014 the $10,000 would have been the price for the remainder <em>cum on ere. </em>If it had been the intention of the parties that the legacies should he removed before the payment of the whole or any part of the purchase money, it might easily have been so expressed; but so far from stating with precision how far the payments were to he influenced by them, not one word is said on the subject It may have happened from their having before been an obstacle to an agreement being closed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-6\">There is very little probability that any expectation was entertained that the legacies would become due before the purchase money for the remainder; but the contract expresdy points out, the respective periods of payments Except for what is termed by the parties the \u00a3\u00a3rider,\u201d <em>no </em>doubt could exist on the subject. The first subject of difference between the parties was not the legacies, but Iho $2,666 66, whether that sum should be equally paid, as the instalments became due, or reserved to the last.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-7\">To remove the necessary inference tint the remainder in the 'and was purchased subject to the legac\u2019es, the endorsement signed by the parties is attached to the written agreement- \u2014 -\u00a3\u00a3T <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>is understood that the legacies charged by the will of <em>Henrif Jl. Smith </em>to be paid out of his real estate, are not to be satisfied <em>by C. </em>Horsey, but that the land is to be exonerated by <em>Charles S. Smith from the payment </em>thereofIt does not appear to me that this endorsement to the original agreement demanded that the legacies should be taken up before the purchase money for the remainder was paid. It was not in the power of <em>Smith </em>to <em>compel </em>the legatees to release them, <em>or </em>to part with them, nor until they were discharged was it in his power to clear the land from being charged with the payment, and <em>of </em>course it was not in his power to <em>exonerate </em>the land he had sold \u201cfrom the payment thereof.\u201d But it may have beeii in his power effectually to free <em>Dorsey </em>from any <em>real danger </em>of being forced to pay them. If <em>Smith </em>had insisted on the payment of the <em>whole </em>purchase money, without first giving an adequate indemnity, the sufficiency whereof this tribunal might have been resorted to to determine, he would have been restrained from enforcing the payment. If <em>Dorsey </em>had paid the second instalment, and refused to pay the third, insisting on his right to retain at least as much of that pa}nnent as would be sufficient to meet the legacies, he would have been protected by this court; and unless full and complete indemnity was offered, <em>Dorsey </em>would have been suffered to retain the #3,666 66, paying the interest, or to bring that sum into court to be invested \u2014 the interest for the use of <em>Smith </em>\u2014 the principal to be paid to the legatees when due. This course would have done complete justice to the parties, and carried fully into execution their engagements. The legacies, therefore, in my opinion do not deprive <em>Smith </em>of his title to the interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-5\">In respect to the allegations in the bill of <em>Smith\u2019s </em>refusing to receive bank notes, doubting their solvency, and creating an impression in the mind of <em>Dorsey </em>of <em>Smith\u2019s </em>intention to wait until the money could be raised by crops \u2014 again expressing a willingness to receive bank paper, which was procured at great inconvenience and loss, it might suffice to observe, that most of those allegations are denied in the answer; and that there is no proof that <em>Dorsey </em>ever procured or tendered the notes But if he had obtained the notes, and retained them by him ready at all times to pay on the removal of the legacies, or if he had ob <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>t-ained specie in sufficient abundance, and retained it unemployed, yet unless he gave notice to <em>Smith </em>of having the money, and tiiai it was ready for him, and as to <em>Dorsey </em>remained unemployed, it would not free him from interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-4\">'In the case of <em>Powell vs. </em>Martyr, 8 <em>Ves. </em>116, the defendant purchased at auction \u2014 deposited part of the purchase money\u2014 the balance to be paid at a future date; where the purchaser was to receive the rents and profits. Objections arose as to the title, when a long correspondence took place, and after considerable delay the objections were removed. During the time of doubt respecting the title, the money was deposited with the vendee\u2019s solicitor for the purpose of being paid when the objections were removed; and yet he had to pay interest; for according to the book, \u201cit does not follow that the mere circumstance that the vendor was not ready to complete the title at the day will vary the rule. The purchaser must stale something more than mere delay, viz. <em>that he has not had the benefit of his money; and m some way the vendor must have notice </em>that the vendee has placed himself in that situation.\u201d In <em>Childs vs. Lord Jlbingdon. </em>1 <em>Ves. jr. </em>04, the interest purchased was a reversion upon an estate <em>for lives. </em>One life only was remaining when the application was made to complete the purchase. <em>Lrskine, </em>Chancellor \u2014 \u201cHe must pa}\u2019 interest. A man cannot purchase a dry reversion, and then lie by for years and expect to pay no more for it then, than if he had completed it immediately.\u201d No case, it is believed, can be produced where the parties, perfectly apprised of the nature of the interest sold, (whether it was such as became or might become immediately productive to the vendee, or was what is termed a ury reversion, and therefore supposed unproductive,) stipulated to pay interest, has the interest been refused. In the present ease no rational doubt can arise, but that the nature of the estate sold was perfectly understood; and the contract, in respect to interest, speaks fin itself. My opinion is, therefore, that the vendee is to be charged with interest cm all the purchase money, except on $3,666 66, from the date of the oripjna)\u2019 contract, to wi', ilie 12f,h of March 1814; on one third of that sum from the 35th ol December following; on one other third from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>the 25th of December 1815, and on the remaining third from the 25th ot December 1816.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-5\">In respect to the <em>second </em>question. Is credit to be allowed for the legacy purchased, and for what amount?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-6\">It is not very evident how much was paid for the legacy purchased by <em>Dorsey </em>from <em>James Wheally, </em>who is admitted to be entitled to one of the legacies charged on the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-7\">By the rider, or endorsement on the original agreement, th<em>e </em>\u2018legacies are not to be satisfied by Dorsey.\u201d If, therefore, he has undertaken to satisfy them, or purchase them, as between him and <em>Smith, </em>he is only entitled to their worth at the time of purchase, and not to their worth when they take effect in possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-8\">According to calculations by which the extent of a widow\u2019s dower in land when converted into money, and by which legacies directed to be paid after a life-estate, are regulated, the legacy purchased by <em>Dorsey </em>was only worth #560 22; indeed, by the <em>English </em>rule, only #349 06. But as that rule is founded on compound interest, on the principle that the interest Should (as there it may,) be immediately invested, although w\u00e9 adopt the time at which it is most probable the right to receive the legacy will arrive, yet its value is not come at by compound, but simple interest; and by that rule <em>Dorsey </em>can only claim, in addition to the two payments, the sum of #560 22, according to the auditor\u2019s statement in account No. 6. And the sum due, according to the statement of <em>the </em>auditor by an additional ac- . Count made in pursuance of this decree, amounts, on the 17th of February 1817, (the time when the auditor\u2019s first statements were made,) to the sum of #5,867 25, including interest to <em>the </em>day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-9\">In directing the principles by which the sum justly and <em>bond Jide </em>due is come at, no regal\u2019d is had to the manner of discharging the first instalment; for as the judgments, including interest and costs, excluding the two payments, the benefit of which is obtained by the authority of the court to the extent of those payments, and for the value of the legacy, relief is obtained here; but those who ask equity must do equity, and therefore the only relief which can be obtained against the amount of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>judgments, is to get free from their effects by the payment of the sum justly due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-5\">The <em>last </em>point is the Costs. Considering the difficulties arising in the cause, and the want of an early offer on the part of <em>Smith </em>to give complete indemnity as far as practicable, and the persevering demands on the part of <em>Dorsey </em>for the entire removal of the legacies, which the contracts did not warrant, and his refusal even to pay the second instalment, it is not thought correct, to charge either party with the whole costs, more especially as <em>Dorsey </em>will obtain credit for the $300 and $900, which do not appear credited on the judgments, although it seems evident no intention existed to deny them; but not having been credited, executions might have issued for the full amount of the judgments. \u2014 Decreed, that unless the complainants shall, on or before the 13th of May next, pay to the defendant the aforesaid sum of $5S67 25, with interest on the sum of $5831 39, a part thereof, from the 17th of February 1817, until paid, or bring the same into this court to be paid to the defendant, that the injunctions heretofore issued in this cause be and the same, from and after the said 13th of May, are hereby dissolved: Provided nevertheless, that no more be levied under executions on the .said judgments than the said sum of $5357 25, with interest on the sum of $5831 39, a part 1 hereof, from Ihe 17th of February <em>1817. </em>\u2014 Decreed also, that each parly in this court bear his own costs.

If the appellant had sued the appellee for the amount paid for <em>Wheaily\u2019s </em>legacy, he would have recovered the amount so paid. He must be considered as the agent of the appellee, doing that with his money which he was bound to do himself. The rule adopted by the chancellor, in allowing the appellant for the legacy purchased by him, was not the correct one. Doctor <em>Halley\u2019s </em>rule is not the chancery rule of\" this state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-4\">On the <em>sixth </em>point. If the money was withheld, then interest is to be paid. When had the appellee a right to call for his money? It may be answered \u2014 When he gave an equivalent for it. What was that equivalent? A deed for the land, and a release from the legatees. Until he did so, he had no right to demand cither the money or interest. The deed and release, and payment of the money, were concurrent acts to be performed at the same time. When the appellee brought his suit on the bond, he had no right to demand payment. He had no right to demand interest except for three years if he had complied in time. After he refused to comply, he had no right to require interest. Refusing to comply with a contract is a fraud; and a new contract sprung up after that refusal. <em>Hoare vs. Allen, 2 Dall.

But suppose he is not let into possession under the purchase, then of course he does not pay interest. The case referred to is not applicable to the present. Here the purchaser was in possession under a superior title; and the contract for the purchase of the remainder was not a purchase of possession, but of title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-6\">But here the appellee had no right to receive payment until he removed the incumbrance, which he had contracted to do. <em>Sugden, </em>312. In <em>Child vs. Lord Abingdon, </em>1 <em>Ves. jr. </em>94, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>also referred to by the chancellor, there was a solemn contract to pay interest by a third person, not by the tenant for life, who was the purchaser. In <em>Ex parte, Manning, 2 P. Wms. </em>410, the wearing out of the life was equivalent to profits. So also in <em>Davy vs. Barber, 2 Atk. </em>489. But in <em>Blount vs. </em>Blount, 3 <em>Atk. </em>636, the doctrine in the two last cases is exploded. <em>Growsock vs. Smith, 3 Anstr. </em>877. cited in <em>Sugden, </em>323. <em>Maynard\u2019s </em>case, 2 <em>Freeman 2, </em>cited in <em>Sugden, </em>312.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-5\">On the <em>seventh </em>and <em>eighth </em>points.

The decree is, that the money should be brought into court, and when so brought in, the chancellor would not direct the payment over until a deed for the land was executed to the appellant. But the record shows that a -deed for the land had been executed, and it was exhibited with the defendant\u2019s answer as an <em>escrow.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-9\">Oil the <em>second </em>point. The credit of <em>$900 </em>was not allowed on the judgments at law, as affirmed in the court of appeals, of course it was proper to be noticed in the decree, otherwise the appellee might have issued an execution for the whole sum, There was no injury, but rather a benefit to the appellant in allowing the credit. It is true the credit was entered <em>on the </em>judgments in the county court, but the records transmitted under Ihe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>appeals to the court of appeals, do not state the credit; and ft was on the affirmed judgments, executions were to issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-4\">On the <em>twelfth </em>point If the decree in other respects ft right, then it is correct as to the costs. <em>West vs. </em>Biscoe, 6 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>Johns. </em>460. <em>Glenn vs. Fisher, </em>6 <em>Johns.

There is nothing in the contract which binds the appellee to clear the incumbrance on the land at the. end of three years. As the appellant neglected to pay the last instalment in December 1816, interest was then to be charged on the whole sum due. The appellant, being tenant of the feo under his purchase, he could cultivate the land with more ad\u00bb vantage than he could do as tenant for the life of Mrs. <em>Dorsey. Powell vs. Martyr, </em>8 <em>Ves. </em>146. <em>Fludyer vs. Cocker, </em>12 <em>Ves. 25. </em>When the land was sold to the appellant if was <em>worth </em>$10,000; and if so it is now worth at least $20,000 \u2014 the life-estate being supposed to be nearly expended. To compensate the appellee interest should be paid on the purchase money. <em>Ex parte Manning, 2 P.

There appear to be two principal questions presented in this cause, for the consideration of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\"><em>First. </em>Ought the appellant, <em>Dorsey, </em>to be charged with interest, from what time, and on what portion of the purchase money?</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\"><em>Second. </em>For what sum ought <em>Dorsey </em>to be credited on account of the legacy purchased by him?</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">The determination of the first question will depend' upon the construction which shall be given to the contract between the parties.- When the appellant purchased the remainder upon the death of his wife, <em>Smith </em>stipulated that he would <em>exonerate </em>the lands so purchased from the payment of the legacies charged upon it. We cannot concur with the chancellor in the belief, that by this <em>Smith </em>only agreed to indemnify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number><em>Dorsey </em>against the payment of the legacies, but wo consider it an undertaking to free the lands sold from all liability to pay them. The lands were charged with those legacies, and it was the object of the parties that the title to <em>Dorsey </em>should pass unincumbered by them. There is no impossibility in this covenant., as events hare proven; it was one, to be sure, which Might be somewhat difficult in its execution, but the legal obligation of tl;e party must not on this account be changed. It. is his agreement which has been voluntarily entered into, and the ether party bad a right to its performance before he could in equity be called on to pay the whole purchase money. The first, instalment due by <em>Dorsey </em>on the original contract for the sale of the lands was paid, and before the second instalment became due <em>Dorsey </em>entered into a bond, conditioned for the payment to <em>Smith </em>of the residue of the purchase money, as follows: $S,333\u00a7, with interest from tiie 13th of March 1814, oh or before the 25th of December 1815, and the sum of $3,333J, with interest on $66G|-, from the day of sale, on the 35th of December 1816. Thus l^ this contract there seems to have been a partial modification of the original agreement -as to the payments, and being the last stipulation must be considered as binding on the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">By a fair construction of these agreements, although <em>Dorsey </em>had agreed to pay the whole of the purchase money by the 25th of December 1816, and <em>Smith </em>had stipulated generally that the land should be exonerated from the payment of the legacies, without having named any definite time, we consider that he was hound to have complied with his contract on the day at which the last instalment became payable. But <em>Smith </em>had, unquestionably, the whole time until that period to comply witn his part of the agreement, and could not, until then, be considered in default. <em>Dorsey\u2019s </em>second instalment, with interest thereon, became due a year before, according to this construction of die agreement, <em>Smith </em>could be called on to comply on his part. He never could have looked to the exoneration of the land as a condition upon which that instalment was to bo paid. lie should have paid it when it became due, ami his liability to pay interest thereon is not in the least changed by &lt;atry oLthe ,subsenueut. events, lie had expressly agreed to p;ry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>intei\u2019est on that sum from the date of the purchase; and the \u2022 same remark may be made with regard to a, part of the third instalment, to wit, the sum of $666-|. On this he had expressly stipulated to pay interest. Could he, On any principles of equity, claim to be relieved from this express agreement? Has he tendered the money; has be been ready ever since to' pay it? There is no evidence of this kind. To have placed himself irt a situation to be relieved against the payment of interest on this sum, he should not only have professed a willingness to have paid, but he should have tendered the amount, which be has not done. We therefore think, that the appellant should pay interest on the second instalment, and on $&gt;666j-, of the \u25a0third Instalment. But as regards the residue of the third instalment, to wit, the sum of $2,666-|, it is to be observed, that there is not only no express, promise to pay, interest, but there is, by the terms of the contract, an entire exemption from payment of Interest. That sum was to be paid on the <em>26th of </em>December 1816, without interest; but <em>Smith </em>having put a different construction on the agreement, positively refused to <em>exonerate </em>the lands from the payment of the legacies. <em>Dorsey </em>was then justified in withholding from him payment of this sum; and according to the spirit of the original agreement, ought not, after such default, and until compliance, be compelled to pay interest on that sum. There is no principle of law which Would, in such a case, entitle the vendor, to the payment of interest. Had <em>Dorsey </em>been in possession of the lands, in virtue of the purchase, dr in the perception of the rents.and profits, in equity he would have been compellable to pay interest, because such advantages would have been considered as. equivalent to interest. But he had not possession by the .contract. The tenant for life was. in possession, and enjoying, in virtue of such life-estate, the rents and profits. He was the purchaser of a <em>dry remainder. </em>But it is contended that the wearing out of the life-estate is equivalent to taking the profits.. And this it is true, is the general position laid down in <em>Sugden, </em>323; and the cases of <em>Ex parte Manning, </em>2 <em>P. </em>Williams, 410, and <em>Child vs. Lord Abingdon, </em>1 <em>Ves. Jr. </em>94, are cited in support of the position. The case of <em>Ex parte Manning </em>came in review before Lord <em>Hardwicke, in </em>the case of <em>Blount </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number><em>vs Blount, 3 </em>Atk. 635, who remarked that he never knew \u201cthe court take into consideration, as a reason for the purchaser paying interest, the wearing out of lives.\u201d This doctrine of Lord <em>Ilardicicke </em>is sanctioned in the case of <em>Growsock vs. Smith, </em>3 <em>Anstruther, </em>877. The falling in of lives may be considered as equivalent to the rents and profits. <em>Davy vs. Barber, </em>2 <em>Atk. </em>489. <em>Blount vs. Blount, </em>3 <em>Atk. </em>636. And in the. <em>case Ex parte Manning </em>a life had fallen in between the date of the purchase, and the application to complete the purchase; and besides, in that ease the purchaser, from the date of the confirmation of the report of sale, was considered as entitled to the estate, and no obstacles were presented, or could be presented, to a completion of the title; but here the incumbrances stipulated to be released were still hanging over the purchased estate, with refusal on the part of the veudor to release them. In the case of <em>Child vs. Lord Abingdon, </em>there was a decree for the payment of interest The Lord Chancellor said, aman could <em>not lie by .for years, </em>who was the purchaser of a dry reversion, and expect <em>to </em>pay no more for <em>it </em>than if he had completed it immediately. The decision in this, case is put upon the ground of delay in the purchaser who was waiting until the remaining life dropped in. Besides, in this case, like the case of <em>Ex parte Manning, </em>the purchaser's title. might be.considered as only requiring payment on his part to complete it. The principles which mark the distinction between the case-uuder consideration, and those above cited, are. too obvious to require further comment, or more minute illustration. When <em>Smith </em>complied with his contract in exonerating the land hy the purchase of the last outstanding legacy'', he was entitled to receive the part of the last instalment, amounting to the sum of $2,666?, and as it was not then paid, he was entitled to interest thereon from that period. This le~. gacy was purchased by the appellee on the 7th of April 1821, from which .day he should have interest on that sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">We consider the release executed hy <em>Margaret Smith </em>valid for the purpose for which it was intended, and that the proof of its execution is sufficient. Where an instrumentary wit ness resides out of, the jurisdiction of the court, so as not to be amenable to its process, or cannot be found after strict and diligent in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>quiry, the proof of the handwriting of such witness is evidence' of everything on the face of the instrument. The scaling and delivery will be presumed. <em>Vide 1 Phil. Evid. </em>419, (362,) and the cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The consideration of the sum which should be allowed <em>Dofsey </em>for the legacy purchased by him, involves a question which has not been adjudicated by this tribunal. Should he be allow'-ed what he proves he has paid for it? We think not.' By'the contract he was not to pay the legacies; it was <em>Smith\u2019s </em>business to disencumber the land. And, if he is made to suffer by the purchase, he has no person to blame but himself. When <em>Smith </em>refused to exonerate the land in violation of his contract, be subjected himself to the legal consequences of such an act; but it would be a most inequitable consequence of such refusal to say that <em>Dorsey </em>was thereby constituted his agent, with unrestricted powers to make the purchase; such a result would have placed him at <em>Dorsey\u2019s </em>mercy. But equity demands, that having purchased the legacy he should be entitled to a credit, as against <em>Smith, </em>for the legacy, at its fair value, from the date of the purchase, (17 Feb. 1817.)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">By what rule is its value to be estimated? The chancellor, in his decree, has adopted that value which ivas ascertained by the auditor by a reference to Doctor <em>Halley\u2019s </em>table of observations, which have been used in <em>England </em>for the purpose of ascertaining the value of life annuities, and reversionary interests.' These tables are framed upon long and accurate observations oa the bills of mortality in <em>England, </em>and in other places, and may not be an unsafe guide lor the purpose in the region or latitude for which they were calculated. But the probability of the duration of human life, cannot be the same in every latitude and climate In the one it may be prolonged to the greatest age \u2014 in the other abbreviated to what, in a more healthful region, would be considered as but a middle age; and even, in\u2022deed, in the same district of country the chance for the duration of life is by no means the same. Thus, would tables suited for the low lands of <em>Louisiana, </em>furnish any index of the duration of human life in the highlands of <em>Maryland? </em>And \u25a0even in our own state, could any dependence be placed in the -/\u00a1Calculation of the value, of an. annuity, or of a reversion expect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>ant upon a life, which would say that as great a probabiliiy existed for the duration of human life amid the marshes of the <em>Che.sape.ahe Bay, </em>as in the mountains of <em>Mleghany? </em>These observations will be found to be verified by an examination of <em>Hr. Halley\u2019s </em>tables, as suited to different parts of England, and to places on the continent. Whether these tables, upon which the chancellor's decree is founded, are suitable to this \u00bfstate, could only be told by a long series of observations here, which not having been made, wc conceive it would be unsafe to adopt them. In ascertaining the value of this legacy at the time of its purchase, we apprehend, there would be a much hotter chance of justice being effected by applying by analogy the rule adopted long since in the court of chancery for the purpose of ascertaining the allowance to a 'woman, in lieu of dower, in land sold under a decree of that court. Mrs. <em>Dorsey </em>is shown to have been about, forty years of age at the date of tho purchase, and the calculation should be made in conformity with the above rule. By such calculation the legacy was worth' the sum of $761 90. With this value the appellant should ho credited on the day of the purchase of the legacy. He should also have credit for the sum of $300, paid on the 26th of Fe~bruary 1816, and the further sum of $900 on the 29th of December 1816.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">We concur with the chancellor in his judgment as to the\" .costs incurred in that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">It is our opinion the appellant should be decreed to pay inte the court of chancery tho sum due <em>Smith, </em>on some day to be fixed by this court, and on failure to pay by such day, that the injunction ought to be dissolved. And it is further our opinion, that the appellee, incase the appellant should pay into court the sum ascertained to be due by the day to be appointed, be only-permitted to receive the same, upon his satisfying the chancellor that he has executed, acknowledged and delivered, to the appellant, <em>Dorsey, </em>a good and sufficient deed of conveyance, passing all his right to the lands sold the appellant in conformity with their contract dated the 13th of March 1814. Decreed, that the decree of the court of chancery, except as to the costs incurred in that court, be reversed, and that the appellant recover against t\u00edre appellee, the. oijsls by the appellant expended in tfie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>prosecution of his appeal to and in this court. And this-court, 'proceeding to pronounce such decree as the court of chancery ought to, have <em>pronounced </em>\u2014 Decreed also, that there shall be credited on the judgments mentioned in the proceedings the Sum of $300, paid on the 26th of February 1816; the sum df $900, on the 29th of December 1816; and of the further sum of $761 90, paid on the 17th of February 1817, to <em>James Wheatly, </em>for his mother\u2019s legacy.
