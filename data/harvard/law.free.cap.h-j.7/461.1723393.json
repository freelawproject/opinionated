That <em>Veasey </em>answered there was a credit that he wad entitled to for wheat, which he had delivered to <em>Bassett, </em>which he could not then ascertain, but that he would in a short time go up to <em>Cecil </em>county and see Mr. <em>Bassett, </em>and ren\u00e9w the said bond. The witness further proved, that some time in March 1815, he called again on <em>Veasey </em>for the purpose of getting the bond settled, and observed to <em>Veasey </em>that he had not complied with his promise in coming up to <em>Cecil </em>county and renewing-his bond, to which the said <em>Veasey </em>said, that the reason why .he did not do so, was that <em>Bassett </em>had drawn an order on <em>him </em>in favour of <em>C. TV. Thomas, </em>which he had paid, and which had taken all his money, and that he the said <em>Veasey </em>would be up in .about three weeks and renew his bond; and he further told the witness that <em>Bassett </em>need not be uneasy about his debt, for that it was very safe;that the farm he then lived on belonged to him, and was paid tor, and that he <em>Veasey </em>would pay him to the uttermost farthing what he owed him, as <em>Bassett </em>had been very indulgent to him, and he hoped he would still indulge him further, and that he was and had been the best friend he had in the world, and that he should never lose any thing by him. The witness further proved that he had' no orders from <em>Bassett </em>to sue, nor did he say any thing about it. The plaintiffs also proved that the original bond, the execution of which was proved by J C, of which the paper herein mentioned is a copy, was in the possession of the said J C, the witness, and produced by him to <em>Veasey </em>at the time of the abve conversations stated to the witness, and that the said bond has since been lost, and that the copy of the bond, and of the endorsements which he produced, was a true copy. It purported to be a copy of a joint and several bond, executed on the 1st of November 1793, by <em>Lambert Veasey, William Veasey </em>and <em>John Makin, </em>to <em>Richard Bassett, </em>in the penalty of J13S0 17 <em>2, </em>money of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>conditioned for the payment of \u00bfS690 8 7, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>or before the 1st of November 1798, with legal interest.

Veasey, </em>for the sum of <em>$39 </em>72. That he called on <em>Veasey </em>afterwards, he does not know when, and presented him with the said order, which <em>Veasey </em>paid, and observed to the witness that he owed <em>Bassett, </em>and that he had been one of the best friends he ever had, and had acted a fatherly part by him.
