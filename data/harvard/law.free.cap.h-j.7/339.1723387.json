The defendant then gave in evidence, that the said <em>Keenan </em>was born in <em>Ireland, </em>and had not been naturalized in this country, but had been living in the city of <em>Baltimore </em>from the end of the year 1815; and then prayed the opinion of the court to the jury, that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. Which opinion the Court, <em>[Archer, </em>Ch. J. and Han<em>son </em>and Ward, A. J.] refused to give. The defendant excepted. Verdict for <em>the </em>plaintiff, and damages assessed to $'517 76.

The person appointed collector was an alien, and did not make the declaration, or take the oath prescribed by the act of 1794, <em>ch. </em>53, <em>s. 2, </em>to be taken by a collector, and that therefore the appellant, being a surety, was not liable on the bond. <em>2. </em>No breaches were suggested by the plaintiff in pursuance of the statute. 3. The copy of the bond offered in evidence was not properly certified. 4. It does not appear that <em>Keenan </em>was appointed collector, and authorised to collect the tax imposed, nor was it proved that he did collect it, or any part of it. 5. The agreement entered into by the counsel of the parties, was only that the <em>defendant </em>might be placed in the same situation as if he had pleaded performance, &amp;e. It does not authorise the plaintiff to do that which could not be done without the agreement. It was not intended to benefit the plaintiff, but solely for the benefit of the defendant. The plaintifi was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>therefore bound to assign the breaches. <em>Wilmer vs. </em>Harris, 5 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>Johns. </em>1. <em>Van Benthuysen vs. </em>De <em>Witt. </em>4 <em>Johns.

S.) </em>and <em>Gill, </em>for the Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq9\">1. The <em>agreement </em>as to the pleadings was manifestly drawn by the defendant\u2019s counsel below, and it cannot be supposed that it was not intended to give the same latitude to the plaintiff, that it accorded to the defendant. It is in substance a <em>case stated, </em>and ought so to be construed. 3. The pleadings are perfectly correct; and the verdict was given under the act of 1785, <em>ch. 80, s. 13. Nil debet </em>is not a good plea to a bond; whether demurred to or not. <em>Roberts vs. Mariett, 2 Saund. </em>187 a, <em>(note 2.) Bullis vs. Giddens, 8 Johns. Rep. 82. Smith vs. Jansen, Ibid 111. </em>Nor is <em>non infregit cmwentionem, </em>nor <em>non damnificatus. </em>If such a plea is agreed to be received with leave, it dispenses with all further pleadings, except the <em>similiter. </em>The leave can only be so construed. No breaches can with propriety then be suggested, nor a special replication to a plea of <em>nil debet </em>be put <em>in </em>\u2014 Cutler <em>vs. Southern, </em>1 <em>Saund. </em>117, <em>(note 1.) </em>1 <em>Chitty\u2019s Plead. 478 </em>So with the pleas of <em>non infregit conventionem, </em>and <em>non damnificatus, </em>1 <em>Saund. </em>117, <em>(note 1.) Brent vs. Davis, </em>10 <em>Wheat. </em>396. <em>Corporation of Washington vs. Young, Ibid 406. Rawlins vs. Danvers, 5 Esp. Rep. </em>38. No case can be found in any book of pleadings, or elsewhere, that breaches were ever assigned after a plea of <em>nil debet </em>had been put in with leave. Under such a plea there can be no oyer. 2 <em>Harr. Ent. </em>549. To the other pleas there is oyer, which becomes a part of the declaration. <em>Arch. Dig. 187, </em>3. Even if it fully appeared that the collector had not taken the oath, or made the declaration required, it is no defence in a suit against him or his sureties. It would prevent his sustaining a suit as plaintiff, but he cannot be permitted to set up his own <em>disqualification; </em>or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>to uso his own delinquency and breach of duty to resist payment of what he has by virtue of his office beeome possessed of. So far as the <em>rights of others </em>are concerned, he is what he professed to he, a legally constituted officer. 16 <em>Vin. Ab. </em>tit. <em>Officers &amp; Offices, (G 4,) 114.

It does not appear whether <em>Keenan </em>took the oath or made the declaration, or not. His not being a citizen of the <em>U. S. </em>is no proof that he did not take such oath. In the absence of all evidence the <em>pre.ntmpiion </em>is he did what his duty required of him. At least where he is called upon, he is to answer for his delinquency. The levy court did their duty. If it is proved he acted as collector, his appointment need not be proved. <em>Arch.

R. </em>648; and <em>Dickson vs. Evans, </em>6 <em>T.

The defence in this case cannot be sustained. It would be contrary to every principle of law to allow a man to avail himself of his own wrong, and plead a breach of duty as an excuse for a gross fraud upon the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\"><em>Keenan </em>being regularly appointed collector under the act of 1794, <em>ch. </em>53, having given bond, with security, for the faithful performance of his duty, and received from the levy court the necessary books to make his collection, will be presumed to have taken the oath prescribed by law, asa prerequisite to the performance of his official duties. It cannot be for him to say, a suit on this bond shall be defeated by his own neglect or malfeasance.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">The securities, <em>in point of law, </em>must he placed in the same predicament. They have engaged that <em>Keenan </em>shall faithfully discharge his duty as collector, part of that duty was to take the oath prescribed by law, to enable him to make his collection, and they cannot be allowed, (in this respect,) a defence that is denied to the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>The appellant has also relied on errors in the pleadings\u2014 that this is an action on a bond with a collateral condition, and no breaches are assigned. This is fatal, unless cured by the agreement filed by the parties. By a paper signed by the counsel on both sides, it was agreed, in the several actions depending on the same bond against the sureties in the county court, \u201cthat, the defendants in these cases shall plead <em>ml debet, </em>and that on the trial of the issues on that plea <em>they </em>shall severally be entitled to make all such legal objections, and give all kinds of evidence, which they could be entitled to make or give by or under any mode or form of pleas or pleading which could be legally used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Whether the court are bound by a strict grammatical construction of this agreement, or may be permitted to look into the circumstances that gave rise to it to ascertain its true character, is the only difficulty presented by it. It is certainly a very loose course of proceeding, and the court cannot but express their regret, that instead of regular pleadings in the case, they are required to act on a substitute not free from ambiguity, and upon which the counsel cannot agree. See the case of <em>Orme vs. Lodge, </em>3 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>Johns. </em>83.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The court are of opinion, that this agreement ought to receive a liberal construction, to carry into effect what appears to have been the intention of the parties, and not one to defeat the plaintiff, whatever might have been the merits of his case. It is considered an agreement to waive <em>all errors in the pleadings, </em>and that instead of proceeding in the regular course, by praying oyer of the bond, pleading performance and assigning breaches, that the plea of <em>nil debet </em>shall be received, and under that plea the cause should be tried, as if all the pleadings had been regular. In this view of it, it would not be injurious to either party; its only effect would be to save trouble in pleading, and the merits of the case would come fairly before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">If this was not intended to be its effect, it is difficult to conceive why the defendant did not avail himself of it in the court below. Both parties proceeded to the trial of the cause, under this state of the pleadings, and that affords strong evidence? that the agreement was considered as a <em>toaiver of errors.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
