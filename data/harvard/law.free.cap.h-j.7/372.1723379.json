and the said <em>John G. </em>net having replevied the said goods and chattels, within the said space of five days, the defendant in his own right afterwards, and after the expiration of said five days, to wit, on the first day of July, in the year aforesaid, caused the same to be in due manner appraised, by two sworn appraisers, according to the form of the statute in such case made and provided, and after such appraisement, the defendant sold the same, and applied the proceeds of said sale in satisfaction of said rent., and the charges of the distress and appraisement aforesaid, As he lawfully might, for the cause aforesaid, inasmuch as the plaintiff had not, replevied the said goods and chattels, or paid the said arrear of rent, together with the costs and charges of said distress, and appraisement aforesaid; and this he is ready to verify: Wherefore he prays judgment if the plaintiff, his action aforesaid thereof to have or maintain ought, and so forth.\u201d To this last plea the plaintiff replied as follows: \u201cAnd the plaintiff, as to the said plea of the defendant, by him secondly above-pleaded, as to the said several trespasses in that plea mentioned. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>\u25a0am\" therein attempted to be justified, saith, that the plaintiff, fey reason of any thing mentioned by the defendant in that plea alleged, ought not to be barred from having and maintaining his aforesaid action;

and this he, the plaintiff, prays may be inquired of by the country, and so forth.\u201d The defendant demurred specially to the replication, and assigned the following causes of demurrer in law to the said replication, that is to say, \u201cthat the same is double, inasmuch as the said replication tends to put in issue several various and distinct matters, when the . \u00abame ought to have put one single matter in issue only, and al.so, that he attempts to put in issue by said replication, all <em>the </em>several matters and things in the said plea contained, whereas he should have traversed one single matter whereon a proper-issue might be joined; :n this, that the defendant states in his plea the following distinct facts, to wit,\u201d &amp;c. \u201cAnd the replication tends to put in issue all the various and distinct matters aforesaid, when the same ought to have put one single matter in issue only. And that the said replication is uncertain, not issuable and wants form,\u201d &amp;e. The plaintiff joined in demurrer. The county court sustained the demurrer, and rendered judgment for the defendant.

The facts stated in the defendant\u2019s plea were essential to Hs defence, but the plaintiff did not chuse to select any one of the acts, but took issue on the whole. Any one of the facts alleged in the pica would, if proved, defeat the plaintiff\u2019s action. The replication should have selected some one of the facts Upon which the issue should be tried, and not deny the whole, and put them all in issue. <em>Crogate\u2019s </em>case, 8 <em>Coke, </em>67. <em>Cockerill vs. Armstrong, Wille\u2019s Rep. </em>99. <em>Bell vs. Wardell, Ib. </em>202.

It is not necessary in this state to set out in the writ the particular trespasses complained of, bail being required here by statute. In <em>England </em>the defendant must be served with the process, showing what is complained of, so as to demand bail. <em>Tidd\u2019s Pr. </em>144.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b386-4\">Earle, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_HY\">delivered the opinion ol the Court. The attention of the court is called to the pleadings of this case. It' is an action of trespass for taking the personal goods of the plaintiff. To the declaration, which is in common form, the defendant, pleaded specially; and he also, pleaded the general issue plea, which by consent was withdrawn from the case. The special-plea purports to be a justification of the taking, fora distress for rent, not due to the defendant by the plaintiff, but from hi3 tenant <em>John O. Neale., </em>who is charged with fraudulently removing the, distrained-property, being his own proper goods and, chattels, from off the demised premises, to prevent the distress, to the place where, &amp;c. to which place they were followed within thirty days, and seized and sold by the -defendant for the payment of his rent. To this plea the plaintiff having replied, <em>de injuria sua propria absque tali causa, </em>the defendant demurred specially, and assigned for cause of demurrer the duplicity of the replication, inasmuch as it tended to put in issue various and distinct matters, when the same ought to have put-one single matter in issue only, and attempted to put in issue all the several matters and things in <em>the </em>plea contained, whereas it should have traversed one single matter, whereon\u2019 a proper issue might have been <em>joined.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The legal sufficiency of the replication furnished the principal ground of the arguments of the counsel, although the plea w,as also adverted to, as being defective. If it is so in form the fault is cured by the pleading over-of the replication; but if it is substantially incorrect, the fault must determine the case, against, the defendant, as it is the first to be found in the pleadings. By way of testing its soundness, the court have inquired whether it is a good plea on general demurrer? and their reflections have brought them to the conclusion that it is not. When applied to a plea, a general demurrer confesses all its well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>pleaded facts; and if all the facts contained in this plea are admitted to be true, the plaintiff we think must nevertheless prevail, because the gist or ground of his action, as set forth in his declaration, is not thereby answered. <em>A </em>plea in trespass is bad on demurrer, that does not cover the whole trespass as laid in the declaration, although it need not answer matter stated in aggravation of damages. <em>Taylor vs. </em>Cole, 3 <em>T. R. 297, </em>per <em>Buller, </em>J. The plaintiff here has alleged in his declaration, that the goods and chattels mentioned therein, at the time of the taking of them by the defendant, were <em>his goods </em>and chattels, and if be had omitted the averment, the omission would have been fatal even after verdict, the objection being a want of title, and not a title defectively stated. 1 <em>Chitty\u2019s Plead. 366, </em>and the authorities there cited. This demonstrates the importance and character of this fact stated in the declaration, and there is no answer given to it in the plea, either by denying it, or by confessing and justifying it. The plea may bo said to assert the goods in question, to be the proper goods and chattels of the defendant\u2019s tenant, when they were fraudulently removed <em>by </em>him from the demised premises; but it is silent as to their being the goods and chattels of any particular person at the time of the taking in the place where, &amp;c. If it were admitted that they were the proper goods and chattels of the tenant, when they were removed by him from the premises, it would not thence follow, that they were his property many days after, when they were taken from the plaintiff, in the name of a distress for rent duo from the tenant. The plaintiff might, in the meantime, have purchased them <em>bona fide </em>of the tenant; and by the statute of 11 <em>Geo. </em>II, <em>ch. </em>19, <em>s </em>1, 2, the sale would have been protected, 3 <em>Chitty\u2019s Plead. </em>551, (in the note.) The defendant should have denied the property of the plaintiff, at the time of taking, and as he has omitted to do this, the declaration is not covered by the plea. The general issue plea would have been a denial of the properly of the plaintiff in the goods at the time of the taking, and imposed on him the necessity of proving it, or showing his right, to sue. The defendant might also have put .the same fact in issue, by a plea of property in himself, or his tenant, at the; time of the taking, if he had thought proper to imard a plea, whidi would have been bad on special demuir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>er, because it amounted to the general issue plea. In the same Way he might have added to his plea before us, that when he seized the goods in the place where, &amp;e. they were the proper goods and chattels of his tenant, and not the plaintiff\u2019s, which perhaps would have made of it a good plea, except as to form. Neither of those modes of negation has he, however, adopted; and his plea used as justification is not suited to the case, and does not justify the act complained of. It would have been a suitable plea, if the tenant had been the plaintiff, but will not answer the defendant\u2019s purpose, as the action is brought by a stranger. To justify, he might well confess by his plea the-goods and chattels carried off the premises to be the property of his tenant, because he has a right to follow them, if they are fraudulently removed to prevent his distress; while a similar admission in the case of a stranger, would be to concede himself to be liable to his action. For the goods of a third person cannot be taken for rent in any place, except on the leased premises; and to admit by plea the taking as a distress for rent of the goods of such \u00e1 person in <em>alio loco, </em>is little short of saying that they are not liable to the distress insisted on; and a justification following such an admission, could be of no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">So much having been said of the plea, it seems unnecessary for the court to speak of the replication. As its invalidity, however, was a point more than any other insisted on, we will briefly give our opinion in relation to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Without attending to the particular causes of demurrer pointed out, it appears to us that the replication is not sustainable in this case; <em>de injuria sua propria absque tali causa, </em>is a plea often resorted to in practice, but where it may be legitimately used, must be determined by a reference to <em>Crogate\u2019s Case, </em>8 <em>Co. Rep. </em>66. This case is the foundation of all subsequent decisions on this question, and is an authority universally acknowledged. Adjudications of later date are little else than interpretations, given by successive judges, of <em>Crogate\u2019s Case, </em>as applicable or not to the subjects which have come under their consideration. In the second resolution of the case, Lord <em>Coke </em>says, \u201cthe general plea <em>de injuria sua propria, &amp;c. </em>is properly where the defendant\u2019s plea doth consist merely upon matter of excuse, and no matter of interest whatsoever;\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>this makes the use of this general replication to depend on the matter of the defendant\u2019s plea. If matter of excuse is pleaded, the general replication is an appropriate plea; but if matter of interest is insisted on, a special reply is necessary. This distinction has been observed and enforced by the most modern decisions on this subject. Such are the cases of <em>Cooper vs. Monke, </em>and <em>Cockerill vs. Armstrong </em>in <em>Willes\u2019s Rep. 52 &amp; 100; </em>the case of <em>Jones vs. Kitchim, </em>1 <em>Bos. &amp; Pull. </em>76, and <em>Lytle vs. </em>Lee <em>and Ruggles, 5 Johns. Rep. </em>112; and such the law in <em>White vs. Stubby, </em>3 <em>Saund. </em>295, <em>(note 1.) </em>All these authorities are decided on the ground that the general replication, <em>de injuria sua propria absque tali causa, </em>is bad, when the defendant insists on a right, as <em>P. Clautice </em>does in this case, and is good only when he pleads matter of excuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\"><em>Raymond </em>then moved the court to order a writ of <em>procedendo, </em>or <em>special mandate, </em>to the court below, directing them to proceed in the cause, and to award an inquiry as to the damages to be assessed to the plaintiff, &amp;c.
