The distress was- levied under the statute of II <em>Geo. </em>II, <em>ch. </em>19, which has never received that limited construction sought to be imposed on it by the reason <em>first </em>assigned as a ground for arresting the judgment Such a limitation would contravene the express provision of the statute, and almost entirely defeat the design of its framers.-. According to the finding of the jury, no case could come more Completely within both its letter and its spirit, than the present... If the <em>second </em>reason assigned had been presented to the court below in the shape of a demurrer to the defendant\u2019s avowry, it' would have been entitled to some consideration; but the, plaintiff having waived that objection, and distinctly put in issue the fact of the goods having been fraudulently or clandestinely removed to prevent a distress, and that issue being found against,him, upon no principle of pleading, or of common sense, can this exception to the avowry warrant the arrest of the judgment. The <em>third </em>and <em>fourth </em>grounds are equally untenable, and derive no sanction whatever from books of precedents of high authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMS\u00ae.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
