The plaintiff at the trial read in evidence, with the consent of the defendant, and under an agreement for that purpos\u00e9 entered into between the parties, the certificates of the clerk of the circuit court of the District of <em>Columbia </em>for <em>Washington </em>county, given on the 1st ot September 1820, not under the seal of his office, stating \u201cthat the papers filed in the ejectment suit of <em>Sarah Coombs, Martenannon Jenkins </em>and <em>Priscilla Hartley\u2019s </em>lessee, against <em>Francis Jenkins, </em>which was tried by a jury at June term 1812, in the circuit court of the District of <em>Columbia </em>for the county aforesaid, were destroyed by <em>the enemy </em>in the cap\u00edtol in August 1814; that there is no record of the said suit, and nothing remaining in his office in relation thereto, except the docket entries, and the entry in the minute book, which can be found, after a diligent search. \u201d The said docket entries of June term 1811, shew, that an ejectment was brought \u2014 a declaration filed \u2014 lease, entry and ouster confessed \u2014not guilty pleaded \u2014 issue joined. \u2014 That a jury was sworn, and a special verdict found; and that on the special verdict a judgment was rendered for the plaintiff at December term 1812. The entries taken from the minute books made on the trial of said action, state the names of the judges of <em>the court who </em>were present, and of the jurors who were sworn to try the issue, amongst whom was <em>John J. Stull. </em>That a bill of exceptions was taken by the plaintiff, and that the jury found a special verdict. The plaintiff also read in evidence, with the consent of the defendant, under the agreement aforesaid, the certificate of the Honourable <em>William Cranch, </em>chief judge of the said circuit court, giving a copy of the whole of his notes taken on the trial of the above mentioned cause, stating it to have been an action of ejectment for lot No. 3, in square No. \u2014, in the city of <em>Washington-, </em>that \u201cplaintiffs are heirs at law of <em>Thomas Jenkins, </em>who died seized. Defendant is his devisee. The will was executed by the testator in the presence of the subscribing witnesses,, when he requested them to go into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>other room to subscribe their names, as he wished to be alone for a few minutes. They did so. Mr. <em>Matthews </em>returned to his room after they had subscribed, and read the will again to the testator, and told him the witnesses had subscribed. He replied <em>it is well, </em>and seemed satisfied. The rooms were separated by a wooden partition, &amp;c. &amp;c. See bill of exceptions.\u201d He then gives a sketch of the arguments of the counsel, the defendants\u2019 counsel contending, \u201cthat the copy of the will and probat should go the jury as evidence without any further proof;\u201d and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel contending, \u201cthat it was not a bar to the descent under the circumstances stated in the bill of exceptions, it not having been subscribed by the witnesses in the presence o\u00ed the testator. The court refused to instruct the jury that it was not a bar; but told them that it was not a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery, unless they should be satisfied by the evidence that it was subscribed by the witnesses in the <em>presence </em>of the testator, leaving the whole evidence to the consideration of the jury.\u201d The plaintiff then produced as a witness <em>John J. Stull, </em>one of the jurors named as before Stated in the extract from the minute book, who gave evidence that he was one o\u00ed the jurors who tried the said cause, and that he remembered the only fact disputed by the parties before the jury was, whether or not the witnesses to the will subscribed their names thereto in the presence of the testator. The evidence was, that the testator, then ill, signed the will in the presence of the witnesses, and then, before they attested it, desired them to leave the room for a short time, which they did, and went into an adjoining room, through a passage, separated by a plank partition from the room in which the testator lay; that there was no direct communication between these rooms, nor could the testator see them sign the will in that room, from the room in which he lay; that they there signed the will, which was then, by the Reverend <em>William Matthews, </em>taken into him; that a special verdict was found by the jury, stating the above facts, as nearly as the witness can recollect. Witness recollects' perfectly, that the opinion of the jury was, that the testator, at the time the witnesses subscribed the will, could not see them. On the preceding statement the plaintiff prayed the opinion of the- court, and their instruction to the jury, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>defendant was precluded from going into evidence to prove the execution of the will. This opinion the Court, [ <em>Johnson, </em>Ch. J. and <em>Key, </em>A. J.] refused to give;'but were of opinion, and so directed the jury, that the same w\u00e1s <em>prima facie </em>evidence that the will was not legally executed. The defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-5\">2. The defendant then produced a copy of the said will and probat, duly certified, which is as follows: \u201cNovember 6th, one thousand eight hundred and seven. In the name of God, Amen.

On the 23d day of November, in the jmar 1807, came <em>John Mountz, Jacob Miller </em>and <em>Hezekiah Berry, </em>the three subscribing witnesses to the annexed and aforegoing last will and testament of <em>Thomas </em>Jenkins, late <em>o\u00ed - Washington </em>county, deceased, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>made oath that they saw <em>Thomas Jenkins, </em>the said testator, put his mark to the said will, andthe reverend <em>William Matthews </em>sign his name for him at his request and in his presence, the said <em>Jenkins </em>sitting in his bed, and having no convenience there for writing; that they heard the said testator publish, pronounce and declare, the aforegoing and annexed, to be his last will and testament. That at the time of so doing the testator was, to the best of their apprehension, of sound and disposing mind, memory and understanding. That they, the deponents, severally subscribed their names as witnesses to the same, at the <em>request </em>of the said testator, and in presence of each other. After the testator had set his mark to the will, Mr. <em>Matthews </em>requested them to sign it. The testator replied, \u201cdo gentlemen, go out to the next room and sign,\u201d &amp;c. They accordingly went into the next room, and there signed their names, but the will was immediately taken back to the testator. And the said <em>Uezekiah Berry </em>deposeth, that he heard the reverend Mr, <em>Matthews </em>reading the same to him. They further depose, that the <em>N, B. on </em>the back was written by the reverend Mr. <em>Matthews, </em>before the testator put his name to this will, and before they attested. The reverend <em>William Matthews </em>being duly sworn saith, that after the will had been signed as aforesaid, he immediately carried the same back to the testator, and read it to him, informing him that the persons above named had witnessed it, shewing him at the same time their handwriting, at which the deceased nodded his head by way of assent, appeared quite satisfied, and he thinks the testator added \u201cwell,\u201d or \u201cvery well.\u201d The defendant then upon this evidence, and also that stated in the first exception, prayed the court to instruct the jury, that if from the evidence the jury are of opinion that the situation of the witnesses and the testator, at the time of the attestation, was such that the testator might have seen the witnesses subscribe as such, the execution of the will was proper, although the testator did not actually see tire witnesses subscribe their names; otherwise not. This instruction the court gave. The plaintiff eXcepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AeM\">S.

The lessor of th\u00ae plaintiff claiming as heir at law of <em>Thomas Jenkins, </em>and the defendant under an instrument of writing alleged to be his last will and testament; and the sole question which appears to have arisen in the court-below, related to the due execution of said will, according to the formalities prescribed by the statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>frauds and perjuries. Upon this point <em>three </em>bills of exception appear to have been taken in the court below, only the <em>first </em>and <em>third </em>of which are before this court, for their review and adjudication, upon the appeal prosecuted by the appellant. The opinion contained in the <em>second </em>bill of exceptions is not appealed from, and is only before this court by the agreement of the parties, as furnishing the testimony upon which the opinion of the court was prayed and given in the <em>third </em>bill of exceptions. The whole of the testimony which went to the jury upon the trial of this case, was admitted by the consent of the parties, and such consent obviates any objection which might otherwise have been made to it as being exceptionable in point of law. This court are of opinion, that the court below did right in refusing the prayer of the plaintiff, that the defendant was precluded from giving evidence to prove the due execution of the will. The conclusion of law deduced by the court from the facts so given in evidence, that the same were <em>prima facie </em>evidence that the will was not legally executed, is believed by this court to be correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">It is the opinion of this court, that there is no error in the opinion of the court below expressed in the <em>third </em>bill of exceptions, because the evidence, so far from warranting a presumption that the formalities of the law had been complied with, in reference to the execution of last wills and testaments, furnished very strong grounds from which a contrary inference might be drawn. It is true it is not essential that a testator should actually see the witnesses attest his will, but it is necessary that he should be in a situation which would give him the capacity of doing so if he should desire it. <em>Russell </em>&amp; <em>Lux vs. </em>Falls, 3 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>M\u2018Hen. </em>457.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">JUDGMENT ARRIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
