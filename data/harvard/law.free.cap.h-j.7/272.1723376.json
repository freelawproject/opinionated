This was an action of debt; and the declaration stated that the defendant, (the present appellee,) on the 12th of August 1819, by his certain bill obligatory, acknowledged himself indebted to the plaintiff, (the appellant,) and promised to pay him the sum of <em>\u00a360 </em>5 3\u00a7. The defendant pleaded, that he from the time of making the articles aforesaid, until the day of the impetration of the original writ of the plaintiff, well and truly hath ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>served, performed, paid, done and kept, all and singular the covenants, clauses, payments and agreements, in the said articles contained, which on his part were to be observed, performed, fulfilled, paid, done and kept, according to the form and effect of the said articles aforesaid; and this he is ready to verify,\u201d &amp;c. The plaintiff replied, protesting that the plea of the defendant was insufficient, &amp;c. and protesting also that the defendant had not performed, &amp;c. and issue was joined. At the trial, the plaintiff to support the issue on his part, read in evidence the following papers, admitted to have been executed by the defendant. 1. <em>\u201cHonors Martin\u2019s </em>account against <em>William Garrett </em>to the 13th of August 1819, is \u00a3830 7 11, equal to -. <em>William Garrett\u2019s </em>account against <em>Honor\u00e9 Marlin\\.o\\S\\a </em>12th of August 1S1.9, is \u00a3770 1 7 J, which leave a balance due <em>Honor\u00e9 Martin </em>of \u00a360 5 3J; but there was an agreement made by <em>William Garrett, </em>with <em>Honor\u00e9 Martin, </em>to build a log granary, and also to build a shed to a house that <em>Honor\u00e9 Martin </em>had at <em>Medley\u2019s, </em>which <em>William Garrett </em>never completed \u2014 Therefore it is agreed by the parties, that what -work <em>William Garrett </em>has done towards the building, according to his contract, should be paid for; which is to he settled by <em>Archibald Orme </em>and <em>James Gissen, </em>who are to make a statement of the building, and the work done by <em>William </em>Garrett, according to the account stated by the parties. The agreement for the building according to contract, was to be two hundred dollars, and what work was not done by <em>William Garrett </em>to be deducted out of the two hundred dollars.\u201d Signed and sealed by <em>Martin </em>and <em>Garrett, </em>the 13th of August 1819. 2. \u201cIt appears there exists a dispute concerning the moving of a house by <em>William Garrett, </em>which he charges five dollars for; and also a receipt of <em>Solomon Holland </em>for <em>William Garrett\u2019s </em>order, 18th July 1799, for \u00a35 9 2\u00a3, which agree to leave to <em>Gassaway Perry </em>and <em>Brice Selby </em>to settle between us.\u201d Signed by <em>Martin </em>and <em>Garrett. </em>The defendant then prayed the court to instruct the jury, that upon the issue joined in the cause, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover.

This is an .action of debt on a single bill, as appears from the declaration, for the payment of \u00a1\u00a3\u00a160 5 3J. The defendant pleaded general performance of <em>articles of agreement, </em>and the plaintiff replied by a <em>protestation </em>that the defendant hath not performed <em>the articles of agreement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">The pleadings are altogether irregular. There is in fact no issue joined in the cause. There is the affirmance of the performance of articles of agreement, but there should have been an express negation of defendant\u2019s plea. A denial, by way of protestation, is no denial. It is ever unavailable in the particular suit in which it is adopted, and the allegations protested against are in e\u00f1ect admitted in the suit. 1 <em>Chitty on Plead. </em>590. The tender of issue upon such a replication is therefore erroneous. There was in fact no issue for the jury to try.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-13\">But if there was an issue joined between the parties, it was an immaterial issue; for it is an issue joined on certain <em>articles </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number><em>of agreement, </em>which no whore appear in the pleadings, and the suit is brought on a single bill. Now the finding of this issue, either for the plaintiff or defendant, determines no one question which lias any relevancy to the action, and no judgment could be rendered on the verdict. Issue is taken, on a point different from the material allegation in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, and although fouud by the verdict, the merits of the cause are left undetermined, and the court could not tell for whom to render judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The judgment is reversed, that the county court may award a repleader, and that substantial justice may be done between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED, AND PROCEDENDO AWARDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
