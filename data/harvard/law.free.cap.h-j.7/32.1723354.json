Debt upon the guardian bond of <em>William Bowers, </em>dated the 10th of May 1806, brought against the administratrix, (the appellant,) of one of the sureties in the bond. The condition of the bond was, that <em>Bowers, </em>\u2018fits guardian to <em>Jinn Coburn, </em>shall faithfully account with the; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>orphans court of <em>Kent </em>county, as directed by law, for the management of the property and estate of the orphan under his care; and shall also deliver up the said property, agreeablj\" to the order of the said court, or the directions of law; and shall in all respects perform the duty of guardian to the said <em>Ann Coburn </em>according to law.\u201d There were no pleadings in the cause, but a judgment was rendered, with the consent of the' parties, <em>pro forma, </em>for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court on the following case: The bond, upon which the action was brought, was executed, as it purports to have been. <em>Ann B. Coburn </em>was born in October 1798, and intermarried with <em>Samuel Dryden, for whose </em>use this action was brought, in the year 1820, and she died in November 1822. The amount of estate due from <em>William Bowers, </em>as guardian to <em>Ann B. Coburn, </em>on the 7th of August 1816, was $330 21. On the 7th of August 1816, the following single bill was executed: \u201cI promise and oblige myself, my heirs, executors or administrators, to pay, or cause to be paid, unto <em>Ann B. Coburn, </em>the just and full sum of three hundred and thirty dollars and 21 cents, (it being the amount of her personal estate,) on or before the first day of October eighteen hundred and eighteen, with legal interest until paid. As witness my hand and seal this seventh day of August one thousand eight hundred and sixteen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-6\"><em>Wm. Bowers, </em>(L.

This action was instituted in the court below, upon a bond executed by <em>William Bowers, </em>as guardian to <em>Ann B. Coburn, </em>in which bond <em>John Bowers, </em>the defendant\u2019s intestate, united with him as surety. <em>Ann B. Coburn, </em>after she obtained the age of 16 years, passed her receipt to <em>William Bowers </em>for the full amount of her personal estate, without having received the same, but in consideration of a single bill, which was executed and delivered to her by her guardian, in which he bound himself to pay at a future day the sum of $330 21, it being, as the bill expresses it, the amount of her personal estate, with legal' interest till paid. And the sole question for this court to decide is, whether, in consequence of this transaction between the ward, (after she had attained the age of IS years, and became by the law ofthis state entitled to the possession of her estate,) and her guardian, all legal liability on the part of <em>John Bowers, </em>his surety in the bond, ceased and determined? It is a well established principle of law, that a debt or right of action cannot be extinguished by the acceptance of an obligation or undertaking of equal dignity; it must be one of higher grade in the estimation of the law to produce that effect. See <em>Williamson vs. Andrew, </em>4 <em>Harr. &amp; M\u2018Hen. </em>482, where this principle was settled by the court. That was an action of debt on a bond, and the defendant pleaded that he made a mortgage to secure the payment of the money, and the plaintiff accepted thereof in satisfaction; on demurrer, the court gave judgment for the plaintiff. In 3 <em>Bacon\u2019s </em>Abridgment, title <em>Extinguishment, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>107, the law is stated to be, that the accepting of a security of equal degree, is no extinguishment of the first debt; as where an obligee has a second bond given to him; for one deed cannot determine the duty upon another.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">This is a well settled law in cases of contract made between parties having a general legal capacity to contract; but in the' case before the court, it appears that <em>Jinn B. Coburn </em>had not attained the age of twenty-one years, and consequently had not guch general power of contracting; but with reference to her capacity to make such an agreement, she was still, in contemplation of the law, a minor. This principle was solemnly established by this court in <em>Davis vs. Jacquin </em>&amp; <em>Pomerat, </em>5 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>Johns. </em>100, where the court express their opinion in the following terms: \u201cThe object of the law, (meaning the act of 1798,) was to enable an infant female, at the age of sixteen, to receive from her guardian, and take into her possession, her real and personal estate. So far the law conferred on her a new capacity; but this capacity does not destroy the state of legal minority, because it is consistent with it. \u201d In this case it is moreover to be considered, that the security taken by <em>Jinn B. Coburn, </em>was less beneficial to her than the one she before had; because, not only was the time of payment extended, and a risk of eventual loss thereby incurred, but it was the single bill of her guardian alone, without the joint responsibility of a surety</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
