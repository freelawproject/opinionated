The 24-month sentence is the statutory maximum sentence, above the advisory guidelines range of eight to 14 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">Primarily, Marston contends that the district court committed plain error by providing inadequate reasons for imposing the maximum sentence. The court\u2019s explanation was adequate to show that the court considered the parties\u2019 arguments and had a reasoned basis for exercising its sentencing authority. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Further, Marston cannot show that a better explanation likely would have resulted in a lesser sentence. He thus fails to show that any error affected his substantial rights as is required under plain-error review. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, 580 F.3d </em>256, 259 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 364-65 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-15\">Marston further contends that the district court improperly based the sentence on \u201cjust punishment,\u201d a factor listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) and thus barred from consideration by \u00a7 3583(e) and <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(May 27, 2011) (No. 10-10784). He argues that this claim is preserved and thus reviewable under the \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard rather than for plain error. Plain-error review applies because Marston\u2019s general objection to the harshness of the sentence said nothing about the consideration of any prohibited factor, and thus did not \u201calert the district court to the nature of the alleged error and to provide an opportunity for correction.\u201d <em>United States v. Neal, </em>578 F.3d 270, 272 (5th Cir.2009). In any event, <em>Miller </em>indicates that the \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard is akin to the plain-error standard in that a defendant must show that his sentence resulted from an error that \u201cwas obvious under existing law.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>634 F.3d at 843. Given this evident similarity between the \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d and \u201cplain error\u201d standards, the claim lacks merit under either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-16\">We first note that revocation of Marston\u2019s supervised release was mandated by \u00a7 3583(g) because Marston violated an express condition of supervised release by being convicted of a drug possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>crime punishable by more than one year. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3588(g). Section 3583(g) does not invoke the sentencing factors of \u00a7 3553(a) or the limits imposed by the first clause of \u00a7 3583(e). <em>See </em>\u00a7 3583(g); <em>United States v. Giddings, </em>37 F.3d 1091, 1095 (5th Cir.1994) (noting that a court need not consider \u00a7 3553(a) when revocation is mandated by \u00a7 3583(g)). Marston fails to show that it is \u201cclear or obvious\u201d or \u201cobvious under existing law\u201d that a sentence imposed when revocation is mandatory must be limited by \u00a7 3583(e). <em>Cf. United States v. Larison, </em>432 F.3d 921, 923 (8th Cir.2006) (holding that \u201cthe district court\u2019s [sentencing] decision was not constrained by the factors specifically enunciated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)\u201d where revocation was mandated by \u00a7 3583(g)).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">In addition, Marston asserts that the district court relied on the \u201cirrelevant\u201d factor of \u201cincapacitation.\u201d Incapacitation can reasonably be interpreted to mean the protection of the public by negating Mar-ston\u2019s capacity to engage in criminal acts. Protecting the public is a well-recognized sentencing factor. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C). Marston fails to show that the court\u2019s mention of incapacitation was a clear or obvious error under <em>Miller </em>or <em>Whitelaw. See Miller, </em>634 F.3d at 843; <em>Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Marston also argues that the district court gave improper consideration to his mental illness and his five years of solitary confinement in state prison. He says the sentence created \u201can unwarranted disparity with similarly-situated defendants.\u201d These arguments implicitly do no more than ask us to reweigh sentencing factors and substitute our judgment for that of the district court. This is improper in light of the deference due to a sentencing court. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">We have routinely affirmed revocation sentences that exceeded the advisory guideline range but not the statutory maximum. <em>See Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 265 (citing cases); <em>United States v. Morales, </em>299 Fed.Appx. 455, 457-58 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Neal, </em>212 Fed.Appx. 328, 331 (5th Cir.2007). Marston has not shown that his sentence was either plainly erroneous or plainly unreasonable. The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">CATHARINA HAYNES, Circuit Judge, concurs in the judgment only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b488-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
