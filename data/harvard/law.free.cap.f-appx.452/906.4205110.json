On appeal, Brown argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies because he only had to exhaust such administrative remedies that were available to him. The administrative process was made unavailable to him because he could not timely resubmit his appeal within the 10 days given since he did not receive the response within that time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-23\">\u201c[We] review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a)\u2019s exhaustion requirement.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Meadows, </em>418 F.3d 1152, 1155 (11th Cir.2005). The PLRA provides that \u201c[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under [42 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>\u00a7 1983], or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). To \u201cproperly exhaust\u201d his administrative remedies, a prisoner must complete the administrative review process, as set forth in the applicable prison grievance process. <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 218, 127 S.Ct. 910, 922-923, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). A prisoner cannot satisfy the exhaustion requirement by filing an untimely or otherwise procedurally defective administrative grievance or appeal. <em>Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 92-103, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 2387-93, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006). However, an administrative remedy that was not discovered, and which could not have been discovered through reasonable effort, until it was too late for it to be used is not an \u201cavailable\u201d remedy. <em>Goebert v. Lee Cnt\u2019y, </em>510 F.3d 1312, 1324 (11th Cir.2007). A remedy is not available if it is unknown or unknowable because such a remedy is not \u201ccapable for use for the accomplishment of a purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1323. Although inmates must exhaust their available administrative remedies, they are not required to \u201ccraft new procedures when prison officials demonstrate ... that they will refuse to abide by the established ones.\u201d <em>Turner v. Burnside, </em>541 F.3d 1077, 1083 (11th Cir.2008) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Title 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 542.10 <em>et seq., </em>of the Code of Federal Regulations sets out the process by which a federal prisoner can \u201cseek formal review of an issue relating to any aspect of his/her own confinement.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 542.10(a). Pursuant to the procedure, an inmate first must present an issue of concern informally to staff. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 542.13(a). If dissatisfied with the staff response, the inmate then may submit a formal written request to the warden (BP-91 within 20 calendar days of the date on which the basis for the request occurred. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 542.14(a). An inmate who is not satisfied with the warden\u2019s response may submit an appeal on the appropriate form (BP-10) to the appropriate Regional Office within 20 calendar days of the date the warden signed the response, and if he is not satisfied with the Regional Office\u2019s response, may submit an appeal on the appropriate form (BP-11) to the General Counsel within 30 calendar days of the date the Regional Office signed the response. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 542.15(a). The applicable time for filing a formal grievance or an appeal may be extended when the inmate demonstrates a valid reason for the delay, which means \u201ca situation which prevented the inmate from submitting the request within the established time frame.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 542.14(b); 542.15(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">Even if an appeal is untimely because the prisoner counselor incorrectly informed the prisoner of the date the appeal was due, the prisoner still fails to exhaust his administrative remedies if he does not seek a waiver for good cause in filing an untimely appeal. <em>Bryant v. Rich, </em>530 F.3d 1368, 1378-1379 (11th Cir.2008). In <em>Bryant, </em>a Georgia state prisoner argued that his appeal of the warden\u2019s denial of his first grievance, despite being untimely, satisfied the exhaustion requirements. <em>Id. </em>at 1378. Bryant argued that his untimely appeal exhausted the administrative grievance process because he was merely following his counselor\u2019s instructions to submit his appeal within five business days instead of four business days. <em>Id. </em>This Court concluded, however, that Bryant failed to exhaust his administrative remedies because the prison\u2019s administrative appeals process permitted the time limits to be waived for good cause, but at no time did Bryant pursue a good cause waiver after his appeal was dismissed as untimely. <em>Id. </em>at 1378-1379. The record reflected that despite the counselor advising Bryant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>of the deadline, the form on which Bryant submitted his appeal stated that the appeal was due within four business days and also indicated that an untimely appeal might be considered if the reason why it was untimely was clearly stated. <em>Id. </em>at 1372. Bryant\u2019s appeal was late and he gave no explanation for why it was late. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Here, the record reflects that Brown\u2019s appeal to the Regional Office was rejected as being untimely filed and his appeal to the General Counsel was rejected due to his appeal to the Regional Office being untimely filed. As such, Brown did not complete the three-step administrative review process set forth by the FBOP. <em>See Woodford, </em>548 U.S. at 92-103, 126 S.Ct. at 2387-2393 (providing that an untimely appeal does not satisfy the exhaustion requirements). However, the administrative process was rendered unavailable to Brown because the delay in delivering the response from the Regional Office to Brown prevented him from being able to timely resubmit his appeal to the Regional Office as required. The administrative process does allow for a motion for extension of time to file an appeal; however, nothing in the record establishes that Brown was aware or could readily become aware of his right to request an extension of time to resubmit his appeal. As such, all administrative remedies were not available to Brown and he is excused from the exhaustion requirements. Because there is nothing in the record indicating that Brown was aware of the process for requesting an extension of time to resubmit his appeal, this case is distinguishable from our holding in <em>Bryant </em>Accordingly, the district court erred in dismissing Brown\u2019s action for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. For the reasons stated above, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
