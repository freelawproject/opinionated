Plaintiff sued United States Probation for allegedly providing false information to the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (\u201cTDFPS\u201d), ultimately resulting in the termination of her parental rights. The district court dismissed her suit on, inter alia, 12(b)(6) grounds. It denied her right to appeal IFP because it certified her appeal was not taken in good faith,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in that it did not \u201cinvolve[] legal points arguable on their merits.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-14\">Plaintiff is presently incarcerated as a federal prisoner. In 2009 Plaintiff was serving a term of supervised release, after a previous conviction for cocaine distribution. Plaintiff claims United States Probation is responsible for her losing her child at that time, because, she alleges, an employee in that department incorrectly informed TDFPS that she had violated her supervised release by failing a drug test and would shortly be sentenced to 2 years imprisonment. Plaintiff had not yet had her revocation hearing, so providing that information was arguably premature, and it ultimately proved incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-15\">Plaintiffs claim here fails, however, because the information was incorrect in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>wrong direction \u2014 instead of 2 years imprisonment, she received a prison sentence of 5 years. Accordingly, contrary to Plaintiff\u2019s complaint, TDFPS\u2019s belief in Plaintiff\u2019s imminent imprisonment, and its knowledge of her behavior underlying her supervised release revocation, ultimately did not cause the termination of her parental rights, because even without the action she alleged by United States Probation, she still would have lost custody of her children. Her lawyer conceded as much at the revocation hearing, noting that \u201c[i]f she is incarcerated, of course, it\u2019s probably going to terminate her parental rights.\u201d (ROA 33).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">For this reason, Plaintiff cannot complain of an injury resulting from Defendants\u2019 actions, and the district court was correct to conclude that Plaintiffs complaint does not present even an arguable claim. Additionally, and in the alternative, Plaintiff alleges that various individuals at United States Probation acted \u201cintentionally\u201d to deprive her of her parental rights. However, she can point to no evidence or motive to support this assertion. As noted by the district court, her complaint thus consists of no more than \u201cbare legal conclusions, with no suggestion of supporting facts,\u201d and as such is insufficient to sustain a claim. See <em>Wesson v. Oglesby, </em>910 F.2d 278, 281 (5th Cir.1990). Finally, the district court also dismissed the petition on Rooker-Feldman<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> grounds. We do not reach appellant\u2019s argument that application of this doctrine was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b600-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
