He argues that the sentence was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-16\">In reviewing a sentence, we must first determine whether the district court committed any procedural error. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A district court commits a procedural error if, for instance, it fails to consider all of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See id. </em>If the district court\u2019s decision is procedurally reasonable, the analysis turns to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Id. </em>Our review, in this regard, is highly deferential. <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe may not ... set aside a sentence merely because we would have decided that another one is more appropriate.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1191 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc). We will vacate a sentence only \u201cif we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-17\">Ricks argues that the district court relied on only one factor in fashioning his sentence \u2014 his criminal history. Ricks thus appears to argue that the district court failed to consider all of the factors listed in Section 3553(a). We are not persuaded by this argument. We have held that a district court is not required to \u201cstate on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number><em>States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). An acknowledgment that the district court considered the Section 3553(a) factors is sufficient. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Here, the district court expressly-stated that \u201cit has considered the factors set forth\u201d in Section 3553(a). It also discussed in more detail some of those factors. The district court\u2019s sentencing decision was thus procedurally reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">We also cannot say that the sentence imposed by the district court was substantively unreasonable. The term of forty-eight months imprisonment was within the guidelines range. Although we do not presume a sentence within the guidelines range to be reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). Ricks argues that the sentence must nonetheless be vacated in light of his testimony about the loss of his son and his sister\u2019s need for a kidney transplant.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">The district court noted, however, that Ricks has a significant and lengthy criminal history. The district court observed that one of the offenses for which his supervised release was revoked \u2014 the commission of an aggravated assault with a deadly weapon \u2014 was serious. The district court expressed concern about deterrence and public safety. It observed that the commission of the aggravated assault, which occurred about seven months into Ricks\u2019s term of supervised release, indicated that he was \u201cnot amenable to supervision.\u201d Taking all of this into account, we cannot say that the record leaves us with \u201cthe definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (quotation marks omitted). Ricks\u2019s sentence must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
