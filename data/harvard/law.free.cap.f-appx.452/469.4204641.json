The district court sentenced Medrano to concurrent imprisonment terms of 360 months and 120 months and concurrent supervised release terms of four years and three years. Medrano challenges his sentence by arguing that the district court erred in its guidelines determinations, and he contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">Contending that the district court used unreliable information from confidential sources who were not credible, Medra-no argues that the district court erred by determining drug quantity. Medrano objected on this basis in district court proceedings in written objections to the pre-sentence report (PSR). At the sentencing hearing, however, Medrano explicitly withdrew his objections to drug quantity. Me-drano\u2019s drug quantity challenge is therefore waived and is unreviewable by this court. <em>See United States v. Arviso-Mata, </em>442 F.3d 382, 384 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Musquiz, </em>45 F.3d 927, 931-32 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-15\">Medrano preserved his objection to the enhancement of his sentence based upon U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), which provides for a two-level increase for offenses involving drugs \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\u201d \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The district court\u2019s decision to enhance Medrano\u2019s sentence for possession of firearms was a factual determination that this court reviews for clear error. <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 396 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Vital, </em>68 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir.1995). A \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement is appropriate if a weapon is present \u201cunless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n.3). It does not matter whether Medra-no used or intended to use the weapons. Rather, the pertinent fact is that the weapons could have been used. <em>See United States v. Jacquinot, </em>258 F.3d 423, 431 (5th Cir.2001). As Medrano did not present evidence to rebut the facts set forth in the PSR, the district court was entitled to rely upon the facts set forth therein. <em>Vital, </em>68 F.3d at 120. Facts in the PSR establish that firearms were present in Medrano\u2019s residence, he conducted drug trafficking activities from his home, and drug para-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>phernalia was found in the home. Thus, it was not clearly improbable that the weapons were connected with the offense, and the district court did not commit clear error when it enhanced Medrano\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). <em>See United States v. Mergerson, </em>4 F.3d 337, 350 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">In addition, Medrano preserved his objection to the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(4) enhancement, which applies where, inter alia, the offense involved the importation of methamphetamine and the defendant is not subject to a mitigating role adjustment. A district court may rely upon hearsay in making sentencing determinations. <em>See United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 455 (5th Cir.2002). The PSR relates statements by Medrano, told to law enforcement agents, that indicate that he knew that he was dealing drugs that had been imported into the United States. The district court\u2019s determination that Medrano knew that he was selling methamphetamine that was being brought into the United States from Mexico therefore does not amount to clear error. \u00a7 201.1(b)(4); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>610 F.3d 271, 292 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Medrano did not object to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence in the district court. Plain error review therefore governs this issue. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). Where, as in Medrano\u2019s case, the district court imposes a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range, the sentence is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The sole basis of Medrano\u2019s challenge to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence is his argument regarding drug quantity. As set forth above, Medrano withdrew his objection to drug quantity and therefore this issue is waived and is unreviewable by this court. As he presents no other argument to challenge the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, Medrano has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b494-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
