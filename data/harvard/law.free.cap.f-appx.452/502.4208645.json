The parties conceded at the suppression hearing that the search was invalid following <em>Arizona v. Gant, </em>556 U.S. 332, 129 S.Ct. 1710, 173 L.Ed.2d 485 (2009), and Motton argues that the district court erred in determining that the search was a valid inventory search. The Government counters that the search of Motton\u2019s vehicle was done incident to his arrest, that the officers acted in good-faith reliance on pre-<em>Gant </em>caselaw, and that the search must therefore be upheld under the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule. Mot-ton makes no argument regarding the good-faith exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-16\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Gomez, </em>623 F.3d 265, 268 (5th Cir.2010). \u201cA factual finding is not clearly erroneous as long as it is plausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Gomez, </em>623 F.3d at 268 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The evidence and inferences therefrom are reviewed in the light most favorable to the Government as the prevailing party. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-17\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, the record demonstrates that the officers searched Motton\u2019s vehicle incident to his lawful arrest, relying in good faith on then-binding caselaw holding such searches to be valid. Although that caselaw has since been overturned by <em>Gant, </em>the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies to preclude suppression. <em>See Davis v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2419, 2428-29, 180 L.Ed.2d 285 (2011); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number><em>United States v. Curtis, </em>635 F.3d 704, 713-14 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 191, 181 L.Ed.2d 99 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"AqU\">Alternatively, and assuming ar-guendo that the search in this case was not done incident to arrest but was an inventory search in the first instance, the inventory search was valid. <em>See United States v. Prescott, </em>599 F.2d 103, 105 (5th Cir.1979) (recognizing inventory searches of automobiles as an exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement). Motton contends that the inventory search was unlawful because impoundment of his vehicle was unnecessary, urging that his car could have been left locked on the side of the road until a family member arrived to pick it up. Motton additionally contends that the record is devoid of evidence that standard inventory police procedures were in place or were followed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"AtA\">Motton has not demonstrated any clear error in connection with the district court\u2019s finding that the officers reasonably concluded that his car should be impounded and acted pursuant to department policy in conducting an inventory of the vehicle pri- or to having it towed. <em>See Gomez, </em>623 F.3d at 268. The undisputed testimony established that Officer Kendrick called for a tow truck to impound Motton\u2019s vehicle because it was blocking traffic on a busy highway and could not be released to Motton\u2019s passenger as he had a suspended driver\u2019s license. It similarly demonstrated that Officer Kendrick performed the inventory pursuant to established departmental policy without any suspicion of criminal activity. <em>See Florida v. Wells, </em>495 U.S. 1, 4-5, 110 S.Ct. 1632, 109 L.Ed.2d 1 (1990); <em>United States v. Andrews, </em>22 F.3d 1328, 1334-35 (5th Cir.1994). Although no written impoundment policy was admitted, the officers\u2019 testimony about the existence of such policy was sufficient. <em>See Andrews, </em>22 F.3d at 1334-35. Moreover, Motton\u2019s conclusional assertion notwithstanding, there is no contrary evidence to suggest that Officer Kendrick did not follow appropriate procedures for impounding Motton\u2019s vehicle. <em>See United States v. Bullock, </em>71 F.3d 171, 178 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"Amc\">The district court properly denied Mot-ton\u2019s suppression motion. Accordingly, its judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b527-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
