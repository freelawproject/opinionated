He argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Specifically, he argues that the district court put too much weight on his prior deportations and criminal history and failed to take into account his cultural assimilation and substance abuse problems. He states that his number of deportations is not unusual for a person with an illegal reentry conviction. He preserves for fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>ther review his argument that his sentence is not presumptively reasonable because there is no empirical basis for U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. He recognizes that his empirical basis argument is foreclosed by our precedent. See <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">We review the substantive reasonableness of Mercado Lopez\u2019s sentence for an abuse of discretion. See <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). As Mercado Lopez raises his argument that his number of prior deportations is not higher than that of most illegal immigrants for the first time on appeal, we review that argument for plain error. See <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Although cultural assimilation can be a mitigating factor, a sentencing court is not required to accord cultural assimilation dispositive weight. See <em>United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008). Moreover, Mercado Lopez\u2019s substantive-reasonableness contentions constitute a disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of the Section 3553(a) sentencing factors and the appropriateness of his sentence. Mercado Lopez has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness attached to his within-Guidelines sentence. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b446-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
