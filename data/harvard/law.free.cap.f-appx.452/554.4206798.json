The point of contention is the amount of insurance coverage that was available to defendants Kevin Schny-der and Schnyder\u2019s Fleet Repair, L.L.C. on the date of an automobile accident between the plaintiffs and Schnyder. Plaintiffs contend that State Farm had issued a policy with $1 million in coverage to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Sehnyder but fraudulently misled them into believing the policy\u2019s limits were only $300,000. We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment for essentially the same reasons stated in the district court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The unambiguous policy documents show that on the date of the accident State Farm had issued a policy to Sehnyder with coverage of $300,000. An amended declarations page, referencing the same policy number, shows that four months after the accident, the policy limits were amended to $1 million, the name of the insured was changed to Schynder\u2019s business, and an additional premium was charged to Schyn-der. There is no evidence supporting the plaintiffs\u2019 contentions that there were two separate policies, that there was $1 million in coverage available on the date of the accident, or that the defendants fraudulently altered the policy documents. Plaintiffs\u2019 speculative assertions and arguments to the contrary are insufficient to defeat summary judgment. <em>See Sanches v. Carrollton-Farmers Branch Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>647 F.3d 156, 165 (5th Cir.2011) (\u201cConelusional allegations and denials, speculation, and unsupported assertions are insufficient to avoid summary judgment.\u201d). Because the unambiguous policy documents do not support plaintiffs\u2019 case, summary judgment was proper. <em>See </em>La. Civ. Code. art. 2046 (\u201cWhen the words of a contract are clear and explicit and lead to no absurd consequences, no further interpretation may be made in search of the parties\u2019 intent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b578-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
