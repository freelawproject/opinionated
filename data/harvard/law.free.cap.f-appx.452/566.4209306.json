He argues that the district court erred in basing an upward departure, in part, on his 2002 and 2010 arrests for assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">Because Zavala did not raise this issue in the district court, review is for plain error. To show plain error, Zavala must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If Zavala makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-15\">A district court incorrectly applies the Guidelines by basing a departure upon a factor that the Sentencing Commission has expressly rejected as an appropriate ground for departure. <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 200, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992). Section 4A1.3(a)(3), p.s., provides that a \u201cprior arrest record itself shall not be considered for purposes of an upward departure.\u201d In <em>United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 434-36 (5th Cir.2006), this court held that it was plain error for a district court to take the \u201cmere fact of prior arrests into account\u201d at sentencing absent findings by the court, supported by reliable information, that the crimes underlying the arrests had actually been committed by the defendant. \u201cArrests, standing alone, do not constitute [such] reliable information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-17\">The district court\u2019s reliance on the arrests for assaultive conduct that actually resulted in convictions does not implicate the concerns identified in <em>Jones. </em>Even assuming that the district court plainly erred by basing the upward departure, in part, on the 2002 and 2010 arrests for assault, Zavala is not entitled to relief because he cannot show that this error affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-18\">When imposing Zavala\u2019s sentence, the district court noted the prior arrests in the context of expressing concern with the thread of assaultive behavior inherent in Zavala\u2019s criminal history. The district court also discussed Zavala\u2019s four previous deportations, his \u201cconsiderably understated\u201d criminal history category, and the \u201chigh\u201d likelihood that the defendant will commit future crimes. The district court explained that the sentencing range with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>base offense level of 12 and a criminal history category of IV was the first sentencing range \u201cthat would be sufficient to achieve the objectives of punishment and deterrence given the defendant\u2019s substantial criminal history, high likelihood of recidivism, and complete and repeatedly demonstrated disregard and disrespect for the laws of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Accordingly, because the record does not indicate a reasonable probability that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence had it not considered Zava-la\u2019s 2002 and 2010 arrests for assault, Za-vala cannot show that his substantial rights were affected. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>620 F.3d 483, 493 n. 9 (5th Cir.2010), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1534, 179 L.Ed.2d 348 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b591-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
