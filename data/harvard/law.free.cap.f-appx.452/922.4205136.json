On appeal, she argues that the district court erred in denying her motion for a judgment of acquittal because the use of a person\u2019s name on forged checks does not constitute the use of a means of identification as prohibited under \u00a7 1028A(a)(l). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-12\">Shanks was previously employed at C-Miles Construction, which was owned by Roger Granger. While employed at C-Miles Construction, Shanks forged Gran-ger\u2019s signature on 211 checks that she issued to herself, totaling $120,789.49. Granger had not signed those checks, authorized Shanks to sign the checks, or authorized Shanks to issue the checks to herself. When interviewed by law enforcement officers, Shanks ultimately admitted to forging Granger\u2019s signature and issuing the checks to herself without permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-14\">A federal grand jury indicted Shanks for five counts of bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(2) (Counts 1-5); two counts of making, uttering, and possessing securities of an organization, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(a) (Counts 6-7); and one count of aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) (Count 8). Count 8 charged that Shanks knowingly possessed and used, \u201cwithout lawful authority, a means of identification of another person, that is the name and signature of\u2019 Granger, in connection with the bank fraud charged in Counts 1-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-15\">Shanks filed an amended motion for a judgment of acquittal on Count 8. She argued that forging Granger\u2019s name on checks was forgery, but not aggravated identity theft. She noted that the definition of a \u201cmeans of identification\u201d was contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7) and was defined as \u201cany name or number ... used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific individual, including any\u201d access device as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(e). Moreover, the definition of \u201caccess device\u201d in \u00a7 1029(e) explicitly excluded checks, which meant that checks were not a means of identification. She argued that this conclusion was consistent with a common sense understanding of what constituted a means of identification. For four reasons, Shanks argued that it was evident that Congress intended that courts would consider the definition of \u201caccess device\u201d in determining whether a means of identification was used in a crime. First, the Sentencing Commission did not consider a forged check a means of identification. Second, if courts did not consider the meaning of \u201caccess device,\u201d they would not be giving meaning to every clause in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>statute. Third, depositing a forged check involved using the check, not the account-holder\u2019s name, to commit a crime. Fourth, to find otherwise would be inconsistent with Congress\u2019s intent not to replace state efforts to fight fraud. Shanks also relied on the Fifth Circuit decision of <em>United States v. Hughey, </em>147 F.3d 423 (5th Cir.1998), to argue that, because she did not use Granger\u2019s name in addition to depositing forged checks, her conduct did not fall within the scope of activities that Congress intended to qualify as aggravated identity theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">The government responded first that the plain language of \u00a7 1028A encompassed Shanks\u2019s conduct because she used Gran-ger\u2019s name and signature as a means of identification to commit the felony of bank fraud. Specifically, \u00a7 1028(d)(7), which the government agreed provided the definition for \u201cmeans of identification,\u201d included four subsections, which were connected by the disjunctive \u201cor.\u201d The four subsections thus gave alternative definitions of the term \u201cmeans of identification.\u201d Congress clearly intended the use of a name to qualify as the use of a means of identification, as it listed the word \u201cname\u201d in both the introductory paragraph of \u00a7 1028(d)(7) and in \u00a7 1028(d)(7)(A). Finally, as to the Sentencing Commission\u2019s definition of a \u201cmeans of identification,\u201d the government argued that Shanks cited a section of the Sentencing Guidelines that was inapplicable in her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">The district court held a bench trial to address Shanks\u2019s arguments as to Count 8. Shanks argued that \u00a7 1028(d)(7) included four examples to define the term \u201cmeans of identification,\u201d one of which was an access device. The term \u201caccess device\u201d was defined in \u00a7 1029(e), and the definition explicitly excluded checks. Shanks acknowledged that the government was arguing that she had used Granger\u2019s name to commit the offense. However, relying on arguments she had presented in her motion for a judgment of acquittal, she argued that the government\u2019s argument could not stand. She further asserted that it would be absurd to include checks as means of identification just because they were signed even though the statute expressly excluded checks. The court agreed that checks were excluded from the definition of \u201caccess device,\u201d but stated that they were not excluded from the definition of \u201cmeans of identification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">The government then argued that <em>Hu-ghey </em>was inapplicable, as it dealt with \u00a7 1029 rather than \u00a7 1028A, and it was decided before \u00a7 1028A existed. Congress enacted \u00a7 1028A to expand the definition of identity theft and to increase the punishments available for identity theft crimes. As to the language of the statute, \u00a7 1028A listed four ways for conduct to qualify as aggravated identity theft, and in this case, using a name as a means of identification qualified. The name, not the check, was the means of identification. Shanks used her boss\u2019s identity to issue checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">The court denied Shanks\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal and found her guilty of Count 8 because the statute included using a forged signature on a check. Pursuant to a written plea agreement, Shanks pleaded guilty to Counts 2-7, and the government dismissed Count 1. The court sentenced Shanks to 6 months\u2019 imprisonment for Counts 2-7, to be served concurrently, and to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment for Count 8, to be served consecutively to the term for Counts 2-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>questions of statutory interpretation. <em>United States v. Segarra, </em>582 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cThe first rule in statutory construction is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). If so, we need not inquire further. <em>Id. </em>We look at the entire statutory context rather than to words in isolation. <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe interpret a statute in a manner consistent with the plain language of the statute, unless doing so would lead to an absurd result.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-4\">The aggravated identity theft statute prohibits the knowing transfer, possession, or use, without lawful authority, of \u201ca means of identification of another person,\u201d in relation to a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344, the bank fraud statute. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l), (c)(5). \u201cMeans of identification\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-5\">any name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific individual, including any\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-6\">(A) name, social security number, date of birth, official State or government issued driver\u2019s license or identification number, alien registration number, government passport number, employer or taxpayer identification number;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-7\">(B) unique biometric data, such as fingerprint, voice print, retina or iris image, or other unique physical representation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-8\">(C) unique electronic identification number, address, or routing code; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-9\">(D) telecommunication identifying information or access device (as defined in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(e) ]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-10\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1028(d)(7). Section 1029 addresses fraud related to access devices. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1029. \u201cAccess device\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-q\">any card, plate, code, account number, electronic serial number, mobile identification number, personal identification number, or other telecommunications service, equipment, or instrument identifier, or other means of account access that can be used, alone or in conjunction with another access device, to obtain money, goods, services, or any other thing of value, or that can be used to initiate a transfer of funds (other than a transfer originated solely by paper instrument). .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-13\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1029(e)(1). Section 1028(i) states that in construing \u00a7 1028(a)(7), a document containing one or more means of identification should be considered one means of identification. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1028(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-14\">In <em>Hughey, </em>the appellant was charged with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(2), (b)(1). 147 F.3d at 483. The Fifth Circuit held that the language in \u00a7 1029(e)(1) excluding transfers originated by paper instrument meant that \u00a7 1029 did not encompass crimes relating to passing bad checks. 147 F.3d at 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-15\">Finally, the Sentencing Guidelines allow for an enhancement where the offense involved \u201cthe unauthorized transfer or use of any means of identification unlawfully to produce or obtain any other means of identification.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C)(i). The commentary notes that forging a signature on a check \u201cis not producing another means of identification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.9(C)(iii)(II)). Additionally, the term \u201cmeans of identification\u201d is given the same meaning as in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment, (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-16\">Here, the district court correctly interpreted \u00a7 1028(d)(7) in denying Shanks\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal. The plain language of the statute lists several definitions of a \u201cmeans of identification\u201d in the disjunctive, such that a means of identification may be, among other things, a name, fingerprint, routing code, or access device. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7)(A)-(D). Accordingly, simply failing to satisfy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>definition of \u201caccess device\u201d does not end the analysis with respect to a \u201cmeans of identification.\u201d A name of a specific individual will satisfy the definition of \u201cmeans of identification\u201d even if it does not satisfy the definition of \u201caccess device.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1028(d)(7)(A). Therefore, that checks (transfers originated by paper instruments) are excluded from the definition of \u201caccess device\u201d does not mean that a forged name on a check cannot be a means of identification under \u00a7 1028A. Moreover, the indictment explicitly charged Shanks with using \u201cthe name and signature of\u2019 Granger, not an access device, as a means of identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Shanks argues that allowing forgery cases such as hers to be prosecuted as aggravated identity theft would render meaningless the exclusion of checks from the definition of \u201caccess device.\u201d However, her argument incorrectly assumes that the definition of \u201cmeans of identification\u201d in \u00a7 1028(d)(7) is the only statutory provision in which the term \u201caccess device\u201d appears. The term also appears numerous times in the substantive criminal provisions of \u00a7 1029, and the exclusion of checks undoubtedly applies to each such instance of the term \u201caccess device.\u201d <em>See generally </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">Shanks also relies on <em>Hughey, </em>\u00a7 1028(i), and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C)(i), all of which are inapplicable here. First, <em>Hu-ghey </em>would be inapplicable even if it was binding precedent. The appellant in <em>Hu-ghey </em>was charged with violating \u00a7 1029(a)(2), (b)(1), not \u00a7 1028A, and the Court in <em>Hughey </em>did not address whether using another person\u2019s name in a forged signature satisfied the definition of a \u201cmeans of identification\u201d in \u00a7 1028(d)(7). <em>See generally </em>147 F.3d at 433-34. Rather, the Fifth Circuit in <em>Hughey </em>merely held that passing bad checks was not a crime encompassed by \u00a7 1029, which prohibits fraud in connection with access devices. <em>See </em>147 F.3d at 434. As discussed above, this holding has no bearing here because the use of Granger\u2019s name independently satisfies the definition of a \u201cmeans of identification\u201d in \u00a7 1028(d)(7)(A) even if it does not satisfy the definition of an \u201caccess device\u201d in \u00a7 1029(e)(1). Next, the rule of construction addressing identification documents in \u00a7 1028(i) is inapplicable here because \u00a7 1028(i) explicitly states that it is relevant to \u00a7 1028(a)(7), a section that is not at issue in this case. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(i). Shanks\u2019s argument that the Sentencing Guidelines support her position is similarly misplaced. Although the commentary for U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 does exclude forging a signature on a check from the meaning of \u201cproducing another means of identification,\u201d it does not similarly disqualify forging a signature from constituting a means of identification. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1, comment, (n.l, 9(e)(iii)(II)). As there has been no allegation that Shanks produced another means of identification by forging Granger\u2019s signature, this commentary has no bearing on this case. Moreover, the commentary for \u00a7 2B1.1 explicitly incorporates the definition in \u00a7 1028(d)(7) for \u201cmeans of identification,\u201d which, as discussed above, includes the use of a name. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Shanks\u2019s conviction for aggravated identity theft under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
