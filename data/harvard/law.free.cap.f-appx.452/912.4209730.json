No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-24\">Orso pleaded guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>\u00a7 922(g)(1). At the time of sentencing in 2008, Orso had two prior felony convictions: one for a controlled substance offense and one for fleeing or attempting to elude police.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Fleeing or attempting to elude police was then considered a crime of violence. Orso was sentenced as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 because he had two prior felony convictions for either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. Orso was sentenced to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment on the drug count and 120 months\u2019 imprisonment on the firearm count, to run concurrently.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Orso filed no appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">In early 2005, the Government filed a Rule 35 motion to reduce Orso\u2019s total sentence for substantial assistance. The district court \u2014 still applying the career-offender enhancement \u2014 amended Orso\u2019s sentence to a total term of 160 months. Orso sought to appeal his new sentence but his appeal was dismissed as untimely. In 2009, Orso filed the present section 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">The crux of Orso\u2019s argument is that decisions rendered after his 2005 resen-tencing as a career offender now make it clear that one of the two predicate offenses used to support the career-offender enhancement \u2014 fleeing or attempting to elude police \u2014 no longer qualifies as a violent felony. <em>See Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008); <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2008); and <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>558 F.3d 1280 (11th Cir.2009). The Government concedes that under recent decisions Orso had only one qualifying conviction and would no longer qualify for an enhanced sentence under the career-offender guideline.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">The district court issued a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) asking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-11\">[Whether Orso is] actually innocent of being a career offender, and therefore entitled to relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, notwithstanding his failure to raise on direct appeal his challenge to the career offender enhancement?<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>As a general rule, a criminal defendant who fails to object at trial or to raise an issue on direct appeal is procedurally barred from raising the claim in a section 2255 motion absent a showing of cause for failing to preserve the claim and actual prejudice from the alleged error. <em>See United States, v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 1594, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982). Orso cannot meet this high threshold. Nonetheless, Orso argues we should excuse his procedural default because he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d \u2014 both factually and legally \u2014 of being a career offender.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">The merits of a procedurally defaulted claim may be reached, in very narrowly defined circumstances, if failure to address the claim would result in a \u201cfundamental miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Murray v. Carrier, </em>477 U.S. 478, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 2649, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986). And, actual innocence of the offense may be shown to satisfy the fundamental miscarriage of justice standard. <em>See Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 115 S.Ct. 851, 864, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995) (\u201ctying the miscarriage of justice exception to innocence ... accommodates both the systemic interests in finality, comity, and conservation of judicial resources, and the overriding individual interest in doing justice in the \u2018extraordinary case.\u2019 \u201d). But Orso does not claim to be actually innocent of the crimes for which he was sentenced; instead, he claims to be actually innocent of being a career offender. Our <em>en banc </em>decision in <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1320 (11th Cir.2011) categorically rejected that claim, albeit in the context of the savings clause, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e): \u201cA defendant who is convicted and then has the \u00a7 4B1.1 career offender enhancement, or any other guidelines enhancement, applied in the calculation of his sentence has not been convicted of being guilty of the enhancement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">And in <em>McKay v. United States, </em>657 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2011), we were asked to decide whether an actual innocence of sentence exception applies to an initial section 2255 claim that the petitioner was wrongly sentenced as a career offender where one of his predicate convictions\u2014 carrying a concealed weapon \u2014 did not qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Reiterating that the actual innocence exception is focused on actual \u2014 not legal \u2014 innocence, we concluded that petitioner McKay \u2014 who made no claim to being factually innocent of the crime of carrying a concealed weapon-advanced a claim that fell outside the ambit of the actual innocence exception. <em>Id. </em>at 1199.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">Orso too makes no claim that he is factually innocent of the predicate offense (willful fleeing) used to support the career-offender enhancement. The actual innocence exception has no application to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>Orso\u2019s sentencing claim that he was wrongly sentenced as a career offender. <em>See id. </em>at 1200.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Because Orso fails to show that either of the two exceptions applies to excuse his procedural default, we decline to reach the merits of his procedurally-defaulted claim. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b937-6\">. Orso\u2019s felony-fleeing conviction was for violating subsection 2 of Florida\u2019s willful fleeing statute, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b937-7\">. At the time of Orso\u2019s offense conduct, the statutory maximum punishment was 480 months on the drug count and 120 months on the firearm count. Because the Government filed an Information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, the maximum sentence on the drug count increased to life. With the career-offender enhancement, Orso\u2019s (then-mandatory) guideline range was 262 to 327 months: without the career offender enhancement, his presumptive guideline range would have been 110 to 137 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b937-8\">. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>558 F.3d 1280 (11th Cir.2009), we concluded that an earlier state-felony conviction for violating Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2) \u2014 the fleeing subsection forming the basis of Orso's felony-fleeing conviction \u2014 is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Because the definition of a \"crime of violence\u201d in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(2) mirrors that of section 924(e)\u2019s \u201cviolent felony,\u201d decisions under each of these provisions inform decision under the other. <em>See United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1350 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008). These precedents underlie the Government\u2019s concession that Orso had only one qualifying conviction (the drug offense) and did not qualify for an enhanced sentence under the career-offender guideline provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-13\">In <em>Sykes v. United </em>States,-U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011), issued after briefing in this case was completed, the Supreme Court concluded that a conviction for felony-vehicle flight under Indiana law was a violent felony for purposes of section 924(e). Because, as we later explain, procedural default bars Orso\u2019s claim, we need not consider \u2014 and leave for another day \u2014 whether <em>Harrison </em>has been abrogated by <em>Sykes.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b937-15\">.The Government argues that the district court concluded wrongly that Orso\u2019s sentencing claim was cognizable in a section 2255 proceeding. A non-constitutional error of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>generally can form the basis for section 2255 relief only if the error constitutes a \"fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Addonizio, </em>442 U.S. 178, 99 S.Ct. 2235, 2240, 60 L.Ed.2d 805 (1979) (internal quotation and citation omitted). Although Orso argues that his sentencing claim is a constitutional claim, we have said that a \"claim that a sentencing guidelines provision was misapplied ... is not a constitutional claim. If it were, every guidelines error would be a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1321 (11th Cir.2011)(en banc). Although Orso's claim of cognizability is of questionable merit, we here assume, arguendo, that Orso advances a claim susceptible to section 2255 relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b938-10\">. The Government seemingly concedes that \"actual innocence\u201d can excuse a procedural default in the context of a non-capital sentence if the sentence imposed exceeds the statutory maximum sentence that would have applied absent the error. We do not need to decide whether to accept this concession because Orso was not sentenced in excess of the statutory maximum for his crimes. <em>See Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1306 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
