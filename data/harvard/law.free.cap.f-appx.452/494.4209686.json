He asserts that the act was intentional and the result of drug use aboard the vessel. He alleges civil rights violations, intentional homicide, and wrongful death aboard a marine vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">In a thorough and convincing report and recommendation, the magistrate judge recommended that the claims be dismissed <em>sua sponte </em>as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). Wells objected. The district court approved the report and recommendation and dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">Wells appeals <em>pro se. </em>His brief is difficult to understand and, for its argument section, contains only about three pages of narrative that cannot reasonably be read to assign specific error to the actions of the district court. In any event, the reasoning of the magistrate judge is sound. The judgment is AFFIRMED, essentially for the reasons expressed in the report and recommendation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b519-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
