Alvardo argues his sentence was proeedurally unreasonable. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">Section 3553(c) requires that the district court state its reasons for imposing a particular sentence. <em>Id. </em>The district court satisfies section 3553(c) if it states that it \u201chas considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis\u201d for its conclusion. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Docampo, </em>573 F.3d 1091, 1100 (11th Cir.2009). A brief explanation is sufficient, particularly when the arguments made are \u201cconceptually simple.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. at 2468.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">The explanation provided by the district court, \u201cthough brief, was legally sufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Alvardo argued briefly for a downward variance, but he admitted that he had a lengthy criminal history and a history of substance abuse. The district court acknowledged that Alvardo had \u201cmade a statement\u201d and then explained that it had \u201creviewed the presentence report and considered the advisory guidelines and the factors of 18 USC, Section 3553\u201d and determined that a sentence of 420 months of imprisonment within the guideline range was \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">We AFFIRM Alvardo\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
