Delacruz argues that the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained during a search of his residence. He specifically argues that the good-faith exception was not applicable to the warrant because the affiant, Sergeant Donald Repp, omitted certain facts that were critical to a proper finding of probable cause. Delacruz also argues that the warrant lacked probable cause because the supporting affidavit was \u201cbare bones.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Delacruz specifically contends that Sergeant Repp\u2019s affidavit omitted (1) the fact that alleged marijuana seeds and stems found in the garbage in front of a residence controlled by Delacruz were not field tested and (2) the fact that when officers contacted Delacruz to set up a controlled buy, Delacruz\u2019s brother showed up instead. According to Delacruz, these omissions militated against a confidential informant\u2019s (Cl) claims that he was a drug dealer and also prevented the magistrate from making an independent determination that there was probable cause to issue a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Even in the absence of a field test, the totality of the circumstances reveal that Sergeant Repp had probable cause to suspect that the substance found in the garbage was marijuana. <em>See United States v. Fisher, </em>22 F.3d 574, 578 (5th Cir.1994). The affidavit included a detailed explanation of Sergeant Repp\u2019s history, training, and experience investigating drug cases. Also, in the affidavit, Sergeant Repp asserted that the trash was filled with loose tobacco and empty cigar wrappers and that he knew from his experience as a narcotics officer that drug dealers often emptied the tobacco from cigars and replaced the tobacco with marijuana to make \u201c \u2018marijuana blunt\u2019 \u201d cigars.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Moreover, during his testimony at the suppression hearing, Sergeant Repp stated that the marijuana was \u201creadily recognizable,\u201d and that he did not believe he was required to perform a field test. Delacruz does not refute Sergeant Repp\u2019s extensive experience investigating drug crimes or Sergeant Repp\u2019s testimony regarding the field testing requirements, nor does Delacruz cite any case law mandating officers to field test marijuana. <em>See Waltman v. Payne, </em>535 F.3d 342, 347-48 (5th Cir.2008) (concluding that probable cause existed to believe substance was marijuana, even where field test was negative, based on officers\u2019 drug training and experience and knowledge that test was unreliable on fresh marijuana plants).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Furthermore, testimony at the suppression hearing did not reveal any specific details about the attempted controlled buy, and nothing in the record indicates the reason Delacruz\u2019s brother might have appeared at the controlled buy. The inclusion of any information about the attempted controlled buy would not have negated a finding of probable cause given that a reliable Cl witnessed Delacruz sell drugs and had also purchased drugs from Delacruz on numerous occasions and that Sergeant Repp conducted a lengthy surveillance of the suspected premises and vehicles and discovered cocaine residue and marijuana seeds and stems in the trash outside of the residence controlled by Delacruz. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>625 F.3d 830, 842 (5th Cir.2010), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Feb. 2, 2011) (No. 10-999). In addition, Delacruz had an extensive list of drug-related arrests and encounters with officers, which tends to confirm the Cl\u2019s statement that Delacruz was knowledgeable of and involved in the drug trade. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Satterwhite, </em>980 F.2d 317, 321 <em>&amp; </em>n. 5 (5th Cir.1992) (stating that a determination of probable cause requires only a \u201cprobabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>ty,\u201d not \u201ccertainty,\u201d that contraband will be located at the suspected premises).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Delacruz does not provide any evidence to establish that Sergeant Repp\u2019s omission regarding the testing, or lack thereof, of the marijuana and the omission regarding the attempted controlled buy were either material or omitted in reckless disregard for the truth. <em>See United States v. McCarty, </em>36 F.3d 1349, 1356 (5th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Cronan, </em>937 F.2d 163, 165 (5th Cir.1991). Because the affidavit was not misleading and set forth detailed information from which the magistrate could determine probable cause, the district court did not err in concluding that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied. <em>See United States v. Shugart, </em>117 F.3d 838, 844 (5th Cir.1997). Accordingly, we need not consider Delacruz\u2019s argument that the affidavit in support of the warrant did not present sufficient evidence to establish probable cause. <em>See United States v. Froman, </em>355 F.3d 882, 888 (5th Cir.2004). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b485-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
