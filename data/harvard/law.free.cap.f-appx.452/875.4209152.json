Reversible error has been shown; we vacate and remand for additional proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-13\">Palacios and his codefendant brother, Juan Palacios (\u201cJuan\u201d), pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money and money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(l)(A)(Z), (a)(2)(A), (h). Palacios filed a section 2255 motion and raised these claims: (1) he did not knowingly, intelligently, or voluntarily plead guilty; (2) his lawyer failed to file a motion to withdraw the guilty plea and plea agreement; (3) his lawyer failed to file a motion to compel the government to move for a downward departure, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1; (4) his lawyer failed to file a motion for a downward departure based on cooperation, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0; (5) his lawyer failed to file a motion to enforce the plea agreement and to object to the government\u2019s breach of the plea agreement; (6) he was actually innocent in the light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Santos, </em>553 U.S. 507, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008); and (7) his lawyer was ineffective for failing to file a direct appeal after being requested to do so. After filing a reply brief, Palacios filed a separate pleading in support of his Claim 6, adopting the portion of Juan\u2019s section 2255 reply brief that discussed the <em>Santos </em>decision.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d), recommending that the district court deny Palac-ios\u2019s motion to vacate. In doing so, the magistrate addressed the merits of Palac-ios\u2019s seven claims and stated that, to the extent Palacios adopted Juan\u2019s claims, those claims were denied for the reasons set forth in the R &amp; R issued in Juan\u2019s case. Palacios filed timely objections to the R &amp; R, asserting that he was entitled to relief on each of his seven claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s R &amp; R and denied Palacios\u2019s motion to vacate, stating that the court had reviewed the objections and had conducted \u201can independent and <em>de novo </em>review of the record.\u201d In its order, however, the court stated that Palacios and Juan had \u201cfiled similar motions to vacate ... raising the same claims.\u201d The court then identified both \u201cmovants\u2019 \u201d claims as follows: \u201c(1) they are actually innocent of all the charges; (2) their sentences should be vacated based on <em>[Santos]; </em>(3) they were denied effective aid with respect t[o] the first two claims; (4) their guilty pleas were not knowingly and voluntarily entered; and (5) they were denied effective aid of counsel because their attorney failed to file appeals to their sentences despite ... their wishes to do so.\u201d The court discussed each of these five claims and denied Palacios\u2019s motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">We granted a certificate of appealability on the following issue: \u201cWhether the district court erred by failing to conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of Palacios\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation, as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b)?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Pursuant to Rule 72(b), \u201c[t]he district judge must determine de novo any part of the magistrate judge\u2019s disposition that has been properly objected to.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b)(3); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1) (providing that \u201c[a] judge of the court shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the [magistrate\u2019s] report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made.\u201d). We review <em>de novo </em>the legal issue of whether the district court conducted a proper review of the record before adopting a magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation. <em>Cf. Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004) (providing that we review legal issues in section 2255 proceedings <em>de novo).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">Based on this record, we cannot conclude that the district court conducted the required <em>de novo </em>review of Palacios\u2019s objections to the R &amp; R. The court incorrectly characterized Palacios\u2019s claims as being \u201cthe same\u201d as Juan\u2019s and, in enumerating the claims, listed only the claims raised in Juan\u2019s section 2255 motion to vacate. Likewise, the court\u2019s analysis was limited to those claims raised in Juan\u2019s motion. Some of Palacios\u2019s claims overlapped with Juan\u2019s. But Palacios\u2019s motion to vacate included claims that were unique to Palac-ios\u2019s case, including-at the very least-those contentions set forth in Claims 2, 3, 4, and 5. Because the district court failed to address these arguments, we vacate and remand to the district court to conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of all of Palacios\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b900-9\"> Juan filed a section 2255 motion to vacate raising these five claims: (1) he was actually innocent based on <em>Santos-, </em>(2) his sentence was erroneously enhanced in the light of <em>San</em>tos; (3) his lawyer was ineffective for failing to raise Claims 1 and 2; (4) his guilty plea was not entered knowingly, intelligently, or voluntarily; and (5) his lawyer was ineffective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>for failing to file an appeal and for failing to inform him that the Supreme Court\u2019s grant of <em>certiorari </em>in <em>Santos </em>presented a potential ground for appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
