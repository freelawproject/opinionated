Fletcher responded by filing a <em>pro se </em>suit in Texas state court seeking an injunction to prevent Defendant-Appellee United States of America from collecting the taxes and a declaratory judgment that he was not required to pay his 2007 income taxes. The United States removed to district court and moved to dismiss. The district court dismissed Fletcher\u2019s suit for failing to comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code\u2019s Anti-Injunction Act, as well as the Declaratory Judgment Act. Fletcher now appeals the removal of his case from state court and its dismissal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-17\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b572-18\">On June 14, 2010, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) issued a notice of deficiency (the \u201cNotice\u201d) to Herbert Fletcher (\u201cFletcher\u201d or \u201cAppellant\u201d) for his 2007 income taxes in the amount of $15,111.00. The Notice included additions of $3,399.98 for failing to file a timely tax return under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6651(a)(1), $687.75 for failing to pay his estimated taxes under 26 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>\u00a7 6654(a), and $1,813.52 for failing to pay his taxes under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6651(a)(2). The Notice made clear that Fletcher could contest this determination in advance of making any payments by filing a petition in the United States Tax Court within 90 days of receipt of the Notice, giving Fletcher until September 13, 2010, to contest the IRS\u2019s determination. The Notice also stated that if Fletcher did not file a petition within 90 days or waive his right to petition, then the IRS would assess the deficiency and begin to bill him.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">On September 8, 2010, Fletcher filed a <em>pro se </em>action in the Judicial District Court of Kaufman County, Texas, against the United States and the United States of America (on appeal, \u201cthe United States\u201d or \u201cAppellee\u201d). In his complaint, Fletcher argued that because \u201c \u2018taxpayer\u2019 means \u2018fiduciary\u201d\u2019 and he never entered into a trust agreement with the federal government, he could not be taxed. As relief, Fletcher sought an injunction against the United States to prevent collection of his 2007 income taxes, as well as a declaratory judgment that \u201cFletcher owes nothing in response to the [IRS]\u2019 claims.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Fletcher also argued that this case was governed by the law of trusts, and because trust law is an issue of state law, there was no federal jurisdiction over his case making removal to federal district court impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">On October 6, 2010, the United States removed Fletcher\u2019s case from state court to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1441, 1442, and 1446. After removing, the United States filed a motion to extend its time to respond to Fletcher, which was granted-by the assigned magistrate judge. On October 27, 2010, Fletcher filed three motions simultaneously seeking to remand the case to state court, strike the United State\u2019 motion to extend, and to prevent the use of a magistrate judge. On November 1, 2010, the district court unfiled these motions for failing to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(a), as Fletcher had failed to properly sign them. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(a) (\u201cEvery ... written motion ... must be signed ... by a party personally if the party is unrepresented.\u201d). The district court also \u201cadmonish[ed] [Fletcher], that after further review of his motions, they appeared] to be devoid of merit and [were] frivolous,\u201d warning Fletcher that if \u201che cho[se] to re-file them, he could subject himself to sanctions.\u201d Undeterred by the district court\u2019s warning, Fletcher would re-file two of these motions, this time with proper signatures, along with a new third motion, on January 20, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">Prior to this, however, on December 14, 2010, the United States moved to dismiss Fletcher\u2019s complaint for want of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that Fletcher\u2019s suit sought an injunction in violation of the Anti-Injunction Act of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421(a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>claratory judgment in violation of the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The United States contended, in essence, that sovereign immunity barred Fletcher\u2019s suit, as Fletcher had not met the prerequisites required for filing a refund action, the sole procedure by which the United States has consented to be sued for the repayment of improperly assessed taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Fletcher moved again for a default judgment in response, arguing that the United States\u2019 motion to dismiss was untimely because he did not consent to use of \u201cnonjudicial decision-makers\u201d and thus the magistrate judge could not grant the United States\u2019 motion to extend its time to filed. Fletcher also filed a further motion to strike the United States\u2019 motion to dismiss, again arguing that he did not consent to the use of a magistrate judge. Along with this motion, Fletcher submitted a draft order to the court in which he implied that the government had engaged in \u201ccriminal violations\u201d against him and that the district court judge and magistrate judge had colluded in \u201charrass[ing] [and] intimidatfing]\u201d him. The United States responded to Fletcher\u2019s motions as being frivolous and requested that the district court grant it relief from having to respond to Fletcher\u2019s repeated motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Fletcher continued to file more motions, however. On January 20, 2011, Fletcher re-filed two of the motions that had been unfiled by the district court in late October, along with a new third motion. First, Fletcher filed still another motion to strike the United States\u2019 motion to dismiss, renewing his standing objection to the use of \u201cnon-judicial decision-makers\u201d and arguing, it appears, that either the United States itself or the Department of Justice lacked \u201csignature authority\u201d to issue the motions filed against him. Second, Fletcher filed a motion to remand his case to state court on grounds that there was no federal jurisdiction over his case, as \u201c \u2018[fjederal tax lav/ is trust law [and] trust law is state law.\u2019\u201d (emphasis omitted). Third, Fletcher filed a motion contesting the United States\u2019 request to be excused from responding to Fletcher\u2019s pleadings, describing the United States\u2019 motion as being \u201cfacially nuts.\u201d Fletcher also contended that the Anti-Injunction Act did not apply to him as he is not a \u201ctaxpayer,\u201d describing its requirement that he pursue his tax claims through a refund suit as \u201cnuts on its face.\u201d The United States replied to all three motions, reasserting that removal jurisdiction was proper and that Fletcher\u2019s filings were frivolous and procedurally improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">The district court granted the United States\u2019 motion to dismiss on March 22, 2011, 2011 WL 1043491. The court found that the United States had consented to suit for improperly assessed taxes, but only under the particular conditions out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>lined under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422. The district court observed that Fletcher had failed to meet these prerequisites and so the court was without power to hear his claims. The court likewise rejected federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, as \u00a7 1331 does not constitute a waiver of the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity. The court also declined to exercise subject matter jurisdiction based upon Fletcher\u2019s request for equitable, non-monetary relief because such jurisdiction is barred by the Internal Revenue Code\u2019s Anti-Injunction Act and Declaratory Judgment Act. The district court also denied all of Fletcher\u2019s outstanding motions, include the three motions submitted on January 20, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">On May 18, 2011, Fletcher timely appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal. While Fletcher\u2019s brief contains a range of interrelated challenges and claims, they can be reduced to two fundamental assertions. First, Fletcher argues that the district court improperly rejected his motion to remand his case to state court because removal of his case to federal court was improper. Second, Fletcher contends that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his case was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AeK\">A. Fletcher\u2019s Motion to Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">We first address whether the district court\u2019s denial of Fletcher\u2019s motion to remand was proper. \u201c[A] district court\u2019s denial of [a] motion to remand, the propriety of removal under the various governing statutes [including 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442], and the existence of subject-matter jurisdiction ... are all interrelated questions of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>Oviedo v. Hallbauer, </em>655 F.3d 419, 422 (5th Cir.2011). We construe the briefs of <em>pro se </em>litigants like Fletcher more liberally than those of litigants represented by counsel and afford them \u201call reasonable inferences which can be drawn from them.\u201d <em>Williams v. Valenti, </em>432 Fed.Appx. 298, 303 (5th Cir.2011) (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a)(1), \u201c[t]he United States or any agency thereof ... sued in an official or individual capacity for any act under color of such office or on account of any right, title or authority claimed under any Act of Congress for ... the collection of the revenue\u201d may remove a civil action commenced in state court to the proper district court. <em>See Arizona v. Manypenny, </em>451 U.S. 232, 242, 101 S.Ct. 1657, 68 L.Ed.2d 58 (1981) (\u201c[T]his Court has held that the right of removal is absolute for conduct performed under color of federal office, and has insisted that the policy favoring removal \u2018should not be frustrated by a narrow, grudging interpretation of \u00a7 1442(a)(1).\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Willingham v. Morgan, </em>395 U.S. 402, 407, 89 S.Ct. 1813, 23 L.Ed.2d 396 (1969))). This language is straightforward: Where the United States is sued in state court for an act under the color of its office involving the collection of revenues, it may remove the suit to federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">Fletcher\u2019s response to this seemingly unambiguous language is to assert that he is only nominally the plaintiff in this suit. Accordingly to Fletcher, it is the United States who is actually the <em>de facto </em>plaintiff as it is the \u201cdebt collector\u201d seeking to assess his tax deficiencies. Unfortunately for Fletcher, it was he who initially filed a state court action complaint seeking in-junctive and declaratory relief against the United States. <em>See Cavallini v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., </em>44 F.3d 256, 264 (5th Cir.1995) (removal jurisdiction is determined on the basis of the claims in the state court complaint at the time of removal). Thus, Fletcher\u2019s contrary notions aside, he was the plaintiff in his state court suit and the United States, as the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>dant, had the power to remove the case from Texas court to federal court under \u00a7 1442(a)(1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Fletcher\u2019s motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">B. Dismissal of Fletcher\u2019s Suit</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">We now turn to the dismissal of Fletcher\u2019s suit. This Court reviews claims of sovereign immunity <em>de novo. See Jacobs v. Nat\u2019l Drug Intelligence Ctr., </em>548 F.3d 375, 377 (5th Cir.2008). \u201cAbsent a waiver, sovereign immunity shields the Federal Government and its agencies from suit. Sovereign immunity is jurisdictional in nature. Indeed, the \u2018terms of [the United States\u2019] consent to be sued in any court define that court\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain the suit.\u2019\u201d <em>F.D.I.C. v. Meyer, </em>510 U.S. 471, 475, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994) (quoting <em>United States v. Sherwood, </em>312 U.S. 584, 586, 61 S.Ct. 767, 85 L.Ed. 1058 (1941)) (citations omitted, alteration in original). A \u201cguiding principle is that waivers of sovereign immunity should be narrowly construed in favor of the United States.\u201d <em>In re Supreme Beef Processors, Inc., </em>468 F.3d 248, 253 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Nordic Vill. Inc., </em>503 U.S. 30, 34, 112 S.Ct. 1011, 117 L.Ed.2d 181 (1992) (noting \u201cthe traditional principle that the Government\u2019s consent to be sued must be construed strictly in favor of the sovereign ... and not enlarge[d] ... beyond what the language [of the statute] requires\u201d) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The district courts have jurisdiction over \u201c[a]ny civil action against the United States for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority or any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected under the internal-revenue laws,\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1). However, this waiver of the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity is subject to additional conditions set forth in Internal Revenue Code\u2019s Anti-Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422(a). <em>See United States v. Dalm, </em>494 U.S. 596, 601, 110 S.Ct. 1361, 108 L.Ed.2d 548 (1990) (\u201cDespite its spacious terms, \u00a7 1346(a)(1) must be read in conformity with other statutory provisions which qualify a taxpayer\u2019s right to bring a refund suit upon compliance with certain conditions. The first is \u00a7 7422(a), which ... limits a taxpayer\u2019s right to bring a refund suit ....\u201d); <em>see also </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6532(a) (imposing additional conditions on suits brought under \u00a7 7422(a)). The Supreme Court has \u201cinterpreted the principal purpose of [\u00a7 7422(a) ] to be the protection of the Government\u2019s need to assess and collect taxes as expeditiously as possible with a minimum of preenforcement judicial interference, \u2018and to require that the legal right to the disputed sums be determined in a suit for refund.\u2019\u201d <em>Bob Jones Univ. v. Simon, </em>416 U.S. 725 736-737, 94 S.Ct. 2038, 40 L.Ed.2d 496 (1974) (quoting <em>Enochs v. Williams Packing &amp; Navigation Co., </em>370 U.S. 1, 7, 82 S.Ct. 1125, 8 L.Ed.2d 292 (1962)). Under \u00a7 7422(a), before a taxpayer can bring a refund suit, he or she must first fully pay the assessed tax, file an administrative claim for refund with the IRS, and wait until either the IRS denies the claim or six months have expired since filing the administrative claim. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6532(a), 7422(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">Fletcher has not pleaded or provided any evidence that he has complied with \u00a7 7422(a)\u2019s prerequisites, and there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>indication in the record that he has fully paid the deficiency assessed on him or even filed an administrative claim for a refund. Indeed, in his motions before the district court, Fletcher repeatedly declared that he had no intention of complying with the refund system, a \u201cbooby-trapped\u201d forum, as he styles it. Accordingly, the district court held correctly that because Fletcher has failed to meet the prerequisites of the Anti-Injunction Act, his claims for injunctive relief must be dismissed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Similarly, the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a), denies jurisdiction to the district courts to grant declaratory relief with respect to federal taxes. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a) (\u201cIn a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction, except with respect to Federal taxes ..., any court of the United States ... may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party .... \u201d); <em>see also Bob Jones Univ., </em>416 U.S. at 732 n. 7, 94 S.Ct. 2038 (\u201cThe congressional antipathy for premature interference with the assessment or collection of any federal tax also extends to declaratory judgments.\u201d). This bars federal jurisdiction over any declaratory relief that Fletcher seeks. Consequently, the district court had no jurisdiction over any of Fletcher\u2019s claims and so we affirm its decision to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">C. Remaining Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Fletcher raises two final issues, both without merit. First, Fletcher objects to the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a default judgment against the United States since he did not consent to the use of \u201cnon-judicial decision makers\u201d and a magistrate judge granted the United States\u2019 motion to extend its time to file its answer. A motion to extend time falls within the plain language of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(a), which provides that \u201ca pretrial matter not dispositive of a party\u2019s claim or defense\u201d may be heard by a magistrate judge. Fed.R.CivP. 72(a); <em>see Tucker v. United States Dep\u2019t of Army, </em>56 F.3d 1384, 1995 WL 337670, at *2 (5th Cir. May 16, 1995) (per curiam) (holding that motion for default judgment was properly denied by the district court because magistrate judge had authority under Rule 72(a) to grant party\u2019s motion to extend time). Accordingly, the magistrate judge could grant the United States\u2019 motion to extend time and so the district court properly rejected Fletcher\u2019s motion for a default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">Fletcher also argues that the district court improperly unfiled his three October 27, 2010, motions with any notice or opportunity to cure. This is flatly wrong. Fletcher was given notice of the defects in his motions and later re-filed two of the three motions properly. His decision to not re-file the third unsigned motion does not affect our conclusion that he had proper notice and the opportunity to correct his motions. His claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b572-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b573-7\">. Meanwhile, since Fletcher had not filed a petition in the Tax Court within the 90 day period for contesting tax deficiencies, the IRS proceeded assessed his deficiency at $23,849.46, including interest, as well as fa.il-ure-to-pay penalties for all three of his violations. Fletcher filed for a temporary injunction to preclude assessment of the deficiency in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, arguing that he was not a taxpayer and so any collection against him would be illegal. The district court denied Fletcher\u2019s motion for a temporary injunction on grounds that he did not meet any of the prerequisites for that relief. Fletcher appealed to this court, but we dismissed his appeal for want of prosecution on April 27, 2011. Fletcher's subsequent petition for a writ of certiorari was denied by the Supreme Court on October 3, 2011.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b573-10\">. The statute provides, in relevant portion, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or of any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority, or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected, until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the Secretary, according to the provisions of law in that regard, and the regulations of the Secretary established in pursuance thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b574-10\">. The statute provides that: \"In a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction, <em>except with respect to Federal taxes </em>..., any court of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b576-7\">. Fletcher also contends that there is no federal question or diversity jurisdiction. Since we find that there was removal jurisdiction under \u00a7 1442, we do not address these additional issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b577-8\">. In <em>Williams Packing, </em>the Supreme Court crafted a narrow exception to the Anti-Injunction Act\u2019s prerequisites for filing a refund suit for plaintiffs who could show (1) irreparable injury and the other elements necessary for injunctive relief, and (2) certainty of success on the merits of the claim. <em>See Williams Packing, </em>370 U.S. at 6-7, 82 S.Ct. 1125; <em>see also Bob Jones Univ., </em>416 U.S. at 737, 94 S.Ct. 2038. Without addressing the first factor, it is clear that Fletcher fails to meet the second. His lawsuit boils down to an generalized attack on the legitimacy of the tax system and Fletcher nowhere demonstrates the possibility of, much less certain, success on the merits of this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
