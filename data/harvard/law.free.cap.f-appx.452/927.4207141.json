On appeal, Johnson argues that in applying 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s sentencing factors, the district court improperly relied on facts, such as Johnson\u2019s criminal history, that the district court had already considered in determining Johnson\u2019s guideline range. Johnson contends that the district court\u2019s improper reliance on such facts resulted in an unreasonable upward variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-19\">\u201cTo be upheld on appeal, a sentence must be both procedurally and substantively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>628 F.3d 1258, 1264 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation omitted). We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion when it (1) fails to afford consideration to relevant factors that were due significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or (3) commits a clear error of judgment in considering the proper factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-20\">While Johnson does not clearly distinguish between procedural and substantive reasonableness, he appears to argue that his sentence is (1) procedurally unreasonable because the district court improperly considered facts that had already been accounted for in the guideline range calculation; and (2) substantively unreasonable because none of \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s sentencing factors would have justified the upward variance had the district court not committed the procedural error of considering such improper facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-21\">Foreclosing Johnson\u2019s arguments, this Court has repeatedly \u201cheld that a district court can rely on factors in imposing a variance that it had already considered in imposing an enhancement.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>628 F.3d at 1264; <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833-34 (11th Cir.2007). Accordingly, we affirm the 84-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
