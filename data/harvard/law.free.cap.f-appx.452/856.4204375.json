Myers sought declaratory and injunctive relief to order MO &amp; Company to make its facilities accessible and usable by persons with disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">During the discovery phase the parties reached a confidential settlement agreement. MO &amp; Company agreed to make certain alterations to the barbershop in exchange for Myers dropping his lawsuit. MO &amp; Company also agreed to pay Myers $8,600 in attorney\u2019s fees and $400 in court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">The parties filed a joint stipulation for dismissal with prejudice under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(l)(ii). The district court dismissed the case, in accordance with its local rule, M.D. Fla. R. 3.08, without prejudice \u201csubject to the right of the parties,\u201d within 60 days, to submit a stipulated form of final order or judgment, if they chose to do so, or to move \u201cto reopen the action, upon good cause.\u201d (emphasis omitted). The dismissal would be with prejudice following that 60-day period. The district court, however, did something beyond the scope of its local rule. It expressly retained jurisdiction \u201cduring and after\u201d the 60-day period \u201cto determine the reasonableness of [Myers\u2019] attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d The district court also prohibited payments of fees or costs without its consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">Two months later Myers\u2019 attorney submitted an affidavit detailing his fees. The district court then entered an order reducing the attorney\u2019s fees award to $5,450 and ruled that Myers was not entitled to reimbursement for his personal expenses. The district court then dismissed the case with prejudice. Myers\u2019 appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Adventure Outdoors, Inc. v. Bloomberg, </em>552 F.3d 1290, 1294 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cWe also review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation of federal procedural rules.\u201d <em>United States v. Elmes, </em>532 F.3d 1138, 1141 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(l)(ii) provides: \u201c[T]he plaintiff may dismiss an action without a court order by filing ... a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 41(a)(l)(ii). The Supreme Court has stated that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1) \u201cdoes not by its terms empower a district court to attach conditions to the parties\u2019 stipulation of dismissal.\u201d <em>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>511 U.S. 375, 381-82, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 1677, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994). The Supreme Court held in <em>Kokkonen </em>that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement after a Rule 41(a)(l)(ii) dismissal with prejudice. <em>Id. </em>A district court may retain jurisdiction over the settlement, however, if the court \u201cembod[ies] the settlement contract in its dismissal order (or, what has the same effect, retain[s] jurisdiction over the settlement contract) <em>if the parties agree.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). This Court has interpreted <em>Kokkonen </em>as follows: \u201c[I]f the district court either incorporates the terms of a settlement into its final order of dismissal <em>or </em>expressly retains jurisdiction to enforce a settlement, it may thereafter enforce the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement.\u201d <em>Am. Disability Ass\u2019n v. Chmielarz, </em>289 F.3d 1315, 1320 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>The district court\u2019s dismissal order in the present case did not incorporate the settlement or even mention it. Nor did the district court retain jurisdiction <em>to enforce </em>the settlement agreement. The district court purported to retain jurisdiction only to modify the agreement. It was without the authority to do so, especially because neither Myers nor MO &amp; Company agreed to the district court\u2019s authority over the settlement. <em>See Kokkonen, </em>511 U.S. at 381-82, 114 S.Ct. at 1677. The district court thus had no subject matter jurisdiction when it ordered the reduction of Myers\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED with instructions to dismiss with prejudice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
