Reviewing the record de novo, <em>see Dickie Brennan &amp; Co. v. Lexington Ins. Co., </em>636 F.3d 683, 685 (5th Cir.2011), we AFFIRM essentially for the reasons given by the district court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-9\">1. The undisputed record evidence shows that Liberty Mutual paid Harp temporary income benefits throughout the claims process. It also shows that Harp was provided with prescription medication, a surgical nerve block injection, and a walking boot for her compen-sable injury. Liberty Mutual disputed whether the extent of Harp\u2019s foot injury included chronic femoral pain syndrome, a foot cyst, knee pain, bursitis, and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), but the record fails to show that specific medical treatment or income benefits were improperly denied. Conclusory assertions by Harp\u2019s treating physician that the carrier was denying all medical treatment and medications are belied by the record and fail to create a genuine issue of material fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-12\">2. We find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s refusal to consider evidence that Harp submitted for the first time in her objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report. At most, the evidence constituted only a scintilla of evidence and is insufficient to defeat summary judgment. <em>See Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc). Most of the evidence is also contradicted by the record showing Liberty Mutual\u2019s payment of medical and income benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b612-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
