On appeal, Barboza-Maldonado argues that the Government breached the terms of the plea agreement. He also contends that the district court erred by denying him credit for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>As Barboza-Maldonado concedes, he did not object based on a breach of the plea agreement in the district court; thus, our review is for plain error only. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1428-33, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). When determining whether the Government violated the terms of a plea agreement, we must consider \u201cwhether the government\u2019s conduct is consistent with the defendant\u2019s reasonable understanding of the agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>476 F.3d 369, 387-88 (5th Cir.2007) <em>(citing United States v. Valencia, </em>985 F.2d 758, 761 (5th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Barboza-Maldonado specifically asserts that his plea agreement limited him to being punished solely for the offense charged and that by failing to mention that relevant conduct not included in the factual resume could be used to enhance his sentence, the Government breached its agreement not to criminally prosecute him for other acts arising from the conduct charged. He further contends that the Government breached its obligation to move for an additional point reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The Government never promised to refrain from using relevant conduct, where appropriate, to calculate the offense level. The plea agreement provided that the sentence \u201cmay be determined in accordance with the ... Sentencing Guidelines ... based on information the Government and Defendant provide the Court.\u201d Section lB1.3(a) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines provides that relevant conduct shall be considered when determining the defendant\u2019s base offense level. It is well established that non-adjudicated offenses may be considered relevant conduct under the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Brummett, </em>355 F.3d at 343, 344 (5th Cir.2003); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, comment. (n.l(H)) (defining \u201coffense\u201d to include \u201cthe offense of conviction and all relevant conduct under \u00a7 1B1.3\u201d). Moreover, the inclusion of relevant conduct in the calculation of the guidelines sentencing range is not a violation of the Government\u2019s agreement not to prosecute a defendant for additional offenses. <em>See United States v. Hoster, </em>988 F.2d 1374, 1378 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">In addition, the Government was under no obligation to move for the additional point reduction because it agreed to make such a motion only if Barboza-Mal-donado was entitled to a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3El.l(a). The district court concluded that Barboza-Maldonado was not entitled to such a reduction. Barboza-Maldonado has not demonstrated that his interpretation of the plea agreement was reasonable, <em>see Lewis, </em>476 F.3d at 387-88; thus, he has not shown plain error with respect to his claim that the Government breached the plea agreement. <em>See Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">The plea agreement contained a provision wherein Barboza-Maldonado waived the right to challenge his guilty plea or the sentence imposed, either on direct appeal or on collateral review, except where he alleged prosecutorial misconduct or ineffective assistance of counsel. The record reveals that Barboza-Maldonado knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal; therefore, he cannot challenge the district court\u2019s denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility unless he can demonstrate that the Government breached the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005) (citing <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746-47 (5th Cir.2005)); <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>309 F.3d 882, 886 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">The record further reveals that the Government complied with all of its obligations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>under the plea agreement by not bringing any additional criminal charges, not contesting Barboza-Maldonado\u2019s eligibility for an acceptance of responsibility reduction, and by moving for dismissal of any remaining counts of the indictment. Accordingly, because Barboza-Maldonado\u2019s sentencing issue is barred by a valid appeal waiver provision, we decline to address the merits of his argument. <em>See United States v. Sanchez Guerrero, </em>546 F.3d 328, 335 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Bond, </em>414 F.3d at 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b549-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
