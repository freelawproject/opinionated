Bashore contends: the district court erroneously applied a heightened pleading standard; and, she pleaded sufficient facts to support her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-23\">A dismissal for failure to state a claim is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>all well-pleaded facts are accepted as true and viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff. <em>E.g., Randall D. Wolcott, M.D., P.A. v. Sebelius, </em>635 F.3d 757, 763 (5th Cir.2011). A pleading must contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief\u2019. Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The district court correctly applied that standard and, additionally, recognizing Ba-shore\u2019s <em>pro se </em>status, allowed her to file an amended complaint, after determining the original complaint was eonclusional.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Bashore reiterates the allegations raised in her complaint: she owed no debt; ap-pellees ignored her letters of dispute; and, they continued collection activities after her dispute-notification.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">First, the district court did not err in dismissing Bashore\u2019s FDCPA claims. Regardless of whether a debt existed, it was not a violation of FDCPA for appellees to send Bashore written communications regarding the claimed debt. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g. Nor does FDCPA require the debt collector to respond by letter of verification to the consumer\u2019s letter of dispute; the debt collector is instead required only to cease collection of the debt until verification of the debt is obtained. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g(b). Bashore\u2019s allegation that Financial Recovery Services, Inc. (FRS), failed to cease collection activities after notification of her dispute was rejected by the district court on the basis that Bashore did not allege she notified FRS of the dispute within the 30-day period established by FDCPA. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g(a)(3), (b). Along that line, Ba-shore\u2019s general allegations that appellees failed to cease collection efforts after notification of her dispute are unsupported by specific factual allegations in her complaint that permit our court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct. <em>See Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1950 (\u201cthe complaint has alleged \u2014 but it has not \u2018show[n]\u2019 \u2014 \u2018that the pleader is entitled to relief \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Regarding her FCRA claim, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-2(b)(l), Bashore again has not alleged sufficient facts to show a violation. Her assertion that the statute mandates that the allegedly inaccurate information be deleted from her credit reports on account of her dispute is inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Bashore next contends TDCPA required an investigation and response by appellees to her letter of dispute. <em>See </em>Tex. Fin.Code \u00a7 392.202(a), (b). Her complaint, however, verifies that Bashore received notice from TransUnion and Ex-pel\u00edan regarding the results of their investigation of the debt reported by ap-pellee LVNV Funding, L.L.C. Thus, the district court did not err in dismissing Bashore\u2019s TDCPA claim. Moreover, as Bashore\u2019s purported TDCPA claim is the sole basis on which she contends she has stated a TDTPA claim, she has shown no error in the dismissal of the TDTPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Bashore\u2019s allegations of publication of false information are eonclusional and, thus, insufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss her defamation claim. <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949. Finally, the dismissal of Bashore\u2019s negligence claim was not error, as she pleaded no facts plausibly giving rise to an entitlement to relief on the basis of a breach of duty. <em>See, e.g., Dukes v. Philip Johnson/Alan Ritchie Architects, P.C., </em>252 S.W.3d 586, 591 (Tex.Ct.App.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b547-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
