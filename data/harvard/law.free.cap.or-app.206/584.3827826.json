The court imposed an upward dispositional and durational departure sentence of 12 months\u2019 imprisonment and 12 months\u2019 post-prison supervision on the burglary conviction, based on its findings that defendant was on probation at the time of the offense and that defendant had \u201ccompletely avoided efforts to rehabilitate himself.\u201d On appeal, defendant argues that the departure sentence violates the principles articulated in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 US 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000), because it was based on facts that were not admitted by defendant or found by a jury. Although defendant did not advance such a challenge below, he argues that the sentence should be reviewed as plain error. Under our decision in <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>205 Or App 113, 133 P3d 343 (2006), the sentence is plainly erroneous. For the reasons set forth in <em>Ramirez, </em>we exercise our discretion to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Sentences vacated; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
