A jury found that NEC infringed both literally and under the doctrine of equivalents. The trial court then granted judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) that NEC did not infringe and overturned the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Laitram Corp. v. NEC Corp., </em>No. 89-CV-1571, slip op. at 1, 1994 WL 261966 (E.D.La. June 6, 1994) (Order). Because the trial court erred in granting JMOL, this court reverses and remands for reinstatement of the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-12\">The '311 patent claims an electro-optical printer that prints letter quality, alpha-numeric characters on a photosensitive recording medium. Apparatus claim 1 and method claim 2 recite:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1477-14\">1. An electro-optical printing apparatus for printing type quality alpha-numeric characters at high speed on a surface of a photosensitive recording material, said apparatus comprising:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1477-15\">a plurality of rapidly reacting radiation emitters each being capable of emitting radiation at wavelengths to which said surface is sensitive, said emitters being disposed in an array along a substantially straight line, said array being a plurality of rows of said radiation emitters;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1477-16\">means for moving said recording material in a single direction substantially perpendicular to said straight line with its surface adjacent said array, and at a substantially constant speed relative to said array and;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1477-17\">means for selectively activating each of said emitters for predetermined periods of time, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1477-18\">means for coordinating the predetermined period of time in which each of the said plurality of emitters are activated with said constant relative speed of said recording material so that the radiation emitted by said emitters will be recorded on selected areas of said recording surface in the form of an alpha-numeric image,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxM\">each of said emitters being positioned to irradiate a different area of said recording surface, the different areas of said surface irradiated by each of the said emitters being arranged in an overlapping relationship with one another and said plurality of emitters being of sufficient number to print said type quality alpha-numeric characters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1477-19\">2. A method of eleetro-optically printing type quality alpha-numeric characters at high speed on the recording surface of a photosensitive material, said method comprising the steps of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1477-20\">arranging a plurality of rapidly reacting radiation emitters in a straight line array, each of the said emitters being capable of emitting radiation at wavelengths to which said photosensitive material is sensitive,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWo\">selectively energizing for predetermined periods of time each of the said emitters,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1390\">*1390</page-number>transmitting the emitted radiation from each of the said emitters to a different area on said surface,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1478-4\">providing relative movement along a single coordinate substantially perpendicular to said array at substantially constant speed between said recording surface and said emitters, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1478-5\">coordinating the predetermined periods of time in which each of said plurality of emitters is selectively energized with said constant speed of said relative movement between said emitters and recording surface so that alpha-numeric character images are recorded on said recording surface by exposure of selected areas of said recording surface by said emitted radiation, said step of coordinating including the steps of synchronously generating a <em>first </em>data signal which programs the order of energization of said emitters and a second data signal which determines the duration of the energization period of said emitters, and employing said first and second data signals to effect energization of said emitters so as to record said alpha-numeric character images of said type quality at said high speed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1478-7\">(Emphasis omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-8\">During printing, photosensitive paper or other recording medium moves at constant speed past an array of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in a direction perpendicular to the LED array. As the paper moves, the LEDs selectively activate (claim 1) or energize (claim 2) to expose, and thereby darken, stripes of varying lengths on the paper. These stripes <em>form </em>alpha-numeric characters, such as the \u201cS\u201d shown in Figure 1 of the patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-9\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-10\">To create the \u201cS,\u201d the LEDs activate for variable periods of time, the activation period determining the length of a stripe.</p>\n<p id=\"AQan\">The '311 specification discloses two ways to print a stripe during an activation period, In one embodiment, an LED corresponding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1391\">*1391</page-number>to the desired stripe location turns ON at the beginning of the activation period and remains continuously lit until the end of the period. The stripe thus printed combines with other stripes to form an alpha-numeric character. In a second embodiment, an LED rapidly turns ON and OFF, or strobes, during the activation period. The strobed LED activation method also produces solid stripes which form characters on the paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-4\">Laitram sued NEC for infringement of claims 1 and 2 of the \u2019311 patent. NEC\u2019s accused printer produces letter quality, alpha-numeric characters on a photo-sensitive recording medium. As the recording medium moves past LEDs arranged in an array, the NEC printer selectively strobes the LEDs to print characters. Each strobe is of fixed duration. Oval-shaped marks produced by a strobed LED overlap to create a stripe. The stripe length varies depending on the duration of the strobing. The stripes form characters, such as the \u201cS\u201d shown in the trial exhibit offered by Laitram below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-7\">Before trial, a third party requested reexamination of the \u2019311 patent as originally issued based on newly cited prior art. The trial court stayed the case pending conclusion of the reexamination. During reexamination, Laitram amended and added claims. The reexamination, however, did not change the language of the claim limitations at issue in this case. When the Reexamination Certificate issued, the trial court reopened the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-8\">The parties introduced extensive evidence over a five-day jury trial. The trial court sent the issues of claim construction, infringement, willfulness, and damages to the jury with proper instructions. The jury rendered its verdict on claim construction and literal infringement in special interrogatory form, as excerpted below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1479-10\">A. Do you find that the language in Claim 1 \u201cmeans for selectively activating each of the emitters for predetermined periods of time\u201d covers an LED printer in which the LEDs are turned ON on different occasions but on each occasion for a fixed period of time? yes x no</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1392\">*1392</page-number>B. Do you find that the language in Claim 2 \u201cselectively energizing for predetermined periods of time each of said emitters\u201d covers an LED printer in which the LEDs are turned ON on different occasions but on each occasion for a fixed period of time? yes x no</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1480-5\">C. Do you find that the language in Claim 2 \u201ca second data signal which determines the duration of the energization period of said emitters\u201d covers an LED printer in which the LEDs are turned ON on different occasions but on each occasion for a fixed period of time? yes x no</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1480-7\">The jury found that NEC literally and willfully infringed and awarded Laitram a reasonable royalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-8\">After the jury verdict, NEC filed a JMOL motion challenging the jury\u2019s verdict of literal infringement. The trial court held that the jury erred as a matter of law in interpreting the claims and entered JMOL of noninfringement. <em>Laitram Corp., </em>No. 89-CV-1571, slip op. at 1, 1994 WL 261966. Laitram appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-11\">When a party appeals from a trial court\u2019s post-verdict grant of JMOL, this court reviews the trial court\u2019s claim construction, a matter of law, <em>de novo. See Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., </em>52 F.3d 967, 979, 34 USPQ2d 1321, 1329 (Fed.Cir.1995) <em>(en banc). </em>The claim limitations at issue in this case are: (1) \u201cmeans for selectively activating each of said emitters for predetermined periods of time\u201d in claim 1, (2) \u201cselectively energizing for predetermined periods of time each of the said emitters\u201d in claim 2, and (3) \u201csynchronously generating a first data signal ... and a second data signal which determines the duration of the energization period of said emitters\u201d in claim 2. Both parties agree that the periods of activation (claim 1) or energization (claim 2) \u2014 the periods during which the printer' prints a stripe \u2014 vary with the desired stripe length. The dispute in this case is whether the claim terms \u201cselectively activating\u201d in claim 1 and \u201cselectively energizing\u201d in claim 2 cover printing strobed stripes, or whether those claim terms encompass only printing continuous stripes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-13\">In construing claim language, the court considers the claims at issue, the specification, and the prosecution history. <em>Markman, </em>52 F.3d at 979 (quoting <em>Unique Concepts, Inc. v. Brown, </em>939 F.2d 1558, 1561, 19 USPQ2d 1500, 1503 (Fed.Cir.1991)). The specification of the '311 patent discloses strobing the LEDs to print an exposed \u201cregion\u201d or stripe:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1480-14\">[T]he recording medium can be moved at a relatively slower speed such that each emitter can be <em>flashed or \u201cstrobed\" </em>a selected number of times to expose a particular region to the radiant energy required to provide a predetermined density.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1480-15\">(Emphasis added.) Thus, the specification contemplates strobing during the variable periods of selective activation (as in claim 1) or selective energization (as in claim 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-16\">Dependent claims 4 and 27 confirm that \u201cselectively activating\u201d in claim 1 and \u201cselectively energizing\u201d in claim 2 cover strobing. Although each claim is an independent invention, dependent claims can aid in interpreting the scope of claims from which they depend. Claim 4 which depends from claim 3, in turn depending from claim 1, recites:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1480-17\">4. An electro-optical printing apparatus as recited in claim 3 further comprising means for flashing said emitters a number of times along said linear regions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1480-18\">Claim 4 covers an embodiment of the invention recited in claim 1 where the printer flashes, or strobes, LEDs during the activation period to print \u201clinear regions\u201d or stripes. Claim 27, which depends from claim 2, recites:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1480-19\">27. A method of electro-optically printing alpha-numeric characters on the recording surface of a photosensitive material as recited in claim 2 wherein said step in which the emitters are selectively energized includes the step of strobing said emitters during the duration of the energization period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1393\">*1393</page-number>Claim 27 makes clear that, in one embodiment of the invention recited in claim 2, strobing occurs during the energization period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-4\">The prosecution history does not suggest a different result, moreover. During prosecution of the reexamination application, Lai-tram distinguished claim 2 from two prior art references. The first reference, United States Patent No. 3,085,132 to Innes (the Innes patent), discloses a dot matrix printer that forms alpha-numeric characters by marking distinct dots on a recording medium. For example, an \u201cE\u201d produced by the Innes printer appears below:</p>\n<p id=\"pAVU\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-8\">Laitram distinguished the Innes patent on the basis of the \u201cfixed timing of the Innes dot matrix\u201d and the Innes\u2019 \u201cfixed-time-duration pulses\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1481-9\">[I]n alleging that Innes in the \u201cplot mode\u201d operates in accordance with claim 2 ignores the claimed mode of operation which records <em>alpha-numeric character images </em>by means of second data signals that determine the duration of the energization period of the emitters coordinated by the constant speed movement along the Y axis as taught [by the '311 patent]. The character style S of Fig. 1 is unique to [the \u2019311 patent] and goes contrary to the fixed timing of the Innes dot matrix.... [I]nnes teaches only a dot [point] mode for both alphanumeric and plot modes.... Further, it is clear from Innes ... that all marking is done with \u201cfixed-time-duration\u201d pulses, as contrasted to the claimed second data signal which determines the variable duration of [the '311 patent] line type marks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1481-10\">(Emphasis in original.) Unlike the claimed printer, the Innes printer does not print <em>stnpes </em>of varying length. Rather, the Innes printer produces distinct dots of fixed length by fixed duration pulses. Thus, this passage from the prosecution history does not define the relevant claim language of the \u2019311 patent to mean something other than strobing during the activation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-11\">Laitram also distinguished United States Patent No. 1,201,624 to Baylis (the Baylis patent) from claim 2 of the \u2019311 patent. The Baylis patent discloses an electro-optical printer that uses LEDs to record an image on a recording surface. Laitram explained a difference between the claimed printer and that disclosed in the Baylis patent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1481-12\">Nor is there anticipation of the step of \u201ccoordinating \u2014 including the step of synchronously generating <em>a second data signal which determines the duration of ener-gization period </em>of said emitters\u201d in view of the absence of Baylis of any teaching of determining the duration of or of coordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1394\">*1394</page-number>nating [Baylis\u2019] continuously energized emitter 114 synchronously with anything. ... [T]he Faraday <em>shutter </em>cells [of Baylis] are scanned and arranged to selectively gate light <em>one at a time ... \u201cto build up from rows of spots images of the cells 111.\u201d </em>That passage does not anticipate or teach in any way the second data signal defined in Claim 2 of variable duration to effect energization of the plurality of emitters to form line images.... Thus, Baylis does not in the Fig. 2 embodiment anticipate the variable duration defined by the claimed step of \u201ccoordinating \u2014 a second data signal which <em>determines the duration of the energization period of said </em>emitters.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1482-4\">(Emphasis in original.) Again, this passage does not define the relevant claim language to exclude strobed striping. Laitram noted that the Baylis printer builds characters from rows of distinct spots. Laitram then pointed out that the Baylis patent does not teach synchronization of a plurality of emitters with the movement of a recording medium to <em>form </em>vertical line images or stripes. At no time during prosecution did Laitram represent that the relevant claim language could not embrace painting stripes by fixed-time strobing during variable periods of activation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-5\">In sum, claims 1 and 2, as properly construed, cover both printing continuous and strobed stripes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-7\">The trial court sent the issue of claim construction to the jury in the form of special interrogatories. Because claim construction is a legal issue within the sole province of the court, this court will treat the jury\u2019s claim construction as an advisory determination. In granting JMOL to NEC, however, the trial court ultimately construed claims 1 and 2 of the \u2019311 patent, exercising its power and obligation to decide the meaning of the claims as a matter of law. <em>See Markman, </em>52 F.3d at 979. This court now must determine whether the trial court\u2019s claim construction survives our <em>de novo </em>review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-8\">The trial court began correctly by recognizing that the \u2019311 patent claims a method and apparatus for activating LEDs for variable periods of time, depending on the desired stripe length. The trial court also correctly found that the claims \u201cmay allow flashing or strobing during the [activation] period.\u201d The trial court thus correctly construed the claims to cover variable activation periods and strobing during those variable activation periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-9\">Yet, the trial court inexplicably concluded that NEC\u2019s accused printers could not literally infringe the claims. The trial court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADT\">[T]he jury erred as a matter of law in interpreting the scope of claims 1 and 2 to cover an LED printer in which the LEDs are turned [ON] on different occasions but on each occasion for a fixed period of time. Because claims 1 and 2 cannot be interpreted to read on such a device, the jury\u2019s finding of literal infringement by the NEC printer cannot stand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1482-10\">The trial court thus construed claims 1 and 2 not to cover strobed printing. This erroneous conclusion contradicts the trial court\u2019s own prior determination that claims 1 and 2 embrace strobing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-11\">Claims 1 and 2, as properly construed in view of the specification, other claims, and prosecution history, cover LEDs which are strobed \u2014 each strobe of fixed duration \u2014 during variable periods of activation. To the extent the trial court found differently in granting JMOL, it erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-12\">Although claim construction is properly a matter of law for the trial court, this court notes that the jury applied the correct construction of the claims in reaching its infringement verdict. The jury found that claims 1 and 2 cover \u201cLED printers in which the LEDs are turned ON on different occasions but on each occasion for a fixed period of time.\u201d The jury presumably read \u201cON\u201d to refer to rapid ON-and-OFF strobing and properly construed the claims to cover LED printers which print with fixed pulse LED strobes during variable periods of activation. In other words, the jury could have read the special interrogatory to ask whether claims 1 and 2 cover \u201cLED printers in which the LEDs are turned ON [i.e., strobed or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1395\">*1395</page-number>flashed] on different occasions but on each occasion for a fixed period [i.e., strobe or flash period] of time.\u201d The jury\u2019s affirmative response to this special interrogatory on claim construction is consistent with its infringement finding. <em>See Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc. v. Ellerman Lines, Ltd., </em>369 U.S. 355, 364, 82 S.Ct. 780, 786, 7 L.Ed.2d 798 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-6\">It remains only to determine whether substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s fact finding that NEC infringes claims 1 and 2 as properly construed. <em>See Read Corp. v. Portec, Inc., </em>970 F.2d 816, 821, 23 USPQ2d 1426, 1431 (Fed.Cir.1992). Laitram presented substantial evidence from which the jury could reasonably find that NEC\u2019s accused printers infringed. Using a mechanical model to represent the electronics of an electro-optical printer, Laitram\u2019s expert, Mr. Prohofsky, demonstrated to the jury how such a printer prints stripes by strobing. Mr. Prohofsky also testified in detail about the operation of NEC\u2019s printer and compared the claims to circuit diagrams of NEC\u2019s printer and to its operation. Thus, substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding of literal infringement. Because this court resolves the issues on appeal on literal infringement grounds, this court need not reach the issue of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-8\">The trial court erred in granting NEC JMOL and overturning the jury\u2019s infringement verdict. Therefore, this court reverses and remands with instructions to reinstate the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-9\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-10\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-11\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
