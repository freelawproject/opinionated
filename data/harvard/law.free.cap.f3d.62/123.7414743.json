GARZA, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">Felix Tamez brought suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1988) against the City of San Marcos, Texas (the \u201cCity\u201d) and Daniel Misiaszek, a San Marcos police officer, claiming that in investigating a \u201cshots fired\u201d call, Misiaszek illegally entered Tamez\u2019 home and used excessive force against him. Tamez also brought supplemental state claims of negligence, civil assault and battery, and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. A magistrate judge denied Misiasz-ek and the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on qualified and official immunity, and Misiaszek and the City filed an interlocutory appeal. We dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b212-15\">San Marcos police officer Daniel Misiaszek responded to a complaint that shots had been fired in the back yard of Felix Tamez\u2019 home. After searching the back yard, Misiaszek walked around to the front porch. According to Tamez, Misiaszek proceeded to enter the house and shoot him. Tamez filed suit in state court against Misiaszek and the City, and Misiaszek and the City removed the suit to federal court. Tamez died, and a magistrate judge substituted members of Tamez\u2019 family as plaintiffs. The Tamezes moved for partial summary judgment, and the City and Misiaszek filed a cross-motion to dismiss or for summary judgment on the grounds that (1) Misiaszek is entitled to qualified immunity, and (2) the City is entitled to official immunity from suit under the Texas Tort Claims Act, Tex.Civ.Prac. <em>&amp; </em>Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 1.001-09 (West 1986 &amp; Supp.1995). The magistrate judge determined that neither party was entitled to summary judgment because disputed issues of material fact remained as to all claims. Misiaszek and the City filed an interlocutory appeal of the denial of their motion for summary judgment based on qualified and official immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b212-17\">Before deciding whether the magistrate judge properly denied summary judgment on this issue, we examine the basis for our jurisdiction. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987) (\u201cThis Court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction, on its own motion, if necessary.\u201d). Generally, this Court does not have jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals of the denial of motions for summary judgment because such pretrial orders are not \u201cfinal decisions\u201d for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1988). <em>See Sorey v. Kellett, </em>849 F.2d 960, 961 (5th Cir.1988) (\u201cUnder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, the courts of appeals have jurisdiction over \u2018final decisions\u2019 of the district courts. Ordinarily, this section precludes review of a district court\u2019s pretrial orders until appeal from the final judgment.\u201d). However, in <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>472 U.S. 511, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985), the Supreme Court held that \u201ca district court\u2019s denial of a claim of qualified immunity, to the extent that it turns on an issue of law, is an appealable \u2018final decision\u2019 within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530, 105 S.Ct. at 2817; <em>see also Hale v. Townley, </em>45 F.3d 914, 918 (5th Cir.1995) (\u201cAn appellate court has jurisdiction to review an interlocutory denial of qualified immunity only to the extent that it \u2018turns on an issue of law.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Mitchell, </em>472 U.S. at 530, 105 S.Ct. at 2817)). In <em>Johnson v. Jones, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995), the Supreme Court clarified the \u201cto the extent that it turns on an issue of law\u201d language in <em>Mitchell. </em>The Court in <em>Johnson </em>held that \u201ca defendant, entitled to invoke a qualified immunity defense, may not appeal a district court\u2019s summary judgment order insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a \u2018genuine\u2019 issue of fact for trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 115 S.Ct. at 2159; <em>accord Hale, </em>45 F.3d at 918; <em>Boulos v. Wilson, </em>834 F.2d 504, 509 (5th Cir.1987). The magistrate judge in the present case found \u201cthat genuine issues of material fact exist[ed] which preclude^ summary judgment in whole or in part for any party.\u201d Consequently, under <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Hale, </em>we lack jurisdiction over Misiaszek\u2019s interlocutory appeal of the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of his motion for summary judgment on the Tamezes\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claim based on qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">We similarly lack jurisdiction over Misiaszek and the City\u2019s appeal of the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of them motion for summary judgment on the Tamezes\u2019 state-law claims based on official immunity under the Texas Tort Claims Act. \u201cAppealability under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 ... is clearly a matter of federal law; state procedural law is not directly controlling.\u201d <em>Sorey, </em>849 F.2d at 962; <em>accord Budinich v. Becton Dickinson &amp; Co., </em>486 U.S. 196, 108 S.Ct. 1717, 100 L.Ed.2d 178 (1988). We look to state procedural rules \u201cfor what they reveal about the state\u2019s view on the substantive issue of whether qualified immunity is an immunity from suit or merely a defense to liability,\u201d <em>Sorey, </em>849 F.2d at 962, because the denial of summary judgment based on a mere defense to liability is not a final decision for the purposes of \u00a7 1291, <em>cf. Mitchell, </em>472 U.S. at 530, 105 S.Ct. at 2817 (holding that district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment based on <em>qualified immunity </em>is sometimes appealable \u2018final decision\u2019 within meaning of \u00a7 1291, which otherwise precludes review of pretrial orders). The distinction is immaterial to the present claim, however, because the magistrate judge held that genuine issues of material fact precluded his granting Misiaszek and the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the Tamezes\u2019 state-law claims. If official immunity under the Texas Tort Claims Act is immunity from suit, Misiaszek and the City\u2019s interlocutory appeal of the denial of that motion is barred by <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Hale </em>for the same reason that their appeal of the denial of their motion for summary judgment on the Tamezes\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claim is barred by <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Hale. See Johnson, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 115 S.Ct. at 2159 (holding that defendant may not appeal district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity if district court determines that the pretrial record sets forth a genuine issue of fact for trial). If, on the other hand, official immunity under the Texas Tort Claims Act is no more than immunity from liability, then the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of the motion is not a final decision for the purposes of \u00a7 1291. In either case, we lack jurisdiction over Misiaszek and the City\u2019s appeal of the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of the motion for summary judgment on the Tamezes\u2019 state-law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b213-14\">For the foregoing reasons, we DISMISS Misiaszek and the City\u2019s appeal of the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of their motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
