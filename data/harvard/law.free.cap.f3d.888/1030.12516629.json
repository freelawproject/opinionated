In the hours leading up to the incident, Reese had consumed large quantities of alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine at a neighborhood party. The party ended when Reese and his neighbor Nathan began arguing over whether Reese had taken Nathan's bottle of vodka. Sometime after the party, Nathan's girlfriend went to Reese's apartment to retrieve the vodka. Reese answered the door holding a knife and refused to hand over the bottle. Around 4:30 a.m., Reese and Nathan exchanged several text messages, some containing racial epithets. Shortly thereafter, Reese heard knocking on his apartment door. He assumed it was Nathan. It was not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Deputies Brown and Rose and several other police officers arrived at Reese's apartment complex shortly before 5:00 a.m. They were responding to an anonymous 911 call that an African-American male had exited apartment 144 and fired an automatic gun. The caller also stated that the male was possibly crazy, under the influence of drugs, had a knife, and was back inside apartment 144.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Deputy Rose decided that someone should knock on the door of apartment 144 to further investigate the 911 report. The deputies decided that Deputy Brown, who had a rifle, would stand back about 15 feet to cover the doorway while Deputy Rose would knock on the apartment door. Deputy Rose, concealing himself, stood to the side of the door and other deputies lined up behind him. Deputy Rose, while holding his handgun in one hand, knocked on the door with his flashlight. Deputy Brown testified that after Deputy Rose knocked, \"the door flew open. I saw a figure coming out, arm up, extended, large knife[.]\" Upon seeing the knife, which he describes as being within a foot of Deputy Rose's neck, Deputy Brown fired his rifle at Reese. Deputy Rose, seeing Reese with the knife in his hand, simultaneously backed away from the door of the apartment. The next events occurred in what Deputy Rose describes as a \"millisecond.\" After the rifle shot, Deputy Rose advanced into the apartment expecting to see Reese shot and incapacitated. Instead he saw Reese standing upright in the apartment. He could not, however, see Reese's hands. Deputy Rose immediately fired his handgun, aiming it at Reese's chest. He was approximately three feet away from Reese. Reese fell backward toward a couch and Deputy Rose saw blood on Reese's clothing and the carpet. At trial, Deputy Rose testified that he was uncertain whether it was his or Deputy Brown's shot that actually hit Reese but believed that it was his. Reese survived the incident and thereafter asserted\n   civil rights claims against the County and Deputies Brown and Rose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After a seven-day jury trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Reese on his Fourth Amendment excessive force and Bane Act claims against Deputy Rose and the County. The jury also returned a verdict in favor of Deputy Brown, which Reese does not appeal. In separate interrogatories, the jury determined that Deputy Rose's pistol round, not Deputy Brown's rifle round, hit Reese. The jury also found that Reese had a knife in his hand in an elevated position when he opened the door. They answered \"no\" to the question of whether Reese brandished the knife at Deputy Rose. Question 14 asked the jury \"[a]t the time Deputy Rose fired his shot, did it appear that Plaintiff posed an immediate threat of death or serious physical injury to Deputy Rose?\" The jury answered \"no.\" The jury awarded Reese $534,340.00 in compensatory damages including $150,000.00 for non-economic loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the jury returned its verdict, the Defendants moved for a judgment as a matter of law asserting that Deputy Rose was entitled to qualified immunity, or alternatively that Reese failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence all of the elements required for a Fourth Amendment battery and Bane Act violation. The Defendants asserted that the evidence at trial insufficiently established that it was Deputy Rose's shot that hit Reese, and thus Reese had not met his burden of showing Rose had caused Reese's harm. Finally, the Defendants asserted that Reese's claims were barred by\n   <em>\n    Heck v. Humphrey\n   </em>\n   because he pleaded no contest to a violation of California Penal Code section 417(a)(1). Defendants also moved for a new trial, arguing that the district court erred in its instruction to the jury on Reese's Bane Act claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court determined that Deputy Rose was entitled to qualified immunity on Reese's Fourth Amendment claim. The district court then granted \"summary judgment\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   ,\" finding that Defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Reese's Bane Act claim, concluding that Defendants' proposed jury instruction on that claim should have been given. The district court denied Defendants' other requests for post-trial relief, including their\n   <em>\n    Heck v. Humphrey\n   </em>\n   claim. Reese appealed the district court's post-trial rulings in favor of Defendants. Defendants filed a cross-appeal reasserting their\n   <em>\n    Heck v. Humphrey\n   </em>\n   claim and asserting that the district court erred in several of its evidentiary rulings and its award of future non-economic loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Defendants' Post-Verdict Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court of Appeals \"review[s] de novo the grant or denial of a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Pavao v.

Thus, although the jury's finding that Reese posed no immediate threat of death or serious physical injury to Rose addresses the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis, it does not answer the purely legal question of whether the right was clearly established in this context.

Upon seeing Reese in the doorway with the knife, which was very close to where Rose was standing, Brown immediately fired a shot from his rifle at Reese, but missed. After Brown fired the shot, he saw Reese back into the apartment and drop the knife.

Rose stated that he could not see Reese's hands but upon seeing him, shot Reese in the chest from three to five feet away.

In re-urging their position, Defendants argued that Reese's proposed instruction eviscerates the requirement in CACI 3066 that additional elements are necessary to prove a Bane Act claim because his instruction is \"essentially amounting to a passthrough where there's a Fourth Amendment violation saying that if there's a Fourth Amendment violation, there's also a Bane Act violation.\" The district court summarily explained that Defendants' argument had previously been rejected on summary judgment and \"I'm going to reject it too.\" Therefore, the district court instructed the jury as follows: \"If you determine that Plaintiff prevails on his Fourth Amendment excessive force claim against Defendant Brown and/or Defendant Rose, then Plaintiff also prevails on his Bane Act claim against that Defendant or Defendants.\" The jury found for Reese and against Deputy Rose and the County on the Bane Act claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In their request for a new trial, Defendants claimed that the trial court erred when it declined to give their CACI 3066 instruction.

Thus, Defendants asserted that\n   <em>\n    Chaudhry\n   </em>\n   \"does not equate to a correct application of \u00a7 52.1\" and a new trial with a CACI 3066 instruction was required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Convinced by the Defendants' arguments, the district court changed its mind.

We note that at the time that the district court issued its\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   summary judgment order, it observed that \"no California Appellate Court decision addressed whether excessive force\n   <strong>\n    alone\n   </strong>\n   -'the use of excessive force during an otherwise lawful arrest,'-is sufficient to sustain a Bane Act violation[.]\" (Doc. 216 at 27). Thus, the district court relied on what it determined were persuasive decisions, including\n   <em>\n    Shoyoye\n   </em>\n   , that explain that more is required. The district court's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Shoyoye\n   </em>\n   is misplaced, however. First,\n   <em>\n    Shoyoye\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from Reese's excessive force claim because it involved a claim of wrongful detention.\n   <em>\n    Chaudhry\n   </em>\n   , upon which the prior court relied when it initially denied Defendants' summary judgment motion, is an excessive force case. Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Chaudhry\n   </em>\n   was decided two years after\n   <em>\n    Shoyoye\n   </em>\n   and since the\n   <em>\n    Chaudhry\n   </em>\n   decision, district courts have largely interpreted it to mean that section 52.1 does not require a showing of \"threats, intimidation and coercion\" separate from an underlying constitutional violation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v.

Until recently, California's appellate court guidance had not squarely addressed whether in an excessive force case the Bane Act requires a separate showing of coercion beyond that inherent in the use of force.

City and County of San Francisco\n   </em>\n   , the California Court of Appeal recognized that Bane Act claims are routinely alleged in Section 1983 claims under federal pendent jurisdiction and that \"[t]he Bane Act's requirement that interference with rights must be accomplished by threats[,] intimidation or coercion 'has been the source of much debate and confusion.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513964\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/225/356/\">\n    17 Cal.App.5th 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513964\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/225/356/\">\n    225 Cal.Rptr.3d 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 384 (2017) (citations omitted). Thus, the court announced its endeavor to provide clarity. In so doing, the court examined\n   <em>\n    Shoyoye\n   </em>\n   's conclusion that the section 52.1 claim required a showing of coercion independent of the coercion inherent in the wrongful detention at issue in that case. Concluding that\n   <em>\n    Shoyoye\n   </em>\n   was limited to cases involving mere negligence, the court in\n   <em>\n    Cornell\n   </em>\n   ruled that \"[n]othing in the text of the statute requires that the offending 'threat, intimidation or coercion' be 'independent' from the constitutional violation alleged.\"\n   <em>\n    Cornell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513964\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/225/356/\">\n    225 Cal.Rptr.3d at 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, the Bane Act does not require the \"threat, intimidation or coercion\" element of the claim to be transactionally independent from the constitutional violation alleged.\n   <em>\n    Cornell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513964\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/225/356/\">\n    225 Cal.Rptr.3d at 382-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As to the requirement of coercion independent from the constitutional violation,\n   <em>\n    Cornell\n   </em>\n   correctly notes that the plain language of Section 52.1 gives no indication that the \"threat, intimidation, or coercion\" must be independent from the constitutional violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cornell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513964\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/225/356/\">\n    225 Cal.Rptr.3d at 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, in the two California Supreme Court cases to apply Section 52.1 in the Fourth Amendment context, neither gave any indication of an independent coercion\n   requirement. In\n   <em>\n    Venegas v. County of Los Angeles\n   </em>\n   , the California Supreme Court, in holding that a Section 52.1 plaintiff need not be a member of a protected class, found that plaintiffs had \"adequately stated a cause of action under section 52.1\" where they alleged warrantless, unconsented searches and unlawful detention.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"801099\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/32/820/\">\n    32 Cal.4th 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20692\">\n    11 Cal.Rptr.3d 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=87%20P.3d%201\">\n    87 P.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 3-4, 14 (Cal. 2004). In\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

This is also reflected in California's model jury instruction, CACI 3066, which characterizes a Bane Act claim as one by the plaintiff that the defendant \"\n   <em>\n    intentionally interfered\n   </em>\n   with [or attempted to interfere with] [his/her] civil rights by threats, intimidation, or coercion.\" CACI 3066 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cornell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513964\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/225/356/\">\n    225 Cal.Rptr.3d at 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (approving use of CACI 3066 because it \"properly focused the jury on intentional violation of Cornell's right to be free from unreasonable seizure\"). As above, we observe that the Fourth Amendment claims asserted in\n   <em>\n    Venegas\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   are not inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Cornell\n   </em>\n   's approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Though we have previously stated that \"the elements of the excessive force claim under \u00a7 52.1 are the same as under \u00a7 1983,\"\n   <em>\n    Chaudhry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4069411,4069639\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/751/1096/\">\n    751 F.3d at 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Cameron\n   </em>\n   , 713 F.3d at 1022 ), we do not read those cases as contradicting the intent requirement articulated in\n   <em>\n    Cornell\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Cameron\n   </em>\n   , we noted that the plaintiff \"assert[ed] no California right different from the rights guaranteed under the Fourth Amendment,\" 713 F.3d at 1022, and so concluded that the elements of the excessive force claim were the same, citing our prior observation in\n   <em>\n    Reynolds v.

They contend there was no evidence at trial of future non-economic losses. They argue that \"[a]t most, the jury was shown a visible physical scar, but there was no testimony that future care was needed, no testimony that the scar caused any sort of anxiety, mental disturbance or other non-economic loss.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The district court cited two district court cases and a California Supreme Court case in determining that \"[a]wards for non-economic damages, which included pain and suffering, can be supported by a finding of permanent scarring.\" The district court then found that \"[i]n light of Reese's scarring, an inference can reasonably be drawn that he will continue to endure suffering\" and that Defendants failed to show this portion of the judgment should be amended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \"A jury's verdict, including a damages award, must be upheld if supported by 'substantial evidence.' \"\n   <em>\n    Freitag v.

Even if the only evidence in support of Reese's non-economic damages was his multiple scars and any inferences drawn therefrom, Defendants have not demonstrated it was error for the district court to conclude that was sufficient to uphold the amount awarded for non-economic damages. The district court's decision on this issue is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Any error in the jury instruction on Reese's Fourth Amendment claim that authorized liability if \"Defendant shot at and/or shot the plaintiff\" was harmless.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendants next contend the district court, over their objection, gave an erroneous jury instruction providing that a Fourth Amendment violation could be shown by proving that one of the Defendants \"shot at and/or shot the plaintiff,\" among other elements. Defendants argue \"[t]his constituted prejudicial error by skewing the burden of proof at trial.\" Defendants argue that merely shooting at someone is insufficient to constitute a seizure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court need not decide whether the instruction was erroneous because any error was rendered harmless by the jury's verdict. In their answers to the special interrogatories, the jury found that the round fired from Deputy Brown's rifle did not hit Reese but the round fired by Deputy Rose did. Correspondingly, the jury found a Fourth Amendment violation by Deputy Rose but not Deputy Brown. Thus, to the extent Deputy Brown could have been found liable under the Fourth Amendment for merely shooting at Reese rather than shooting and hitting him, the jury's findings prevented any harm from the potentially erroneous instruction. Thus, even if the district court erred in giving that instruction, the error was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it failed to exclude certain testimony by Reese's expert, and certain testimony by Defendants' expert elicited on cross-examination.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defendants next argue the district court abused its discretion by failing to exclude testimony by Reese's expert that a particular set of circumstances represented a \"don't shoot scenario.\" The district court overruled Defendants' objection at trial that the question presented an incomplete hypothetical and invaded the province of the jury. Citing no legal authority, Defendants argue the evidence should have been excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \"We review the district court's evidentiary decisions for abuse of discretion, and the appellant is ... required to establish that the error was prejudicial.\"\n   <em>\n    Ambat v.

As to the argument that the expert's answer invaded the province of the jury in that it addressed the ultimate issue, Defendants have not shown prejudicial error. As a general rule, \"[a]n opinion is not objectionable just because it embraces an ultimate issue.\" Fed. R. Evid. 704(a). The district court's ruling on this issue is therefore affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Defendants also challenge the district judge's failure to sustain objections to questions asked of Defendants' expert by Reese's counsel. The questions addressed scenarios pertaining to whether Deputy Rose saw Reese's hands when he shot him. Again, given the jury's finding on this issue, Defendants have failed to show prejudicial error, as the district court determined. The district court's ruling is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The district court did not err in excluding the deposition testimony of a defense witness who did not appear in court to testify.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Next, Defendants argue the district court erred in excluding from the trial deposition testimony of Brittany Shurtleff, a witness who Defendants claim was \"unavailable\" under the Federal Rules of Evidence. Defendants contend they successfully served a subpoena on the witness and made reasonable, good faith efforts to procure her presence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The district court determined that defense counsel, despite being aware the witness did not intend to appear in court, failed to make additional reasonable efforts in the time leading up to trial to ensure the witness's appearance in court. The district court therefore concluded there was no basis \"to justify finding her unavailable under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(a)(5).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Likewise, Defendants here simply assert that counsel made reasonable, good faith efforts to procure the witness's presence but they fail to explain what those efforts were. Absent any evidence of actual reasonable, good faith efforts to ensure the witness's appearance, Defendants have not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion. The district court's ruling is therefore affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED IN PART, and REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART. Each party shall pay its own costs on appeal.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    We also agree with the district court that the jury's negative answer to Question 14 (\"At the time Deputy Rose fired his shot, did it appear that Plaintiff posed an immediate threat of death or serious physical injury to Deputy Rose?\") was unhelpful to the judge's legal question of whether any \"reasonable\" officer would have understood that the use of deadly force was at that time proscribed by clearly established Fourth Amendment excessive force law. As the district court noted, the question does \"not specify from whose perspective it did appear that Reese posed an immediate threat of death or serious physical injury to Rose.\" (Doc. 216 at 11).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    <em>\n     Chaudhry\n    </em>\n    relied on\n    <em>\n     Cameron v.
