After addressing various preclusion questions, we uphold the Board's conclusion that it may apply the National Labor Relations Act (\"NLRA\") to that relationship, in accord with its usual process.

About 2,900 customers visit Casino Pauma each day. The Casino employs 462 employees, five of whom are members of the Pauma Band; the parties stipulated that \"[t]he vast majority of [Casino Pauma's] employees and managers are not members of any Native American Tribe.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2013, UNITE HERE (\"Union\") began an organizing drive at Casino Pauma. Over the course of a day in December 2013, nine Casino Pauma employees distributed\n   Union leaflets to customers at the casino's front entrance. Some of the employees stood on the sidewalk at the entrance to the casino's valet driveway, and some at the exit, all facing the casino's customer parking lot. Several times during the day security personnel for Casino Pauma told the employees that they could not distribute flyers near the valet driveway, directing them instead to distribute flyers at the back of the casino, near the employee-only entrance. When the leafleting employees asked what would happen if they stayed at the valet entrance, the security employees told them they would be reported to human resources and disciplined, and that they could potentially lose their jobs. Each group of employees stopped distributing leaflets after being told to do so. In the afternoon, a security guard took a picture of two leafleting employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The next month, in January 2014, another Casino Pauma employee handed out Union flyers to several employees waiting to clock out at the end of their shifts. The time clock was located in a hallway near the employee cafeteria. The leafleting employee was on her break. The three employees to whom she gave flyers had not yet clocked out for the end of their shift, but were standing in line to do so; all three clocked out within \"about 30 seconds\" of receiving the flyers. In March, Casino Pauma issued the leafleting employee a disciplinary warning for distributing the flyers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The General Counsel of the NLRB filed several complaints concerning the literature distribution incidents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaints were consolidated, and an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") presided over a three-day trial. The ALJ held that Casino Pauma violated the National Labor Relations Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20151\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , in most of the ways the General Counsel alleged-in particular, it committed unfair labor practices by trying to stop union literature distribution in guest areas at the casino's front entrance and in non-working areas near its employees' time clock. A three-member panel of the Board affirmed the ALJ's rulings and findings and adopted a slightly modified version of the ALJ's order.\n   <em>\n    Casino Pauma\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Casino Pauma II\n   </em>\n   ), 363 N.L.R.B. No. 60 (Dec. 3, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In so doing, the Board relied on a jurisdictional finding involving the same parties it had made earlier that year in\n   <em>\n    Casino Pauma\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Casino Pauma I\n   </em>\n   ), 362 N.L.R.B. No. 52 (Mar. 31, 2015), a Board decision from which neither party sought judicial review. In\n   <em>\n    Casino Pauma I\n   </em>\n   , which concerned other unfair labor practices that took place at the same casino in April 2013, the Board rejected Casino Pauma's argument that it was a government entity not subject to the NLRA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20151\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1 n.3; 3-4. Although Casino Pauma renewed this argument in\n   <em>\n    Casino Pauma II\n   </em>\n   , the case now before this panel, the Board held that \"the doctrine of issue preclusion ... forecloses the Respondent from arguing that the\n   Board lacks jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Casino Pauma II\n   </em>\n   , 363 N.L.R.B.

The Union notes that the issue was resolved by the NLRB in a previous decision,\n   <em>\n    Casino Pauma I\n   </em>\n   , and that the Casino did not seek judicial review of that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Union is correct that collateral estoppel, also known as issue preclusion, \"is not limited to those situations in which the same issue is before two\n   <em>\n    courts\n   </em>\n   . Rather, where a single issue is before a court and an administrative agency, preclusion also often applies.\"\n   <em>\n    B &amp; B Hardware v.

There may indeed be good reason not to apply preclusion principles to unenforced Board orders. Unlike other federal administrative determinations, the Board's orders do \"not have the force of law.\" 2 John E.

Orders not enforced by the Board thus do not share the same status as many other administrative matters \"already resolved as between ... [the] parties\" by the time they arrive at the courthouse; until enforced by the courts, the Board's orders may not be fully \"resolved\" for preclusion purposes.\n   <em>\n    Utah Constr. &amp; Mining Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045684\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/394/#p422\">\n    384 U.S. at 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045684\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/394/#p422\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted). A litigant may, for example, legitimately wish to settle a case even if there is no enforceable order, to save either time or money. Applying preclusion to an unenforced order would discount the opportunity presented in the NLRA's enforcement scheme by encouraging litigants to seek review where even minor unfair labor practices, with minimal relief, are at stake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   But we need not resolve the preclusive effect in court of unenforced NLRB determinations. Even if issue preclusion principles fully applied to the NLRB's unenforced decision in\n   <em>\n    Casino Pauma I\n   </em>\n   , Casino Pauma would not be precluded from making its arguments before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Issue preclusion is a waivable defense.\n   <em>\n    Peterson v.

The Board has affirmatively waived any preclusion defense before this court, deciding instead to litigate the question of its ability to regulate tribes under the NLRA on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   When a party \"entitled to raise a preclusion defense fails to do so, it may be concluded that a third party cannot undo the waiver.\" 18 Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice and Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4405 (3d ed. 2017). So here. We are disinclined to allow the Union to supply a preclusion defense on behalf of the Board through the Union's status as an intervenor. The Union was not a party to the administrative proceedings now on review; the Board, which\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   , may legitimately wish for a resolution in the courts of the jurisdictional issue advanced in the administrative proceedings, so as to have it settled for other cases and circumstances that it, but not the Union, will face in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Board has intentionally relinquished any preclusion defense, even though the primary burden of litigating the issue before us falls on it.

We have no reason to require the Board to abandon this long-established, reasonable premise, long ago approved by the Supreme Court. Again, the\n   <em>\n    Republic Aviation\n   </em>\n   rule is grounded in the recognition that employers have little interest in requiring employees legitimately on the premises and not working to advance their organizational interests somewhere else.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As to Casino Pauma's valet driveway, each of the Board's holdings involved a reasonable application of its literature distribution jurisprudence to facts supported by substantial evidence here: Casino Pauma's literature distribution rule in its handbook was applied to prevent literature distribution in the non-working area of the casino's valet entrance, and thus violated section 8(a)(1);\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Casino Pauma's prevention of nonworking employees from handing out union literature at the entrance violated section 8(a)(1); and its employees' photographing of others handing out union literature constituted inappropriate surveillance and violated section 8(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Board's holding that Casino Pauma violated sections 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) by disciplining an employee because she distributed union literature near the casino's time clock was also reasonable. The employee was on a break, and did not interfere with other employees' working time or working space. The \"employees who received the flyers clocked out within 30 seconds or so,\" and were located \"immediately outside the employee break room/cafeteria, in an area removed from the gaming areas or other places that customers or clients have access to.\" Under\n   these circumstances, the Board reasonably found that Casino Pauma violated the employee's right to distribute union literature in non-working spaces at a non-working time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In short, the Board's conclusion that Casino Pauma violated its employees' NLRA right to distribute union literature was adequately supported, both by the applicable legal principles and the record.
