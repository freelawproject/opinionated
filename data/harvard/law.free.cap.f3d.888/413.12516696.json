We review the merits of the district court's summary judgment decision in an accompanying memorandum disposition. Here, we address only Chavez's contention that subject matter jurisdiction is lacking because \u00a7 1332's amount-in-controversy requirement was not met when the case was removed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Specifically, we write to clarify what it means to say that the amount in controversy is determined as of \"the time of removal.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kroske v. U.S. Bank Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"556364\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/432/976/#p980\">\n    432 F.3d 976\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 980 (9th Cir. 2005). We conclude that the amount in controversy is not limited to damages incurred prior to removal-for example, it is not limited to wages a plaintiff-employee would have earned before removal (as opposed to after removal). Rather, the amount in controversy\n   is determined by the complaint operative at the time of removal and encompasses all relief a court may grant on that complaint if the plaintiff is victorious. Applying that standard, the amount-in-controversy requirement is easily satisfied here, and we have subject matter jurisdiction over this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Elsa Chavez worked as a mortgage banker for JPMC. JPMC terminated her employment on February 6, 2014. She sued JPMC in California Superior Court, alleging (1) harassment, discrimination, and retaliation on the basis of disability under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (\"FEHA\"); (2) harassment, discrimination, and retaliation on the basis of age under FEHA; (3) harassment, discrimination, and retaliation for taking protected leave under the California Family Rights Act (\"CFRA\"); (4) failure to produce employment records under California Labor Code \u00a7 226 ; and (5) wrongful termination under California common law. Her complaint sought \"loss of earnings\" and \"loss of earning capacity,\" as well as \"medical expenses,\" \"reasonable attorneys' fees and costs,\" \"prejudgment interest,\" \"punitive and exemplary damages,\" \"a $750.00 penalty, pursuant to California Labor Code \u00a7 226(f),\" and injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 30, 2015, JPMC removed to the United States District Court for the Central District of California on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. Chavez did not contest removal, and indeed, the parties filed a Stipulated Discovery Plan and Scheduling Order stating: \"The parties agree that this Court has jurisdiction over this matter on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.\" The district court granted summary judgment for JPMC on all claims, and Chavez appealed. She now argues for the first time that removal was improper and that we lack subject matter jurisdiction over this action because the amount in controversy does not exceed $75,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.

Such a concession is tantamount to a plaintiff expressly alleging damages in excess of the jurisdictional amount, which we accept as the amount in controversy if done in good faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dart Cherokee Basin Operating Co., LLC v.

As noted above, Chavez's prayer for relief included \"loss of earnings\" and \"loss of earning capacity.\" Because Chavez did not contest the amount in controversy below, the record with respect to these claims is somewhat slim. Chavez did admit in her deposition, however, that her salary as a mortgage banker was greater than $39,000 a year and that she had intended to continue working for another nine years. Chavez does not contest these facts and agrees that, if victorious, California law could entitle her to over $350,000 in lost wages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wysinger v. Auto. Club of S. Cal.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4101619\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/157/413/\">\n    157 Cal.App.4th 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=69%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%201\">\n    69 Cal.Rptr.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 12 (2007) (\"Under FEHA, an employee ... may be compensated for a future loss of earnings.\"). Thus, Chavez's prayer for past and future lost wages by itself exceeds $75,000, even before factoring in non-economic and punitive damages, attorneys' fees, or other requested relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Chavez nevertheless argues that, in calculating the amount in controversy, we may only consider lost wages for the period between her termination in February 2014 and JPMC's removal of this action a little over a year later in March 2015. Looking only at this period, Chavez's lost wages would be less than $75,000 and would not satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement. Chavez bases this argument on our oft-repeated statement that the amount in controversy is assessed as of \"the time of removal.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kroske\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"556364\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/432/976/#p980\">\n    432 F.3d at 980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . She contends that this means the amount in controversy does not include any damages incurred after the time of removal, such as her lost earnings from after March 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In considering this argument, we begin with first principles. The amount in controversy is \"not a prospective assessment of [a] defendant's liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Lewis v. Verizon Commc'ns, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053023\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/395/#p400\">\n    627 F.3d 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 400 (9th Cir. 2010). Rather, it is the \"amount at stake in the underlying litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174578\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/644/#p648\">\n    840 F.3d at 648-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If a plaintiff claims at the time of removal that her termination caused her to lose future wages, and if the law entitles her to recoup those future wages if she prevails, then there is no question that future wages are \"at stake\" in the litigation, whatever the likelihood that she will actually recover them. In such a situation, although the plaintiff's employer would have paid the wages in the future had she remained employed, they are\n   <em>\n    presently\n   </em>\n   in controversy. Indeed, courts generally assume as much without discussion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Andrews v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5384473\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/447/510/#p515\">\n    447 F.3d 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 515 (7th Cir. 2006) (taking into account plaintiff's \"lost wages (past and future)\");\n   <em>\n    Nelson v. Keefer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"787700\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/451/289/\">\n    451 F.2d 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 294 n.10 (3d Cir. 1971) (the amount in controversy includes \"wages and earnings, past and future\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   When we say that the amount in controversy is assessed at the time of removal, we mean that we consider damages that are claimed at the time the case is removed by the defendant. So, for example, if a plaintiff files a complaint in state court and voluntarily dismisses a claim before removal, any relief that might have been awarded on the dismissed claim will not be included in the amount in controversy. Likewise, when the amount in controversy is satisfied at removal, any subsequent amendment to the complaint or partial dismissal that decreases the amount in controversy below the jurisdictional threshold does not oust the federal court of jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    St. Paul Mercury Indem. Co. v. Red Cab Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6139940\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/303/283/#p292\">\n    303 U.S. 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 292-93,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6139940\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/303/283/#p292\">\n    58 S.Ct. 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6139940\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/303/283/#p292\">\n    82 L.Ed. 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1938). That the amount in controversy is assessed at the time of removal does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   mean that the mere futurity of certain classes of damages precludes them from being part of the amount in controversy.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Steel v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1689860\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/813/1545/#p1547\">\n    813 F.2d 1545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1547 (9th Cir. 1987) (noting that \"past and future pension payments\" exceeded the amount-in-controversy requirement);\n   <em>\n    Broglie v. MacKay-Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1034850\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/541/453/#p455\">\n    541 F.2d 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 455 (4th Cir. 1976) (\"[A] plaintiff may properly include as part of the amount in controversy costs which\n   will not be incurred until after the suit is ended.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In sum, the amount in controversy includes all relief claimed at the time of removal to which the plaintiff would be entitled if she prevails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The amount in controversy is what is at stake in the litigation at the time of removal. Where, as here, a plaintiff's complaint at the time of removal claims wrongful termination resulting in lost future wages, those future wages are included in the amount in controversy. That being the case, the amount in controversy here easily exceeds $75,000. We therefore have subject matter jurisdiction over this action.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Chavez is a California citizen.
