(the debtor) and a group of related entities purchased the assets of several United States and Canadian railways. On January 8, 2003, a consortium of investors (the 2003 Investors) provided $15,000,000 to the purchasers in return for a series of subordinated notes and warrants. Despite this infusion of cash, the debtor soon found itself strapped and procured a $34,000,000 loan from the Federal Railroad Administration (the FRA). As part of this transaction, the FRA obtained a senior lien on all of the debtor's rail lines and related improvements in the United States. Several years later, the appellee, Wheeling &amp; Lake Erie Railway Company (Wheeling), furnished a $6,000,000 line of credit to the debtor-a transaction memorialized by a promissory note dated June 15, 2009 and a security agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Notwithstanding these efforts, the debtor struggled to meet its financial obligations. By late 2010, it owed $906,579.38 in overdue principal and $1,466,355.58 in accrued interest to the FRA. To obtain needed funds, the debtor proposed to sell approximately 233 miles of track located in northern Maine (the Lines) to the State of Maine. In order to make this transaction feasible, the debtor enlisted FRA's cooperation and, on December 29, 2010, it agreed with the FRA to amend the existing loan agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This amendment, which we shall call the Second Amendment, lies at the epicenter of this litigation. Under Section 3.b, the FRA agreed to provide \"a limited waiver\" of its senior lien over the Lines, which would take effect \"upon the closing\" of the proposed sale to the State of Maine. In exchange, the FRA received a replacement lien on certain of the debtor's property in Canada.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As relevant here, the FRA conditioned its \"limited waiver\" of its senior lien on the debtor's compliance with a series of conditions spelled out in Section 3.b.ii of the Second Amendment. The FRA concluded that these conditions and the concomitant\n   amendments to the parties' prior agreement were \"equitable and in the overall best interest of the United States\" in accordance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20823\">\n    45 U.S.C. \u00a7 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Pertinently, the Second Amendment required the debtor, upon the closing of the sale, to convey the proceeds to an escrow agent. Once the FRA's replacement lien on the Canadian property had been perfected, the debtor was to pay the FRA roughly $2,400,000 of the sale proceeds (representing the sum of the FRA's overdue principal and accrued interest), pay roughly $14,000,000 to the 2003 Investors, reserve roughly $1,000,000 to defray certain accounts payable, and distribute the remainder of the proceeds to Wheeling to reduce the debtor's outstanding balance under the 2009 credit agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The record contains few details as to how the parties shaped the contours of this waterfall of disbursements. In this regard, though, the complaint does allege that the 2003 Investors \"demanded full payment as a condition to allowing the transaction to occur.\" The complaint also alleges an overlap between the leadership of Wheeling and the leadership of the debtor. It offers several examples of this perceived overlap, such as the fact that Larry R. Parsons was the principal owner of Wheeling and served as a board member of the debtor and the fact that ABC Railway (a wholly owned subsidiary of Wheeling) was a shareholder of the debtor's parent company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 4, 2011, the State of Maine agreed to pay approximately $21,000,000 for the Lines (of which approximately $1,000,000 was to be retained by Maine and applied to other debt owed to Maine). The debtor distributed the proceeds in accordance with the waterfall provision of the Second Amendment, with the result that Wheeling received $2,708,912.20 (which was applied to pay down the debtor's outstanding line of credit). Despite this effort to stanch the flow of red ink, the debtor's financial woes persisted and, in mid-2013, it filed a voluntary petition for protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20301\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The bankruptcy court appointed the appellant, Robert J. Keach, as the Chapter 11 trustee (the Trustee).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On May 26, 2015, the Trustee instituted an adversary proceeding against Wheeling, seeking to avoid the waterfall disbursement made to it as constructively fraudulent under section 5(b) of Maine's Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (UFTA), which proscribes certain conveyances by an insolvent debtor to an \"insider.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20301\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 544(b); 14 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 3576(2). Wheeling moved to dismiss the Trustee's complaint pursuant to Rule 7012 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. It argued that the waterfall disbursements did not consist of \"assets\" belonging to the debtor and, in the alternative, that the Trustee had failed plausibly to allege that Wheeling was an \"insider\" vis-\u00e0-vis the debtor. Accepting Wheeling's first argument, the bankruptcy court dismissed the complaint with prejudice for failure to state an actionable claim. It reasoned that because the waterfall disbursements were part of a single transaction, all aspects of which should be deemed to have occurred simultaneously, they remained encumbered by the FRA's lien up to and until the time of disbursement (and, therefore, did not comprise property belonging to the debtor). The bankruptcy court did not reach Wheeling's alternative ground for dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Trustee appealed to the federal district court, which affirmed on substantially similar reasoning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Keach\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wheeling &amp; Lake Erie Ry.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Montreal, Me. &amp; Atl.

The Trustee says that this case is of the same genre because the Lines were sold to a third party and some (but not all) of the debtor's creditors received portions of the sale proceeds to satisfy existing debts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We find this proffered analogy unpersuasive. The preferential transfer cases hawked by the Trustee rest on the notion that \"[if] the funds the third party used to pay the creditor were consideration for the debtor's sale of its assets,\" then those funds are considered \"property\" of the estate because they \"would have been available for distribution\" to the general pool of creditors \"had they not been transferred.\"\n   <em>\n    Warsco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11082114,9499546\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/258/557/\">\n    258 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   565 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Begier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121653\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/53/#p58\">\n    496 U.S. at 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121653,6118743\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/110/2258/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining bankruptcy code's \"central policy\" of ensuring \"[e]quality of distribution among creditors\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The case at hand is a horse of a quite different hue: unlike in these preferential transfer cases, the Lines were not \"assets\" that belonged outright to the debtor prior to consummation of the relevant transactions but, rather, were subject to the FRA's mortgage and lien.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   14 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 3572(2). As the Trustee readily acknowledges, \"the FRA would have been entitled to the proceeds\" from a sale of the Lines \"but for\" the Second Amendment. And although the FRA granted a limited waiver of its lien, it conditioned that waiver on the debtor's distribution of the proceeds in compliance with the Second Amendment's waterfall provision. The FRA made a choice to allocate the proceeds to which it was entitled among certain of the debtor's creditors, an allocation that it apparently concluded was \"equitable and in the overall best interest of the United States.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Seen in this light, it is readily apparent that this is not a case in which a debtor decides to sell his assets and divert the proceeds to pay certain creditors to the detriment of others. Instead, it is a case in which a senior lienholder imposes conditions that preclude the debtor from exercising effective control over the sale proceeds. Accordingly, the waterfall disbursement to Wheeling did not consist of property of the debtor's estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Computrex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9018316,8979311\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/403/807/\">\n    403 F.3d at 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Trustee nonetheless insists that other averments in the complaint render his allegations about the debtor's control over the waterfall disbursements plausible. As he sees it, the debtor \"could not have 'paid' [Wheeling] if it did not have control or dominion over the proceeds.\" The fly in this ointment is that the Trustee mistakenly equates the debtor's possession of the sale proceeds with its control over those proceeds. The mere fact that the debtor briefly possessed the sale proceeds (apparently as an escrow agent) does not mean that it had any discretion to use those proceeds as it saw fit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Were the Trustee's reasoning valid, any property possessed by a bailee, however fleetingly, would become property of that bailee's estate in a bankruptcy proceeding. This proposition is untenable. The law is luminously clear that, in the absence of a state statute to the contrary-and no such statute has been cited here-\"if property is in a debtor's hands as bailee or agent,\" that property is not recoverable by the bankruptcy trustee. 5\n   <em>\n    Collier on Bankruptcy\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 541.05 (A.N.

Consequently, we reject the Trustee's flawed attempt to equate \"possession\" with \"control.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Undaunted, the Trustee tries to attach decretory significance to the fact that the FRA received only $2,400,000 or so from the sale of the Lines (more than $30,000,000 less than the total of the loan balance, plus incurred interest and penalties), while the 2003 Investors received payment in full. The Trustee suggests that this fact shows that the debtor, not the FRA, had control over the sale proceeds. But this suggestion represents magical thinking : the debtor could never have sold the Lines, let alone decided how to distribute the sale proceeds, without the FRA's approval. That the FRA chose to structure the waterfall disbursements in a way that favored the 2003 Investors may well be an indication that the 2003 Investors had some leverage; it is not, however, an indication that the debtor had control over the sale proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We recognize that the FRA's decision to divert the proceeds of the sale to less senior creditors may seem unusual, but the FRA is not a typical transacting party. Rather, the FRA is an executive agency of the United States, which employs its lending program to maintain and improve the nation's railroads.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20822\">\n    45 U.S.C. \u00a7 822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, it agreed to a loan modification that it deemed to be in the national interest; and in structuring that modification, it presumably\n   determined that the national interest would be best served by distributing the sale proceeds in accordance with the waterfall provision. We have no reason to believe that it would have surrendered its security interest in the Lines otherwise. To permit the Trustee retroactively to unwind this transaction would simply second-guess the FRA and disturb the balance that it sought to strike without any principled basis for doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In a last ditch attempt to salvage his complaint, the Trustee points to other allegations in the complaint that, in his view, make his claim plausible. He emphasizes, for instance, the complaint's allegations that the waterfall disbursements \"consisted entirely of unencumbered assets\" belonging to the debtor at the time of payment. The problem, though, is that the Trustee gives too much weight to conclusory statements and rhetorical flourishes. Plausibility demands that a pleader offer more substantial stuff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
