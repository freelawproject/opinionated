The government responds, asserting that a conviction under the statute categorically qualifies as a violent felony or, alternatively, that the statute is divisible and application of the modified categorical approach shows that Kinney was convicted of a crime matching the generic definition of burglary under federal law. \"We review de novo a district court's finding that a defendant's prior conviction constitutes a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

North Dakota Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We therefore turn to North Dakota law to discern whether the statute of conviction is (1) overinclusive and (2) divisible or indivisible. At the time of Kinney's conviction in 1999, the burglary statute at issue read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   A person is guilty of burglary if he willfully enters or surreptitiously remains in a building or occupied structure, or a separately secured or occupied portion thereof, when at the time the premises are not open to the public and the actor is not licensed, invited, or otherwise privileged to enter or remain as the case may be, with intent to commit a crime therein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.D.%20Cent.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012.1-22-02\">\n    N.D.

Where any person lives or carries on business or other calling; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   b. Which is used for overnight accommodation of persons.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   c.

By including both structures and vehicles within its reach, the statute criminalizes more conduct than the generic version of the offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shepard v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879404\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/13/#p15\">\n    544 U.S. 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 15-16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879404\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/13/#p15\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879404\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/13/#p15\">\n    161 L.Ed.2d 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) (\"The A[CCA] makes burglary a violent felony only if committed in a building or enclosed space ('generic burglary'), not in a boat or motor vehicle.\"). The government argues against this conclusion by asserting that North Dakota's decision to limit the statute only to vehicles used for living or business purposes brings the statute in line with the generic offense. We disagree. In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Specifically, we must address whether the phrase \"building or occupied structure\" denotes two factual means of committing the single offense of burglary or whether the alternative locations are elements under North Dakota law. Kinney argues that the structure of the statute, North Dakota jury instructions, and available charging documents all show that the alternative terms are means.
