The state conviction arose from the same conduct as the federal offense. In the plea for the federal offense, the parties agreed to recommend the statutory maximum of 60 months. They also recognized that the district court would decide whether to credit Benson for time served for his related state sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In his sentencing memorandum, Benson requested that his federal sentence run concurrently with the remainder of his undischarged state sentence. At sentencing, he did not renew this request. However, he\n   did request credit for time served for his state sentence. The district court gave him partial credit for time served (6 months). It sentenced him to 54 months to run consecutively to the undischarged portion of his state sentence (19 months). Benson did not object. He now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Benson believes his federal sentence should run concurrently to his undischarged state sentence.

This belief has no merit. The district court said: \"This sentence of 54 months, which will be consecutive to the state sentence, I do find to comply with statutory objectives. I think it's sufficient but not more than necessary to accomplish the objectives of justice.\" It thus considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and explained that a consecutive sentence was necessary \"to accomplish the objectives of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     McDonald\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3737543\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/521/975/#p980\">\n    521 F.3d at 980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding the district court was \"well within its broad discretion\" in ordering consecutive sentences where the district court said the sentence was appropriate \"under the advisory [G]uidelines\" and it \"considered all the other statutory factors\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Benson argues the consecutive sentence violates U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(2) which says that when \"a term of imprisonment resulted from another offense that is relevant conduct to the instant offense of conviction ... the sentence for the instant offense shall ... run concurrently to the remainder of the undischarged term of imprisonment.\"\n   <strong>\n    U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(2)\n   </strong>\n   .
