Wisconsin law, though, gives students at state universities rights to organize themselves and to run their governments, which have the power to spend substantial funds.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2036.09\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 36.09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5). The combination of those state-law rights and fiscal powers can produce federal claims, even if the stakes are more modest than in most other disputes over state and local governance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case arises from a long-running feud between rival student governments at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, commonly known as UWM. Plaintiffs are the UWM Student Association and several former and current UWM students. Plaintiffs allege a wide-ranging conspiracy to interfere with student governance. They allege that the UWM administration excluded certain students from student government by unseating the legitimately elected officers and replacing them over several years with a supposedly \"puppet\" student government with a similar name, the defendant Student Association at UWM. After considerable procedural fencing-resulting from plaintiffs' clumsy efforts to pursue an unmanageable complaint with 44 plaintiffs suing 37 defendants for claims spanning several years of student politicking-the district court dismissed the suit with prejudice. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand with instructions to reinstate certain claims, though it is clear that those claims are likely to encounter other substantial obstacles on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The unwieldy, seven-count complaint is now in its fourth iteration. Plaintiffs are 44 former and current UWM students, although the complaint is vague about which students currently attend UWM and the capacity in which they attend. Among the 37 defendants are UWM's former chancellor and the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents, as well as numerous university administration officials and other students. Plaintiffs filed their lawsuit in Wisconsin state court, but defendants removed the case to federal court. After removal, the district court allowed the plaintiffs to amend their complaint twice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the operative version of the complaint, the first five counts are claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   alleging denials of due process and First Amendment retaliation and, in one count, a violation of one plaintiff's freedom of religion. The sixth count is a state-law claim alleging a violation of plaintiffs' right to organize under the Wisconsin statute on student governance\n   at state universities,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2036.09\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 36.09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5). The seventh count alleges violations of Wisconsin's Public Records Law,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2019.31\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 19.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 19.39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The district court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the case with prejudice.\n   <em>\n    UWM Student Ass'n v. Lovell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266681\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/266/1121/#p1139\">\n    266 F.Supp.3d 1121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1139 (E.D. Wis. 2017). The court first dismissed claims against individual defendants whom plaintiffs renamed after the district court had already dismissed claims against them for lack of timely service. Next, the court dismissed the state-law right-to-organize claim based on state sovereign immunity. The court then dismissed all remaining claims for misjoinder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   To summarize our decision, we affirm the dismissal of the claims against the defendants who were not timely served with process. We also affirm the dismissal of the right-to-organize claim under state law. Any claims for damages on that theory have dropped out of the case, and any claims for injunctive or declaratory relief on that theory are moot. We must reverse, however, the dismissal with prejudice of the remaining claims for misjoinder. While we understand the district court's frustration, the remedy for misjoinder is severance or dismissal without prejudice, not dismissal with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Before digging into those issues, we address one preliminary matter. The case was first assigned to Judge Clevert, who retired while it was pending. The case was then assigned to Judge Stadtmueller, who made the final decision dismissing the case. Plaintiffs argue that Judge Stadtmueller erred by not certifying his familiarity with the record pursuant to Rule 63 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure after the case was assigned to him. Defendants point out correctly that by its terms, Rule 63 applies only when \"a judge conducting a hearing or trial is unable to proceed.\" The rule applies when, for example, a judge has retired or died after hearing evidence but before issuing a decision. See\n   <em>\n    Marantz v. Permanente Medical Grp., Inc. Long Term Disability Plan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864126\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/687/320/#p326\">\n    687 F.3d 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 326-27 (7th Cir. 2012). Rule 63 does not apply here. There was no evidentiary hearing on defendants' motion to dismiss this version of the complaint, and there was no trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Dismissal of Previously Dismissed Defendants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This case illustrates some of the issues that can arise when plaintiffs fail to serve defendants in cases removed from a state court to a federal court. Since the district court did not hold a fact-finding hearing on the issue, our review of the dismissal of a defendant for insufficient service of process is\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   . See\n   <em>\n    Cardenas v. City of Chicago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3417824\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/1001/#p1005\">\n    646 F.3d 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1005 (7th Cir. 2011), citing\n   <em>\n    uBID, Inc. v.

The issue of timely service is governed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201448\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   In all cases removed from any State court to any district court of the United States in which any one or more of the defendants has not been served with process or in which the service has not been perfected prior to removal, or in which process served proves to be defective, such process or service may be completed or new process issued in the same manner as in cases originally filed in such district court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   This section shall not deprive any defendant upon whom process is served after removal of his right to move to remand the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The case was removed on January 2, 2015, and the operative complaint at the time of removal was the first amended\n   complaint. It named several defendants, including Dr. Michael Lovell, the Board of Regents, Heather Harbach, Pahoua Xiong, Amy Watson, Suzanne Weslow, Anthony DeWees, Nikolaus P. Rettinger III, Carla Greve, Angela Lang, and Dakota Hall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On September 30, 2015, the district court dismissed these defendants because they had not been properly served with a summons and the original or first amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    UWM Student Ass'n v. Lovell\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-C-0001,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205795675\">\n    2015 WL 5795675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (E.D.

The court also granted plaintiffs leave to file a second amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On October 13, 2015, plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint, renaming all of the previously dismissed defendants except Lang and Hall. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss that complaint. The district court held a hearing and granted plaintiffs leave to file a third amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   And on December 1, 2015, plaintiffs filed their third amended complaint, again naming all of the previously dismissed defendants except Lang and Hall.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although plaintiffs filed additional affidavits showing service following the third amended complaint, none of these affidavits establishes service on the previously dismissed defendants before or within 120 days of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The district court found that plaintiffs had failed to serve timely the remaining previously dismissed defendants under either state or federal law. Because \u00a7 1448 provides that federal law governs these procedural issues after the removal, we focus on the federal standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Under the version of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(m) in effect when this case was removed, plaintiffs had to serve defendants within 120 days of removal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For cases originally filed in federal court, Rule 4(m)'s service clock starts on the date the complaint is filed. For removed cases, the combined effect of \u00a7 1448 and Rule 4(m) starts the clock on the date of removal. See\n   <em>\n    Cardenas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3417824\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/1001/#p1005\">\n    646 F.3d at 1004\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   What happens when the plaintiffs fail to make timely service after the removal? Rule 4(m) requires the district court to extend the time \"if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure.\" The rule also permits the district court to extend the time even absent good cause.\n   <em>\n    Coleman v. Milwaukee Bd. of School Directors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9435599\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/290/932/#p934\">\n    290 F.3d 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 934 (7th Cir. 2002) (collecting cases and noting that \"excusable neglect\" may support extension), cited in 4B Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1137 (4th ed.) ; see also\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) advisory committee's note to 1993 amendment (noting that rule \"authorizes the court to relieve a plaintiff of the consequences of an application of this subdivision even if there is no good cause shown\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The case was removed to federal court on January 2, 2015, so defendants needed to be served by May 4, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs provide no evidence or argument that the previously dismissed defendants were served before that date, so they were not timely served under the federal rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   To overturn the dismissal, the plaintiffs argue that the district court implicitly extended the service period by allowing an amended complaint. But filing an amended complaint does not restart the clock for serving defendants who are added to an amended complaint after having been dismissed from a prior one. See\n   <em>\n    Del Raine v. Carlson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1741309\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/826/698/#p705\">\n    826 F.2d 698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 705 (7th Cir. 1987) (court order permitting amended complaint did not trigger new 120-day period for service); see also 4B Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1137 (4th ed.) (\"Filing an amended complaint does not toll the Rule 4(m) service period and thereby provide an additional 90 days for service. However, adding a new party through an amended complaint initiates a new timetable for service upon the added defendant.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To be cautious, the district court considered the late service issue under both state and federal law, but federal law governs. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201448\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court considered whether it would extend the period for service under Rule 4(m) or 6(b) and held that plaintiffs did not show \"anything approaching excusable neglect or good cause.\"\n   <em>\n    UWM Student Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266681\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/266/1121/#p1139\">\n    266 F.Supp.3d at 1130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While the district court did not specifically state whether it would have been willing to exercise its discretion to allow late service under Rule 4(m) despite the lack of good cause, we are confident from the court's analysis and comments that the court would not have been at all inclined to do so, and that would not be an abuse of its discretion. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's dismissal of the claims against the remaining previously dismissed defendants, Dr. Michael Lovell, the Board of Regents, Heather Harbach, Pahoua Xiong, Amy Watson, Suzanne Weslow, Anthony DeWees, Nikolaus P. Rettinger III, and Carla Greve, for lack of timely service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Dismissal of Right-to-Organize Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We turn next to plaintiffs' right-to-organize claim under Wisconsin law, which the district court dismissed based on state sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    UWM Student Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266681\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/266/1121/#p1139\">\n    266 F.Supp.3d at 1131-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The plaintiffs allege infringements of their right to self-organize, but most of the events ended in 2014. A prospective injunction would be pointless. The complaint acknowledges that plaintiffs seek to revive a student government that is \"moribund.\" Nearly four years after the last alleged wrongdoing, plaintiffs do not face any real and immediate threat of future injury. Although plaintiffs allege some continuing harms because the defendant Student Association continues to function, they fail to allege that those continuing harms have stopped them from organizing on a current basis.

We agree with that observation, but the district court erred in dismissing those remaining claims with prejudice. The remedy for misjoinder of otherwise proper claims is severance or dismissal without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   An overview of the joinder rules is helpful. Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires joinder of certain parties, but plaintiffs do not contend that joinder was required here. They rely instead on Rules 18 and 20, which can work together to allow joinder of multiple claims by multiple plaintiffs against multiple defendants. Multiple plaintiffs may join if they assert a \"right to relief jointly, severally, or in the alternative with respect to or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences\" and a \"question of law or fact common to all plaintiffs will arise in the action.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a)(1). Multiple defendants may be joined if \"any right to relief is asserted against them jointly, severally, or in the alternative with respect to or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences\" and \"any question of law or fact common to all defendants will arise in the action.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   These rules are broad, giving district courts considerable flexibility in managing and structuring civil litigation for fair and efficient resolution of complex disputes. Still, there are limits. \"Unrelated claims against different defendants belong in different suits.\"\n   <em>\n    George v. Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5541764\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/507/605/#p607\">\n    507 F.3d 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 607 (7th Cir. 2007). A district judge necessarily has considerable discretion in applying Rules 18 and 20. The rules \"operate[ ] independently\" because Rule 20 contains limitations that Rule 18 does not, and the Rule 20 inquiry comes first. See\n   <em>\n    Pace v. Timmermann's Ranch &amp; Saddle Shop Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289140\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/795/748/\">\n    795 F.3d 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 755 n.10 (7th Cir. 2015), citing\n   <em>\n    Intercon Research Assocs., Ltd. v.

Although Rule 18 does not contain the same limitations as Rule 20, district courts still have discretion at the pleading stage because of Rule 21. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 21 (\"On motion or on its own, the court may at any time, on just terms, add or drop a party. The court may also sever any claim against a party.\"). District courts also have discretion to sever claims at the trial stage under Rule 42. See 6A Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1586 (3d ed.) (\"As a practical matter, however, Rule 18(a) must be read in conjunction with the practice under Rule 42(b), which gives the court extensive discretionary power to order separate trials of claims or issues. Whenever the court determines that this type of treatment will be conducive to the expeditious handling of the action, will promote judicial economy, or will avoid prejudice to the litigants, it may order a properly joined claim or claims to be tried separately.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The district court acted well within its discretion in finding misjoinder here. Initially, the overarching conspiracy allegation in count six might have arguably\n   connected the claims. With that claim dismissed, there are limited connections between the remaining claims. The district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that counts one through five and seven do not belong in the same lawsuit, and that counts one through five were not properly joined with one another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Where we must disagree with our colleague in the district court concerns the remedy for this problem.
