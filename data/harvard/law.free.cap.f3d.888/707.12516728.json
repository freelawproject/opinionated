Appellant American Entertainers, LLC (\"American Entertainers\"), an exotic dancing venue, argues that the licensing regulation, in its entirety, violates the First Amendment on overbreadth grounds because it potentially requires licensure of venues that display \"mainstream\" performances such as ballets, concerts, and theatrical productions. In the alternative, American Entertainers contends that one of the licensing regulation's denial provisions is an unconstitutional prior restraint because it vests \"unbridled discretion\" in a governmental official to deny license applications and that another of the denial provisions violates the Equal Protection\n   Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by barring eighteen- to twenty-one-year-olds from owning \"sexually oriented businesses.\" The district court rejected all three claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court's denial of American Entertainers' First Amendment overbreadth challenge and Equal Protection challenge. We conclude, however, that the district court erred in rejecting American Entertainers' prior restraint claim. By authorizing the police chief to deny a license if the chief believes the applicant will fail to comply with \"all applicable laws,\" the challenged denial provision is insufficiently \"narrow, objective, and definite\" to pass constitutional muster.\n   <em>\n    Shuttlesworth v.

We therefore strike as unconstitutional the relevant denial provision from the Ordinance and remand to the district court to consider whether and to what extent the provision is severable from the remainder of the Ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In sum, we affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Since 2002, American Entertainers has operated within Rocky Mount's limits a business known as \"Gentleman's Playground.\" Gentleman's Playground features exotic dancers, whose scant attire has varied throughout its sixteen years of operation. Rocky Mount and American Entertainers previously have had disputes regarding the revealing nature of Gentleman's Playground's dancers' attire, including a voluntarily dismissed lawsuit back in 2003. Although years subsequently passed without incident, a 2014 police investigation regarding Gentleman's Playground caused Rocky Mount to seek to enforce against American Entertainers its sexually oriented business ordinance. Rocky Mount, N.C., Code of Ordinances \u00a7 13-270\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   [hereinafter Ordinance].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Ordinance constitutes Chapter 13, Article VII of Rocky Mount's City Code, and addresses \"the regulatory licensing requirements for sexually oriented businesses located within the city.\" \u00a7 13-270(a). Rocky Mount enacted the Ordinance because \"[s]exually oriented businesses ... are recognized as having serious objectionable operational characteristics\" and \"[s]tudies and experiences in other municipalities have shown that lower property values and increased crime rates tend to accompany and are brought about by sexually oriented businesses.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169040\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/394/147/#p151\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, \"[t]he city council f[ou]nd[ ] that regulation ... [wa]s necessary to insure that these adverse secondary effects do not contribute to the blighting of surrounding neighborhoods and to regulate acts, omissions or conditions detrimental to the health, safety or welfare and the peace and dignity of the city.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169040\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/394/147/#p151\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Ordinance's stated goal is to \"balanc[e] ... the legitimate ends of the community,\" and requires any sexually oriented business \"to carry its share of financing the administrative and enforcement activities.\" \u00a7 13-270(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Ordinance defines a sexually oriented business as, in pertinent part, \"any ...\n   <em>\n    adult cabaret\n   </em>\n   ... as defined in this article.\" \u00a7 13-271 (emphasis added). An \"adult cabaret,\" in turn, is defined as \"any retail business or private club as defined in North Carolina General Statutes \u00a7 18B-1000 which: (a) serves food or beverages, or permits the consumption of food or beverages; and (b) regularly provides or\n   has available for viewing by its patrons or members\n   <em>\n    adult live entertainment\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169040\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/394/147/#p151\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The term \"adult live entertainment\" means \"any performance of or involving the actual presence of real people which exhibits\n   <em>\n    specified sexual activities\n   </em>\n   or specified anatomical areas, as defined in this article.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169040\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/394/147/#p151\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The Ordinance defines \"specified sexual activities\" as, in relevant part, the \"[f]ondling or other erotic touching of human genitals, pubic regions, buttocks or female breasts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169040\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/394/147/#p151\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Additionally, the Ordinance contains six license-denial provisions. \u00a7 13-273(d). The two provisions at issue in this appeal permit Rocky Mount's police chief to deny a license if either (1) \"the operation [of the sexually oriented business], as proposed by the applicant, if permitted, would not comply with all applicable laws, including, but not limited to, the city's building, zoning, and health regulations;\" or (2) any license applicants or other specified business principals are \"not over the age of twenty-one ... years.\" \u00a7 13-273(d)(2), (d)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Rocky Mount sought to enforce the Ordinance against American Entertainers after police investigators learned that dancers at Gentleman's Playground were providing \"adult live entertainment\" within the meaning of the Ordinance. In response, American Entertainers filed a Complaint in the Eastern District of North Carolina challenging, among other things, the application and constitutionality of the Ordinance under the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After the close of discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court granted in part and denied in part the motions, resolving in Rocky Mount's favor American Entertainers' constitutional claims. American Entertainers timely filed a motion for rehearing, which the district court denied. American Entertainers timely appealed three constitutional determinations to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   American Entertainers asserts three arguments on appeal, that the Ordinance: (A) is unconstitutionally overbroad; (B) imposes an unconstitutional prior restraint by granting Rocky Mount's police chief unfettered discretion to deny a permit; and (C) violates the First Amendment and Equal Protection Clause by prohibiting from being owners, officers, or directors of a sexually oriented business individuals between eighteen and twenty-one years of age. Because this appeal arises from a district court's grant of summary judgment, we review each issue de novo.\n   <em>\n    Askew v.

Therefore, the specific conduct encompassed by the definition of \"specified sexual activities\" \"reach[es] conventional, mainstream arts and entertainment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060719\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/810/263/#p266\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before considering these arguments, we first must address Rocky Mount's two threshold objections to American Entertainers' overbreadth claim: that American Entertainers lacks standing to assert a facial overbreadth challenge and that\n   American Entertainers' overbreadth arguments are not properly before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Rocky Mount urges that American Entertainers lacks standing to assert a facial overbreadth challenge because Gentleman's Playground undisputedly falls within the relevant Ordinance definitions. However, this conflates the law of vagueness challenges,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Young v. Am.

Accordingly, that Gentleman's Playground likely falls within the Ordinance's constitutional scope does not bar American Entertainers' overbreadth challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Next, Rocky Mount argues that American Entertainers forfeited its right to challenge several provisions of the Ordinance as overly broad because American Entertainers' Complaint only expressly challenged as overbroad the definition of \"specified sexual activities.\" American Entertainers' Complaint, however, alleged that \"\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of [Rocky Mount]'s regulations governing sexually oriented businesses are unconstitutional on their face,\" J.A. 11 (emphasis added), described the interlocking nature of the Ordinance definitions at issue in this appeal, and targeted the most-specifically defined term: \"specified sexual activities.\" J.A. 42-43. Although this places primary focus on the definition of \"specified sexual activities,\" it does so of necessity. The definition of \"specified sexual activities\" provides required meaning to each Ordinance section here at issue and listed in the Complaint. Further, the definition does not exist in a vacuum-it necessarily must be read within the surrounding context of the Ordinance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parker v.

That construction applies with equal force to the Ordinance here, since its purpose is also to regulate adult entertainment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Further, in arguing that the word \"touching\" is overbroad, American Entertainers reads the word \"erotic\" out of the Ordinance entirely. The word \"erotic\" amplifies the meaning of the word \"touching\" in the Ordinance. Mere \"touching\" and \"erotic touching\" are not the same thing. \"Erotic\" means something. Specifically, it means \"of, devoted to, or tending to arouse sexual love or desire.\"\n   <em>\n    Erotic\n   </em>\n   , Webster's Third New International Dictionary (2002). An action is \"erotic\" if it \"tend[s] to incite sexual pleasure or desire\" or is \"directed toward sexual gratification.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5666161\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/470/1074/#p1080\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Erotic touching\" might also be described as touching that is \"lascivious,\" \"lustful,\" \"prurient,\" or \"vulgar\"-the opposite of touching that is \"decent,\" \"polite,\" or \"innocuous.\"\n   <em>\n    See Erotic\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster, http://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/erotic (last visited Apr. 4, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Quite simply, \"erotic touching,\" like \"fondling,\" has a sexual connotation that is plainly not present in mainstream artistic performances. Dancers performing a lift during a ballet surely do not intend for their touching to incite sexual arousal in the manner contemplated by the Ordinance. The same is true for athletic endeavors such as wrestling, where participants often come into contact with intimate body parts. Indeed, if \"erotic touching\" includes as broad a description as American Entertainers ascribes to it, the sports world is in trouble. Given such an extensive reading, a sports arena may well be considered a sexually oriented business, considering, for example, players' frequent celebratory slaps on the buttocks.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
