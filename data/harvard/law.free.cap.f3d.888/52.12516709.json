The Little Sisters sought to intervene in litigation challenging regulations promulgated under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The District Court denied the motion, finding that the Little Sisters lacked a significantly protectable interest in the case and that their interests were adequately represented by the federal government. We will reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Little Sisters of the Poor are an international Roman Catholic congregation whose mission is to serve the elderly poor of all backgrounds. They operate more than 25 homes for the elderly in the United States, all of which adhere to the same religious beliefs. Each home is separately incorporated as a nonprofit but is \"operated under the control\" of the larger congregation. App. 82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellant in this case is a religious nonprofit corporation that operates a Little Sisters home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Little Sisters' interest in regulations implementing the Affordable Care Act is neither novel nor isolated. Indeed, they have been involved in litigation regarding the Affordable Care Act for years, and their attempt to intervene in this case must be considered in full context. Accordingly, we begin by describing the relevant portions of the Affordable Care Act and its regulatory scheme, along with the pertinent legal challenges filed by the Little Sisters and others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Affordable Care Act includes a provision that requires health plans to cover certain forms of preventive care for women without cost sharing, as specified in guidelines issued by an agency of the United States Department of Health &amp; Human Services (HHS) called the Health Resources and Services Administration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4). Preventive care under these guidelines includes: all contraceptive methods approved by the Food &amp; Drug Administration, sterilization procedures, and related counseling and education. Unless an exemption applies, failure to comply with the mandate renders a noncompliant employer subject to a penalty of $100 \"for each day in the noncompliance period with respect to each individual to whom such failure relates.\" 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980D(b)(1). In common parlance, this coverage has come to be known as the \"contraceptive mandate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2011, HHS, along with the United States Departments of Labor and Treasury (collectively, the Departments) promulgated interim final regulations exempting certain religious employers from the contraceptive mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Fed.%20Reg.%2046%2C621\">\n    76 Fed.

To be eligible, a religious employer had to (1) have the inculcation of religious values as its purpose; (2) primarily employ people who share its religious tenets; (3) primarily provide services to persons who share its religious tenets; and (4) be a church, its integrated auxiliary, a convention or association of a church, or \"the exclusively religious activities of any religious order.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Fed.%20Reg.%2046%2C621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Fed.%20Reg.%2046%2C621\">\n    at 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,623 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206033\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(A)(i), (iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Almost two years after the interim final regulations were promulgated, the Departments issued a final rule in response to public input and various legal challenges.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2039%2C870\">\n    78 Fed.

Such a religious nonprofit employer could avail itself of the accommodation if it (1) had religious objections to providing coverage for some or all of the required contraceptive services; (2) was \"organized and operate[d] as a nonprofit entity;\" (3) \"[held] itself out as a religious organization;\" and (4) \"self-certifie[d] that it satisfie[d] the first three criteria.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2039%2C870\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Once an employer made this self-certification to its insurer or third-party administrator, that entity would provide the mandated contraceptive services directly to women covered under the employer's plan.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2039%2C870\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2039%2C870\">\n    at 39,875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

They claimed the contraceptive mandate was unconstitutional and that it violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged v.

Colo. 2013). With respect to RFRA, the Little Sisters asserted that the self-certification accommodation would force them to \"take actions that directly cause others to provide contraception or appear to participate in the Departments' delivery scheme,\" both of which would violate their religious conviction \"that deliberately avoiding reproduction through medical means is immoral.\"\n   <em>\n    Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged v.

They sought a preliminary injunction, which the district court denied.

This litigation has the potential to reopen issues that turn on the meaning of RFRA as it bears on self-certification, potentially influencing any substantive outcome. The Commonwealth's APA challenge calls into question whether the new religious exemption is required by RFRA and therefore justifies bypassing notice-and-comment rulemaking to issue the IFRs quickly. If this Court were to reach the RFRA issue, we would be answering the very question the Supreme Court chose not to address in\n   <em>\n    Zubik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether the self-certification process imposes a substantial burden on the Little Sisters' sincerely held religious beliefs.

It stands to reason, then, that the Little Sisters have a significantly protectable interest in whether the approach contemplated by\n   <em>\n    Zubik\n   </em>\n   , as\n   manifested in the religious exemption IFR, ultimately prevails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We faced an analogous scenario in\n   <em>\n    Kleissler\n   </em>\n   , where one of the timber companies had won a bid for a contract, and the bid was threatened by an environmental suit against the municipality.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11682616\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/157/964/#p969\">\n    157 F.3d at 973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Commonwealth Br. 19. To support this argument, Pennsylvania emphasizes that the Little Sisters have not lost their protection under\n   <em>\n    Zubik\n   </em>\n   in the months since the District Court granted preliminary injunctive relief, so \"no outcome in this case presents a 'tangible threat' to the Little Sisters' 'legally cognizable' interests.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11682616\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/157/964/#p969\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We disagree with this view, which the District Court adopted, and we conclude that the Commonwealth's contentions are based on an incomplete reading of\n   <em>\n    Zubik\n   </em>\n   .

Should the federal government have to engage in a new rulemaking process, there is no guarantee that the Little Sisters will remain protected under\n   <em>\n    Zubik\n   </em>\n   . In this regard, the District Court found that the Little Sisters have recourse through the litigation brought in the Tenth Circuit by their colleagues.

This, in turn, could affect whether the Little Sisters will remain exempt from the mandate.

The religious exemption IFR applies not only to religious nonprofit corporations like the Little Sisters, but also to closely held and publicly traded for-profit corporations. And the moral exemption IFR protects parties for reasons unrelated to religion. The religious and moral interests of these entities are numerous and varied. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that the government will sufficiently attend to the Little Sisters' specific interests as it attempts to uphold both IFRs in their entirety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kleissler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11682616\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/157/964/#p969\">\n    157 F.3d at 967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that the proposed intervenors had carried their burden by showing \"a reasonable\n   doubt whether the government agency would adequately represent [their] concerns\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The preceding discussion also demonstrates why our decision in\n   <em>\n    Virgin Islands\n   </em>\n   is inapposite.

Unlike that situation, here the IFRs protect more than religious nonprofits like the Little Sisters, and the Little Sisters do not share the government's interest in upholding every aspect of both IFRs.
