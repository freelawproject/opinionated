Pettis objected to his classification as an armed career criminal and argued that none of the six convictions qualified as predicate offenses under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"). The court agreed with Pettis on five of the six convictions, finding that only one of his convictions for aggravated robbery qualified as violent felony for purposes of the ACCA. Because it found that Pettis had not been convicted of at least three predicate offenses, the court concluded that Pettis was not eligible for the ACCA sentencing enhancement. As a result, Pettis's guidelines range initially was determined to be 151 to 188 months, but because of the ten-year statutory maximum sentence for a felon-in-possession offense without the ACCA enhancement,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), the guidelines sentence was 120 months,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(a). The court sentenced Pettis to 120 months' imprisonment but noted that \"if Mr. Pettis was found to be an armed career criminal under the ACCA, [it] would impose a sentence of 192 months.\" The Government timely appealed, arguing that Pettis qualifies as an armed career criminal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The ACCA's enhanced sentencing penalties apply when a defendant has three or more convictions for serious drug offenses or violent felonies.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). On appeal, the Government initially argued that all six of the convictions in question qualify as violent felonies for purposes of the ACCA and thus that Pettis should receive the armed career criminal enhancement to his sentence.

Thus, for Pettis to qualify as an armed career criminal, his Minnesota simple-robbery convictions must qualify as predicate offenses. Accordingly, we limit our analysis to that question, which we review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In other words, to decide whether Minnesota simple robbery qualifies as a violent felony, we must determine whether a conviction for the offense requires the use, attempted use, or threatened use of force capable of causing physical pain or injury. To find that a conviction does not so require, \"there must be a realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility,\" that a person would be convicted for conduct that does not involve this kind of violent force.\n   <em>\n    Moncrieffe v.

In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Libby\n   </em>\n   , we held that Minnesota simple robbery requires as an element at least the threatened use of violent force and thus qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266493\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/1011/#p1015\">\n    880 F.3d 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1015-16 (8th Cir. 2018). That decision arguably resolves this case. Since\n   <em>\n    Libby\n   </em>\n   , however, an\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   panel of this court clarified the proper analysis for considering whether a statute requires violent force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swopes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516467\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/668/#p670\">\n    886 F.3d at 670-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (overruling\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, while we reach the same conclusion as\n   <em>\n    Libby\n   </em>\n   , we revisit the question with the benefit of this new precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In Minnesota, a simple robbery occurs when a person, \"having knowledge of not being entitled thereto, takes personal property from ... another and uses or threatens the imminent use of force against any person to overcome the person's resistance or powers of resistance to, or to compel acquiescence in, the taking or carrying away of the property.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.24\">\n    Minn.

Like the district court below, Pettis relies heavily on our precedents involving convictions under similar statutes in other states-namely,\n   <em>\n    Eason\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In\n   <em>\n    Libby\n   </em>\n   , we compared the text of the Arkansas and Minnesota statutes and found that because \"the statutes are distinguishable ... we are not bound by\n   <em>\n    Eason\n   </em>\n   's holding\" when reviewing the Minnesota simple-robbery statute.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266493\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/1011/#p1015\">\n    880 F.3d at 1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the Arkansas statute considered in\n   <em>\n    Eason\n   </em>\n   defines the requisite force for conviction as \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   ... [b]odily impact, restraint, or confinement.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%205-12-101\">\n    Ark.

We agree. But since Pettis filed his briefs, we have held that a conviction for Missouri second-degree robbery qualifies as a violent felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swopes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516467\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/668/#p670\">\n    886 F.3d at 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Swopes\n   </em>\n   , we explained that the \"text of the Missouri second-degree robbery statute ... requires proof that a defendant used physical force or threatened the immediate use of physical force.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516467\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/668/#p670\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The similarity between the text of the Missouri and Minnesota statutes thus supports the Government's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   That still leaves Minnesota caselaw applying\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.24\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609.24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In conducting this analysis, we are again mindful of the\n   <em>\n    Swopes\n   </em>\n   decision. In\n   <em>\n    Swopes\n   </em>\n   , we emphasized two considerations for evaluating state caselaw: we (1) focus on the conduct at issue in the state court decision rather than isolated\n   <em>\n    dicta\n   </em>\n   and (2) focus more on the kind of force used-force capable of causing pain-rather than the degree of force or the resulting harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swopes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516467\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/668/#p670\">\n    886 F.3d at 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In resisting this conclusion, Pettis relies on a Minnesota Court of Appeals' statement that \"[m]ere force suffices for the simple robbery statute,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

In context, however, the language in\n   <em>\n    State v.
