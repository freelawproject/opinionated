These two federal actions are stayed pending the outcome of a third class action that is proceeding in California state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Although we agree with Bozic that it was clear error to transfer her action to the Eastern District, issuance of the writ would have no practical impact on this case in its current procedural posture, and any injury Bozic might face is purely speculative. We therefore hold that the extraordinary remedy of mandamus is unwarranted at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2015, Plaintiff-Petitioner Regina Bozic purchased the weight-loss supplement Lipozene in her home state of Pennsylvania. Disappointed by the product, Bozic filed a putative class action in the Southern District against the corporate entities and individuals (collectively, \"Defendants\") responsible for the production, distribution, and marketing of Lipozene. In addition to asserting a series of state law claims, Bozic sought a declaratory judgment defining Lipozene purchasers' rights under a 2005 Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") consent decree that restricts Defendants' ability to sell weight-loss products. The Southern District, where the decree was entered and where Defendants reside, retains jurisdiction over matters involving \"construction, modification, and enforcement\" of that decree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Bozic's case is the third of its kind. At the time she filed suit, two related putative class actions were already pending in California:\n   <em>\n    Duran v. Obesity Research Institute, LLC\n   </em>\n   , filed in the San Diego Superior Court, and\n   <em>\n    Fernandez v. Obesity Research Institute, LLC\n   </em>\n   , filed in the Eastern District.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   All three suits assert similar state law claims against a largely overlapping group of defendants, although Bozic's request for declaratory relief under the FTC consent decree is unique to the current action.\n   <em>\n    Fernandez\n   </em>\n   has been stayed since August 2013 pending the resolution of\n   <em>\n    Duran\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Bozic filed this action in March 2016 in the Southern District, Defendants moved in that court to transfer the case to the Eastern District for consolidation with\n   <em>\n    Fernandez\n   </em>\n   or, in the alternative, to stay the proceedings. The court held that Bozic's action was governed by the first-to-file rule, a judicially created \"doctrine of federal comity,\"\n   <em>\n    Pacesetter Sys., Inc. v.

Issuance of the writ would have no practical impact on this case in its current procedural posture. The district court made clear that it would either transfer or stay this case under the first-to-file rule, which the parties do not dispute applies. If transfer were not an available option, Bozic's action therefore would be stayed pending a final judgment in\n   <em>\n    Duran\n   </em>\n   -which is the same state it is in now in the Eastern District. As a result, any injury Bozic might face from the transfer is purely speculative at this point. If the stay were eventually lifted in circumstances in which she could proceed with her case, thus making her asserted injury less speculative, Bozic could then file a motion in the Eastern District to transfer her case back to the Southern District and, if necessary, file a new petition for a writ of mandamus in our court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The district court clearly erred by transferring this case to the Eastern District because, under the general venue statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201391\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , venue is not proper there.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court had discretion to transfer Bozic's action, but only \"to any other district or division where it might have been brought.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The phrase \"where it might have been brought\" refers solely to districts where Bozic could have originally filed suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hoffman v. Blaski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165319\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/363/335/#p344\">\n    363 U.S. 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 344,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165319\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/363/335/#p344\">\n    80 S.Ct. 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165319\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/363/335/#p344\">\n    4 L.Ed.2d 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1960). This category cannot be expanded by Defendants, even if they favor transfer to a district where the action could not have been brought.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165319\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/363/335/#p344\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Relying on the class character of Bozic's claims, Defendants argue that venue is proper in the Eastern District because some putative class members presumably purchased Lipozene in that district. And even if venue is improper under \u00a7 1404(a), they insist that the requirements of \u00a7 1404(a) do not control where, as here, an action is transferred pursuant to the first-to-file rule. We reject both contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants assert that purchases by putative class members in the Eastern District comprise \"a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to\" Bozic's claims, and that venue in the Eastern District is therefore proper under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201391\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). Even putting aside whether the purchase of Lipozene by some fraction of putative class members might qualify as \"a substantial part of the events\"-and further that no members of Bozic's putative class have so far been identified-Defendants' argument fails. Whether before or after class certification, the claims of unnamed class members can never make permissible an otherwise impermissible venue. Rather, in a class action, the \"events\" in question are only those involving the named plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abrams Shell v. Shell Oil Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9096845\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/343/482/#p490\">\n    343 F.3d 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 490 (5th Cir. 2003) (explaining that \"all named plaintiffs to a class action must satisfy the venue requirements\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   2 Newberg on Class Actions \u00a7 6:36 (5th ed.) (\"The analysis of where a substantial part of the events took place, in a class action, looks to the events concerning the named plaintiffs' claims, not all of the class members' claims.\"). Otherwise, a nationwide class action could be transferred to any district in the country, thus abrogating the venue statute altogether.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Nothing in Bozic's Complaint suggests that a substantial part of the events giving rise to her individual claims-or, indeed, any event giving rise to her individual claims-occurred in the Eastern District. Nor have Defendants offered any evidence or legal theory connecting Bozic's individual claims to the Eastern District. Bozic purchased Lipozene in Pennsylvania, and Defendants' Lipozene business operations are based entirely in the Southern District. By contrast, venue is proper in the Eastern District in\n   <em>\n    Fernandez\n   </em>\n   , the related federal class action, because several of the\n   named plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Fernandez\n   </em>\n   purchased Lipozene in the Eastern District.\n   <em>\n    Fernandez v. Obesity Research Inst., LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:13-cv-00975-MCE-KJN,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%204587005\">\n    2013 WL 4587005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 28, 2013). Contrary to Defendants' argument, it is irrelevant that Bozic is herself a member of the putative class in\n   <em>\n    Fernandez\n   </em>\n   ; whether venue is proper under \u00a7 1391(b)(2) in\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   action depends only on the events surrounding Bozic's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Nor does \u00a7 1391(b)(1) or (b)(3) provide a basis for venue in the Eastern District. None of the seven defendants in this action reside in the Eastern District, as would be required for venue under \u00a7 1391(b)(1). And \u00a7 1391(b)(3) applies only if there is no district where venue lies under \u00a7 1391(b)(1) or (b)(2). Because venue is proper in the Southern District, this residual provision does not apply. Thus, the Eastern District is not an available venue for this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants also contend that the first-to-file rule negates \u00a7 1404(a)'s requirement that an action may be transferred only to a district where it \"might have been brought.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants' argument on this score presents what appears to be an issue of first impression in the courts of appeals. But Defendants' argument is foreclosed by the plain language of \u00a7 1404(a), which provides in relevant part that \"a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Van Dusen v.

Bozic's petition might have been more responsive to her articulated concern had she also requested that we reverse the district court's conclusion that the first-to-file rule applied, thereby precluding any subsequent stay in the Southern District.
