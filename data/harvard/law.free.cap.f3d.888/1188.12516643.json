After exhausting his state-court remedies on direct appeal and collateral attack, he petitioned the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida for a writ of habeas\n   corpus vacating his convictions pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court denied the writ and a judge of this Court issued a Certificate of Appealability (\"COA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The COA posed the following question: whether Bush was denied \"due process or access to the courts\" because he was unable-due to the unavailability of a transcript of his criminal trial-to prove in collaterally attacking his convictions that his trial attorneys rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). The answer to this question depends upon whether the Florida Third District Court of Appeal's (\"DCA\") decision affirming the collateral-attack court's denial of relief \"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established\" United States Supreme Court precedent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1). We conclude that the answer is no and therefore affirm the District Court's denial of the writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The crimes in this case occurred in the night of October 7-8, 2003, in Miami Shores, a village in Miami-Dade County, Florida. Around 2:30am on October 8, Lori Willenberg briefly observed a man outside of her house. Minutes later, she saw the man running swiftly near the back of her house. She called the police and described the man as a black male wearing a red shirt and black pants. An officer responded and, upon his arrival, spotted a man nearby matching that description. He was riding a bicycle. After the man noticed the officer, he jumped off of the bicycle, discarded a bag and a leaf blower, and then ran. The officer followed him but ceased the pursuit soon after the man jumped over a chain-link fence. A k-9 unit was dispatched and at around 3:30am Michael Bush was found on the roof of a house in the area and taken into custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 29, 2003, the State Attorney for Miami-Dade County charged Bush by information with burglary of an occupied dwelling, grand theft, and resisting an officer without violence. He was declared indigent, and the Circuit Court of Miami-Dade County appointed public defenders Lindsey Glazer and Gregg Toung to represent him. Bush pleaded not guilty to the information and stood trial before a jury on February 7, 8, and 9, 2006. The jury convicted Bush on all charges, and the court sentenced him to prison for thirty-five years. He appealed his convictions to the DCA, represented by separate appointed counsel, public defenders Bennett Brummer and Howard Blumberg. Portions of Bush's trial had not been transcribed because the court reporter had lost some of her notes,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   so counsel sought leave to reconstruct the trial record and prepare a \"statement of the evidence or proceedings\" (\"Statement\") pursuant to Florida Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.200(b)(4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   With the\n   assistance of Bush's trial attorneys and the prosecutor, counsel prepared the Statement, which depicted what had transpired during the portions of the trial that had not been transcribed. The Statement was included in the record on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Although the Statement failed to recreate portions of the trial, the appeal went forward presenting a single issue: whether the trial court erred in sustaining the State's objection to unauthenticated x-rays of Bush's damaged ankle, which would have helped Bush substantiate his claim that he was incapable of evading police in the way the prosecution alleged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The DCA affirmed summarily.\n   <em>\n    Bush v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8204941,8204966\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/992/412/\">\n    992 So.2d 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 3d Dist. Ct. App. 2008) (mem.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 29, 2009, Bush returned to the trial court and filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion for postconviction relief pursuant to Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850. His motion presented six claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Annexed to his motion was the Statement that had been presented to the DCA in the direct appeal of his convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court appointed Alan Byrd, a private lawyer, to represent Bush and on August 12, 2010, it held an evidentiary hearing on Bush's motion. Bush's trial attorneys, the prosecutor, and Bush testified.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The attorneys' recollection of what transpired during the portions of the trial that had not been transcribed differed from that of Bush; they sharply disputed Bush's version of what had occurred. Byrd thus argued that Bush's motion should be granted because, had a complete trial transcript been available, he could have thoroughly impeached the attorneys' testimony and Bush's own would have been bolstered. The trial court was not persuaded and denied Bush's Rule 3.850 motion on September 10, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Bush appealed the decision to the DCA. In his brief, he raised four issues. The first three concerned three of the original six ineffective-assistance claims litigated in the Rule 3.850 proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bush's fourth issue was whether the court erred, under the United States and Florida Constitutions, \"in denying [his] Rule 3.850 motion for [postconviction] relief on all claims when 80% of the original trial record was\n   lost, destroyed, or [ir]retrievable.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bush claimed that given this circumstance, the court should have vacated his convictions and ordered a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Bush argued that a new trial was required because the missing portions of the trial transcript precluded him from proving his allegations of ineffective assistance and thus prevented the trial court from fairly considering and then ruling on his motion. He supported his argument by citing a series of Florida appellate decisions, all reviewing a defendant's conviction on direct appeal\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; none reviewed the denial of postconviction relief. In the most recent decision Bush cited,\n   <em>\n    Jones v. State\n   </em>\n   , the Florida Supreme Court expressed its precedent in cases involving the absence of a trial transcript in the direct appeal of a defendant's conviction\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   : \"It is ... clear that under our precedent, this Court requires that the defendant demonstrate that there is a basis for a claim that the missing transcript would reflect matters which prejudice the defendant.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8980695\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/923/486/#p489\">\n    923 So.2d 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 489 (Fla. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The State, in its answer brief, expressed its argument for the affirmance of the trial court's decision with this perfunctory statement: \"[T]he court's decision denying the Rule 3.850 motion was based on a careful review of the witnesses, and circumstances of the case; that the Appellant's issues have already been addressed or are meritless, and alternatively, there was no error.\" Referring to\n   <em>\n    Jones v. State\n   </em>\n   and two of the other cases Bush had cited,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   the State's answer brief acknowledged that a new trial might have been required had an inadequate trial transcript precluded the DCA from conducting a meaningful review of his convictions. It went on to assert, however, that \"to the extent that the adequacy of the record was or could have been raised on direct appeal, [Bush] was not entitled to relief.\" In making its argument, the State did not distinguish between the provision of a trial transcript on direct appeal and in a postconviction\n   proceeding. The State thus raised, but did not answer, the question of whether the\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   remedy applied in the postconviction context as well as on direct appeal and, if so, whether the transcript of Bush's trial was inadequate for Rule 3.850 purposes-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to determine whether defense counsels' trial performance was constitutionally ineffective under\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   . It was precisely this unanswered question that Bush's fourth point posed: whether the Florida appellate decisions Bush cited required the denial of Rule 3.850 relief to be reversed and a new trial granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The DCA summarily affirmed the trial court's decision.\n   <em>\n    Bush v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. 3D10-3063,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20560916\">\n    2012 WL 560916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 3d Dist. Ct. App. Feb. 22, 2012) (unpublished table decision).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Having exhausted his state-court remedies, Bush brought the habeas petition now before us. In his petition, Bush challenged the DCA's disposition of the three ineffective-assistance claims presented on appeal and of his claim that the unavailability of eighty percent of the trial transcript required the vacation of his convictions and a new trial. Bush reframed that claim, which is the only claim relevant here, to assert two violations of the United States Constitution: His convictions were invalid because \"his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process and access to the courts were violated by being required to appeal and seek postconviction remedies with an incomplete record.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   As stated, the claim amounted to a substantive restatement of the fourth claim Bush presented to the DCA in appealing the denial of Rule 3.850 relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The District Court ordered the state to respond to the petition. Concerning Bush's fourth claim, the State's response first asserted that the claim had been waived. Bush, the State contended, should have raised on direct appeal his allegations about the effect of the incomplete transcript on meaningful appellate review. The State then argued that, should the merits be reached, Bush could not show that he was actually prejudiced by the missing portions of the transcript. Implicit in this argument was the State's recognition that a convicted defendant has a constitutional right to the provision of a trial transcript for use in postconviction proceedings. It recognized the right as created by the substantive component of the Due Process Clause. It also recognized that denial of a transcript might operate to deny the defendant's right of access to the courts. In short, the State's argument was not that there is no constitutional right to a trial transcript in postconviction proceedings. Rather, its argument was that notwithstanding the missing portions of the transcript, Bush received full consideration of his ineffective-assistance claims in the Rule 3.850 proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The District Court referred Bush's petition and the State's response to a Magistrate Judge for a report and recommendation. The Magistrate Judge denied Bush's request for an evidentiary hearing and, after consulting the records of the state courts' criminal and Rule 3.850 proceedings, recommended that the District Court deny his petition. In his recommendation,\n   the Magistrate Judge \"decline[d] to engage in an analysis of procedural bar\" resulting from Bush's failure to present his insufficient-record argument as two, discrete federal constitutional claims in his Rule 3.850 motion and instead reached the merits.

The District Court denied the COA, but this Court granted a COA with respect to his fourth claim, framing the issue as \"[w]hether the absence of significant portions of the trial transcript violated Bush's rights to due process or access to the courts.\" The COA was granted under the assumption that Bush had presented the due process and access to the courts claims to the DCA and that it had summarily decided that neither constitutional right had been infringed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), Pub.

Bush does not contend that the DCA's affirmance of the Rule 3.850 court's decision was based on an unreasonable determination of facts. Rather, his argument is that the decision was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal Law, and that the District Court erred in failing to recognize that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Under \u00a7 2254(d)(1), \"clearly established Federal Law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\" refers to the Court's holdings, not its dicta, as of the time of the state-court decision in question.\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

In his opening brief on appeal, though, Bush says nothing about access to the courts. He has therefore abandoned the claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As to due process, the parties, the Magistrate Judge, and the District Court treated Bush's petition as claiming a violation of the right in its substantive rather than procedural form. And Bush and the State continue to do so here. We do likewise. Our analysis starts with the function of a trial transcript on direct appeal versus in postconviction proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The state creates a trial transcript for purposes of direct appeal out of necessity. That is, the state provides direct appellate review of convictions, so it also provides a court reporter and transcript in order to allow for review to be meaningful. A trial transcript, in some instances, might be critical to reviewing for alleged trial-court errors; affirming a conviction without\n   one might be arbitrary. Thus if a defendant's conviction cannot be meaningfully reviewed on direct appeal, due to a deficient transcript or otherwise, state law requires the conviction to be vacated.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Vilsaint v.

App. 2005) (mem.). And indeed the United States Constitution does too, as such would violate one's right to procedural due process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Entsminger v. Iowa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182899\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/748/#p750\">\n    386 U.S. 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 750,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182899\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/748/#p750\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1403,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182899\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/748/#p750\">\n    18 L.Ed.2d 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1967) (holding that a defendant was denied \"adequate and effective review\" of his conviction because significant parts of the trial record were missing). In Bush's direct appeal of his convictions, he did not have a complete trial transcript, but that did not preclude meaningful review. Bush concedes this.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A trial transcript plays a different role in Rule 3.850 proceedings. Once a Rule 3.850 motion is filed, the clerk must \"forward the motion and file to the court.\" Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850(f). If the motion states a claim for relief \"but the files and records in the case conclusively show that the defendant is not entitled to relief,\" the claim \"shall be summarily denied on the merits without a hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.850(f)(4), (5). If the files and records-including among their contents the trial transcript-do not conclusively show that the defendant is not entitled to relief, as here, then the court must order the state attorney to file an answer to the defendant's motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.850(f)(6). After Bush filed his motion and the State filed its response, the Rule 3.850 court decided an evidentiary hearing was required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.850(f)(8). It was only at this point that Bush needed the trial transcript. The full transcript was unavailable but the hearing proceeded nonetheless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In this context, the transcript was merely to serve as a piece of evidence in Bush's Rule 3.850 proceeding. Bush's constitutional claim is that, without a transcript in his Rule 3.850 hearing, he could neither impeach the other witnesses' testimony nor show that his memory of the events at trial was, in fact, better than that of the other witnesses. Bush contends that this hindered his ability to argue his ineffective-assistance claims. The transcript, then, was to be used to increase or decrease the value of witness testimony, like any other piece of evidence.

Bush was represented by counsel in his Rule 3.850 proceeding, testified about his own recollection of trial, called Toung as a witness and had an opportunity to cross-examine Glazer and Simon, and had the right to appeal. He also had available to him the record which he and his trial counsel had previously supplemented with a statement of proceedings via Florida Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.200(b)(4). What's more, the transcript's incompleteness is in no way a result of trial-court error, and the full transcript would not aid in identifying trial-court errors.

There may be instances in which a trial transcript is crucial to meaningful appellate review. But there may also be instances in which meaningful review can be conducted without a trial transcript. Adequate process can remedy a missing or deficient trial transcript. Florida Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.200(b)(4), for example, provides litigants a way to receive a fair hearing without a trial transcript.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In Rule 3.850 proceedings, trial transcripts are but one part of the record that informs a state postconviction court's decision of whether to conduct an evidentiary hearing. Here, Bush was granted an evidentiary hearing. Within that hearing, the trial transcript's function was then an evidentiary one: to substantiate Bush's testimony and impeach adverse testimony. Being unable to use a portion of the trial transcript was akin to being unable to produce a witness. Bush's claim therefore cannot be feasibly characterized as a\n   <em>\n    substantive\n   </em>\n   due process violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The DCA's affirmance of the Rule 3.850 court's denial of relief was not contrary to, and did not involve an unreasonable application of, clearly established United States Supreme Court precedent.
