When Marshall Garber sued Dr. Heriberto Menendez for malpractice in May 2017, one year had come and gone. But Ohio tolls the statute of limitations if the defendant leaves the State. The clock stopped when Dr. Menendez left Ohio for Florida and stayed stopped when he chose to retire there. That differential treatment of residents and non-residents, says Dr. Menendez, violates the dormant Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution by disincentivizing individuals from leaving Ohio and offering their services (or retirement spending) in other States. But the Ohio tolling provision does not discriminate against out-of-state commerce any more than many other policy benefits reserved for residents of a given State, including the existence of an income tax for Ohioans but not for Floridians. We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2010, Dr. Menendez treated fifteen-year-old Garber for a fever, constipation, and back pain. The treatment did not go well. Garber became a paraplegic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Garber's first two attempts to sue Dr. Menendez failed. The state court dismissed Garber's initial lawsuit because he failed to file an affidavit from an expert witness in support of his claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ohio Civ. R. 10(D)(2). In his second lawsuit, Garber tried to serve Dr. Menendez at his Ohio office, but (unbeknownst to him) Dr. Menendez had retired to Florida by then. Garber voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit due to lack of service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Garber sued Dr. Menendez a third time in May 2017, and properly served him. Garber acknowledged that Ohio provides a one-year statute of limitations for medical malpractice claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2305.113. And he acknowledged that the limitations period began running on August 5, 2013, when he turned eighteen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2305.16. But his lawsuit remained timely, he explained, because Ohio tolls the statute of limitations when the defendant \"departs from the state.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2305.15. Dr. Menendez left Ohio for Florida in April 2014, and he has not returned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Dr. Menendez removed the lawsuit to federal court. He filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that Ohio's tolling rules violated the dormant component of the Commerce Clause as applied to him. The district court agreed and dismissed Garber's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"[A] page of history is worth a volume of logic,\"\n   <em>\n    N.Y.

Once a statute of limitations started, it usually did not stop. Many States responded to the problem by enacting laws that tolled the limitations period for out-of-state defendants, whether they fled the jurisdiction in the face of a lawsuit or left innocently for greener pastures. 2 H.G. Wood, A Treatise on the Limitation of Actions at Law and in Equity \u00a7 244, at 1143-47 (Dewitt C. Moore, ed., 4th ed. 1916) (collecting statutes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ohio joined this crowd early. Seven years after Ohio became a State in 1803, its legislature enacted a law that tolled the statute of limitations \"when any person or persons against whom there is cause of action[ ] shall have left the state.\" An Act for the Limitation of Actions, ch. 213, \u00a7 2 (1810),\n   <em>\n    reprinted in\n   </em>\n   1 The Statutes of Ohio and of the Northwestern Territory 656 (Salmon P. Chase, ed., 1833).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The premises of these policies and constitutional rulings shifted over time. By the early Twentieth Century, new modes of transportation and communication meant that many businesses sold their products in many States, not just one, and that most individuals could travel readily between and among the States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Cue\n   <em>\n    International Shoe\n   </em>\n   . It held that the Due Process Clause no longer required in-state personal service on defendants for a state court to exercise personal jurisdiction over them.\n   <em>\n    Int'l Shoe Co. v.

After\n   <em>\n    International Shoe\n   </em>\n   , after the Court liberated the States from the requirement of having physical control over the parties in a lawsuit in its jurisdiction, every State enacted a long-arm statute that allowed claimants to file lawsuits against out-of-state defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 Robert\n   C. Casad, William M. Richman &amp; Stanley E. Cox, Jurisdiction in Civil Actions \u00a7 4.01 (4th ed. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This change in law changed the policy calculus for tolling statutes of limitations, as the most salient justification for tolling the statute of limitations against out-of-state defendants no longer existed. Some state legislatures as a result amended their tolling statutes to apply only if their long-arm statute-usually construed to extend as far as the Due Process Clause permitted-could not reach the out-of-state defendant.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 735 Ill.

In granting Congress power \"[t]o regulate Commerce ... among the several States,\" U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3, the Constitution implied that the States had no such power.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2 The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, at 625 (Max Farrand ed. 1966) (James Madison grew \"more &amp; more convinced\" that the regulation of commerce among the States \"was in its nature indivisible and ought to be wholly under one authority.\"). Hence the creation of a negative, implied, dormant limitation on the States' power to regulate interstate commerce. For much of American history, a challenge to a state or federal regulation thus required courts to police the boundary between Congress's exclusive sphere of regulation and the States' exclusive sphere.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gibbons v.

Dr. Menendez does not claim that the law explicitly discriminates against interstate commerce. For good reason. On its face, the tolling statute bears none of the hallmarks of facial discrimination.

Here is Dr. Menendez's theory. The law violates\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   , he says, by starting the statute of limitations clock when an itinerant Ohioan commits a tort in Ohio and by stopping the clock when he leaves the State before the statute of limitations expires. In this way, he explains, the law discourages Ohio residents from moving by adding a cost to relocating and by depriving other States of the commercial benefits that new residents might bring. We don't see it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Start with the stops. Many state benefits stop when a resident leaves a State. Texans do not pay a state income tax but lose that benefit when they move. Floridians do not pay an estate tax but lose that benefit when they move. Many States offer their residents-and their residents alone-an in-state tuition break for attendance at the State's universities. Some States have higher minimum-wage laws than others. Some States have lower licensing fees than others. And some States charge higher licensing fees for out-of-state residents. Just ask a fisherman.\n   <em>\n    All\n   </em>\n   of these policy choices (and many more) provide benefits to residents that the residents put in jeopardy if they move. In truth, States discourage residents from leaving whenever they provide residents with policies they like. That indeed is the point of the benefits. But the States' ability to attract and retain residents through policy choices has long been considered a healthy byproduct of the laboratories of democracy in our federalism-based system of government, not a sign of unconstitutional protectionism.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Evenwel v.

But a complete ban on travel differs in degree and kind from the Ohio law.

But it does not carry the water needed to invalidate this law. An Illinois company (Midwesco) agreed to install a boiler system for an Ohio company (Bendix) in one of its Ohio facilities.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6226096\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/888/\">\n    486 U.S. at 889-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6226096\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/888/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Midwesco allegedly did a poor job and Bendix sued, relying on the Ohio statute to toll the limitations period because Midwesco was an out-of-state company.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6226096\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/888/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court held that this application of the tolling statute violated the dormant Commerce Clause. By applying its tolling statute, the Court explained, Ohio forced out-of-state companies like Midwesco to face liability indefinitely as a cost of doing business across state lines.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6226096\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/888/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6226096\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/888/\">\n    at 891-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6226096\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/888/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court held that this favoritism imposed a \"significant\" burden on interstate commerce that, measured by\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   balancing, outweighed any local benefits of the law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6226096\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/888/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   But the tolling statute does not impose a cost on a traditional interstate business transaction in the same way in today's case. At the time of the medical/business transaction, Dr. Menendez lived in Ohio, and he treated Garber, an Ohio resident, in Ohio. That application of the statute does not lead to favoritism toward in-state firms over out-of-state ones. It merely creates a benefit for residents of Ohio. As with the public records benefit provided to Virginia residents-and only Virginia residents-it does not \"prohibit[ ] access to an interstate market\" or \"impose[ ] burdensome regulation on that market.\"\n   <em>\n    McBurney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697042\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/221/#p235\">\n    569 U.S. at 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697042\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/221/#p235\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To reach a contrary decision, we would have to travel down the path of saying that all state policy benefits reserved for residents need to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   balancing because all in-state benefits potentially affect commerce by potentially affecting where people choose to live. That is a bridge too far. Policy incentives that entice residents to stay in a State do not impose a cognizable burden on any interstate market under the dormant Commerce Clause, as\n   <em>\n    McBurney\n   </em>\n   illustrates and as common sense intimates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Dr. Menendez adds one last point-that the tolling statute should be invalidated because it serves no useful purpose. Ohio has a valid long-arm statute, and he remains amenable to service under it. Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2307.382.\n   <em>\n    International Shoe\n   </em>\n   , he argues, thus has eclipsed any valid purpose once served by the law. But just because due process no longer stands as a barrier to haling an out-of-state defendant to court does not mean that practical challenges no longer exist. When an in-state defendant moves out of the State, as the facts of this case illustrate, the defendant \"remains potentially difficult to locate\" and\n   \"may not be so easy to find and serve.\"\n   <em>\n    G. D. Searle &amp; Co. v\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Cohn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11305830\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/404/#p410\">\n    455 U.S. 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 410,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11305830\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/404/#p410\">\n    102 S.Ct. 1137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11305830\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/404/#p410\">\n    71 L.Ed.2d 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982). The statute still benefits Ohio plaintiffs who wish to sue Ohio defendants who have left the State. That is enough of a local benefit to survive\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   review on this record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For these reasons, we reverse and remand the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
