The court rejected claims by two objectors, and they appealed. Exercising jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we reverse and remand. The district court failed to compute attorney fees under the lodestar method, as required by Oklahoma law in this diversity case, and the incentive award is unsupported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The underlying class action alleged underpayment of royalties by the defendants on gas from wells in Oklahoma. The parties reached a settlement for a cash payment of $52 million, to be distributed pro rata to the class members after payment of expenses and fees. Class counsel moved for attorney fees in the amount of 40% of the settlement fund, plus interest; and the lead plaintiff, Chieftain Royalty Company, requested an incentive award of 1% of the fund. Appellants Charles David Nutley and Danny George were class members who objected to these requests. After a hearing on the settlement and fee requests, the court awarded class counsel 33 ? % of the fund ($17,333.333.33) as attorney fees and awarded Chieftain \u00bd % of the fund ($260,000) as an incentive award. The objectors appealed each award. We address them in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ATTORNEY FEE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   There are two primary methods for determining attorney-fee awards in common-fund class-action cases. The first is the percentage-of-the-fund method, which awards class counsel a share of the benefit achieved for the class.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Newberg on Class Actions \u00a7 15:63 (5th ed. 2016) (Newberg). Many courts, including this circuit, consider 12 factors to determine the appropriate percentage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gottlieb v. Barry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306871\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/43/474/\">\n    43 F.3d 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 482 &amp; n.4 (10th Cir. 1994). These factors were first set forth in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"213570\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/488/714/#p717\">\n    488 F.2d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 717-19 (5th Cir. 1974), which was not a common-fund case. We have stated the factors as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the question presented by the case, the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly, the preclusion of other employment by the attorneys due to acceptance of the case, the customary fee, whether the fee is fixed or contingent, any time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances, the amount involved and the results obtained, the experience, reputation and ability of the attorneys, the \"undesirability\" of the case, the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client, and awards in similar cases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gottlieb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306871\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/43/474/\">\n    43 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   482 n.4. The second method is the lodestar approach. The court first determines the lodestar by multiplying the number of hours reasonably spent on the litigation by a reasonable hourly rate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anchondo v. Anderson, Crenshaw &amp; Assocs. L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049708\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/1098/#p1102\">\n    616 F.3d 1098\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1102 (10th Cir. 2010). This \"produces a presumptively reasonable fee,\" but it \"may in rare circumstances be adjusted to account for the presence of special circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049708\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/1098/#p1102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This court has approved both methods in common-fund cases, although expressing a preference for the percentage-of-the-fund approach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gottlieb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306871\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/43/474/\">\n    43 F.3d at 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In our circuit, following\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v.

Our approach also \"has been called a 'hybrid' approach, combining the percentage fee method with the specific factors traditionally used to calculate the lodestar.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 482-83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The district court chose the percentage-of-the-fund analysis, explaining that this is \"[t]he preferred method of determining a reasonable attorney fee award in common fund cases.\" JA at 523 (Dist. Ct. Order). It overruled the objectors' argument that the lodestar approach should govern and that the fee is excessive under that analysis. The court stated that \"[b]oth state and federal cases recognize and/or permit a percentage of fund recovery under the common fund doctrine.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It added that in any event, the result would not have differed under a lodestar analysis, citing Newberg on Class Actions \u00a7 14.6 at 551 (4th ed. 2002), for the proposition that empirical studies show that the average fee award is about one-third of the recovery, whichever method is used.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 524.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Although a contingency-fee agreement allowed class counsel to recover 40% of any common-fund recovery, the district court ruled that \"in fairness and consistent with the best interest of the Class,\" counsel should recover 33 ? % of the settlement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 523. It stated that an award of that percentage was not unusual, pointing out that \"[t]he Tenth Circuit has previously identified the typical fee range as 23.7% to 33.7%.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 526 (citing\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1309609\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/838/451/\">\n    838 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   455 n.2 ). It then recited the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   factors and found that \"most, if not all, ... support Class Counsel's fee request, as reduced by the Court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1309609\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/838/451/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Class Counsel has conducted the Litigation and achieved the Settlement with skill, perseverance and diligent advocacy;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The Litigation involved complex factual and legal issues and was actively prosecuted for over four years;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Had Class Counsel not achieved the Settlement, there would remain a significant risk that Class Representative and the other members of the Settlement Class may have recovered less or nothing from the Settling Parties;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Class Counsel devoted substantial time and resources to achieve the Settlement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1309609\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/838/451/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal numbering removed).

In this circuit we have used the labels\n   <em>\n    substantive\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    procedural\n   </em>\n   to classify the two types of fees.\n   <em>\n    Substantive fees\n   </em>\n   are those that \"are tied to the outcome of the litigation\" and\n   <em>\n    procedural fees\n   </em>\n   are those that are \"generally based on a litigant's bad faith conduct in litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Scottsdale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4101325\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/636/1273/#p1280\">\n    636 F.3d at 1279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These labels are shorthand for those attorney fees that are governed by\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   (substantive fees) and those that are not (procedural fees). Substantive fees are part and parcel of the cause of action over which we have diversity jurisdiction. For example, if the cause of action is for bad-faith denial of insurance coverage and state law authorizes an award of attorney fees to a successful insured, then the right to an award of attorney fees is part of the state substantive right and the federal court must recognize it. In contrast, an attorney-fee award against bad-faith conduct in the litigation has nothing to do with the nature of the cause of action and does not derive in any way from state substantive law. \"[F]ee-shifting here is not a matter of substantive remedy, but of vindicating judicial authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Chambers v.

And Wright &amp; Miller endorses the view that \"state law [is] controlling when it forbids an award of attorney's fees\" and that \"when state law provides for the recovery of an attorney's fee as a part of the claim being asserted[,] ... the federal court should permit an award of a fee on the theory that it is part of the substantive right in issue.\" 10 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R.

Moore's states, \"When state law controls, state law governs not only the right to fees\n   <em>\n    but also the method of calculating the fees\n   </em>\n   .\" Moore's \u00a7 124.07[3][b] (emphasis added). The calculation of attorney fees is considered substantive law because \"[t]he method of calculating a fee is an inherent part of the substantive right to the fee itself and reflects substantive state policy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11347051\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/851/456/#p475\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Here, the attorney-fee award was based on the outcome of the litigation not the district court's power to discipline the litigants. State law therefore governs the propriety of granting a fee award. And we must also apply the State's rules on how the amount of the fee is to be calculated because they are \"rules of decision by which [the] court will adjudicate [the] right[ ] [to the fee].\"\n   <em>\n    Murphree\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157402\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/438/#p446\">\n    326 U.S. at 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157402\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/438/#p446\">\n    66 S.Ct. 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After all, if there is no sufficient federal interest to override a state's decision not to allow common-fund attorney fees, it is hard to see how there could be a sufficient interest to override state law on how to compute the fee. To be sure, the ultimate standard for awarding a fee under either the lodestar or\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   methodology is whether the fee is reasonable, so one might argue that the method of calculation to determine reasonableness is merely a matter of procedure. But it is state substantive law that cabins the meaning of\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   . If state law declares that failure to wear a seatbelt while riding in a motor vehicle is never unreasonable (or is always unreasonable), there can be no question that a federal court hearing a common-law negligence claim in diversity must comply with that declaration. Similarly, a federal court in a diversity action must follow state law declaring that, absent extraordinary circumstances, a reasonable attorney fee is the fee computed under the lodestar method. We therefore see no reason to depart from what appears to be the consensus view that state law governs how to calculate a substantive attorney fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Chieftain nevertheless relies on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(h), which governs class actions in federal court, arguing that \"the\n   <em>\n    method\n   </em>\n   used to assess the reasonableness of [class counsel's] fee is a procedural matter governed by Rule 23(h), not state procedural law.\" Chieftain Br. at 18. We agree that this would be a more challenging issue if a federal rule of procedure said, for example, that fees should be calculated under the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   methodology. We would first have to determine whether the rule violated the prohibition in the Rules Enabling Act against rules that modify substantive rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202072\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). And then assuming (although, for reasons discussed above, we doubt the validity of the assumption) that the rule passed muster, we would probably have to apply it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shady Grove,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12447674,3582260\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/393/\">\n    559 U.S. at 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12447674,3582260\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/393/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But Rule 23(h) does not establish a rule of decision for assessing\n   attorney fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It provides that \"[i]n a certified class action, the court may award reasonable attorney's fees and nontaxable costs that are authorized by law or by the parties' agreement.\" And it outlines procedures to be followed before granting such an award: \"A claim for an award must be made by motion ... at a time the court sets\"; \"[n]otice of the motion must be served on all parties and, for motions by class counsel, directed to class members in a reasonable manner\"; \"[a] class member, or a party from whom payment is sought, may object to the motion\"; \"[t]he court may hold a hearing and must find the facts and state its legal conclusions....\"; and \"[t]he court may refer issues related to the amount of the award to a special master or a magistrate judge....\" In short, the rule addresses only how to conduct the court proceedings for determining the fee award. It does not provide any rules to guide the court on how to calculate the amount of the award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Thus, we turn to Oklahoma law to determine how to compute the attorney fee in this case.

One was the \"risk or burden\" Mr. Abernathy incurs as a result of his role as lead plaintiff. Counsel gave two examples. First, because he is litigating against a company called\n   Merit, \"he is not able to sit and talk to people at Merit like an ordinary royalty owner would because they know he's our client and they know he is in these cases, so he has to go through a little different procedure. And it's very difficult for [Mr. Abernathy] to just do basic deals at times compared to your average royalty owner.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 440. Second, during this litigation he could not talk to the law firm that ordinarily does his estate planning, because that firm represents defendants in the underlying action. Counsel added that \"there is a lot of hardship and risk when you're in the State of Oklahoma where a lot of the buildings downtown are oil and gas companies and you live here and you're going against them in several different cases in ways that they don't like.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Counsel for Chieftain also sought to justify an incentive award by describing Mr. Abernathy's contribution to the case-his services rendered- as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   He is a licensed attorney. He has represented to me that he spent somewhere around 200 to 300 hours working in this case. And I know that without looking at any-what he does every day. I know that he has been directly involved in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   His deposition was taken in this case. He attended, I believe, two of the depositions in this case. He helps us prepare for all kinds of things during the settlement process. He reviews the pleadings in this case.

He was telling me-I think it was last year he was in Fort Myers and a lady came up to him and said, Are you the Chieftain from\n   <em>\n    Chieftain vs. QEP\n   </em>\n   ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   He said, Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   She said, I want to give you a hug.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   He said, Why?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   She said, I got $40,000 in that case. Thank you for what you did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   So, you know, this isn't, as the objectors try to insinuate, some guy who is just out there and doesn't know what he is doing and letting the lawyers run amuck over him. He is a real active helpful client.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Also, in this case, because there is this future component, somebody has got to look out and see if the defendants are actually complying with their future benefits under the settlement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   And what we will do and what Mr. Abernathy will do is we will look at his statements every month. We will probably have Ms. Ley and class counsel look at them too. We will be doing this for the next three years to make sure that nothing changes on the way his payments are calculated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   We had an audit provision in the\n   <em>\n    QEP\n   </em>\n   case. We don't have it here. But, based on that experience, I think Mr. Abernathy would say-when we talked-it will probably be another 50 hours to 100 hours doing that over the next three years.

Br. (Nutley) at 27. But Nutley forfeited any argument about the general legality of incentive awards by failing to raise it below. We cannot find any indication in the record that Nutley raised this argument in district court. On the contrary, he stated in his written objection to\n   the award that incentive awards are sometimes proper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JA at 319 (Nutley's objection) (\"The concept of a service award is not unfamiliar in this Circuit, and may be appropriate when necessary to induce people to become named representatives, or to compensate personal risk or 'additional effort expended' by the representative in prosecuting the suit.\"). Nutley claims that he preserved this issue because \"[a]t the fairness hearing, [his] counsel challenged Chieftain's right to claim any award for Abernathy's time on the case.\" Aplt. Joint Reply Br. at 24-25. As that statement suggests, however, his counsel spoke at the fairness hearing only of the propriety of\n   <em>\n    Chieftain's\n   </em>\n   incentive award-not of the legality of these awards in general.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JA at 459-62 (Transcript of Fairness Hearing). And the district court made no ruling on the broader issue. Because this argument was forfeited, we can review only under the plain-error standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Richison v. Ernest Grp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4094416\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/634/1123/#p1130\">\n    634 F.3d 1123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1130 (10th Cir. 2011). But ordinarily we will not even do that unless the party specifically argues plain error in its briefs,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4094416\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/634/1123/#p1130\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4094416\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/634/1123/#p1130\">\n    at 1131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and Nutley's briefs made no such argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   We therefore turn to the specific award in this case. As stated above, Chieftain raised in district court two potential grounds for receiving an incentive award. One was the risk or burden incurred by Chieftain and Mr. Abernathy. Courts have recognized that an award may be appropriate to provide an incentive to act as a named plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Synthroid Mktg. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9484574\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/264/712/#p722\">\n    264 F.3d 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 722-23 (7th Cir. 2001) (\"Incentive awards are justified when necessary to induce individuals to become named representatives.... But if at least one [class member] would have stepped forward without the lure of an 'incentive award,' there is no need for such additional compensation.\");\n   <em>\n    Cook v. Niedert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219637\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/142/1004/#p1016\">\n    142 F.3d 1004\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1016 (7th Cir. 1998) (\"Because a named plaintiff is an essential ingredient of any class action, an incentive award is appropriate if it is necessary to induce an individual to participate in the suit.\"); Newberg \u00a7 17:3 (incentive awards can \"incentivize class members to step forward\" despite risks such as the possibility that the class representative could be liable for the costs of the suit or might face retaliation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The district court, however, did not justify the incentive award on the basis of any risk or burden incurred by Chieftain or Mr. Abernathy or on the need for an incentive for Chieftain to act as a named plaintiff. Indeed it made no findings on the subject. This is understandable, given (1) that the notice to the class stated that the requested incentive award would be compensation for time and effort (with no mention of risk or burden) and (2) that the presentation of risk and burden at the hearing on the award was quite weak.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Accordingly, there is no foundation for us to affirm, in whole or in part, the incentive award on this ground. The district court is free to decide in the first instance whether under the circumstances of this case-including the absence of an initial court finding on the matter-Chieftain should be given another opportunity on remand to make a better showing under the risk-or-burden rationale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Hence, we need analyze only Chieftain's second argument in support of an award-that it would fairly compensate for the services rendered by Mr. Abernathy. Our first task is to determine the governing law. We think it clear that, as with the attorney-fee award discussed above,\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   requires us to apply Oklahoma law. Unfortunately, the Oklahoma Supreme Court apparently has not addressed incentive fees, nor have we been directed to or found any opinions by lower courts of that state. Our task then is to make an informed prediction of what the State's highest court would do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Badger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4250841\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/818/563/#p568\">\n    818 F.3d 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 568-69 (10th Cir. 2016). When \"no state cases exist on a point, we turn to other state court decisions, federal decisions, and the general weight and trend of authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Sender v. Simon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6464695,1793567\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/84/1299/\">\n    84 F.3d 1299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1303 (10th Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). In conducting this analysis we have the advantage of a treatise on class actions that discusses and cites relevant judicial decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   To begin with, we note that courts regularly give incentive awards to compensate named plaintiffs for the work they performed-their time and effort invested in the case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cobell v. Salazar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3770537,7339202,3876895\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/679/909/\">\n    679 F.3d 909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 922-23 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (district court did not err in finding that lead plaintiff's \"singular, selfless, and tireless investment of time, energy, and personal funds to ensure survival of the litigation [merited] an incentive award\");\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v. West Publ'g Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237455\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/563/948/#p958\">\n    563 F.3d 948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 958 (9th Cir. 2009) (\"Incentive awards ... are intended to compensate class representatives for work done on behalf of the class....\"). These services typically include \"monitoring class counsel, being deposed by opposing counsel, keeping informed of the progress of the litigation, and serving as a client for purposes of approving any proposed settlement with the defendant.\" Newberg \u00a7 17:3. The award should be proportional to the contribution of the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phillips v. Asset Acceptance, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725968\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/1076/#p1081\">\n    736 F.3d 1076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1081 (7th Cir. 2013) (if the lead plaintiff's services are greater, her incentive award likely will be greater);\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237455\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/563/948/#p958\">\n    563 F.3d at 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (incentive award should not be \"untethered to any service or value [the lead plaintiff] will provide to the class\"); Newberg \u00a7 17:18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In our view, however, the Oklahoma Supreme Court would not approve the award given here. The district court granted Chieftain a \u00bd % incentive award of $260,000. Yet the weight of authority apparently disfavors percentage-based awards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Newberg \u00a7 17:16 (\"Percentage-based awards are disfavored, if not altogether forbidden.\"). There are several reasons to reject the practice. Most importantly, \"scaling those rewards according to the size of the common fund is at best a rough proxy in that the services and risks are not necessarily directly related to the size of the settlement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . In addition, percentage awards \"skew the class representatives' incentives by encouraging them\n   to hold out for greater recovery ... when in fact the class's interest would be best served by a settlement\"; \"percentage awards privilege monetary recoveries over other remedies, such as injunctive relief, creating a potential conflict between the interest of the class representative and the class\"; \"percentage awards threaten to be excessive\"; and \"paying the class representatives a portion of the settlement fund is simply unseemly: it gives the appearance that the representative is either a professional plaintiff, or bounty hunter, not a servant for the class.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (footnotes omitted). If a percentage calculation is to be made at all, it should be made only to \"check a flat award for excessiveness by reference to the percentage of the fund it represents.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237455\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/563/948/#p958\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   We therefore examine whether the award to Chieftain can be justified as payment at a reasonable rate for reasonable time expended on services rendered that were helpful to the litigation and did not duplicate what could be performed less expensively by counsel. Appellant George concedes that such payment would be proper.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aplt. Br. (George) at 30. And this approach to measuring the value of the work is consistent with the Oklahoma Supreme Court's lodestar approach to attorney-fee awards in common-fund cases. The question is what rate and what efforts are reasonable. The answer must be supported by sufficient evidence in the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219637\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/142/1004/#p1016\">\n    142 F.3d at 1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (upholding district court's incentive award after noting that findings justifying the award were \"well-supported by the evidence\").

The district court was not provided supporting documents either when deciding to grant the incentive award or when determining the amount of the award. Instead, as can be seen in the excerpt from the transcript above, counsel spoke broadly about the tasks Mr. Abernathy had performed in the case and offered an anecdote about a class member in a previous suit who was grateful for his work there. When discussing the time Mr. Abernathy had expended on the case, counsel did not provide detailed contemporaneous records but offered only approximations and generalities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JA at 438 (Transcript of Fairness Hearing) (\"[Mr. Abernathy] spent somewhere around 200\n   to 300 hours working in this case.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 439 (\"[I]t will probably be another 50 hours to 100 hours [of work for Mr. Abernathy] over the next three years.\").

The district court wrote: \"Objectors Danny George and Charles David Nutley objected to Class Counsel's fee request and the amount of fees requested on the grounds that Oklahoma law applies to Class Counsel's request, under Oklahoma law, a lodestar analysis is required, and the fees are excessive under either analysis.\" JA 523 (Dist. Ct. Order).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The treatise suggests that there may be some contrary authority, stating that \"cases have held that a federal judge has discretion to allow or disallow attorney fees, and have concluded that the judge's exercise of this discretion is not to be fettered by state doctrines relating to attorney's fees.\" 10 Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 2669 at 261-62. But the six cases cited for this proposition are distinguishable from our case. Two of the cases involved fee sanctions for bad-faith conduct in litigation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Chambers,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107845\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/32/#p55\">\n     501 U.S. at 45-46\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107845\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/32/#p55\">\n     111 S.Ct. 2123\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     Republic of Cape Verde v.

Nutley argues that Chieftain and class counsel have a longstanding arrangement of filing class actions together, that this \"produces a disabling conflict of interest that deprived the class of adequate representation,\" and that this \"should deprive Class Counsel of their right to demand a fee.\" Aplt. Br. (Nutley) at 58. We question whether this argument was preserved below. But in any event, this alleged relationship is not enough in itself to establish a disabling conflict.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    There was no assertion that Mr. Abernathy had been retaliated against or even ostracized as a result of serving as lead plaintiff. His inability to employ an attorney from the law firm of opposing counsel to assist him with his estate planning is hardly cause for a bonus. He did not say that he could not negotiate deals with energy companies; he complained only that he had to do it a little differently than other royalty owners might have to, and he provided no specifics on how this process was more time-consuming or expensive than the norm. And the court could give little weight to the bald statement that \"there is a lot of hardship and risk,\" JA at 440, to going against major companies in the state, particularly when counsel indicated that Mr. Abernathy is a respected and even beloved member of the community. Further, his company recovered unpaid royalties from the suit, which should be incentive enough for most plaintiffs, particularly when royalty litigation may be the business model for the company.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Robles v.

Jan. 31, 2011) (denying an incentive award in part because lead plaintiff \"offer[ed] no argument or evidence, competent or otherwise, that other class representative[s] were not forthcoming, and that an incentive award [was] justified for bringing a representative forward\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    We reject appellant Nutley's argument that Chieftain is not entitled to any incentive award at all. He states on appeal that \"Chieftain argued below that it should be compensated because Abernathy's work 'as an attorney, contributed to the prosecution and resolution of this case.' \" Aplt. Br. (Nutley) at 32 (quoting Fee Memorandum, JA 305). He contends that \"a litigant who is also an attorney is not entitled to collect attorneys' fees that might otherwise be authorized.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 33. And he says that \"seeking compensation\n    <em>\n     as an attorney\n    </em>\n    produces a conflict of interest sufficient to disable Chieftain from acting as an adequate representative for the class.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    We do not think Mr. Abernathy is seeking compensation for his legal work but, as we discuss below, the record does not contain sufficient evidence of what services he provided that entitle him to an award. Once this is established, the district court should determine in the first instance whether he can be compensated for any \"legal work\" and, if so, what the amount of compensation should be.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
