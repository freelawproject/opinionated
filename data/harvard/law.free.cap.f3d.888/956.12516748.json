Heritage Ins. Co. v. Asphalt Wizards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4288167\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/795/832/#p836\">\n    795 F.3d 832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 836-37 (8th Cir. 2015) ;\n   <em>\n    Depositors Ins.

Code Ann. \u00a7 27-67-214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) limits Southern's liability to maintain \"that part of the roadway between [its] tracks and to the end of the cross ties on each side,\" the case law interpreting the statute does not clearly indicate whether the area between the cross ties is covered.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Untiedt v.

The district court may need to predict how the Arkansas Supreme Court would interpret the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.
