The district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   granted Accounts Receivable's motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed Hill's complaint. Hill appeals, challenging the district court's interpretation of the Act. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On October 30, 2015, Accounts Receivable filed suit against Hill on an assigned debt from Allina Health System (Allina), seeking payment for unpaid medical services totaling $2,997.63 and for statutory interest under Minnesota Statutes \u00a7 334.01. During a hearing before the Conciliation Court for the Fourth Judicial District of Minnesota, Accounts Receivable submitted exhibits-the authenticity of which Hill challenged-purporting to document the assignment. The conciliation court ruled in favor of Hill and issued its judgment on a standard form, checking a box stating that \"Plaintiff has not demonstrated an entitlement to relief and recovers zero.\" The judgment contained no further legal analysis. Hill subsequently filed this action, alleging that Accounts Receivable's conduct before the conciliation court violated the Act. We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   the district court's ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This includes a prohibition on threatening \"to take any action that cannot legally be taken or that is not intended to be taken.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(5). Hill argues that the district court erred by applying a materiality standard to these provisions. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Hahn v. Triumph Partnerships LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3381986\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/557/755/\">\n    557 F.3d 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2009), the Seventh Circuit addressed whether a materiality standard applies to \u00a7 1692e. The court explained that the Act \"is designed to provide information that helps consumers to\n   choose intelligently, ... immaterial information neither contributes to that objective (if the statement is correct) nor undermines it (if the statement is incorrect).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3381986\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/557/755/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3381986\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/557/755/\">\n    at 757-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). The court reasoned that because \"[a] statement cannot mislead unless it is material, [ ] a false but non-material statement is not actionable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3381986\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/557/755/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3381986\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/557/755/\">\n    at 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Hill does not deny that his family received medical care from Allina or that Allina assigned the debt to Accounts Receivable. Instead, he argues that Accounts Receivable cannot \"acquir[e] documentation to establish its debt collection claims\" and that the documents submitted to the conciliation court contained a number of false statements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Hemmingsen v. Messerli &amp; Kramer, P.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049018\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/674/814/#p820\">\n    674 F.3d 814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 820 (8th Cir. 2012), we explained that a debt collector's loss of a collection action-standing alone-does not establish a violation of the Act. \"[T]he fact that a lawsuit turns out ultimately to be unsuccessful\" does not \"make the bringing of it an 'action that cannot legally be taken.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049018\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/674/814/#p820\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Heintz v.

Accounts Receivable's inadequate documentation of the assignment did not constitute a materially false representation, and the other alleged inaccuracies in the exhibits are not material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Hill also argues that Accounts Receivable violated the Act by engaging in unfair practices. Under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f, \"[a] debt collector may not use unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt.\" Included within that definition is \"[t]he collection of any amount ... unless such amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f(1). Hill argues that Accounts Receivable violated these provisions by attempting to collect interest under Minnesota Statutes \u00a7 549.09. Accounts Receivable's conciliation court complaint, however, sought interest under Minnesota Statutes \u00a7 334.01. Whether \u00a7 334.01 applies to Accounts Receivable's conciliation court claim is a question of Minnesota law that has not been decided by the Minnesota Supreme Court.\n   <em>\n    Hogenson v. Hogenson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6925004\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/852/266/#p272\">\n    852 N.W.2d 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 272-74 (Minn. Ct. App. 2014). Furthermore, the text of \u00a7 334.01 does not prohibit Accounts Receivable from recovering such interest. That Hill may have had a valid legal defense to the\n   application of the statute does not mean that Accounts Receivable attempted to collect interest that is not permitted by law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    The Honorable Donovan W. Frank, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    Hill disputes the following: (1) although the conciliation court complaint alleged that Hill owed $3,687.62 on an account stated, that amount included statutory interest that would not have been on the account stated Hill received; (2) one of the documents submitted to the conciliation court falsely stated that Accounts Receivable is a division of Allina; (3) two documents stated that the assignment was \"hereby\" made from Allina to Accounts Receivable, which could not be true because only one document could assign the rights; and (4) one document stated that Accounts Receivable was to \"select an experienced agency to pursue collection of the accounts,\" which it did not do.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
