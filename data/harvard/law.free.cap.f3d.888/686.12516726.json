If the ALJ cannot make a conclusive determination at the end of the third step, the ALJ must then determine the claimant's residual function capacity, meaning the most a claimant can still do despite \"all of the claimant's medically determinable impairments of which the ALJ is aware, including those not labeled severe at step two.\"\n   <em>\n    Mascio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4074218\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/632/#p634\">\n    780 F.3d at 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4) ; 404.1545(a). Only once the ALJ has identified the claimant's \"functional limitations or restrictions\" and assessed the claimant's \"work-related abilities on a function-by-function basis\" may the ALJ express the claimant's residual function capacity \"in terms of the exertional levels of work, sedentary, light, medium, heavy, and very heavy.\" SSR 96-8p,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20Fed.%20Reg.%2034%2C474\">\n    61 Fed.

In 2010, Woods began exhibiting symptoms consistent with inflammatory arthritis, osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia. She also began complaining of persistent pain that limited her ability to perform her job. Her symptoms progressed over the next three years, and in April 2013, Woods stopped working. The next month, Woods applied for Social Security disability insurance benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The SSA initially denied her application and her petition for reconsideration. Woods then requested a hearing before an ALJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Before the ALJ, Woods presented medical records from Dr. Aasheim (her primary care physician), Dr. de Wit (her rheumatologist through January 2013), and a prior decision by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (\"NCDHHS\") that found that Woods was disabled and entitled to Medicaid benefits. The ALJ also reviewed the opinions of Drs. Burgess and Pardoll, who conducted consultative examinations at NCDHHS's request, and Dr. Clayton, the state agency medical consultant who reviewed Woods's medical record but did not treat or examine her in person. In addition, Woods submitted disability questionnaires and testified before the ALJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We briefly summarize the relevant evidence from each source.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Beginning in 2010, Drs. de Wit and Aasheim documented various symptoms consistent with inflammatory arthritis, osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia. In early 2013, both doctors concluded that because of her condition, Woods \"should not do heavy manual labor\" as required by her current job. In November 2013, Dr. Aasheim concluded that Woods could occasionally lift up to ten pounds but frequently could not lift any weight, she could stand one of eight hours, could sit one of eight hours, and could occasionally balance independently, but could not climb, stoop, crouch, kneel, or crawl.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 The NCDHHS decision found that Woods was eligible to receive Medicaid. The state hearing officer noted that Woods had several positive laboratory results and physical exams that supported her claims of pain. That officer also found that Woods's testimony at the state hearing was \"wholly credible and substantiated the alleged disabilities.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Dr. Burgess, who conducted a physical consultation, concluded that Woods's \"ability to perform work-related activities such as bending, stooping, lifting, walking, crawling, squatting, carrying, traveling, pushing and pulling heavy objects ... appears to be mildly to moderately impaired.... Claimant's insight into and description of limitations appears not inconsistent with the objective findings.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Dr. Pardoll, who conducted a psychological consultation, found that although Woods has \"few mental health symptoms that interfere with her social and occupational functioning,\" it did not \"appear that she would be able to tolerate the stressors and pressures associated with a day to day work activity since she is experiencing a lot of pain.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Dr. Clayton, the state agency's non-treating, non-examining consultant, found Woods's \"[a]llegations and statements ... partially credible,\" but concluded that the \"evidence does not support the level of limitations alleged.\" He also concluded that Woods could occasionally lift 50 pounds and frequently lift 25 pounds, and could stand or sit for six hours of an eight-hour workday. Thus, he found that Woods could perform medium work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Woods wrote in her disability questionnaires that her typical activities varied daily depending on her pain. For example, although she could \"prepare simple meals,\" it was difficult to \"cut, chop, or dice.\" Woods also testified before the ALJ that she could lift approximately three to four pounds, could comfortably sit or stand for 20 minutes, walked with a limp and otherwise had poor balance and stumbled frequently, and had limited grip strength and dropped things \"consistently.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After reviewing the evidence, the ALJ found that Woods did not meet the legal definition of \"disabled\" and denied her claim for Social Security disability insurance benefits. At step one, the ALJ found that Woods was not employed since her onset date. At step two, he concluded that her impairments were \"severe.\" Because her impairments did not meet the requirements of step three, the ALJ proceeded to the residual function capacity assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The ALJ began his assessment of Woods's residual function capacity by summarizing the relevant medical evidence. For example, the ALJ found that certain tests showed only \"mild degenerative changes\" and that some reports indicated that Woods did not display other typical signs of her alleged impairments, such as swollen joints. The ALJ then concluded that Woods's \"medically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to cause the alleged symptoms,\" but that her \"statements concerning the intensity, persistent and limiting effects of these symptoms are not entirely credible.\" In support of this adverse credibility finding, the ALJ noted that Woods's \"daily activities are not those typically associated with an individual alleging the pain, severity, and limitations as posed by the claimant.\" The ALJ also identified the relative weight he accorded to the various medical experts: great weight to Dr. Clayton, some-to-great weight to Dr. Pardoll, some weight to Dr. Burgess, little weight to Drs. Aasheim and de Wit, and little weight to the NCDHHS decision. Based on this evidence, the ALJ found-consistent with Dr. Clayton's opinion-that Woods had the residual function capacity to perform \"medium work\" (subject to certain exceptions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At step four, the ALJ concluded that Woods \"is capable of performing past relevant work in production of manufacturing textiles,\" as that work \"does not require the performance of work-related activities precluded by\" her residual function capacity. At step five, he found that \"other jobs exist[ ] in the national economy that [Woods] is also able to perform,\" like janitorial work. The ALJ therefore concluded that Woods did not meet the legal definition of \"disabled\" and denied her application for benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After exhausting her administrative appeals, Woods filed this action against the Acting Commissioner of Social Security. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and a magistrate judge recommended granting the Commissioner's motion, denying Wood's motion, and affirming the denial of benefits. The district court adopted this recommendation in full. Woods now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   a district court's grant of summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

First, the Commissioner suggests that the NCDHHS hearing officer did not actually consider the \"same underlying evidence\" as the ALJ because the state hearing officer's report did not discuss Dr. Clayton's opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bird\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3632287\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/699/337/#p340\">\n    699 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   343 ; Appellee Br. at 15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Of course, where a prior decision does not rely on substantially the same underlying evidence, such as where a state issued its disability decision a number of years before the claimant applied for Social Security disability insurance benefits, the state decision may not be entitled to substantial weight. If that is the case, however, the ALJ must explain these facts. The ALJ's opinion here never mentioned this alleged issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Second, the Commissioner argues that because the ALJ's decision as a whole makes clear that he considered the same evidence on which the NCDHHS decision relied, the ALJ did not need to refer expressly to that evidence in discussing the NCDHHS decision. We cannot agree. It\n   may well be that the ALJ considered this evidence in deciding\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   which doctors and evidence to credit\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   whether the NCDHHS decision deserved substantial weight. But meaningful review cannot rest on such guesswork.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeLoatche\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1882178\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/715/148/\">\n    715 F.2d at 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It may be, of course, as the Secretary suggests on appeal, that the ALJ considered all of these factors and proposed to himself cogent reasons for disregarding them. However, on this record we cannot so determine.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We therefore conclude that the ALJ erred in failing to adequately explain why he accorded the prior NCDHHS disability decision less than substantial weight. For this reason, we must vacate the decision and remand the case to the ALJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Woods raises several other challenges to the ALJ's decision. Because these issues may recur on remand, we address them now.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bird\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3632287\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/699/337/#p340\">\n    699 F.3d at 342-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   First, Woods contends that the ALJ did not adequately perform the residual function capacity assessment. In performing this assessment, an ALJ \"must include a narrative discussion describing how the evidence supports each conclusion, citing specific medical facts (e.g., laboratory findings) and nonmedical evidence (e.g., daily activities, observations).\"\n   <em>\n    Mascio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4074218\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/632/#p634\">\n    780 F.3d at 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting SSR 96-8p,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20Fed.%20Reg.%2034%2C474\">\n    61 Fed. Reg. at 34,478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, the ALJ must\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   identify evidence that supports his conclusion\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   \"build an accurate and logical bridge from [that] evidence to his conclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Monroe v. Colvin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324803\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/176/#p189\">\n    826 F.3d 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 189 (4th Cir. 2016) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Clifford v.

The ALJ concluded that Woods could perform \"medium work\" and summarized evidence that he found credible, useful, and consistent. But the ALJ never explained how he concluded-\n   <em>\n    based on this evidence\n   </em>\n   -that Woods could actually perform the tasks required by \"medium work,\" such as lifting up to 50 pounds at a time, frequently lifting or carrying up to 25 pounds, or standing or walking for six hours.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SSR 83-10,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1983%20WL%2031251\">\n    1983 WL 31251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (Jan. 1, 1983). The ALJ therefore failed to build an \"accurate and logical bridge\" from the evidence he recounted to his conclusion about Woods's residual function capacity. On remand, the ALJ should remedy this error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Woods also contends that the ALJ erred in finding Woods not credible because her \"daily activities are not those typically associated with an individual alleging the pain, severity, and limitations as posed by the claimant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   An ALJ may not consider the\n   <em>\n    type\n   </em>\n   of activities a claimant can perform without also considering the\n   <em>\n    extent\n   </em>\n   to which she can perform them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Commissioner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263940\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/251/#p263\">\n    873 F.3d 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 263 (4th Cir. 2017). The ALJ here did just that. For example, the ALJ noted that Woods can \"maintain her personal hygiene, cook, perform light household chores,\" \"shop,\" \"socialize with family members, and attend church services on a regular basis.\" But the ALJ did not consider Woods's statements that she cannot button her clothes, has trouble drying herself after bathing, and sometimes needs help holding a hairdryer; that she can prepare simple meals but has trouble cutting, chopping, dicing, and holding silverware or cups; it takes her all day to do laundry; she shops only for necessities, and that process takes\n   longer than normal; when she reads to her grandchildren, they have to turn the pages because of severe pain in her hands; and that some days, she spends the entire day on the couch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   On remand, the ALJ should consider not just the\n   <em>\n    type\n   </em>\n   of Woods's daily activities, but also the\n   <em>\n    extent\n   </em>\n   to which she can perform them in assessing her credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Finally, we note two additional problems with the ALJ's analysis as it pertains to his weighting of the various medical opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   An ALJ must include \"a narrative discussion describing how the evidence supports\" his \"explanation of the varying degrees of weight he gave to differing opinions concerning [the claimant's] conditions and limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    Monroe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324803\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/176/#p189\">\n    826 F.3d at 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In this case, the ALJ's discussion of certain expert opinions was at times conclusory or sparse. For example, the ALJ gave Dr. Burgess's opinion \"some weight\" because \"it is rather vague and general in nature,\" but did not discuss what aspects of that opinion he found overly vague.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324803\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/176/#p189\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324803\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/176/#p189\">\n    at 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding insufficient the explanation that the \"consultative examiner opinion is consistent with the objective evidence and other opinions of record\" even though the ALJ had recounted various medical evidence earlier in his opinion). On remand, we caution the ALJ to provide better explanations in support of these types of determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   We are also skeptical about the ALJ's rationale for according great weight to the opinion of Dr. Clayton-who did not personally examine or treat Woods-while at the same time discounting the opinions of the doctors who did examine and treat her. In general, an ALJ should accord \"more weight to medical opinions from [a claimant's] treating sources, since these sources are likely to be the medical professionals most able to provide a detailed, longitudinal picture of [a claimant's] medical impairment(s).\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 404.1527(c)(1) (stating the same presumption for examining sources). An ALJ may, however, credit the opinion of a non-treating, non-examining source where that opinion has sufficient indicia of \"supportability in the form of a high-quality explanation for the opinion and a significant amount of substantiating evidence, particularly medical signs and laboratory findings; consistency between the opinion and the record as a whole; and specialization in the subject matter of the opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263940\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/251/#p263\">\n    873 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   268 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   It is not clear to us that Dr. Clayton's opinion satisfies this standard. For example, Dr. Clayton concluded that Woods could lift up to 50 pounds (something none of her treating physicians believed she was capable of), but failed to explain\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   he arrived at that specific number. The same is true of his conclusion that Woods can sit or stand for six hours in an eight-hour workday. As the ALJ himself acknowledged, these conclusions conflict with the opinions of Drs. Burgess, de Wit, Aasheim, and with Woods's own testimony. Nor is there any evidence in the record that Dr. Clayton is a specialist and therefore due additional deference. The ALJ should consider these potential shortcomings on remand in deciding what weight to accord the opinion of Dr. Clayton, and any other non-treating, non-examining physicians.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand the case with instructions to vacate the denial of benefits and remand for further\n   administrative proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    This regulation only applies to claims filed before March 27, 2017.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%205%2C844\">\n     82 Fed.
