Caribbean, which operates the Burger King franchise throughout Puerto Rico, had previously employed Sep\u00falveda as an assistant manager. In 2011, while Sep\u00falveda was attempting to make a bank deposit on behalf of Caribbean, he was attacked at gunpoint, hit over the head, and had his car stolen. He suffered, as a result, from post-traumatic stress disorder and major depression disorder. In response to these diagnoses, Sep\u00falveda requested that Caribbean provide him with a fixed work schedule (as opposed to a rotating one) and that it move him to a Burger King location in an area not prone to crime. That is, Sep\u00falveda asked Caribbean, which schedules all of its managers such that they rotate among three distinct work shifts (one from 6:00am to 4:00pm, another from 10:00am to 8:00pm, and the last from 8:00pm to 6:00am), to assign him to one specific timeslot consistently. While Caribbean initially acquiesced to this request, it thereafter informed Sep\u00falveda that he would have to go back to working rotating shifts. Eventually, in 2013, Sep\u00falveda resigned from his position with Caribbean.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the district court below, Sep\u00falveda argued that although Caribbean recognized he was disabled within the definition of the ADA, it (1) failed to reasonably accommodate him by permanently providing him with a fixed work schedule as opposed to one comprised of rotating shifts and (2) that employees of Caribbean engaged in a series of retaliatory actions against him as a result of his request for a reasonable accommodation, thus creating a hostile work environment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court weighed both sides' arguments, ultimately concluding that Sep\u00falveda was not a \"qualified individual\" under the ADA and that the supposedly retaliatory acts comprising his hostile work environment claim were insufficient to support his claim. It\n   therefore granted Caribbean's summary judgment motion, a decision from which Sep\u00falveda appeals. We now affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Reviewing the grant of summary judgment de novo, we construe the record in the light most favorable to the non-movant, resolving all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Coca-Cola Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3760446\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/522/168/#p175\">\n    522 F.3d 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 175 (1st Cir. 2008).

The district court's focus below (and the parties' focus in their briefs on appeal) revolves around the second of those three factors, namely, whether in light of Sep\u00falveda's requested accommodation to be assigned fixed shifts he was still qualified to perform the essential job functions required of Caribbean assistant managers. An essential function is one that is \"fundamental\" to a position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kvorjak\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9498111\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/48/#p55\">\n    259 F.3d 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 55 (1st Cir. 2001). \"The term does not include 'marginal' tasks, but may encompass 'individual or idiosyncratic characteristics' of the job.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9498111\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/48/#p55\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mass.

Unsurprisingly, we have explained that \"the complex question of what constitutes an essential job function involves fact-sensitive considerations and must be determined on a case-by-case basis.\"\n   <em>\n    Gillen\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fallon Ambulance Serv., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508706\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/283/11/#p25\">\n    283 F.3d 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 25 (1st Cir. 2002). In making this case-by-case determination, the ADA instructs us to give consideration \"to the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012111\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8). And the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (\"EEOC\") implementing regulations of the Act further tell us that beyond the employer's judgment, things to be considered include (but are not limited to) factors like \"[t]he consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function[,]\" \"[t]he work experience of past incumbents in the job[,]\" and \"[t]he current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201630.2\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (n)(3). Such considerations are not meant \"to enable courts to second-guess legitimate business judgments, but, rather, to ensure that an employer's asserted requirements are solidly anchored in the realities of the workplace, not constructed out of whole cloth.\"\n   <em>\n    Gillen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508706\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/283/11/#p25\">\n    283 F.3d at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Here, the district court fully considered these factors and concluded that being able to work rotating shifts was an essential function of the assistant manager job with Caribbean. First, the court pointed\n   out that it was uncontested that from Caribbean's perspective, the ability to work rotating shifts was essential. Indeed, Caribbean explained that rotating shifts were necessary for the equal distribution of work among the managerial staff and Sep\u00falveda conceded this point in his deposition. That is to say, accommodating Sep\u00falveda permanently would have had the adverse impact of inconveniencing all other assistant managers who would have to work unattractive shifts in response to Sep\u00falveda's fixed schedule. We have previously explained that such \"idiosyncratic characteristics as scheduling flexibility\" should be considered when determining the essentiality of a job function.\n   <em>\n    Calero-Cerezo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Dep't of Justice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9057520\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/355/6/#p22\">\n    355 F.3d 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 22 (1st Cir. 2004) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Laurin\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Providence Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1540684\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/150/52/\">\n    150 F.3d 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Cir. 1998).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court also explained that Sep\u00falveda admitted in his deposition that rotating shifts was a responsibility he had at Caribbean and that this was the case for all other assistant managers. Moreover, the court noted that the job application Sep\u00falveda filled out and signed when he was hired made clear that all Caribbean managerial employees had to be able to work different shifts in different restaurants. And it pointed to a newspaper advertisement for the job that listed the need to work rotating shifts as a requirement. While the court did note that Caribbean initially granted Sep\u00falveda the accommodation on a temporary basis, that fact did \"not mean that it conceded that rotating shifts was a 'non-essential' function.\"\n   <em>\n    Sep\u00falveda-Vargas\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Caribbean Restaurants LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. CV 13-1622 (SEC),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208710980\">\n    2016 WL 8710980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (D.P.R. Sept. 30, 2016). And we agree. \"To find otherwise would unacceptably punish employers from doing more than the ADA requires, and might discourage such an undertaking on the part of employers.\"\n   <em>\n    Phelps\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Optima Health, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11092309\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/251/21/#p26\">\n    251 F.3d 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26 (1st Cir. 2001).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As for Sep\u00falveda's retaliation claim, the ADA forbids retaliation \"against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful ... or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under [the ADA].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012203\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These sorts of claims \"may succeed even where [a] disability claim fails.\"\n   <em>\n    Valle-Arce\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    P.R.

To establish a prima facie claim of retaliation, it is incumbent for a plaintiff to show that he was engaged in protected conduct, that he was subject to an adverse employment action, and that there was a causal connection between the adverse employment action and the conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Freadman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Metro.

Not all retaliatory actions, however, suffice to meet the ADA's anti-retaliation provision. Rather, \"a plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Carmona-Rivera\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Puerto Rico\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3729570\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/464/14/#p20\">\n    464 F.3d 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 20 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry.

As for Sep\u00falveda's argument that making a temporary change to his schedule so that he could attend a required managers' seminar was an adverse action, the district court explained that even if \"[the supervisor's] approach [by saying he didn't believe Sep\u00falveda had an ailment] may have been somewhat rude or insensitive, 'a supervisor's unprofessional managerial approach and accompanying efforts to assert her authority are not the focus of the discrimination laws.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Lee-Crespo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Schering-Plough Del Caribe Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9293180\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/354/34/#p47\">\n    354 F.3d 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 47 (1st Cir. 2003) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Col\u00f3n-Font\u00e1nez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3843394\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/660/17/#p36\">\n    660 F.3d at 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that accusations of being a \"hypochondriac\" and \"faking it\" though uncomfortable \"do not rise to the level of severity or pervasiveness\" to sustain a retaliation claim). The court also rejected Sep\u00falveda's assertion that he was forced, on one occasion, to pull down his pants to reveal a medical skin condition. Not only did Sep\u00falveda fail to \"provide sufficient details surrounding this incident,\" but he additionally failed to demonstrate how he was \"forced\" to do so or \"explain how his supervisor's disbelief regarding a condition for which he had requested no accommodation nor provided any medical evidence before was related to a protected activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Sep\u00falveda-Vargas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208710980\">\n    2016 WL 8710980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. The court next rejected Sep\u00falveda's notion that being called a \"cry baby\" was an adverse action. Sep\u00falveda alleged that he was told by one employee that she had heard someone else call him a \"cry baby\" and further alleged that he had personally heard two other employees call him the same. The court rejected the first allegation as hearsay within hearsay. As for the latter two, it explained that while \"it is unclear whether these statements were related to a protected activity or to some other workplace issue,\" even assuming it was connected to a protected event, \"[t]he case law is clear that 'simple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious)' do not amount to adverse employment action, not even to establish an objectively hostile or abusive work environment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208710980\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Col\u00f3n-Font\u00e1nez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3843394\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/660/17/#p36\">\n    660 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   44 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The remaining assertions by Sep\u00falveda regarding supposed adverse actions were all determined to be similarly unmeritorious. The court concluded that Caribbean's placement of Sep\u00falveda on forced paid vacation was not adverse, particularly where it was mandated because Sep\u00falveda had an expired health certificate and Caribbean could get in trouble with the Puerto Rico Department of Health if Sep\u00falveda did not pass the required examinations for the certificate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7-8. And the fact that Sep\u00falveda was on one occasion told to stay past his shift's end until\n   11:00pm and was reprimanded when he defied the instruction was also not tantamount to an adverse employment action. The restaurant Sep\u00falveda worked at had been closed by the Puerto Rico Department of Health due to a cockroach infestation and Caribbean required all managers to stay late on that occasion to ensure the restaurant was properly cleaned. This in and of itself is not adverse and, to the extent Sep\u00falveda may have been treated especially harshly for defying the instruction to stay until 11:00pm, the court noted that he \"provide[d] no details regarding the severity of the alleged admonishment and his disciplinary record was not affected.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Next, the court explained that though \"Sep\u00falveda timidly floats the idea that he was subject to differential treatment in working hours' requirements, in labor assignment, in understaffing of the shift he supervised, [and] in being subject to constant verbal warnings ... he references fifty paragraphs of his additional statement of uncontested facts without even bothering to specify which paragraphs contain the relevant facts as to each of the four types of disparate treatment alleged therein.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Not just that, but he also \"fail[ed] to discuss any case law to support his contention.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court thus found the argument waived.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, to the extent Sep\u00falveda argued the actions should be considered materially adverse when looked at together rather than individually, (thus comprising a hostile work environment), the court concluded otherwise, explaining that \"[c]ollectively, these incidents amount to nothing more than the petty insults and minor annoyances which are insufficient to constitute an adverse employment action under the ADA.... Drawing all reasonable inference in his favor, Sep\u00falveda did not demonstrate from an objective standpoint, that Caribbean's actions were sufficiently severe or pervasive to sustain a retaliatory hostile work environment, and so it fails.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Col\u00f3n-Font\u00e1nez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3843394\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/660/17/#p36\">\n    660 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   36-37 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Our de novo standard of review fails to yield any genuine issue of material fact that would lead us to draw a conclusion that differs from the district court. Because the court below got it right, we need not say anymore on the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Sep\u00falveda also originally brought separate claims of discrimination under Puerto Rico law. Because the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Caribbean on the both of the federal ADA claims, it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining Puerto Rico-based claims and dismissed those without prejudice. Sep\u00falveda makes no challenge here to their dismissal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    On appeal, Sep\u00falveda argues that the district court's reliance on\n    <em>\n     Laurin\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Providence Hospital\n    </em>\n    was erroneous because that case was decided on materially distinguishable facts.\n    <em>\n     Laurin\n    </em>\n    involved a hospital's rotating shifts requirement for nurses working in a 24-hour maternity ward.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3843394\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/660/17/#p36\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3843394\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/660/17/#p36\">\n     at 59\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Given that setting, we had little difficulty in concluding that the rotating shifts requirement was essential. As we explained, \"[m]edical needs and emergencies ... do not mind the clock, let alone staff-nurse convenience,\" and \"to suggest otherwise would be tantamount to maintaining that night work is not an 'essential function' of a night watchman's job, even though that is the only time the premises are not otherwise occupied.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Though we agree with Sep\u00falveda that\n    <em>\n     Laurin\n    </em>\n    provides a more clear cut example of an \"essential\" rotating shifts requirement, the district court's citation to the case does not undermine its otherwise sound conclusion that Caribbean's rotating shifts requirement was also an essential job function.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Oddly, Sep\u00falveda seems to think that\n    <em>\n     Phelps\n    </em>\n    is inapplicable to the instant case because it relied in part on the logic of a Seventh Circuit case,\n    <em>\n     Basith\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Cook County\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11139656\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/241/919/\">\n     241 F.3d 919\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (7th Cir. 2001), that has slightly distinguishable facts from the those found here. This argument is strange to us;\n    <em>\n     Phelps\n    </em>\n    says what it says and, regardless of the underlying facts of a Seventh Circuit case cited in\n    <em>\n     Phelps\n    </em>\n    , we see no reason how its general admonishment against punishing an employer for going above and beyond that required under the ADA is irrelevant to the case at hand. But, for the sake of thoroughness, we will briefly entertain Sep\u00falveda's argument. At core, Sep\u00falveda appears to believe the following. In\n    <em>\n     Basith\n    </em>\n    , an employer granted an accommodation purportedly requested by an employee under the ADA. In doing so, however, the employer stated, \"[a]lthough this is a change in the job functions, which is not required, I will agree to it.\"\n    <em>\n     Basith\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11139656\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/241/919/\">\n     241 F.3d at 930\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . That is, the employer knew the employee was not a \"qualified individual\" under the ADA and chose to make a temporary accommodation for him in spite of this fact. Because, here, Caribbean's impetus for granting the temporary accommodation was its mistaken belief that it was required to do so by the ADA, Sep\u00falveda believes (for reasons that are unclear) that this renders the logic of Basith and\n    <em>\n     Phelps\n    </em>\n    irrelevant. Not so. Sep\u00falveda cites no case (and we can find none) that requires this kind of \"intent to go above and beyond the ADA\" in order to apply the logic of\n    <em>\n     Phelps\n    </em>\n    and, importantly, we provided no such caveat when we decided\n    <em>\n     Phelps\n    </em>\n    . To the contrary, this Court only held that evidence of non-required accommodations will not be used against a company in determining what is or isn't an essential job function, without mention of whether the employer meant to go above and beyond the ADA.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
