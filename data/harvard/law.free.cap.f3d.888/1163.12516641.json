In the shipment of freight interstate it and other rail carriers compete against trucking transport companies (motor carriers) and commercial ships, vessels, and barges (water carriers). Yet Alabama taxes each type of carrier differently on the purchase or use of diesel fuel inside the state.

Instead, it is a flat-rate, 4% general tax imposed without reference to burdens generated by the activity and borne by the State.

As a result, the\n   <em>\n    Oregon Waste\n   </em>\n   Court's conjecture that a cost disparity might justify a proportionally disparate \"cost-based surcharge\" does not mean that one might justify exempting water carriers from a flat-rate tax of general applicability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Because the sales and use tax does not account for the relative burdens imposed by taxpayers, and because dicta from the dormant Commerce Clause decision in\n   <em>\n    Oregon Waste\n   </em>\n   does not control the result in this 4-R Act case, the State's \"disparate burdens\" argument does not justify the water carrier exemption.
