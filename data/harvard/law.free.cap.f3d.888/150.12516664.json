In accordance with a written plea agreement under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C), Salas is serving a 288-month sentence for trafficking in cocaine and heroin. None of Salas's proposed claims are based on newly discovered evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2255(h)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In pertinent part, Salas asserts that he is entitled to relief under\n   <em>\n    Burrage v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12585952,12701986\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/881/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12585952,12701986\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/881/\">\n    187 L.Ed.2d 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). In\n   <em>\n    Burrage\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that, in order to apply the mandatory sentence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(C) for a death resulting from the defendant's drug trafficking, it is necessary to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the death would not have occurred \"but for\" the defendant's conduct.\n   <em>\n    Burrage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12585952,12701986\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/881/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 887-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However,\n   <em>\n    Burrage\n   </em>\n   was decided on direct appeal, and nothing suggests that the Supreme Court has made\n   <em>\n    Burrage\n   </em>\n   retroactive to cases on collateral review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2255(h)(2). Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    Burrage\n   </em>\n   the Court was interpreting a statute, \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), and did not announce a new rule of constitutional law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burrage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12585952,12701986\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/881/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   885-92 ;\n   <em>\n    Santillana v. Upton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12132936\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/779/#p783\">\n    846 F.3d 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 783 (5th Cir. 2017) (addressing savings clause issue and concluding that\n   <em>\n    Burrage\n   </em>\n   was a new rule of\n   statutory law). Salas fails to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 2255(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   IT IS ORDERED that Salas's motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
