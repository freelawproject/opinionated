A year later, after notice and comment, the Commission issued an order approving the Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Georgia Republican Party, the New York Republican State Committee, and the Tennessee Republican Party filed a petition challenging the Commission's order. They contend that the Commission lacked the authority to approve Rule 2030 and that the Rule violates the First Amendment. We, however, are unable to consider the petition's merits because the Georgia Party does not have standing to challenge the Rule and this Court is not the proper venue for either the New York Committee or the Tennessee Party. As a result, we dismiss the Georgia Party for lack of jurisdiction, and transfer the appeal of the remaining two parties to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2010, the Commission enacted rules generally prohibiting investment advisors from \"provid[ing] investment advisory services for compensation to a government entity within two years after a contribution to an official of the government entity.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20275.206\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 275.206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4)-5(a)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041018\">\n    75 Fed.

The Party asserts that, because Rule 2030 prohibits placement agents from \"solicit[ing] or coordinat[ing]\" to make any \"[p]ayment to a political party of a state ... with which the covered member is engaging in, or seeking to engage in, distribution or solicitation activities on behalf of an investment adviser,\" the Rule will necessarily harm the Party's fundraising because some placement agents will not be able to contribute to the Party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Georgia Party, however, does not provide sufficient evidence to support its assertions. The Party's only evidence is the affidavit of J. Adam Pipkin, the Georgia Party's Executive Director. Mr. Pipkin's affidavit states broadly that those regulated by Rule 2030 \"will be ... limited\n   in their ability to contribute to the Georgia Republican Party\" and that the Rule \"will significantly hinder the state party.\" Mr. Pipkin does not assert that he himself would like to contribute to the Georgia Party but has decided not to do so because of Rule 2030. He does not identify another person who wishes to contribute but will not because of the Rule. And he does not offer any factual support for his general assertion that the Georgia Party will be \"significantly hinder[ed]\" in some way. In other words, the affidavit offers no facts to show that the Georgia Party's fundraising will actually be harmed. The affidavit's generalized \"[a]llegations of\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   future injury,\" without factual support, \"are not sufficient\" to establish \"\n   <em>\n    certainly impending\n   </em>\n   \" injury.\n   <em>\n    Clapper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n    568 U.S. at 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration and emphases in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Whitmore v.

Injury based on the diversion of the Georgia Party's resources\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Georgia Party also argues that it is harmed because it must divert resources from its core mission to advise state and local officeholders about the impact of Rule 2030 on their ability to fundraise. We have recognized that an \"organization has standing to sue on its own behalf if the defendant's illegal acts impair its ability to engage in its projects by forcing the organization to divert resources to counteract those illegal acts.\"\n   <em>\n    Ga. Latino Alliance for Human Rights v.

Because the Georgia Party offers no facts whatsoever to support this theory, it necessarily fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   3. Injury to the Georgia Party's members\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, the Georgia Party contends that it has standing because its members have standing. \"An association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right, the interests at stake are germane to the organization's purpose, and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p180\">\n    528 U.S. at 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p180\">\n    120 S.Ct. 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, members who are placement agents directly regulated by Rule 2030 face consequences for making contributions to certain candidates. Second, members who are state and local officials are inhibited by Rule 2030 from receiving such contributions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Yet, once again, the Georgia Party has failed to allege that a specific member will be injured by the rule, and it certainly offers no evidence to support such an allegation. Mr. Pipkin's affidavit identifies that he is a member of the Party, but his affidavit does not establish that he is regulated by Rule 2030 or that he plans to make (or receive) a specific contribution that would trigger the Rule. And Mr. Pipkin's affidavit identifies no other members\n   of the Georgia Party who are covered or affected by Rule 2030. Thus, the Party has failed to identify at least one member who has or will suffer harm from Rule 2030 as required to show injury in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Georgia Party invokes this Court's previous decision in\n   <em>\n    Florida State Conference of the NAACP v. Browning\n   </em>\n   to argue that it need not \"name names\" to establish standing based on prospective harm.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3761058\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/522/1153/#p1160\">\n    522 F.3d 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1160 (11th Cir. 2008). In\n   <em>\n    Browning\n   </em>\n   , we held that organizations need not identify particular members who would be harmed because future \"probabilistic injuries\" to unidentified members were sufficient if at least one member was \"certain to get injured in the end.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3761058\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/522/1153/#p1160\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3761058\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/522/1153/#p1160\">\n    at 1162-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Here, however, Mr. Pipkin's affidavit does not aver that at least one of the Georgia Party's members is certain to be injured by Rule 2030. Moreover, since\n   <em>\n    Browning\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court has rejected probabilistic analysis as a basis for conferring standing. In\n   <em>\n    Summers\n   </em>\n   , the majority rejected the dissent's theory that an organization could establish standing if \"there is a statistical probability that some of [its] members are threatened with concrete injury.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679229\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/488/#p492\">\n    555 U.S. at 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679229\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/488/#p492\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To be sure, we explained that an \"organizational plaintiff[ ] need not establish that all of [its] members are in danger\" and approvingly cited our holding in\n   <em>\n    Browning\n   </em>\n   that \"large organizations ... ha[v]e standing [when] there [is] a high probability that at least one of the[ir] members w[ill] be [harmed].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314214\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/1335/#p1339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314214\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/1335/#p1339\">\n    at 1342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But in\n   <em>\n    Arcia\n   </em>\n   , we were not asked whether\n   <em>\n    Summers\n   </em>\n   and its requirement that an organization proffer \"at least one\n   <em>\n    identified\n   </em>\n   member [who] had suffered or would suffer harm,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679229\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/488/#p492\">\n    555 U.S. at 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679229\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/488/#p492\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added), had abrogated our precedent about probabilistic injury to unnamed plaintiffs. Nor did we need to answer this question because we acknowledged that the organizations in\n   <em>\n    Arcia\n   </em>\n   \"represent a large number of people,\n   <em>\n    like Ms. Arcia and Ms. Antoine\n   </em>\n   , who face a realistic danger of being identified in the [voter] removal program[ ].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679229\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/488/#p492\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). In the light of this identification of two members, the only question before this Court was whether there was a realistic danger of injury to the\n   <em>\n    named\n   </em>\n   members, and not whether there was a sufficient possibility that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   member would suffer an injury.

For reasons unknown to this Court, the Georgia party has not submitted\n   an affidavit from a member who is a placement agent regulated by Rule 2030 and who has decided not to make a particular contribution because of the Rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tenn.
