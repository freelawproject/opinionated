BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant pleaded guilty in 2014 for failing to register as a sex offender. He was sentenced to 21 months in prison, followed by a five-year term of supervised release, which eventually began in November 2015. One condition of his supervised release was that he \"comply with the requirements of [SORNA].\" R., Vol. I at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In January 2017, Sharla Belluomo, a Tulsa-based probation officer supervising Defendant, filed a petition (the Petition) alleging five violations of the terms of his supervised release. The district court held a revocation hearing on April 5, 2017. Defendant stipulated to four of the alleged violations but denied the allegation that he had violated SORNA by \"fail[ing] to update his registration status when he\n   changed residences in July 2016.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He claimed that he had \"just found ... out\" that homeless people could register as such under SORNA, and that people at a court building had told him that homeless people could not register. R., Vol. III at 12. In response, Belluomo testified that in July or August 2016, Defendant had returned to Tulsa after living in a facility in Oklahoma City under a \"public law placement\" because of a state failure-to-pay charge.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    at 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to Belluomo, after Defendant reported that he was homeless, she had instructed him to \"register as homeless,\" and he had acknowledged the need to do so and \"told [her] that he was able to register weekly.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . She further testified that before she submitted the Petition, she had been informed by the officer overseeing the Tulsa Police Department's sex-offender registry that Defendant had never registered, and had been informed by the person overseeing the state registry that Defendant had last registered in July 2016 in Oklahoma City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The district court determined that Belluomo was credible and Defendant was not. It thus found that Defendant had failed to comply with SORNA. The court sentenced Defendant (based on all five violations alleged in the Petition) to 18 months in prison and an 18-month term of supervised release. Apparently believing that his sentence would be lower if there were no finding of a SORNA violation, Defendant appeals the finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant argues in this court that there was no evidence that he changed his residence to Tulsa for SORNA purposes. He concedes that he did not raise this argument below, so we review only for plain error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Rios-Morales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266326\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/978/#p987\">\n    878 F.3d 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 987 (10th Cir. 2017). He must therefore show \"(1) error, (2) that is plain, which (3) affects [his] substantial rights, and which (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266326\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/978/#p987\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). In our view, he has failed even to show error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To assess Defendant's argument, we begin with a review of his legal obligations. Under SORNA, \"[a] sex offender shall register, and keep the registration current, in each jurisdiction where the offender resides....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020913\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 20913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The Act defines\n   <em>\n    resides\n   </em>\n   to mean \"the location of the individual's home or other place where the individual habitually lives.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020913\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 20911(13). To keep the registration current, \"[a] sex offender shall, not later than 3 business days after each change of ... residence ..., appear in person in at least 1 jurisdiction ... and inform that jurisdiction of all changes in the information required for that offender in the sex offender registry.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020913\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 20913(c).

The guidelines include a thorough discussion of the statute's application to homeless persons. Section VIII recognizes that \"[r]equiring registration only where a sex offender has a residence or home in the sense of a fixed abode would be too narrow to achieve SORNA's objective of 'comprehensive' registration of sex offenders, because some sex offenders have no fixed abodes.\" The National Guidelines for Sex Offender Registration and Notification,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2038%2C030\">\n    73 Fed. Reg. 38,030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 38,061 (July 2, 2008) (SORNA Guidelines) (citation omitted). \"For example,\" it notes, \"a sex offender may be homeless, living on the street or moving from shelter to shelter, or\n   a sex offender may live in something that itself moves from place to place, such as a mobile home, trailer, or houseboat.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2038%2C030\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The section then explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [SORNA \u00a7 20911(13) ] accordingly defines \"resides\" to mean \"the location of the individual's home or other place where the individual habitually lives.\" This entails that a sex offender must register ... [i]n any jurisdiction in which he has his home; and [i]n any jurisdiction in which he habitually lives (even if he has no home or fixed address in the jurisdiction, or no home anywhere).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Section VIII also addresses the meaning of\n   <em>\n    habitually lives\n   </em>\n   . It observes that the term is not defined in the statute and \"[a]n overly narrow definition would undermine the objectives of sex offender registration and notification under SORNA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2038%2C030\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The term therefore \"should be understood to include places in which the sex offender lives with some regularity, and with reference to where the sex offender actually lives, not just in terms of what he would choose to characterize as his home address or place of residence for self-interested reasons.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2038%2C030\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2038%2C030\">\n    at 38,062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Guidelines then adopt the interpretation that \"a sex offender habitually lives in the relevant sense in any place in which the sex offender lives for at least 30 days.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2038%2C030\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This Section also sets forth the timely-reporting requirement of the statute, saying that \"a sex offender who changes his place of residence within a jurisdiction must be required to report the change within three business days.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2038%2C030\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Section VI describes the sort of location information that transient sex offenders must provide.

For example, the sex offender could provide \"information about a certain part of a city that is the sex offender's habitual locale, a park or spot on the street (or a number of such places) where the sex offender stations himself during the day or sleeps at night, shelters among which the sex offender circulates, or places in public buildings, restaurants, libraries, or other establishments that the sex offender frequents.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2038%2C030\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2038%2C030\">\n    at 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,055 -56.

We recommended the following jury-instruction language: \"An offender 'habitually lives' in any place in which he intends to live with some regularity, or lives for at least 30 days, even if the person has no home or fixed address or is homeless.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6814450\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/817/1205/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6814450\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/817/1205/\">\n    at 1215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant's contention, as we understand\n   it, is that the evidence at his revocation hearing would not support a finding that he resided in Tulsa for 30 days or intended to do so. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The government's burden of persuasion in a revocation hearing is proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203583\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(3). The government's burden was satisfied. It was uncontested that in July 2016 Defendant had registered as a sex offender in Oklahoma City. But then he came to Tulsa. Belluomo testified that beginning in July or August 2016 and lasting until December, when she lost track of him, she met with Defendant \"on numerous occasions ... in [her] office or in the community,\" R., Vol. III at 20; and in those meetings he reported that he had registered weekly as a sex offender in Tulsa.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Okla.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20tit.%2057%2C%20%C2%A7%20584\">\n    Okla.

The government did not have to provide a particular address in Tulsa where Defendant was living. After all, the SORNA Guidelines recognize that offenders without \"fixed abodes\" still need to register. SORNA Guidelines at 38,055. The evidence was ample for the district court to infer that Defendant was \"liv[ing] with some regularity\" somewhere in Tulsa.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Okla.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20tit.%2057%2C%20%C2%A7%20584\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Okla.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20tit.%2057%2C%20%C2%A7%20584\">\n    at 38,062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Br. at 12 (capitalization omitted). But he is not disputing that he failed to register in Tulsa. He appears to be saying only that because he did not change his residence, he did not need to update his registration. This argument adds nothing to the prior argument and it is no more successful the second time around.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
