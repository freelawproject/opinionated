The Commonwealth in its petition for panel rehearing or rehearing en banc challenges that ruling on a number of grounds. Those grounds include the contention that the Massachusetts Appeals Court's reference to the reasons set forth in certain pages of the Commonwealth's brief that included a discussion of the prejudice prong constituted an adjudication of that prong,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%201134\">\n    81 Mass.App.Ct. 1134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201623373\">\n    2012 WL 1623373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *1 (Mass. App. Ct. May 10, 2012) (\"For these reasons, and for the reasons included in the Commonwealth's brief at 13-39, the defendant was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel.\"), and thus requires the application of deferential AEDPA review to that prong under\n   <em>\n    Magraw\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Roden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4117047\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/743/1/#p10\">\n    743 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 10 (1st Cir. 2014) and\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407478\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/289/#p301\">\n    568 U.S. 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 301,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407478\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/289/#p301\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407478\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/289/#p301\">\n    185 L.Ed.2d 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). Without suggesting that those precedents would dictate the outcome here, I note that the Commonwealth makes this incorporation argument for the first time in its petition and hence the argument is waived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tavares\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277494\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/849/529/#p530\">\n    849 F.3d 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 530 (1st Cir. 2017) (stating that \"new arguments raised for the first time in a petition for rehearing are waived\").\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
