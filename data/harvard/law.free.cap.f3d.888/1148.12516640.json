Barnes waived his right to an advisory jury, and mitigation counsel appeared only before the judge. Second, the Fifth Circuit concluded that \"Davis's strategy was in direct conflict with the independent counsel's approach.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9445519\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/378/\">\n    285 F.3d at 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, we have explained that the Florida Supreme Court reasonably determined that the presentation by special counsel did not conflict with Barnes's asserted theory of mitigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Shakoor also argues that some of the information presented by special counsel was aggravating, including evidence that Petitioner had been a pyromaniac from an early age, that as a child he had assaulted family members and peers in various settings, and that his score on a psychological\n   assessment conducted by Dr. Riebsame classified him as a psychopath. Contrary to Shakoor's suggestion, there is no evidence in the record that special counsel's mitigation presentation prejudiced Petitioner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, it appears that the mitigation presentation inured to Petitioner's benefit because it resulted in the trial court finding numerous additional mitigators, including the statutory mitigator that Petitioner was \"under the influence of a mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the offense\" and the non-statutory mitigators that he \"had an abusive childhood, lacked a loving relationship with his parents, and was a functional and capable person with a capacity to contribute to society.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7050319\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/29/1010/#p1013\">\n    29 So.3d at 1026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Further, it is clear from the record that the trial judge obtained all of the allegedly aggravating information from sources other than special counsel's mitigation presentation, and that the judge would have been privy to that information even if special mitigation counsel had not been appointed. Florida law requires the preparation of a PSR in all death penalty cases where the defendant waives mitigation or refuses to present mitigation evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.710(b) (requiring the preparation of a \"comprehensive\" PSR when a capital defendant refuses to present mitigation evidence);\n   <em>\n    Muhammad v.

The PSR, which was provided to the trial judge on May 17, 2007 and supplemented on November 16, 2007, contains all of the information Petitioner claims is aggravating.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Specifically, the PSR describes a long history of criminality, violence, and drug use beginning when Petitioner was fifteen years old and continuing until Petitioner murdered his wife when he was 35. The \"family history\" section of the PSR states that Petitioner had assaulted his mother and sisters, including one incident during which he broke his sister's nose by punching her in the face, and that he had been diagnosed as a sociopath. The \"mental health\" section of the PSR states that Petitioner had been seen by a psychiatrist and psychologist beginning at the age of six for behaviors such as stealing, being cruel to other children, and exposing himself sexually, and that he lacked remorse for his actions and \"seemingly show[ed] no emotion.\" The PSR also reveals that Petitioner had issues with aggression and \"firesetting\" at a young age. Special counsel's attempt during the mitigation presentation to cast this information-already available to the trial judge as a result of the PSR-in the best light possible in terms of Petitioner's culpability could not possibly have prejudiced Petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, there is no support for finding that the Florida Supreme Court's decision\n   was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. Standby counsel Shakoor vaguely asserts in his brief that the state court proceedings \"resulted in decisions that w[ere] based on an unreasonable determination of the facts, in light of the evidence presented in the State court.\" But Shakoor does not cite any evidence in support of that assertion, nor even specify the factual findings he claims were unreasonable. In fact, the parties appear to agree on the essential facts underlying Petitioner's\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   claim: (1) Petitioner asserted his right to self-representation in his criminal proceeding and the trial judge found, after conducting a\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   inquiry, that he was competent to proceed without a lawyer, (2) Petitioner decided to plead guilty and waived his right to an advisory jury, (3) during the penalty phase of his proceeding, Petitioner refused to present any mitigation other than the fact that he had come forward and accepted responsibility for his crime, (4) the trial judge, over Petitioner's objection, appointed special counsel to investigate and present any available mitigating evidence, and (5) special counsel presented mitigation evidence to the trial judge, including evidence regarding Petitioner's background and record. These facts, which were the basis of the Florida Supreme Court's decision on Petitioner's\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   claim, are undisputed and well-supported in the record, meaning they were reasonably determined by the Florida court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For the above reasons, we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   the district court's order denying federal habeas relief on Petitioner's Sixth Amendment self-representation claim.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    We take the facts surrounding Petitioner's crime, which are undisputed, from the Florida Supreme Court's ruling on Petitioner's direct appeal.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Barnes v.
