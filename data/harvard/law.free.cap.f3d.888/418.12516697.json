Smith\n   We must determine whether a monkey may sue humans, corporations, and companies for damages and injunctive relief arising from claims of copyright infringement. Our court's precedent requires us to conclude that the monkey's claim has standing under Article III of the United States Constitution. Nonetheless, we conclude that this monkey-and all animals, since they are not human-lacks statutory standing under the Copyright Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Naruto was a seven-year-old crested macaque that lived-and may still live-in a reserve on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia. In 2011, a wildlife photographer, David Slater, left his camera unattended in the reserve. Naruto allegedly took several photographs of himself (the \"Monkey Selfies\") with Slater's camera.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Slater and Wildlife Personalities, Ltd., (\"Wildlife\") published the Monkey Selfies in a book that Slater created through Blurb, Inc.'s (\"Blurb\") website in December 2014. The book identifies Slater and Wildlife as the copyright owners of the Monkey Selfies. However, Slater admits throughout the book that Naruto took the photographs at issue. For example, the book describes one of the Monkey Selfies as follows: \"Sulawesi crested black macaque smiles at itself while pressing the shutter button on a camera.\" Another excerpt from the book describes Naruto as \"[p]osing to take its own photograph, unworried by its own reflection, smiling. Surely a sign of self-awareness?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2015 People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (\"PETA\") and Dr. Antje Engelhardt filed a complaint for copyright infringement against Slater, Wildlife, and Blurb, as Next Friends on behalf of Naruto. The complaint alleges that Dr. Engelhardt has studied the crested macaques in Sulawesi, Indonesia for over a decade and has known, monitored, and studied Naruto since his birth. The complaint does not allege any history or relationship between PETA and Naruto.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, the complaint alleges that PETA is \"the largest animal rights organization in the world\" and \"has championed establishing the rights and legal protections available to animals beyond their utility to human beings....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Slater, Wildlife, and Blurb filed motions to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) on the grounds that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to establish standing under Article III or statutory standing under the Copyright Act. The district court granted the motions to dismiss. In its order the district court stated the following with respect to Article III standing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-16\">\n   The Ninth Circuit has stated that Article III \"does not compel the conclusion that a statutorily authorized suit in the name of an animal is not a 'case or controversy.' \"\n   <em>\n    Cetacean Cmty. v.

I need not discuss Article III standing further, because regardless of whether Naruto fulfills the requirements of Article III, he must demonstrate standing under the Copyright Act for his claim to survive under Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"**\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    The Honorable Eduardo C.

Here, we are concerned with the second requirement. PETA does not claim to have a relationship with Naruto that is any more significant than its relationship with any other animal. Thus, PETA fails to meet the \"significant relationship\" requirement and cannot sue as Naruto's next friend.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    But, even if PETA had alleged a significant relationship with Naruto, it still could\n    not sue as Naruto's next friend. In\n    <em>\n     Whitmore v.

In considering whether the third-party, Whitmore, had standing to sue on behalf of Simmons, the Court emphasized the limited nature of \"next friend\" standing and explained the rationale behind its limitations. For example, requiring a showing of incompetency and a \"significant relationship\" ensures that \"the litigant asserting only a generalized interest in constitutional governance\" does not \"circumvent the jurisdictional limits of Article III simply by assuming the mantle of 'next friend.' \"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633773\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/149/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633773\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/149/\">\n     at 164\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633773\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/149/\">\n     110 S.Ct. 1717\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In short, requirements of a significant interest in the subject party protect against abuses of the third-party standing rule. As the Court noted in a prior case, \"however worthy and high minded the motives of 'next friends' may be, they inevitably run the risk of making the actual [party] a pawn to be manipulated on a chessboard larger than his own case.\"\n    <em>\n     Lenhard v.

R. Civ. P. 17(c), there is no such authorization for \"next friend\" lawsuits brought on behalf of animals. Our precedent on statutory interpretation should apply to court rules as well as statutes: if animals are to be accorded rights to sue, the provisions involved therefore should state such rights expressly.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cetacean Cmty.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9155078\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/386/1169/#p1175\">\n     386 F.3d at 1179\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Because we believe the Supreme Court's reasoning in\n    <em>\n     Whitmore\n    </em>\n    counsels against court-initiated expansion of \"next friend\" standing, we decline to recognize the right of next friends to bring suit on behalf of animals, absent express authorization from Congress.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Even so, we must proceed to the merits because Naruto's lack of a next friend does not destroy his standing to sue, as having a \"case or controversy\" under Article III of the Constitution. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17, which authorizes \"next friend\" lawsuits, obligates the court \"to consider whether [incompetent parties] are adequately protected,\" even where they have no \"next friend\" or \"guardian.\"\n    <em>\n     U.S. v. 30.64 Acres of Land\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1596182\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/795/796/#p805\">\n     795 F.2d 796\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 805 (9th Cir. 1986).

There, the cetaceans had no purported \"next friend.\" Thus, were we to vacate the case we have before us now and remand with instructions to dismiss because of PETA's failure to establish \"next friend\" standing, our jurisprudence would permit a case brought \"directly\" by animals without any allegation that the suit was brought by a \"next friend\"-as was the case in\n    <em>\n     Cetacean\n    </em>\n    -but would not permit a case brought by an organization as the \"next friend\" of the animal at issue if the organization failed to meet the relational requirements. That cannot be the law. We thus hold that Naruto's Article III standing under\n    <em>\n     Cetacean\n    </em>\n    is not dependent on PETA's sufficiency as a guardian or \"next friend,\" and we proceed to our Article III standing analysis.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    <strong>\n     II.

R. Civ. P 17(c) (emphasis added). Per the text, this can only apply to human persons, not any \"minor\" or \"incompetent\" corporations or animals. Importantly, the historical background of Rule 17(c) limits the use of next friends to only human persons. Rule 17(c) incorporated Rule 70 of the Federal Equity Rules into the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(c), Note to Subdivision (c). Rule 70 specifically provided, \"All infants and other persons so incapable may sue by their guardians, if any, or by their\n    <em>\n     prochei ami\n    </em>\n    [next friend].\" Fed. Equity R. 70. Finally, the provisions for corporate capacity are articulated in Rule 17(b). Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(b). This separate enumeration of rules for non-human entities, Rule 17(b), is a clear textual indication that the use of the term \"person\" in Rule 17(c) does not include non-human entities, such as corporations or animals.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    <strong>\n     3.

Moreover, as Chief Justice Rehnquist (writing as the sole justice for the Supreme Court on a stay of execution) similarly noted: \"however worthy and high minded the motives of 'next friends' may be, they inevitably run the risk of making the actual defendant a pawn to be manipulated on a chessboard larger than his own case.\"\n    <em>\n     Lenhard v.

Allowing next-friend standing on behalf of animals allows lawyers (as in\n    <em>\n     Cetacean\n    </em>\n    ) and various interest groups (as here) to bring suit on behalf of those animals or objects\n    <em>\n     with no means or manner to ensure the animals' interests are truly being expressed or advanced\n    </em>\n    . Such a change would fundamentally alter the litigation landscape. Institutional actors could simply claim some form of relationship to the animal or object to obtain standing and use it to advance their own institutional goals with no means to curtail those actions. We have no idea whether animals or objects wish to own copyrights or open bank accounts to hold their royalties from sales of pictures. To some extent, as humans, we have a general understanding of the similar interests of other humans.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    In the habeas corpus context, we presume other humans desire liberty. Similarly, in actions on behalf of infants, for example, we presume the infant would want to retain ownership of the property she inherited. But the interests of animals? We are really asking what\n    <em>\n     another species\n    </em>\n    desires. Do animals want to own property, such as copyrights? Are animals willing to assume the duties associated with the rights PETA seems to be advancing on their behalf?\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    Animal-next-friend standing is materially different from a competent person representing an incompetent person.

Because the \"real party in interest\" can actually\n    <em>\n     never credibly articulate its interests or goals\n    </em>\n    , next-friend standing for animals is left at the mercy of the institutional actor to advance its own interests, which it\n    <em>\n     imputes\n    </em>\n    to the animal or object with\n    <em>\n     no accountability\n    </em>\n    .

The Majority opinion\n    <em>\n     states\n    </em>\n    that animals cannot have next-friend standing, but it nevertheless determines that, because Naruto has an Article III injury and he is \"adequately protected,\" the Majority may proceed to determine the merits of Naruto's statutory standing claim under the Copyright Act. Maj. Op. at 422-25. In order to get there, the Majority concludes that next-friend standing is nonjurisdictional: \"[W]e must proceed to the merits because Naruto's lack of a next friend does not destroy his standing to sue, as having a 'case or controversy' under\n    Article III of the Constitution,\" and concludes that \"Naruto's Article III standing under\n    <em>\n     Cetacean\n    </em>\n    is not dependent on PETA's sufficiency as a guardian or 'next friend.' \" Maj.

Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    The question of PETA's next-friend standing was squarely before our panel. It was briefed and argued. By both concluding that next-friend standing is nonjurisdictional\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    reaching the merits of the Copyright Act question, the Majority allows PETA (with no injury or relationship to the real party in interest) to sue on Naruto's behalf, because it obtained legal counsel to allegedly represent Naruto. I cannot support this conclusion.\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-99\">\n     We feel compelled to note that PETA's deficiencies in this regard go far beyond its failure to plead a significant relationship with Naruto. Indeed, if any such relationship exists, PETA appears to have failed to live up to the title of \"friend.\" After seeing the proverbial writing on the wall at oral argument, PETA and Appellees filed a motion asking this court to dismiss Naruto's appeal and to vacate the district court's adverse judgment, representing that PETA's claims against Slater had been settled. It remains unclear what claims PETA purported to be \"settling,\" since the court was under the impression this lawsuit was about Naruto's claims, and per PETA's motion, Naruto was \"not a party to the settlement,\" nor were Naruto's claims settled therein. Nevertheless, PETA apparently obtained something from the settlement with Slater, although not anything that would necessarily go to Naruto: As \"part of the arrangement,\" Slater agreed to pay a quarter of his earnings from the monkey selfie book \"to charities that protect the habitat of Naruto and other crested macaques in Indonesia.\"\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Settlement Reached: 'Monkey Selfie'' Case Broke New Ground For Animal Rights\n     </em>\n     , PETA, https://www.peta.org/blog/settlement-reached-monkey-selfie-case-broke-new-ground-animal-rights/ (last visited Apr. 5, 2018). But now, in the wake of PETA's proposed dismissal, Naruto is left without an advocate, his supposed \"friend\" having abandoned Naruto's substantive claims in what appears to be an effort to prevent the publication of a decision adverse to PETA's institutional interests. Were he capable of recognizing this abandonment, we wonder whether Naruto might initiate an action for breach of confidential relationship against his (former) next friend, PETA, for its failure to pursue his interests before its own. Puzzlingly, while representing to the world that \"animals are not ours to eat, wear, experiment on, use for entertainment, or abuse in any other way,\"\n     <em>\n      see\n     </em>\n     PETA, https://peta.org (last visited Apr. 5, 2018), PETA seems to employ Naruto as an unwitting pawn in its ideological goals. Yet this is precisely what is to be avoided by requiring next friends to have a significant relationship with, rather than an institutional interest in, the incompetent party-a point made by Chief Justice Rehnquist in\n     <em>\n      Lenhard v. Wolff\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198330\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/1306/#p1312\">\n      443 U.S. 1306\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 1312,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20S.%20Ct.%203\">\n      100 S.Ct. 3\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20885\">\n      61 L.Ed.2d 885\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (1979).\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      infra\n     </em>\n     page 422 for exact language.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-100\">\n     Here, we find that this case was briefed and argued by competent counsel who represented the legal interests of the incompetent party, but not a person, Naruto. Thus, his interests up to submission of the case following oral argument were adequately protected, notwithstanding any deficiencies in PETA's \"next friend\" relationship.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"5\">\n    <p id=\"p-101\">\n     This is where we depart from the concurring opinion. First, Judge N.R. Smith seems to posit that we must restrict our inquiry into Article III standing and its effect on jurisdiction to an examination of the validity of the claimed Next Friend status, because that is how the complaint is stated.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      infra\n     </em>\n     , note 8 (Smith, J., concurring in part). In other words, since Naruto's only stated basis for jurisdiction is Next Friend status, we can determine whether we have jurisdiction by examining only the validity of the Next Friend claim. But such a restriction is contrary to our long held and often restated duty to examine\n     <em>\n      sua sponte\n     </em>\n     whether jurisdiction exists, regardless how the parties have framed their claims.\n     <em>\n      See, e.g.\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Gonzalez v. Thaler\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186041,12445442\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/134/\">\n      565 U.S. 134\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 141,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186041,12445442\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/134/\">\n      132 S.Ct. 641\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186041,12445442\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/134/\">\n      181 L.Ed.2d 619\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (2012) (\"When a requirement goes to subject-matter jurisdiction, courts are obligated to consider\n     <em>\n      sua sponte\n     </em>\n     the issues that the parties have disclaimed or have not presented. Subject matter jurisdiction can never be waived or forfeited.\") (internal citations omitted). We therefore respectfully reject this suggested limitation.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-102\">\n     Next, although Judge N.R. Smith agrees that an animal cannot sue by next friend, he nevertheless limits his analysis to cases involving next friend suits under statutes which contain particular next friend provisions. Under\n     <em>\n      Whitmore\n     </em>\n     and\n     <em>\n      Coalition\n     </em>\n     , he argues, we must dismiss based on PETA's insufficiency as a \"next friend.\" But if we all agree that suits by animals\n     <em>\n      cannot\n     </em>\n     be brought under FRCP 17, because the rule refers only to \"persons,\" not \"animals,\" why would we want to follow and be bound by habeas cases for humans for which the statute (\u00a7 2242 ) expressly\n     <em>\n      provides\n     </em>\n     next friend standing? The concurrence does not explain this point.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-103\">\n     In our view, the question of standing was explicitly decided in\n     <em>\n      Cetacean\n     </em>\n     . Although, as we explain later, we believe\n     <em>\n      Cetacean\n     </em>\n     was wrongly decided, we are bound by it. Short of an intervening decision from the Supreme Court or from an en banc panel of this court,\n     <em>\n      see\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Miller v. Gammie\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1533829\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/335/889/#p899\">\n      335 F.3d 889\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 899 (9th Cir. 2003), we cannot escape the proposition that animals have Article III standing to sue. With this as a starting premise, how could it be that PETA's deficiency as Naruto's representative could destroy Naruto's otherwise valid Article III standing? Again, the concurrence fails to explain.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-104\">\n     Judge N.R. Smith insightfully identifies a series of issues raised by the prospect of allowing animals to sue. For example, if animals may sue, who may represent their interests? If animals have property rights, do they also have corresponding duties? How do we prevent people (or organizations, like PETA) from using animals to advance their human agendas? In reflecting on these questions, Judge Smith reaches the reasonable conclusion that animals should not be permitted to sue in human courts. As a pure policy matter, we agree. But we are not a legislature, and this court's decision in\n     <em>\n      Cetacean\n     </em>\n     limits our options. What we\n     <em>\n      can\n     </em>\n     do is urge this court to reexamine\n     <em>\n      Cetacean\n     </em>\n     .\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      infra\n     </em>\n     note 6. What we\n     <em>\n      cannot\n     </em>\n     do is pretend\n     <em>\n      Cetacean\n     </em>\n     does not exist, or that it states something other, or milder, or more ambiguous on whether cetaceans have Article III standing.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"6\">\n    <p id=\"p-105\">\n     The use of the double negative here is problematic in that it creates unnecessary ambiguity in the court's holding. Better, we think, to say a petition is \"timely\" than that it is \"not untimely,\" for example. Better here to have said the animal has Article III standing. \"This type of litotes (the negation of an opposite) often makes language convoluted. George Orwell ridiculed it with this example: 'A not unblack dog was chasing a not unsmall rabbit across a not ungreen field.' \" Bryan Garner, Garner's Modern American Usage 545 (2003) (citing \"Politics and the English Language\" (1946), in\n     <em>\n      4 Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell\n     </em>\n     127, 138 n.1 (1968) ). But this language does not change our ultimate conclusion. If nothing about Article III\n     <em>\n      compels\n     </em>\n     the conclusion that animals lack standing, then it cannot also be true that animals lack standing simply by virtue of their being animals. In other words,\n     <em>\n      Cetacean\n     </em>\n     at the very least holds that it is\n     <em>\n      possible\n     </em>\n     for animals, like humans, to demonstrate the kind of case or controversy required to establish Article III standing. Although the claims in\n     <em>\n      Cetacean\n     </em>\n     sounded in physical harm to plaintiffs, and the claims in\n     <em>\n      Naruto\n     </em>\n     sound in economic harm to Naruto, that difference is not a point of distinction for Article III purposes. \"Cases or Controversies\" have described claims involving property interests, as well as claims involving personal injuries, since the Founding, and before, at common law. Thus, the sort of blanket exclusion of animals from Article III jurisdiction which Judge N.R. Smith advocates is, alas, fundamentally inconsistent with\n     <em>\n      Cetacean\n     </em>\n     's holding.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"7\">\n    <p id=\"p-106\">\n     Mindful that the term \"standing\" carries with it jurisdictional connotations, we clarify that our use of the term \"statutory standing\" refers to Naruto's ability to sue under the Copyright Act, not his ability to sue generally. Thus, as we have observed in previous cases, \"[t]hough lack of\n     <em>\n      statutory\n     </em>\n     standing requires dismissal for failure to state a claim, lack of Article III standing requires dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).\"\n     <em>\n      Maya v.

But, unlike a normal settlement, the purported plaintiff, Naruto,\n     <em>\n      was not a party\n     </em>\n     . \"Dismissal with vacatur is just and proper where, as here, the Plaintiff [Naruto] is\n     <em>\n      not a party to the settlement\n     </em>\n     .\"\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 1 (emphasis added). Rather, his purported next friend, PETA,\n     <em>\n      settled its own claims\n     </em>\n     : \"the settlement resolves all disputes arising out of this litigation\n     <em>\n      as between PETA and Defendants\n     </em>\n     .\"\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     (emphasis added). It remains a mystery to me what \"claims\" PETA (a non-party) could settle. Nevertheless, even though PETA only settled its\n     <em>\n      own\n     </em>\n     claims, it maintained that \"the settlement also renders moot the appeal filed on behalf of the Plaintiff Naruto.\"\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     Indeed, PETA went so far as to claim \"[t]here is thus no longer any live case or controversy before this Court.\"\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 3.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-128\">\n     Though it had previously attested it would \"fulfill[ ] the duties of a next friend,\" PETA forgot its self-appointed role. \"A 'next friend'\n     <em>\n      does not [itself] become a party to the ... action\n     </em>\n     in which [it] participates, but\n     <em>\n      simply pursues the cause on behalf of [the party in interest]\n     </em>\n     .\"\n     <em>\n      Whitmore\n     </em>\n     , 495 U.S. at 163,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633773\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/149/\">\n      110 S.Ct. 1717\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (emphasis added). Whatever PETA did or did not do for Naruto (it only made representations to this court regarding what\n     <em>\n      it\n     </em>\n     obtained), PETA made sure to protect itself and with the\n     <em>\n      Joint Motion\n     </em>\n     sought to manipulate this court to avoid further negative precedent contrary to its institutional objectives. PETA cleverly argues that, because Naruto is not a party to the settlement and Defendants have maintained that PETA does not have next-friend standing, Naruto should not be bound by judgments entered because of PETA's actions. But, clever arguments hardly conceal what is really occurring and the flip by PETA is quite surprising. One day, PETA maintains it will advance Naruto's interests, the next it maintains that Naruto cannot be bound by PETA's actions. It is clear: PETA's real motivation in this case was to advance its own interests, not Naruto's. PETA began this case purportedly seeking not only an injunction, but also a judgment \"[d]eclaring Naruto to be the author and copyright owner of the Monkey Selfies with all attendant rights and privileges under law\" and disgorgement. Compl. at 9-10. After oral argument, none of those objectives are, apparently, worth pursuing. Rather, when it came down to a possible negative, precedential ruling from the panel, PETA quickly sought to protect the\n     <em>\n      institution\n     </em>\n     , not the claimed real party in interest. PETA used Naruto as a \"pawn to be manipulated on a chessboard larger than his own case.\"\n     <em>\n      Lenhard\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198330\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/1306/#p1312\">\n      443 U.S. at 1312\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20S.%20Ct.%203\">\n      100 S.Ct. 3\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (Rehnquist, J., writing for the full Supreme Court).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-129\">\n     Unfortunately, PETA's actions could be the new normal under today's holding.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
