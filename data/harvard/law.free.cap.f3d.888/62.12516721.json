He was captured by the Afghan Border Police and American soldiers in the Khost province of Afghanistan in 2009 after he planned and participated in an attack on an Afghan Border Police post at Camp Leyza. He was taken into U.S. custody and held in U.S. facilities in Afghanistan. He was later indicted in the Eastern District of Virginia for acts associated with the attack, first in a twelve-count indictment and later in a fifteen-count second superseding indictment. The charges against him included providing and conspiring to provide material support to terrorists, conspiring and attempting to destroy an aircraft of the United States Armed Forces in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2032\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , conspiring and attempting to kill an officer or employee of the United States, and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Prior to trial, Hamidullin moved for dismissal of the second superseding indictment on the grounds that he qualified for combatant immunity pursuant to the Third Geneva Convention and common law. Hamidullin also moved to dismiss his\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2032\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   charge, arguing that the statute was not intended to apply to lawful military actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The district court held an evidentiary hearing on Hamidullin's motions at which experts testified as to the applicability of the Third Geneva Convention and laws of war in Hamidullin's circumstance and as to the structure and practices of the Taliban and the Haqqani Network. Thereafter, the court denied Hamidullin's motion to dismiss. The district court assumed without deciding that in 2009, when the alleged acts took place, the conflict in Afghanistan was an international armed conflict and determined that Hamidullin was not a lawful combatant because neither the Taliban nor the Haqqani Network fell within any of the categories of lawful combatants listed in Article 4 of the Third Geneva Convention. Thus, the district court concluded that, as a matter of law, Hamidullin was not entitled to combatant immunity under the Third Geneva Convention or common law and precluded him from presenting this defense at trial. The district court also determined that the plain language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2032\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   embraced unlawful acts in a combat zone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In August 2015, Hamidullin was convicted by a jury on all charges and sentenced to multiple life sentences. On appeal, Hamidullin argues that the district court erred in (1) holding that his prosecution was not barred by the doctrine of combatant immunity, as articulated by the Third Geneva Convention and common law, and (2) determining that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2032\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   applied to his actions. On June 23, 2017, this Court ordered supplemental briefing to address whether the district court possessed jurisdiction to decide, in the first instance, whether Hamidullin qualifies for combatant immunity under the Third Geneva Convention. In particular, we requested briefing on whether the district court's jurisdiction was affected by Army Regulation 190-8-which implements international law relating to detention during armed\n   conflicts. In response, Hamidullin argues that Army Regulation 190-8 requires that this Court vacate his conviction and remand with instructions that he be transferred to the U.S. military for treatment in accordance with Army Regulation 190-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Hamidullin argues he is entitled to combatant immunity under various theories. Accordingly, we begin with a brief discussion of the doctrine of combatant immunity. Combatant immunity is rooted in the customary international law of war and \"forbids prosecution of soldiers for their lawful belligerent acts committed during the course of armed conflicts against legitimate military targets.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Unlawful combatants are likewise subject to capture and detention, but in addition they are subject to trial and punishment by military tribunals for acts which render their belligerency unlawful.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The current doctrine of combatant immunity is codified in the Third Geneva Convention. The Third Geneva Convention is one of four international agreements drafted in the wake of World War II to govern the status and treatment of wounded and captured military personnel and civilians in wartime.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adriana Sinclair,\n   <em>\n    Geneva Conventions\n   </em>\n   , in 1\n   <em>\n    The Oxford Encyclopedia of American Military and Diplomatic History\n   </em>\n   414 (Timothy J. Lynch ed., 2013). The Geneva Conventions have been signed and ratified by every country in the world, including the United States.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"303800\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/1/#p31\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Conventions therefore have the force of law in the United States. U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Article 2 of each of the Geneva Conventions renders the full protections of the Conventions, including combatant immunity, applicable only in international armed conflicts between signatories of the Conventions. Third Geneva Convention, art. 2. (\"[T]he present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties\"). If Article 2 is applicable, then the Third Geneva Convention provides that lawful combatants who are captured in such a conflict are considered prisoners of war (POWs). The categories of combatants qualifying as lawful are listed in Article 4 of the Convention. Two of these categories are relevant in this case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   A. Prisoners of war, in the sense of the present Convention, are persons belonging to one of the following categories, who have fallen into the power of the enemy:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (1) ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (2) Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organized resistance movements, belonging to a Party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this territory is occupied, provided that such militias or volunteer corps, including such organized resistance movements, fulfil the following conditions: (a) that of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (b) that of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (c) that of carrying arms openly;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (d) that of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (3) Members of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a government or an authority not recognized by the Detaining Power.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500459\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/557/#p629\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   art. 4(A)(2)-(3).

Article 3 of each Convention provides that in an \"armed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, each Party to the conflict shall be bound to apply, as a minimum,\" certain provisions, including protecting \"[p]ersons taking no active part in the hostilities,\" and refraining from \"the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"303800\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/1/#p31\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   art 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamdan v.

We now turn to that inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As a threshold matter, we must consider whether the district court had jurisdiction\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   to decide in the first instance whether Hamidullin qualified as a POW under the Third Geneva Convention, or whether Army Regulation 190-8 requires that his status first be determined by a military tribunal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Army Regulation 190-8 controls the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps approach to the treatment and care of enemy prisoners of war and other detainees. Army Reg. 190-8, i. The regulation articulates a general policy that \"[a]ll persons taken into custody by U.S. forces will be provided with the protections of the [Third Geneva Convention],\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   1-5(a)(2), and that \"[i]n accordance with Article 5 [of the Convention], if any doubt arises as to whether a person ... belongs to any of the categories enumerated in Article 4, ... such persons shall enjoy the protection of the [Third Geneva] Convention until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   1-6(a). Army Regulation 190-8 further states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A competent tribunal shall determine the status of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   person not appearing to be entitled to prisoner of war status who has committed a belligerent act or has engaged in hostile activities in aid of enemy armed forces, and who asserts that he or she is entitled to treatment as a prisoner of war, or concerning whom any doubt of a like nature exists.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   1-6(b) (emphasis added). Army Regulation 190-8 defines a competent tribunal as a tribunal \"composed of three commissioned officers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   1-6(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Hamidullin argues that Army Regulation 190-8 limits the ability of Article III courts to hear criminal claims against him. He contends that, like in the context of the federal prosecution of juveniles and hate crimes, when the Attorney General must make a certification to the district court demonstrating the unavailability or inappropriateness of state court prosecution prior to federal prosecution, the government must comply with Army Regulation 190-8 prior to proceeding with the criminal prosecution of captured combatants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205032\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20249\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). He asserts that Army Regulation 190-8 requires that any doubt about the applicability of combatant immunity to captured combatants be resolved in the first instance by a competent tribunal composed of three military officers. Because no such tribunal determined his status, Hamidullin contends that he is immune from criminal prosecution in civilian court and should be remanded to the custody of the U.S. military. This argument is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Army Regulation 190-8's general implementation of the Third Geneva Convention does not impact the district court's jurisdiction in this case. Army Regulation 190-8 confirms that persons taken into custody by U.S. forces will be provided Geneva Convention protections. The regulation implements Article 5 of the Convention and provides that if there is doubt as to whether a detained person is a POW, as defined by the Third Geneva Convention, the detainee \"shall enjoy the protection of the present Convention until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.\" Army Reg. 190-8, 1-6(a). Critically, however, Army Regulation 190-8, in implementing Article 5, is also restricted by Article 5's applicability. Article 2 of the Convention provides that the Article 5 determination of POW status by a competent tribunal is only applicable in cases of international armed conflict between Convention signatories. Consequently, Army Regulation 190-8, by its own terms, only provides that POW status is determined by a competent tribunal in cases of international armed conflict. We conclude, however, that at the time of Hamidullin's offense, the conflict in Afghanistan was not an international armed conflict, and therefore that the Army Regulation 190-8 and the Article 5 requirement that POW status be determined by a competent tribunal does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The conflict in Afghanistan began in 2001 as an international armed conflict arising between two or more Third Geneva Convention signatories-it was a conflict between the United States and its coalition partners on one side, and the Taliban-controlled Afghan government on the other.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 265-66. Shortly thereafter, in 2002, the Taliban lost control of the government and was replaced by a government led by Hamid Karzai.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 270. The United States and its coalition partners remained in Afghanistan at the request of this new government, assisting it in combating the continued Taliban insurgency. J.A. 311-12. Thus, by 2009, the conflict in Afghanistan had shifted from an international armed conflict between the United States and the Taliban-run Afghan government to a non-international armed conflict against unlawful Taliban insurgents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Pictet Commentary, which the Supreme Court has found instructive in interpreting the Third Geneva Convention in\n   <em>\n    Hamdan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500459\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/557/#p629\">\n    548 U.S. at 619-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500459\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/557/#p629\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , supports the conclusion that in 2009, the conflict in Afghanistan was non-international. The Pictet Commentary explains that Article 4(A)(3) of the Convention, which defines POWs to include \"[m]embers\n   of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a government or an authority not recognized by the Detaining Power,\" Third Geneva Convention, art. 4(A)(3), was a response to the refusal of certain states to recognize the combatant immunity of French followers of General Charles de Gaulle fighting during World War II, ICRC,\n   <em>\n    Commentary to Geneva Convention III Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War\n   </em>\n   62 (J. Pictet ed., 1960) (\"[Article 4] must be interpreted, in the first place, in the light of the actual case which motivated its drafting-that of the forces of General de Gaulle which were under the authority of the French National Liberation Committee.\"). Article 4(A)(3) was drafted to afford POW protections to combatants who, like the Free French led by General de Gaulle, continued to engage in armed conflict even after a new government had been installed in their country and reached an armistice with a once-adversary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61-63. However, Article 4(A)(3) is not without limit; indeed, the drafters of the Third Geneva Convention feared that an overly broad interpretation of Article 4(A)(3) would be \"open to abusive interpretation\" and lead \"to the formation of armed bands.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62, 63. The Pictet Commentary, therefore, makes clear that the installation of a new government by an invading power is not enough to convert a conflict from international to non-international. Rather, some level of international recognition is required for the conflict to remain an \"international armed conflict.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63 (\"It is not expressly stated that this Government or authority must, as a minimum requirement, be recognized by third States, but\n   <em>\n    this condition is consistent with the spirit of the provision\n   </em>\n   , which was founded on the specific case of the forces of General de Gaulle.\" (emphasis added) ). In the case of the Free French, the ousted government led by General de Gaulle was recognized by the Allied forces. Conversely, by the time Hamidullin was captured, the Taliban had been removed from power for eight years and\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   country recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. J.A. 275-76 (explaining that the last country recognizing the Taliban government withdrew its recognition within months of 9/11). Thus, the Pictet Commentary suggests that in 2009, the conflict in Afghanistan was a non-international armed conflict for the purposes of the Convention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The International Committee of the Red Cross and the executive branch of the United States government have reached this same conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ICRC,\n   <em>\n    International Humanitarian Law and the Challenges of Contemporary Armed Conflicts\n   </em>\n   10 (2011) (\"As the armed conflict does not oppose two or more states, i.e. as all the state actors are on the same side, the conflict must be classified as non-international, regardless of the international component, which can at times be significant.

Common sense agrees. If the conflict in Afghanistan was originally an international armed conflict occurring between two \"High Contracting Parties\"-the United States and the Afghan government-the\n   conflict cannot remain international when the conflict between the recognized Afghan government and the United States has ceased. Accordingly, the provision in Army Regulation 190-8 directing that POW status be determined in accordance with Article 5 is inapplicable, and Hamidullin's argument that these provisions require a competent tribunal to determine his POW status must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Instead, because we conclude that the conflict in Afghanistan was non-international at the time of Hamidullin's offense, the protections of Article 3 of the Convention apply. Under Article 3, however, there is no provision entitling combatants captured during non-international conflicts to POW status or the resulting combatant immunity. Therefore, there is no process by which Hamidullin is entitled to a determination of whether he is a POW, as no POW status exists under Article 3, and, consequently, combatant immunity cannot be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Pursuant to Article 3, Hamidullin can be sentenced in a \"regularly constituted court\" that is \"established and organised in accordance with the laws and procedures already in force in a country.\" 1 ICRC,\n   <em>\n    Customary Int'l Humanitarian Law\n   </em>\n   355 (2005) (interpreting Third Geneva Convention, art. 3).

He frames this defense as a public authority defense, citing\n   <em>\n    Dow v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   and other post-Civil War jurisprudence.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4631\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/100/158/#p165\">\n    100 U.S. 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 165,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4631\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/100/158/#p165\">\n    25 L.Ed. 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1879) (\"[F]rom the very nature of war, the tribunals of the enemy must be without jurisdiction to sit in judgment upon the military conduct of the officers and soldiers of the invading army.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coleman v.

Hamidullin argues that just as defendants who act in objectively reasonable reliance on the authority of a government official are immune from criminal liability,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Fulcher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11096126\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/250/244/#p252\">\n    250 F.3d 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 252-53 (4th Cir. 2001), soldiers in armed conflict are immune from criminal liability when they act by virtue of the direction of a belligerent party. Typically, however, the public authority defense looks to whether the defendant's actions were sanctioned by a U.S. official, as foreign officials do not have authority to authorize violations of U.S. criminal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 Charles E. Torcia,\n   <em>\n    Wharton's Criminal Law\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 41 (15th ed. 2015) (\"The fact that a crime committed in time of peace was committed under the directions of the authority of a foreign government is no defense.\"). Nonetheless, Hamidullin asserts that \"immunity from ordinary criminal liability applies without distinction between soldiers who fight on behalf of a State and opposing forces who assert a rival claim to sovereign authority.\" Appellant Br. 35. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Third Geneva Convention is the governing articulation of lawful combatant status. The principles reflected in the common law decisions cited by Hamidullin were refined and collected in 20th century efforts to codify the international law of war that resulted in the Third Geneva Convention. Just as a statute preempts common law when Congress speaks directly to the question,\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    City of Milwaukee v. Illinois &amp; Michigan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185830\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/304/#p315\">\n    451 U.S. 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 315,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185830\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/304/#p315\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185830\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/304/#p315\">\n    68 L.Ed.2d 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981),\n   a self-executing treaty like the Third Geneva Convention would similarly preempt common law if the treaty speaks directly to the question. The Third Geneva Convention explicitly defines the category of individuals entitled to POW status, and concomitantly, combatant immunity. Third Geneva Convention, art. 4. As such, the Third Geneva Convention's definition of lawful and unlawful combatants is conclusive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Moreover, Hamidullin's broad framing of common law combatant immunity would extend immunity far beyond the Third Geneva Convention, to every person acting on behalf of an organization that claims sovereignty. For example, it could supply a claim of immunity to terrorists operating on behalf of the Islamic State, which itself claims sovereignty. We decline to broaden the scope of combatant immunity beyond the carefully constructed framework of the Geneva Convention. The Convention represents an international consensus on the norms of treatment of prisoners, a consensus that would be eviscerated if common law principles were interpreted as superseding. Because Hamidullin does not qualify for combatant immunity pursuant to the Third Geneva Convention, he likewise does not qualify for the common law defense of public authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Last, Hamidullin challenges his conviction for conspiring and attempting to destroy a U.S. military aircraft in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2032\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Section 32(b) criminalizes the damage or destruction of \"civil aircraft registered in a country other than the United States.\" The district court held that the plain language of \u00a7 32(a) applies to unlawful acts even when committed in a combat zone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Hamidullin argues that Congress did not intend to apply \u00a7 32 to military personnel whose attacks on aircraft are accepted under the laws of armed conflict. To support this contention, he relies on a memorandum from the Office of Legal Counsel which analyzed \u00a7 32(b) and reasoned that \u00a7 32(b) should not be construed to \"have the surprising and almost certainly unintended effect of criminalizing actions by military personnel that are lawful under international law.\" United States Assistance to Countries that Shoot Down Civil Aircraft Involved in Drug Trafficking,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Op.%20O.L.C.%20148\">\n    18 Op.

He claims that Congress did not intend \u00a7 32 to apply to the actions of \"military force\" that are lawful under international law. However, as described above, Hamidullin was not a lawful combatant and his conduct was not lawful under the Third Geneva Convention. Hence, the district court did not err in determining that the plain language of \u00a7 32(a) applied to Hamidullin's conduct. Here, Hamidullin was convicted of attempting to fire anti-aircraft weapons at U.S. military helicopters. Given Hamidullin's status as an unlawful combatant, that attack falls under the plain language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2032\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We do not take our duty to respect and comply with the tenets of international law lightly.

Nonetheless, for the foregoing reasons, it is clear to us that neither the Third Geneva Convention nor U.S. Army regulations grant Hamidullin immunity from criminal prosecution in an Article III court. Moreover, the text of \u00a7 32(a) clearly applies to these facts.

The President's status declaration was a collective, not an individual, one. Empowering different panels of military officers to determine case by case whether Taliban fighters are entitled to POW status would throw the entire concept of a collective judgment overboard and would result in the disparate treatment of similarly situated detainees. And it would hamstring our country in its ability to approach armed conflicts in a unified fashion. It would also undermine the consistent practice of both the United States and its allies to uniformly treat Taliban fighters as insurgents who lack any claim to the Third Geneva Convention's combatant immunity defense. But perhaps most alarmingly, allowing status determinations under AR 190-8 to control here would threaten to elevate every band of terrorists around the world to near nation-state status and, in so doing, to extend the protections of the Third Geneva Convention to those who both regularly and flagrantly violate its dictates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   For years, the aim of Taliban fighters was to get into the civilian courts. When those courts proved also capable of imposing just punishment, Taliban defendants sought to discredit them too. As Judge Floyd's cogent opinion demonstrates, this whole exercise is a shell game designed to play one part of American governance against another. An affirmance here respects the proper roles of our President, our Congress, our courts, our military, and the international alliance against the worldwide scourge of terrorism in which our nation plays such a crucial part.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-197\">\n    Among other procedural matters addressed in Army Regulation 190-8 are the following: listing the order in which the members of the tribunal and the recorder are sworn; requiring that a written record be made of the proceedings; mandating that the proceedings be open, save for deliberation, voting, or other matters that could compromise security; advising the captive person of his rights at the outset of the proceedings; providing the captive person with access to all open sessions of the proceedings and, if needed, an interpreter; allowing the captive person to call and question reasonably available witnesses, or to submit written statements to be considered as evidence; affording the captive person the right to testify or otherwise address the tribunal; protecting the captive person from being compelled to testify; requiring a written report of the tribunal decision; and identifying possible determinations, including that the captive person is a POW or an innocent civilian.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Reg. 190-8 at \u00a7 1-6(e)(1)-(8), (10).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-77\">\n   KING, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Whether Irek Hamidullin qualifies as a prisoner of war (a \"POW\") under the Third Geneva Convention implicates two difficult questions with great potential repercussions for international relations and the safety and security of our military personnel abroad: (1) whether the war in Afghanistan against the Taliban was an international armed conflict within the meaning of the Third Convention's Article 2 when Hamidullin was captured by the U.S. Army in late 2009; and (2) whether Hamidullin satisfies one of the categories of POWs articulated in the Convention's Article 4. Hamidullin and the Government mutually left those questions to be answered by the district court-simply presenting evidence and argument in support of their respective theories-without asserting that either issue had already been conclusively determined by the Executive Branch and without contesting the district court's authority to decide the issues in the first instance. Thereafter, the district court opted to avoid the Article 2 question (recognizing that it \"may elude a definitive answer\"), proceeded to its own Article 4 analysis, and concluded that Hamidullin is not eligible for POW status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Va. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Only later, after we raised concerns in this appeal about whether the Third Convention questions are initially for the Executive or the Judiciary, did the parties change stances on the district court's power to dispose of Hamidullin's POW claim. Hamidullin has since been firm that the Article 2 international armed conflict question is for the courts, but that, regardless of the status of the war, he is entitled to have a military tribunal assess his Article 4 eligibility for POW status pursuant to Army Regulation 190-8. Meanwhile, the Government has wavered between arguing that the Executive Branch has rendered unassailable determinations on the relevant Third Convention issues and contending that those issues should be decided by the courts, albeit with some deference to the Executive's views.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Indeed, the Government has asserted both that the Executive's \"determinations constitute a classic exercise of the President's war powers and his authority over foreign affairs,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Br. of Appellee 13, and that \"the judicial branch must render its own decision on the availability of immunity to criminal charges here,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Second Suppl. Br. of Appellee 14. With respect to each premise, the Government invokes a statement issued by President George W. Bush on February 7, 2002 (the \"2002 Presidential Statement\"), which deemed the war against the Taliban to be an Article 2 international armed conflict but purported to categorically exclude Taliban fighters from POW status under Article 4. According to the Government, the Executive explicitly-or maybe just implicitly-abandoned the 2002 Presidential Statement's Article 2 judgment by 2009. The Government insists, however, that the Executive continues to adhere to the Statement's sweeping Article 4 ruling-notwithstanding widespread condemnation of that ruling, including criticism from the Supreme Court and the Government's own expert witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In my view, these circumstances demand a clear statement from the Executive Branch on whether Hamidullin should be accorded POW status and, if not, an explanation as to why not. Contrary to the Government, the Executive has not already rendered Article 2 and Article 4 determinations to which we can or should defer. Yet I agree with the Government insofar as it contends the Third Convention questions are initially for the Executive, not the courts. Consequently, I would remand this matter for the limited purpose of the Executive's consideration and explanation of Hamidullin's POW status. Such a remand would not necessarily include the military tribunal sought by Hamidullin. Perhaps instead, the President would pronounce that the war against the Taliban was not an Article 2 international armed conflict at the time of Hamidullin's capture in late 2009. Or perhaps the President would endorse the 2002 Presidential Statement's categorical Article 4 ruling and proclaim its continuing applicability. Or perhaps the President would elect to bestow POW protections upon Hamidullin, regardless of Article 2 and Article 4, in an effort to obtain reciprocal treatment of U.S. forces. Whatever the Executive would decide, we would have the opportunity for an informed and appropriate review upon this matter's return to our Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   My distinguished colleagues, however, reckon that the Third Convention questions are a matter of treaty interpretation primarily for the Judiciary, not the Executive Branch.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 71-72 (explaining that \"there can be no question that it is the role of the judiciary, not the executive, to interpret treaties,\" though \"the executive may engage in the interpretation of treaties in [certain circumstances and thereby] inform the judiciary's own interpretations\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Like the district court, my friends resolve the conflicting evidence and authorities to confidently declare that Hamidullin cannot be a POW. Nonetheless, the panel majority takes a tack different from the district court's.

Additionally, the majority rejects Hamidullin's argument that, regardless of the status of the war, Regulation 190-8 entitles him to have his Article 4 eligibility for POW status determined by a military tribunal. According to the majority, agreeing with Hamidullin on that point would strip the federal courts of the jurisdiction to interpret treaties, as well as the jurisdiction to adjudicate crimes, and would flout the 2002 Presidential Statement's Article 4 ruling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 73 (\"Hamidullin not only asks this Court to abdicate our duty to decide cases properly within our jurisdiction, but also asks us to ignore the legal determination already made by the President of the United States ....

After the U.S. Army captured Hamidullin, he was indicted in the Eastern District of Virginia on criminal charges arising from the attack. Significantly, nothing in the record explains how or why Hamidullin was transferred from military to civilian custody, or how he ended up in Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The initial indictment against Hamidullin was returned by the grand jury in Richmond in October 2014 and twice superseded, most recently in April 2015 by the operative indictment in Hamidullin's trial (the \"Indictment\"). The Indictment charged fifteen offenses, all under Title 18 of the United States Code: conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists ( \u00a7 2339A ); providing material support to terrorists ( \u00a7 2339A ); conspiracy to destroy an aircraft of the armed forces of the United States ( \u00a7 32 ); attempting to destroy an aircraft of the armed forces of the United States ( \u00a7 32 ); conspiracy to kill an officer or employee of the United States or a person assisting such officer or employee (\u00a7 1117); two counts of attempting to kill an officer or employee of the United States or a person assisting such officer or employee (\u00a7 1114); conspiracy to murder a national of the United States (\u00a7 2332(b) ); two counts of attempting to murder a national of the United States (\u00a7 2332(b) ); two counts of engaging in physical violence with intent to cause serious bodily injury to a national of the United States (\u00a7 2332(c) ); conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction (\u00a7 2332a); possession of a firearm in connection with a crime of violence (\u00a7 924(c) ); and conspiracy to possess a firearm in connection with a crime of violence (\u00a7 924(o) ). Several of the charges included allegations under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   of aiding and abetting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Hamidullin promptly moved in the district court for dismissal of the Indictment, invoking Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Hamidullin sought dismissal of the criminal charges on multiple grounds, including that, pursuant to the Third Geneva Convention, he is a POW who did not violate the law of war and thus cannot be prosecuted in a civilian or military court. Hamidullin has decried his prosecution for being \"premised on the radical conceit that in Afghanistan, only one side of an ongoing war is authorized to shoot.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opening Br. of Appellant 14. He has proffered that he should instead \"be detained as an enemy combatant for the duration of hostilities in Afghanistan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   As previously explained, the Third Geneva Convention issues relevant to Hamidullin's POW claim are whether the war in Afghanistan against the Taliban was an international armed conflict within the meaning of the Third Convention's Article 2 at the time of Hamidullin's capture in late 2009, and whether Hamidullin falls within one of the six categories of POWs articulated in the Convention's Article 4. Those disputed issues were presented by the parties to the district court for initial consideration, rather than first being determined by the Executive Branch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   In June 2015, the district court conducted a hearing on Hamidullin's motion to dismiss and heard evidence from the parties' expert witnesses on the Third Convention issues, generating hundreds of pages of transcribed testimony and a multitude of exhibits. The witnesses explained in some detail the background of the Taliban and the Haqqani Network with which the Taliban was affiliated. The witnesses also explained the status of the government of Afghanistan from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States until Hamidullin's capture in 2009. That is, in the view of the United States and most other countries, the Taliban constituted the de facto government of Afghanistan until it was ousted from power in late 2001. Only three countries (Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia) had ever given diplomatic recognition to the Taliban as Afghanistan's de jure government, and each withdrew its recognition shortly after the 2001 terrorist attacks. The Taliban was replaced by the de jure government of Hamid Karzai, which began as an interim government in late 2001 and then was elected in 2004. Over the years, the Karzai government has been accorded diplomatic recognition by the United States and many other countries. The United States and allies have continued to assist Afghan forces in fighting the Taliban.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The evidence admitted at the hearing and addressed by expert witnesses included the 2002 Presidential Statement-a statement that followed the Taliban's ouster from power in Afghanistan, came during the Karzai government's interim rule, and preceded Hamidullin's capture by more than seven years. By that statement, the President declared \"that the provisions of [the Third] Geneva [Convention] will apply to our present conflict with the Taliban.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2002 Presidential Statement at 1. In other words, the President determined that, at least as of early 2002, the war against the Taliban constituted an Article 2 international armed conflict. The 2002 Presidential Statement advised, however, that Taliban detainees are categorically excluded from POW status under Article 4.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"I determine that the Taliban detainees are unlawful combatants and, therefore, do not qualify as prisoners of war under Article 4 of [the Third] Geneva [Convention].\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   During the hearing, the expert witnesses also addressed various materials invoked by the parties in support of their respective positions. The Government submitted, for example, a 2007 report of the International Committee of the Red Cross (the \"ICRC\") deeming the ongoing hostilities in Afghanistan to be an Article 3 non-international armed conflict-\"albeit with an international component in the form of a foreign military presence on one of the sides\"-\"because it is being waged with the consent and support of the respective domestic authorities and does not involve two opposed States.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Int'l Comm. of the Red Cross,\n   <em>\n    International Humanitarian Law and the Challenges of Contempo\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    rary Armed Conflicts\n   </em>\n   , 89 Int'l Rev. of the Red Cross, 719, 725 (2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   In support of the argument that the war against the Taliban remains an Article 2 international armed conflict because it began as one, Hamidullin presented, inter alia, a 1995 submission made by the U.S. Government itself in a war crimes prosecution in the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. There, the Government asserted that \"it is artificial and improper to attempt to divide [a conflict] into isolated segments, either geographically or chronologically, in an attempt to exclude the application of [the Third Convention].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Submission of the Government of the United States of America Concerning Certain Arguments Made by Counsel for the Accused at 28,\n   <em>\n    The Prosecutor of the Tribunal v. Dusko Tadic\n   </em>\n   , No. IT-94-1 (ICTY July 17, 1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The expert witnesses at the district court's June 2015 hearing disagreed on the applicability of the Third Convention to Hamidullin and other Taliban and Haqqani fighters. One of the Government's witnesses testified that-although the United States had initially characterized the war against the Taliban as an international armed conflict under the Convention's Article 2-the war became an Article 3 non-international armed conflict after the Karzai government was elected in 2004. That witness acknowledged that the 2002 Presidential Statement deeming the war to be an Article 2 international armed conflict had \"never been officially changed.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 368.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The witness also recognized that there was precedent, arising from the\n   <em>\n    Tadic\n   </em>\n   war crimes prosecution in the mid-1990s, for the proposition that the United States should continue to treat the war as an international armed conflict because of its initial characterization.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    at 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition, the witness observed that the United States' longstanding \"practice has been to follow the rules for an international armed conflict without making a legal determination as to whether they apply,\" based on \"a hope for reciprocity if our personnel fall into enemy hands.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    at 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nevertheless, the witness insisted that there \"was a sea change in how some of these things were looked at\" following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    at 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consistent with the 2007 ICRC report, the witness concluded that the war against the Taliban had become an Article 3 non-international armed conflict and thus that the Convention's Article 4 protections for POWs were not available in 2009 to forces of the Taliban and the Haqqani Network.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The same witness further opined that, even assuming the war against the Taliban qualified as an international armed conflict in 2009, no Taliban and Haqqani fighters can satisfy Article 4 criteria for POWs. The witness premised that conclusion on an independent analysis, without relying on the 2002 Presidential Statement's Article 4 determination. Importantly, the witness acknowledged that the 2002 Presidential Statement's Article 4 determination was \"flawed\" and \"politically based rather than based on law,\" in that it did not take all of the Article 4 factors into account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 400-01 (confirming his view that \"President Bush erred in accepting the advice of individuals who lacked military experience and ... possessed skepticism, if not [disdain,] for the law of war, over [the advice] of individuals with military combat and substantial law of war expertise\n   and experience\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   By contrast, Hamidullin's expert witness testified that-because the war against the Taliban began as an Article 2 international armed conflict-it remained so through 2009 and beyond. That witness also rejected the notion that the war may be characterized as an Article 3 non-international armed conflict, relying on news reports that the United States had attacked Taliban targets outside Afghanistan (in Pakistan), and that Pakistan and Iran have supplied the Taliban with troops, weapons, and other materials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 440 (acknowledging that \"[s]ome of this may be classified\" and thus verifiable only by government officials and others with appropriate security clearances).

In so doing, the court explained that the complexity of its analysis was compounded by a dearth of judicial authority applying the law of war to the conflict in Afghanistan. As the court observed, \"[w]hile the legal landscape is filled with respectable military and scholarly treatises, along with a host of public policy position papers, few courts have had occasion to venture into this terrain.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamidullin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362635\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/114/365/#p387\">\n    114 F.Supp.3d at 367-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In rendering its analysis, the court did not invoke or evidently accord any deference to the 2002 Presidential Statement's Article 4 determination. Furthermore, the court did not acknowledge either the Third Convention's requirement for Article 5 proceedings before a \"competent tribunal,\" or Army Regulation 190-8's directive that Article 5 proceedings in the United States are to be conducted by a tribunal of three commissioned military officers. In the circumstances, the court also did not address whether or how a U.S. court could be a \"competent tribunal\" authorized to conduct Article 5 proceedings and decide a POW claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   By their opening appellate briefs, the parties disputed the correctness of the district court's POW determination-but they did not question the court's authority to decide Hamidullin's POW status in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Notably, the Government argued that the 2002 Presidential Statement's categorical exclusion of Taliban fighters from POW status under Article 4 \"is entitled to a degree of deference as a reasonable interpretation and application of the [Third Geneva Convention] to the Taliban by the Commander in Chief.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opening Br. of Appellee 34.

The Government did not then assert that the Article 2 issue had already been decided by the Executive Branch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   During the initial oral argument in this appeal, in December 2016, we questioned the parties about the district court's authority to decide Hamidullin's POW status in the first instance. Soon thereafter, we received from the Government what it purported was a definitive Executive Branch statement on the nature of the war against the Taliban: a December 2016 report signed by President Barack Obama and entitled\n   <em>\n    Report on the Legal and Policy Frameworks Guiding the United States' Use of Military Force and Related National Security Operations\n   </em>\n   (the \"2016 Presidential Report\"). The 2016 Presidential Report indicated that the war in Afghanistan against the Taliban was an Article 3 non-international armed conflict as of late 2016, without explaining when the war transformed from an Article 2 international armed conflict or specifying the status of the war at the time of Hamidullin's capture in late 2009. For example, the Report stated that \"the United States is currently engaged in hostilities against only non-State actors,\" i.e., non-international armed conflicts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 Report at 19. That statement did not concern the nature of the war against the Taliban in late 2009, the time relevant to Hamidullin's POW claim. Elsewhere, the Report referred to non-international armed conflicts \"such as the hostilities authorized by the 2001 [Authorization for Use of Military Force (the 'AUMF') ].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32. As the Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Hamdan v. Rumsfeld\n   </em>\n   , the AUMF authorized both the war against al Qaeda (a non-international armed conflict) and the war against the Taliban (at least initially an international armed conflict).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500459\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/557/#p629\">\n    548 U.S. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 568,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500459\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/557/#p629\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500459\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/557/#p629\">\n    165 L.Ed.2d 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). Thus, the 2016 Presidential Report's reference to non-international armed conflicts authorized by the AUMF did not specify the nature of the war against the Taliban in late 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Additionally, the 2016 Presidential Report advised that \"the United States often applies policies that are more restrictive than what would be required as a matter of law,\" leaving open the possibility that Hamidullin could be accorded POW status even if the Executive considers the war against the Taliban to be a non-international armed conflict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 Report at 19. Nonetheless, when it submitted the Report to this Court, the Government asserted that the Report \"reflects the United States' view that the conflict in Afghanistan is a non-international armed conflict,\" and \"[t]hat conclusion alone\" renders POW status unavailable to Hamidullin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter under Fed.

The Government also repeated arguments aimed at convincing us to affirm the district court's determination that Hamidullin does not qualify as a POW under Article 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   In response, Hamidullin confirmed his view that the characterization of a war as an Article 2 international armed conflict or an Article 3 non-international armed conflict \"is for the Court, not the Executive.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response to Letter under Fed.

Hamidullin\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-4788 (4th Cir. June 23, 2017), ECF No. 48. In so doing, we advised that \"[t]he briefs should discuss the effect of Army Regulation 190-8 on the court's jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/#p550\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The parties simultaneously filed supplemental opening and response briefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Strikingly, the Government's supplemental briefs contended that the Third Convention determinations relevant to Hamidullin's POW claim \"are properly made by the Commander-in-Chief or other higher authorities in the Executive Branch\"-not a military tribunal or, by implication, a federal court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Br. of Appellee 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (reiterating that \"overarching questions, such as the appropriate classification of the conflict, ... properly belong to higher authorities within the Executive Branch\"). In addition to asserting that the Third Convention issues were for the Executive to decide, the Government declared that the Executive had in fact made the relevant determinations herein, i.e., that the war against the Taliban was an Article 3 non-international armed conflict by late 2009 (apparently based on the 2016 Presidential Report), and that, in any event, Taliban fighters are categorically excluded from POW status under Article 4 (based on the 2002 Presidential Statement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Of course, the Government had previously treated the district court as the appropriate first adjudicator of the Third Convention issues and had conceded that the 2002 Presidential Statement was not\n   dispositive of Hamidullin's POW claim. Without acknowledging or explaining its significant change of position, the Government now insisted that \"Hamidullin's legal status has been determined by a 'competent authority' within the meaning of [Army Regulation 190-8] because the President-the highest 'competent authority' on the subject-conclusively determined in 2002 that Taliban detainees such as Hamidullin do not qualify for POW status.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Br. of Appellee 2. From there, the Government defended the district court's disposition of Hamidullin's POW claim as consistent with Regulation 190-8 and the Executive's pronouncements because there is no doubt that Hamidullin is ineligible to be deemed a POW. The Government also cautioned us, in emphatic terms, that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   [t]he Executive's determinations regarding the character of the conflict, the status of the Taliban, and the proper application of the [Third Convention] and [Regulation] 190-8 are entitled to great deference by this Court. These determinations constitute a classic exercise of the President's war powers and his authority over foreign affairs that also implicates his exclusive authority to determine whether a foreign government merits recognition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   In his supplemental briefs, Hamidullin for the first time argued that Army Regulation 190-8 requires that a military tribunal determine his POW status, and that such a determination is a prerequisite to his criminal prosecution. According to Hamidullin, \"[b]ecause the Executive Branch failed to follow its own regulation and the [Third Convention] in this case, [he] retains status as a prisoner of war and is immune from ordinary criminal liability,\" thereby necessitating that we \"vacate his convictions and remand with the direction that he be transferred to the custody of the U.S. military and afforded treatment in accordance with Army Regulation 190-8.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Br. of Appellant 14-15. Hamidullin stood by his position that the war against the Taliban remains an Article 2 international armed conflict, but contended that the status of the war is irrelevant, in that \"[n]othing in [Regulation 190-8's] language limits [its] application based on the type of conflict in which a person is seized.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Response Br. of Appellant 2 (invoking the provision of Regulation 190-8 at \u00a7 1-5(a)(2) that \"\n   <em>\n    [a]ll\n   </em>\n   persons taken into custody by U.S. forces will be provided with the protections of the [Third Convention] until some other legal status is determined by competent authority\" (emphasis added) ). Hamidullin also asserted \"that a detainee's seizure by U.S. forces in armed conflict coupled with an assertion of prisoner of war status is equivalent to 'doubt' which requires the detainee to be treated as a POW until a competent tribunal, as defined by [Regulation 190-8], decides otherwise.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (citing Army Reg. 190-8 at \u00a7 1-6(b) ). Moreover, Hamidullin criticized the Government for relying on the 2002 Presidential Statement and ignoring \"the near-universal conclusion, since [the Statement] was issued, that the President's [Article 4] determination violated the [Third Convention] and [Regulation] 190-8.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Following our announcement that the second oral argument in this matter would be held in December 2017, the Government opted to file an additional supplemental brief. No longer arguing that the relevant Third Convention issues were conclusively determined by the 2016 Presidential Report and the 2002 Presidential Statement, the Government seemed to revert to its original position that it was up to the courts to decide whether the war against the Taliban was an Article 2 international armed conflict in late 2009 and whether Hamidullin is eligible for POW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   status under Article 4. The Government merely included the 2016 Presidential Report in a string of authorities cited for the purpose of convincing us to find that the war had become an Article 3 non-international armed conflict prior to Hamidullin's capture. Meanwhile, the Government did not explicitly reference the 2002 Presidential Statement at all. Rather, the Government mentioned only that the Executive Branch \"has specifically determined that members of the Taliban are not entitled to POW protections,\" and did so only in the course of urging us to affirm the POW determination made by the district court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Suppl. Br. of Appellee 14 (\"To be sure, the judicial branch must render its own decision on the availability of immunity to criminal charges here. But a joint judgment of the political branches in this arena is entitled to the utmost deference from this Court.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   At the second oral argument, however, the Government revived its theory that the Executive Branch has already answered the Article 2 and Article 4 questions. Rather than crediting the 2016 Presidential Report with deciding the Article 2 issue, the Government asserted it is implicit in the manner the United States has carried out the war against the Taliban since 2001 that the Executive Branch changed the status of the war from an Article 2 international armed conflict to an Article 3 non-international armed conflict by 2009. With respect to the Article 4 issue, the Government reiterated its reliance on the 2002 Presidential Statement. For his part, Hamidullin stood firm that the Article 2 question is for the courts, but that Army Regulation 190-8 in any event guarantees a military tribunal's assessment of his POW status under Article 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   That brings us to today, when my friends of the panel majority have taken it upon themselves-under the guise of treaty interpretation-to resolve the conflicting evidence and authorities to make their original determination that the war against the Taliban was no longer an Article 2 international armed conflict by 2009. Additionally, the majority rejects Hamidullin's argument that, regardless of the status of the war, Regulation 190-8 entitles him to have his Article 4 eligibility for POW status determined by a military tribunal. According to the majority, its decision safeguards the courts' jurisdiction to interpret treaties and adjudicate crimes, and also respects the 2002 Presidential Statement. As explained below, however, the majority actually usurps the authority of the Executive Branch and fails to grapple with significant questions surrounding the enforceability of the 2002 Presidential Statement's categorical Article 4 ruling. I therefore must dissent from the majority's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   As I see it, the Third Geneva Convention questions underlying Hamidullin's POW claim are initially for the Executive Branch, not the Judiciary. Crucially, we are asked here not to simply interpret the Third Convention-as the Judiciary is entirely capable and qualified to do-but to determine whether the Convention applies to particular hostilities and a particular detainee. In the circumstances, I believe we must refer the Third Convention questions to the Executive for first consideration and then review its answers as appropriate. Indeed, the Government itself espoused in its original supplemental brief that it is the Executive's role to determine \"the character of the conflict, the status of the Taliban, and the proper application of the [Third Convention] and [Army Regulation] 190-8,\" as those \"determinations constitute a classic exercise of the President's\n   war powers and his authority over foreign affairs that also implicates his exclusive authority to determine whether a foreign government merits recognition.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl.

Unlike the\n   <em>\n    Hamdan\n   </em>\n   Court, however, we are not reviewing an Executive Branch determination, and we cannot restrict ourselves to a clear-cut interpretation of the Third Convention. Instead, we are asked to determine in the first instance whether particular hostilities (the war against the Taliban, as of late 2009) constituted an Article 2 international armed conflict, and whether a particular detainee (Hamidullin) is eligible for Article 4 POW status. Despite those material distinctions and in contravention of\n   <em>\n    Hamdan\n   </em>\n   's cautious approach, the panel majority takes up the Third Convention questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The unsuitability of leaving the Third Convention questions to the courts is also illustrated by the panel majority's decision, wherein the majority determines that when Hamidullin was captured by the U.S. Army in late 2009, \"the conflict in Afghanistan was not an international armed conflict.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 69. The Article 2 determination is premised on factual findings rendered by the majority, including that \"[t]he conflict in Afghanistan began in 2001 as ... a conflict between the United States and its coalition partners on one side, and the Taliban-controlled Afghan government on the other,\" and that since \"the Taliban lost control of the government and was replaced by a government led by Hamid Karzai,\" there merely has been a conflict in Afghanistan \"against unlawful Taliban insurgents.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 69-70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   \"It is axiomatic, however, as our Judge Hall eloquently explained, that appellate courts do not make factual findings.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

Furthermore, the panel majority's factual findings are on shaky evidentiary ground. The record contains only the evidence-much of it disputed-that the parties chose to present. And even that evidence casts doubt on the majority's findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   For example, in opining that the war against the Taliban cannot be characterized as an Article 3 non-international armed conflict, Hamidullin's expert witness pointed to news reports that the war has not been confined to Afghanistan (the United States having attacked Taliban targets in Pakistan), and that the Taliban has been supported by other countries (Pakistan and Iran having supplied troops, weapons, and other materials).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 440. The witness explained that the reported information was probably classified but could be verified by government officials with appropriate security clearances.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11328385\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/56/556/#p575\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Yet the panel majority does not acknowledge\n   or confront Hamidullin's evidence in finding that the war has been waged only in Afghanistan and solely against the Taliban. Nor does the majority express any concern over the record's lack of classified, but potentially pertinent, evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Further undermining the panel majority's decision is its reliance on debatable, non-binding authorities and so-called \"[c]ommon sense.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 70-71 (simplifying the issue to the supposedly commonsensical proposition that \"[i]f the conflict in Afghanistan was originally an international armed conflict occurring between two 'High Contracting Parties'-the United States and the Afghan government-the conflict cannot remain international when the conflict between the recognized Afghan government and the United States has ceased\"). The majority wholly ignores the compelling contrary authorities that led the district court to conclude, quite understandably, that the Article 2 question may be unanswerable-at least on the limited materials submitted in these court proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Worse still, the panel majority allows for just two possibilities in its Article 2 analysis: first, that the war against the Taliban was an Article 2 international armed conflict in late 2009, leaving Hamidullin eligible to be adjudged a POW; or second, that the war was instead an Article 3 non-international armed conflict at the relevant time, excluding Hamidullin from POW status. An important third possibility would be available to the Executive Branch: that, notwithstanding the proper characterization of the war, Hamidullin may be treated as a POW. The 2016 Presidential Report reserved the right to exceed the requirements of the Third Convention, and the Government's expert witness recognized that the United States has long accorded POW status to detainees lacking legal entitlement in the hope of securing reciprocal treatment of U.S. forces. But, in the majority's conception of the courts as treaty interpreters, the Judiciary is without the authority to make such a discretionary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Other problems surface in the panel majority's decision where it rejects Hamidullin's argument that, regardless of the status of the war against the Taliban, Army Regulation 190-8 entitles him to have his Article 4 eligibility for POW status determined by a military tribunal. According to Hamidullin, all detainees who claim to be POWs must be accorded military tribunals for determination of their status. To be clear, I am not saying that argument is meritorious. I do not reach the issue, which I believe should be referred to the Executive Branch as part of its initial consideration of the Third Convention questions. What I am saying is that the majority's reasons for rejecting Hamidullin's argument are untenable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   First, the panel majority reasons that accepting Hamidullin's argument would strip the federal courts of the jurisdiction to interpret treaties and adjudicate crimes. In other words, the majority concludes that the courts possess the authority to decide in the first instance whether a detainee qualifies as a POW pursuant to Article 4 of the Third Convention-i.e., a federal court can be the \"competent tribunal\" required by the Convention's Article 5. I disagree. In the United States, Article 5 proceedings are to be conducted before a U.S. military tribunal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Army Reg. 190-8 at \u00a7 1-6. Arguably, the President also may decide detainees' POW status under Article 4. But the Article 4 question is not one that can be answered initially by the courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   As previously explained, the Third Convention leaves it to the High Contracting Parties to adopt laws and regulations to ensure the Convention's application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Geneva Convention art. 128. Thus, an Article 5 \"competent tribunal is established by domestic law,\" and \"[r]ules clarifying the tribunal's competence, composition and procedure must be provided by the detaining State.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Yasmin Naqvi,\n   <em>\n    Doubtful Prisoner-of-War Status\n   </em>\n   , 84 Int'l Rev. of the Red Cross 571, 593 (2002). Relevant to persons captured by the United States, Army Regulation 190-8 specifies the composition of an Article 5 competent tribunal-a military tribunal-and delineates the procedures to be followed in Article 5 proceedings. Among the extensive requirements and procedures spelled out in Regulation 190-8 is that the tribunal be comprised of three commissioned officers, with the senior ranking officer serving as the tribunal's President and an additional non-voting officer serving as its recorder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Army Reg. 190-8 at \u00a7 1-6(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Simply put, pursuant to Army Regulation 190-8, the United States has placed the responsibility for the Third Convention's Article 5 proceedings in the hands of military tribunals-not the federal courts. Because Regulation 190-8 has the force and effect of law, the courts are bound to respect and enforce it.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Al Warafi v.

First of all, Article 4 POW determinations, as previously stated, are not matters of simple treaty interpretation within the province of the courts. Additionally, as Hamidullin has contended, Regulation 190-8's requirement that a military tribunal make Article 4 POW determinations simply serves as a legal prerequisite to criminal prosecution.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20249\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (requiring certification from Attorney General before hate crimes prosecution may proceed);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20249\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5032 (similarly mandating certification for juvenile prosecution);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Suppl.

Nevertheless, the court engaged in its own assessment of Lindh's POW status and determined that he failed to prove that Taliban fighters satisfy the criteria set forth in Article 4(A)(2).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11449944\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/212/541/#p553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11449944\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/212/541/#p553\">\n    at 557-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that, \"even absent deference, the Taliban falls far short when measured against the four [Article 4(A)(2) ] criteria\").

More importantly, the majority's view defies the Convention and the United States' chosen scheme for making Article 4 POW determinations, as set forth in Army Regulation 190-8. Consequently, it is wrong for the majority to dismiss Hamidullin's quest for a military tribunal as an improper effort to strip the courts of jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The panel majority next invokes the 2002 Presidential Statement as a basis for rejecting Hamidullin's argument that Regulation 190-8 entitles him to have his Article 4 eligibility for POW status determined by a military tribunal. The majority explains that a remand to a military tribunal would \"necessarily involve a reconsideration of President Bush's [categorical Article 4 determination],\" and that it would be improper for this Court \"to provide a three-member military tribunal with the authority to displace the president's interpretation of the Convention.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 72-73;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 77 (Wilkinson, J., concurring) (\"A military regulation cannot overcome ... the Commander-in-Chief's declaration that 'Taliban detainees are unlawful combatants and, therefore, do not qualify as prisoners of war' under the Third Geneva Convention ....\" (quoting 2002 Presidential Statement at 2) ). In so doing, the majority unquestioningly accepts the 2002 Presidential Statement as a conclusive determination of the Article 4 question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Significantly, the panel majority does not acknowledge that the Government only belatedly invoked the 2002 Presidential Statement as dispositive of Hamidullin's Article 4 eligibility for POW status, precluding development in the district court of how much deference the Statement may be due. The majority also does not acknowledge that the Government has since taken inconsistent positions on the Statement's efficacy. Or that the Government's own expert witness condemned the Statement's Article 4 determination as \"flawed\" and \"politically based rather than based on law.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 400. Or that the district court, and the\n   <em>\n    Lindh\n   </em>\n   court before it, declined to defer to the Statement in conducting their own Article 4 analyses.

Particularly flummoxing is my good friend's separate opinion, wherein he accuses me of stubbornly and unreasonably ignoring the \"many\" \"clear statement[s] from the Executive Branch on whether Taliban and Haqqani fighters should be accorded POW status\"-including the 2002 Presidential Statement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 77 n.1 (Wilkinson, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks omitted).

They include the Government's initial appellate argument that the 2002 Presidential Statement's Article 4 determination is entitled to deference but not dispositive of Hamidullin's POW claim, and the Government's subsequent, inconsistent contention that the Statement conclusively renders Hamidullin ineligible for POW status.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/#p550\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing Opening Br. of Appellee 33-35; Suppl.

Meanwhile, the Government has not sought to supplement the record or otherwise provide an explanation that can be reviewed by this Court. As a former federal prosecutor, I know that if the Government could explain some satisfactory pre-prosecution process afforded Hamidullin, it would do so. I am not willing to accept that the mere fact of Hamidullin's prosecution guarantees that the Executive Branch properly considered his POW status-especially when the Government has seesawed between insisting, on the one hand, that the POW determination is for the courts, and on the other hand, that an\n   unassailable Executive determination has already been made (via the 2002 Presidential Statement, or maybe the 2016 Presidential Report, or perhaps implicitly some other way). The Government is not infallible, and I will not heedlessly treat it as such.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Pursuant to the foregoing, I respectfully dissent from the panel majority's decision. Rather than affirming Hamidullin's convictions (as the majority does), or vacating those convictions (as Hamidullin wants us to do), I would remand this matter for the limited purpose of the Executive Branch's consideration and explanation of Hamidullin's POW status. In my view, unless and until the Executive resolves his POW claim, Hamidullin should be treated in accordance with the Third Geneva Convention and Army Regulation 190-8. The district court should also be authorized to conduct related proceedings, including proceedings on the status of the criminal judgment against Hamidullin pending the Executive's resolution of his POW claim; proceedings to review, if appropriate, any POW determination made by the Executive; and proceedings to ascertain, in the wake of any POW determination, the extent of Hamidullin's susceptibility to criminal prosecution and the validity of the criminal judgment against him. Until such remand proceedings are completed, we should hold in abeyance the balance of this appeal, including Hamidullin's other grounds for dismissal of the Indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   With the utmost admiration for my distinguished colleagues, I therefore dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-194\">\n    Our friend in dissent longs for \"a clear statement from the Executive Branch\" on whether Taliban and Haqqani fighters should be accorded POW status. Dissent at 32. We have many. The President stated very clearly in 2002 that the answer is no. And the government's briefing in this case states very clearly that its position remains the same.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Br. of U.S. at 27-41; Second Supp. Br. of U.S. at 2. If the dissent really wishes a clear statement, it has only to look underfoot. The clearest statement imaginable that Taliban and Haqqani fighters should not be accorded POW status is the prosecution of Hamidullin that began in 2014 and the conviction of Hamidullin defended by the government on appeal. Actions may or may not speak louder than words. But here we are fortunate to have both.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-195\">\n    The Executive Branch is free, of course, to change its position at any time. But it has chosen not to do so. The President's declaration that the Taliban are unlawful enemy combatants has never been rescinded, superseded, or modified. In fact, its relevance could not have been diminished in 2009, the year Hamidullin was captured attacking U.S. aircraft. For by that time, the Taliban had been overthrown and the conflict had become a non-international armed conflict. And our allies have recognized that fact and acted accordingly. The dissent's appetite for an additional \"clear statement\" will do nothing but sow confusion in a delicate matter of international relations and prolong this case indefinitely. Perhaps the dissent would heed an additional statement if it received one under its indefinitely elongated timetable. Or perhaps it would ignore it as it has every clear statement the Executive Branch has already offered.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-196\">\n    Finally, the dissent's proffer of the truism that the government is not always right adds absolutely nothing to the question in this case of whether the Taliban should be accorded POW status. All the smoke and mirrors fail to change in even minor particular the consistent view of all post-9/11 administrations, and of America's allies in the Afghan fight, that the Taliban collectively are unlawful enemy combatants and not entitled to the broad jurisdictional immunity from Article III courts that Hamidullin now claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-198\">\n    Citations herein to \"J.A. ----\" refer to the contents of the Joint Appendix filed by the parties in this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-199\">\n    Other aspects of the district court's Article 4 analysis also bear mentioning. The court treated Hamidullin's POW claim as an affirmative defense that Hamidullin bore the burden of proving. Rather than considering the characteristics of Hamidullin individually, the court focused on Taliban and Haqqani fighters generally. In any event, the court had before it only the sparse facts alleged in the Complaint and the \"little [that] was said [during the evidentiary hearing] about [Hamidullin] as an individual military actor.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hamidullin,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362635\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/114/365/#p387\">\n     114 F.Supp.3d at 386\n    </extracted-citation>\n    <em>\n     .\n    </em>\n    When additional relevant evidence was adduced at trial, the court did not revisit Hamidullin's POW claim, including the issue of whether Hamidullin qualifies as a POW under Article 4(A)(2).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-200\">\n    Notably, Hamidullin invoked the\n    <em>\n     Hamdan\n    </em>\n    decision as support for his contention that the Article 2 question is for the Judiciary, not the Executive Branch.

The district court's Article 4 analysis raises various questions, however, about the propriety of the proceedings and whether they were conducted in a manner consistent with that of a U.S. military tribunal.\n    <em>\n     See supra\n    </em>\n    note 3. For example, how could it be proper for the court to place the burden on Hamidullin to prove he is a POW? Shouldn't the court have considered the characteristics of Hamidullin individually, rather than focusing on Taliban and Haqqani fighters generally? Should the court have considered the additional relevant evidence that was adduced in Hamidullin's trial?
