Scott sued GME alleging sexual harassment and retaliation under state law. The parties stipulated to the dismissal of Scott's state law claims and Scott's filing of an amended complaint asserting claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In granting GME's motion for summary judgment, the district court concluded that Scott's Title VII claims were time-barred and that Scott failed to meet her burden of establishing a basis for equitable tolling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Under Title VII, an aggrieved person wishing to bring a claim against an employer must exhaust administrative remedies by filing a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the \"EEOC\") or a qualifying state agency and receiving a right-to-sue notice. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5. The primary issue in this appeal is whether, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1), the 90 -day period for filing a civil action begins when the aggrieved person becomes eligible to receive a right-to-sue notice from the EEOC or when the person is actually given a right-to-sue notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We hold that the 90-day period referenced in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1) begins when the aggrieved person is given notice of the right to sue by the EEOC. We also hold that Scott's Title VII claims may be based on alleged acts occurring after she filed her first administrative charge only to the extent such acts are part of a single unlawful employment practice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l R.R.

We thus affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Scott began working for GME in April 2011 at a barbershop located on the United States Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, where she was responsible for providing customers with haircuts and selling hair products. Scott alleges Judy Lifesy (a GME Manager) and Katie Shepler (a GME General Manager) sexually harassed and retaliated against her. Specifically, Scott alleges that after she turned down Lifesy's sexual advances, Lifesy began treating Scott poorly. Examples of Lifesy's alleged abusive behavior include pushing Scott out of the way to ring up customers, turning down the temperature of the shop to 30 degrees, turning up the volume of the television in the shop, yelling at Scott in front of customers, throwing Scott's work tools in the sink, and blaming Scott for computer problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 13, 2013, while Scott was still employed by GME, she filed a charge with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (the \"DFEH\") after speaking with DFEH representative Karen Rice. Scott's handwritten notes from her telephone conversation with Rice indicate \"365 days\" in the margin next to \"Dept. of Fair Employment &amp; Housing\" and \"w/in 30 days an investigator will call to determine if actionable.\" The notes also indicate \"statue [sic] of lim 300 Days\" in the margin next to \"EEOC-Federal coverage (DFEH will send their filing to the EEOC).\" Six days later, the DFEH transferred the duty to investigate Scott's charge to the EEOC pursuant to a worksharing agreement between the DFEH and the EEOC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 25, 2013, the DFEH issued a letter giving Scott notice of her right to sue. The letter stated the DFEH\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   had closed Scott's case \"for the following reason: Administrative Dismissal-Waived to Another Agency.\" The right-to-sue letter also explained that: (1) a civil action under California's Fair Employment and Housing Act (the \"FEHA\") \"must be filed within one year from the date of this letter\"; (2) Scott's DFEH charge \"is dual filed with the [EEOC]\" and Scott \"ha[s] a right to request EEOC to perform a substantial weight review of [DFEH's] findings ... within fifteen (15) days of ... receipt of this notice\"; (3) \"[a]lthough DFEH has concluded that the evidence and information did not support a finding that a violation occurred, the allegations and conduct at issue may be in violation of other laws\"; and (4) Scott \"should consult an attorney as soon as possible regarding any other options and/or recourse [she] may have regarding the underlying acts or conduct.\" (Emphasis omitted). Scott testified that she read the DFEH right-to-sue letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Scott alleges that on December 22, 2013, approximately one month after she obtained her first right-to-sue letter, Lifesy issued Scott's first warning but described it as her second warning.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Scott then decided to leave GME's employ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Scott did not follow up on her first administrative charge until October 15, 2014, when she contacted Karen Rice from the DFEH and received contact information for the EEOC. That same day, Scott spoke with someone at the EEOC, who confirmed that Scott's complaint was being processed and gave Scott a claim number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Scott hired a lawyer and filed a second charge with the DFEH on November 17, 2014. The second charge recounted Scott's allegations leading to her first DFEH charge, and then stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   After I filed my complaint and received my right to sue letter, Lifesy and Shepler gave me a final warning (although this was the very first warning I received while I was employed by GM). After the unfair treatment, harassment and retaliation and the immediate warning after I filed my DFEH complaint, I was unable withstand [sic] any further retaliatory harassing and unfair treatment and left GMs [sic] employ knowing that they were setting me up for termination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Scott received a second DFEH right-to-sue letter on the same date she filed the second charge. The letter stated that Scott's case was being closed because an immediate right-to-sue notice was requested and that the DFEH would take no further action on the charge. The letter also stated: \"To obtain a federal Right to Sue notice, you must visit the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to file a complaint within 30 days of receipt of this DFEH Notice of Case Closure or within 300 days of the alleged discriminatory act, whichever is earlier.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On November 20, 2014, Scott filed a complaint in the Superior Court of California, County of Orange, asserting FEHA claims only. GME removed the case to federal court under the federal enclave doctrine. Scott filed a motion to remand the case to state court, arguing she asserted claims under state law only. The district court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On May 22, 2015, GME filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, seeking dismissal of the FEHA claims as preempted by the federal enclave doctrine. After receiving that motion, Scott requested, and obtained, a right-to-sue notice from the\n   EEOC (associated with her first administrative charge). The notice, which was issued on June 3, 2015, stated that \"[m]ore than 180 days have passed since the filing of this charge\" and \"[t]he EEOC is terminating its processing of this charge.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p117\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The notice also stated that Scott's \"lawsuit under Title VII ...\n   <strong>\n    must be filed in a federal or state court\n    <em>\n     WITHIN 90 DAYS\n    </em>\n    of ... receipt of this notice\n   </strong>\n   ; or [the] right to sue based on this charge will be lost.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before Scott filed an opposition to the motion for judgment on the pleadings, the parties filed a joint motion to allow Scott to file a First Amended Complaint (the \"FAC\") and for GME to withdraw its motion for judgment on the pleadings. The proposed FAC included only federal claims under Title VII. The parties' stipulation expressly preserved GME's right to assert defenses to Scott's federal claims, \"specifically including any statute of limitations defenses.\" The district court granted the joint motion, and Scott filed her FAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   GME then moved to dismiss the FAC, arguing the Title VII claims were time-barred. In denying the motion, the district court assumed, without deciding, that Scott's Title VII claims were untimely but ruled that Scott might be entitled to equitable tolling and that the issue was not appropriate for resolution on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After the parties subsequently engaged in discovery on the issue of equitable tolling, GME filed a motion for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion, ruling that all of Scott's claims were time-barred and equitable tolling did not apply. Scott timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Scott's claims based on the first administrative charge are timely\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   There are effectively two limitations periods for Title VII claims. First, a claimant must exhaust administrative remedies by filing a charge with the EEOC or an equivalent state agency, like the DFEH, and receiving a right-to-sue letter. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    Jasch v. Potter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11440904\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/302/1092/#p1094\">\n    302 F.3d 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1094 (9th Cir. 2002). The charge must be filed within 180 days after the allegedly unlawful employment practice occurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(1). Second, after exhausting administrative remedies, a claimant has 90 days to file a civil action. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Scott filed her first DFEH charge on November 13, 2013. Twelve days later, she received a notice giving her the right to sue under the FEHA and stating that the charge \"is dual filed with the [EEOC].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Scott did not file her complaint\n   in state court until almost a full year later on November 20, 2014. At that time, she still had not received a right-to-sue notice from the EEOC. On June 3, 2015, the EEOC issued a right-to-sue notice, and two weeks later, the district court granted the parties' joint motion to allow Scott to amend her complaint to assert her Title VII claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   There is no dispute that Scott timely filed her first administrative charge. At issue is the second limitations period, and the dispute turns on whether the 90-day period to file a civil action begins when the plaintiff receives a right-to-sue notice from the EEOC\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   180 days after the charge is filed with the EEOC, regardless of when the EEOC issues a right-to-sue notice. If it is the former, then Scott's claims are not time-barred. If it is the latter, Scott's time to file an action undoubtedly expired before she sued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The operative provision of the statute states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   If a charge filed with the Commission pursuant to subsection (b) of this section is dismissed by the Commission, or if within one hundred and eighty days from the filing of such charge or the expiration of any period of reference under subsection (c) or (d) of this section, whichever is later, the Commission has not filed a civil action under this section ... or the Commission has not entered into a conciliation agreement to which the person aggrieved is a party, the Commission ... shall so notify the person aggrieved and within ninety days after the giving of such notice a civil action may be brought against the respondent named in the charge (A) by the person claiming to be aggrieved or (B) if such charge was filed by a member of the Commission, by any person whom the charge alleges was aggrieved by the alleged unlawful employment practice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1). This statutory provision addresses two related, but distinct, ideas: the EEOC's obligation to give notice to the aggrieved person and the person's authorization to file a civil action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The EEOC's duty to give notice is triggered in two instances: (1) the EEOC's dismissal of the administrative charge, or (2) the EEOC's failure to file a civil action or enter a conciliation agreement within 180 days from the filing of the charge (or the expiration of time periods referenced in provisions not at issue here).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   If either of these triggering events occurs, the EEOC \"shall so notify the person aggrieved.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1). The corresponding regulation requires the EEOC's notice to state that the claimant may bring an action \"within 90 days from\n   receipt of such authorization.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201601.28\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The statute does not expressly state when the EEOC must give such notice. However, it clearly contemplates the giving of notice sometime after 180 days have expired from the date the charge is filed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Ming W. Chin et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Employment Litigation (The Rutter Group 2012) \u00b6 16:151 (\"To protect aggrieved individuals from undue delay, the EEOC must issue a right-to-sue letter upon the potential plaintiff's request anytime\n   <em>\n    after 180 days\n   </em>\n   after the charges were filed.\") (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201601.28\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The language from \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1) addressing the right to file a civil action may be broken down into two parts: who may file the suit and when it may be filed. Although not at issue here, the statute provides that the \"person claiming to be aggrieved\" or, if the charge was filed by the EEOC, \"the person whom the charge alleges was aggrieved\" may file suit. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1). The portion of the statute addressing the time to file a civil action-the key issue in this case-is similarly straightforward. The person claiming to be aggrieved may file a civil action \"within ninety days after the giving of such notice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201601.28\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The terms \"such notice\" could refer only to the notice (identified a few words earlier in the sentence) the EEOC must give upon the occurrence of the specified conditions-i.e., the right-to-sue notice. Thus, under a plain reading of \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1), the 90 -day period in which a claimant may file a civil action begins when the EEOC gives a right-to-sue notice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The district court concluded that Scott's \"90-day window in which to file suit\" opened 180 days after Scott's claim was constructively filed with the EEOC-or, in other words, when Scott became eligible for a right-to-sue notice from the EEOC. To support its conclusion, the court did not cite the statute but, instead, relied on our unpublished decision in\n   <em>\n    Rucker v. Sacramento County Child Protective Services\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=462%20Fed.%20Appx.%20762\">\n    462 Fed.Appx. 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 763 (9th Cir. 2011) (\"Once the DFEH letter issued, an EEOC charge was deemed filed; Rucker was entitled to a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC 180 days thereafter, or on December 15, 2008.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Rucker\n   </em>\n   , in turn, cites\n   <em>\n    Stiefel v.

The court in\n   <em>\n    Stiefel\n   </em>\n   did not consider whether the plaintiff timely filed suit within the 90-day\n   limitations period. Rather, the issue in\n   <em>\n    Stiefel\n   </em>\n   was whether the plaintiff satisfied the statute's administrative exhaustion requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stiefel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3794678\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/624/1240/\">\n    624 F.3d at 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]hen a plaintiff files a disability discrimination complaint with a state agency acting, with respect to ADA complaints, as an agent of the EEOC, and receives a right-to-sue letter from the state agency, thereby becoming entitled to an EEOC right-to-sue letter, the plaintiff need not file a separate complaint with the EEOC nor receive an EEOC right-to-sue letter in order to file suit.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Thus, while the issue in this case is whether Scott filed suit too\n   <em>\n    late\n   </em>\n   , the issue in\n   <em>\n    Stiefel\n   </em>\n   was essentially whether the claimant filed suit too\n   <em>\n    early\n   </em>\n   . Nonetheless, in generally describing the time limits for filing suit, the court in\n   <em>\n    Stiefel\n   </em>\n   observed that \"[a]fter receiving an EEOC right-to-sue letter or\n   <em>\n    becoming eligible for one by the Commission's inaction\n   </em>\n   , a plaintiff generally has 90 days to file suit.\"\n   <em>\n    Stiefel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3794678\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/624/1240/\">\n    624 F.3d at 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1) ).

Both claims are based, at least in part, on conduct that took place before Scott filed her first DFEH charge. To that extent, her claims are timely for the reasons stated in this opinion. But Scott's retaliation claim is based in part on later conduct. Specifically, Scott alleged in her second administrative charge that after she filed her first charge Lifesy and Shepler retaliated against her by issuing a sham warning in an effort to set her up for termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Under Title VII, a charge must be filed with the DFEH (and thus \"dual-filed\" with the EEOC) within 300 days \"\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(1) (emphasis added).

She argues the continuing violations doctrine allows her to base her Title VII claims on conduct alleged to have occurred\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   she filed her first administrative charge-i.e., retaliation for filing the DFEH charge by issuing a bogus warning which led to Scott quitting her job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Generally, a Title VII plaintiff may not base a claim on conduct occurring outside the statutory time period for filing a charge (i.e., 300 days before the charge is filed).
