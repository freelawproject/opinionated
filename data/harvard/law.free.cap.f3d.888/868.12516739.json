The central issue in this appeal is whether the disparate impact provision, \u00a7 623(a)(2), protects only current employees or whether it protects current employees\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   outside job applicants. We hold that \u00a7 623(a)(2) protects both outside job applicants and current employees. That is the better reading of the statutory text. It is also more consistent with the purpose of the Act and nearly fifty years of case law interpreting the ADEA and similar language in other employment discrimination statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In fact, our reading tracks the Supreme Court's reading of virtually identical statutory language in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in\n   <em>\n    Griggs v.

Moreover, we have not been presented with, and could not imagine on our own, a plausible policy reason why Congress might have chosen to allow disparate impact claims by current employees, including internal job applicants, while excluding outside job applicants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We therefore reverse the district court's Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of plaintiff Dale Kleber's disparate impact claim and remand for further proceedings.

Part II examines the text, purpose, and origins of \u00a7 623(a)(2), as well as the practical consequences of the interpretations advanced by the parties. Part III addresses the unusually wide array of arguments, rebuttals, and sur-rebuttals marshaled by the parties to support their competing interpretations \u00a7 623(a)(2).

Plaintiff Dale Kleber is an attorney with extensive legal and business experience, including private law practice in Chicago, work as a general counsel for a major national company, and leadership of a national trade association, a real estate development company, and a medical device company. After his employment ended in July 2011, Kleber began applying for other legal jobs, primarily those in corporate legal departments. Kleber sent out more than 150 applications in total, without success, including applications for less senior positions. In 2014, Kleber was 58 years old and searching actively for a full-time position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 5, 2014, Kleber applied for a position as \"Senior Counsel, Procedural Solutions\" with defendant CareFusion Corporation, a healthcare products company. The job posting called for \"a business person's lawyer\" with the ability \"to assume complex projects,\" which we must assume would be well-suited to Kleber's skills and experience. The job posting also said, however, that applicants must have \"3 to 7 years (no more than 7 years) of relevant legal experience.\" CareFusion received Kleber's application but did not select him for an interview. The company eventually filled the position with a 29-year-old applicant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The seven-year experience cap is at the heart of this lawsuit. In this appeal from a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, we must assume that the company did not select Kleber because he had more than seven years of relevant legal experience. Because of the experience cap, Kleber filed a charge of age discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. CareFusion responded in a letter to the EEOC saying its maximum experience cap in the job posting was an \"objective criterion based on the reasonable concern that an individual with many more years of experience would not be satisfied with less complex duties ... which could lead to issues with retention.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After the EEOC issued Kleber a right-to-sue letter in December 2014, he filed this suit alleging claims for both disparate treatment and disparate impact under the relevant clauses of section 4 of the ADEA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20623\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) &amp; (a)(2). Kleber alleged that the maximum experience cap was \"based on unfounded stereotypes and assumptions about older workers, deters older workers from applying for positions ... and has a disparate impact on qualified applicants over the age of 40.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   CareFusion moved to dismiss both claims. The district court dismissed the disparate impact claim under Rule 12(b)(6), relying on our decision in\n   <em>\n    E.E.O.C. v. Francis W. Parker School\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7411710\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/41/1073/\">\n    41 F.3d 1073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 1994), to hold that the ADEA's disparate impact provision does not cover job applicants who are not already employed by the defendant. The court denied dismissal on the disparate treatment claim. Kleber later dismissed the disparate treatment claim voluntarily. The district court entered final judgment for CareFusion. Kleber then appealed, challenging only the district court's dismissal of his \u00a7 623(a)(2) disparate impact claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    The Scope of Disparate Impact Protection\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Text of the ADEA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Dissecting \u00a7 623(a)(2)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This appeal from a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal presents a legal issue that we review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   : whether \u00a7 623(a)(2) protects outside job applicants from employment practices that have a disparate impact on older applicants.

We start with the critical statutory language, \"to limit, segregate, or classify\" employees. If an employer classifies a position as one that must be filled by someone with certain minimum or maximum experience requirements, it is classifying its employees. If the classification \"would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities,\" paragraph (a)(2) can reach that classification. The broad phrase \"any individual\" reaches job applicants, so the focus turns to the employer's action and its effects on the individuals impacted by it-i.e.,\n   whether the employer has classified jobs in a way that tends to limit any individual's employment opportunities. See\n   <em>\n    Smith v. City of Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/\">\n    544 U.S. 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 234, 235-38,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/\">\n    161 L.Ed.2d 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) (plurality) (explaining that this \"text focuses on the\n   <em>\n    effects\n   </em>\n   of the action\" and not the employer's motive);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/\">\n    at 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Scalia, J., concurring).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To oppose this conclusion, the defendant emphasizes the phrase \"or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee.\" \u00a7 623(a)(2). The antecedent of \"his\" is \"any individual,\" and \"otherwise adversely affect\" is broader than \"deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities.\" If \"any individual\" is not already employed by the employer in question, reasons the defendant, the individual does not yet have \"status as an employee\" and so is not protected from policies or practices that have disparate impacts because of age. The defendant thus concludes that a person's status as an employee cannot be affected unless the person is\n   <em>\n    already\n   </em>\n   an employee, so paragraph (a)(2) implicitly limits its protections from disparate impacts to people who already possess \"status as an employee\" with the defendant-employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Looking only at the language of paragraph (a)(2) in isolation, the defense argument has some plausibility, but we reject it for several reasons we explain in detail below. At the most basic textual level, there are two fundamental problems. First, the defense argument assumes that \"status as an employee\" limits the already broad phrase, \"deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities.\" It is not self-evident-as a matter of plain meaning-that the last \"status\" phrase\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be read as a limitation. A list culminating in an \"or otherwise\" term could instead direct the reader to consider the last phrase alternatively, \"in addition to\" what came before. For example, an employer could violate the ADEA by adversely affecting the status of its employees (e.g., by unreasonably giving bigger raises to junior employees, as alleged in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/\">\n    544 U.S. at 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) without depriving an individual of employment opportunities, i.e., better jobs and promotions. In this sense, paragraph (a)(2) \"enumerates various factual means of committing a single element\"-imposing employment policies that have disparate impacts on older workers. See\n   <em>\n    Mathis v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/#p2249\">\n    136 S.Ct. 2243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2249,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/#p2249\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (discussing various ways to write an \"alternatively phrased law\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, even if \"status as an employee\" must be affected to state a claim under (a)(2), the defense argument depends entirely on the notion that \"status as an employee\" is not affected when a person is denied the opportunity to become an employee in the first place. That limiting assumption is clever, but we believe it is incorrect. Deciding whether a person becomes an employee or not has the most dramatic possible effect on \"status as an employee.\" Courts often speak of \"denying status\" of one sort or another.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the\n   word \"status\" is not necessarily limited to status as of any particular moment. See Pub. L. No. 82-248, \u00a7 1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20Stat.%20710\">\n    65 Stat. 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1951), codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Dictionary Act providing that unless the context indicates otherwise, \"words used in the present tense include the future as well as the present\"). Thus, if Congress really meant to outlaw employment practices that tend to deprive older workers of employment opportunities, which it did,\n   <em>\n    but at the same time deliberately chose to leave a wide array of discriminatory hiring practices untouched\n   </em>\n   , its use of the phrase \"status as an employee\" would have been a remarkably indirect and even backhanded way to express that meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Looking beyond the text of paragraph (a)(2) at the larger context of the ADEA as a whole, as well as the Supreme Court's interpretation of identical language in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in\n   <em>\n    Griggs v.

Imagine two applicants for the defendant's senior counsel position: both are in their fifties, and both have significantly more than seven years of relevant legal experience. One is Kleber, who does not currently have a job with the defendant. The other already has a job with the defendant but wants a transfer or promotion to the senior counsel position. Both are turned down because they have more than the maximum seven years of experience. According to the defendant's interpretation of paragraph (a)(2), the internal applicant can sue for a disparate impact violation, but the external one cannot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   That result would be arbitrary and even baffling, especially under a statute with the stated purpose \"to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

We doubt that when the ADEA was enacted, \"a reasonable person conversant with applicable social conventions would have understood\" the ADEA as drawing the line the defendant proposes here.

If the statute actually drew this arbitrary line between inside and outside applicants, still further arbitrary line-drawing would be needed. Suppose the applicant is currently employed by a sister subsidiary of the employer. Does she have \"status as an employee\" so that she could assert a disparate impact claim? Or suppose the applicant was recently laid off by the employer and challenges its failure to recall her. Or suppose the applicant currently has a temporary position as an independent contractor through a temporary employment agency. We see no arguable policy reason to exclude any of these applicants from the disparate impact protection of paragraph (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The defendant and other proponents of the no-outside-applicants interpretation of paragraph (a)(2) have not offered a reason why Congress might have chosen to allow the inside applicant but not the outside applicant to assert a disparate impact claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We have tried, too, but cannot\n   imagine a plausible policy reason for drawing that arbitrary line. We recognize, of course, that Congress can and often does draw arbitrary lines when it wants to do so. When it does, we enforce those lines, absent constitutional problems.

To decode words one must frequently reconstruct the legal and political culture of the drafters. Legislative history may be invaluable in revealing the setting of the enactment and the assumptions its authors entertained about how their words would be understood. It may show, too, that words with a denotation \"clear\" to an outsider are terms of art, with an equally \"clear\" but different meaning to an insider. It may show too that the words leave gaps, for short phrases cannot address all human experience; understood in context, the words may leave to the executive and\n   judicial branches the task of adding flesh to bones.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6500091,11648436\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/870/1340/\">\n    870 F.2d at 1342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   There can be no doubt that Congress enacted the ADEA to address unfair employment practices that make it harder for older people to\n   <em>\n    find\n   </em>\n   jobs. The ADEA is now more than 50 years old. It has been amended numerous times, but the disparate impact language we address here has not changed since the initial enactment in 1967. See Pub.

Congress was \"especially\" concerned about the difficulty older workers faced in trying to \"regain employment when displaced from jobs\"-in other words, when older workers were\n   <em>\n    applying for jobs\n   </em>\n   . See \u00a7 621(a)(1). Unemployment ends when a person who is not currently employed applies successfully for a job. As the ADEA provides, \"it is ... the purpose of this chapter to promote employment of older persons based on their ability rather than age.\" \u00a7 621(b). These findings do not specifically use the term \"job applicants,\" but we know from the reference to \"regain employment\" and from the 1965 Department of Labor report that was the catalyst for the ADEA-known as the Wirtz Report-that Congress had job applicants very much in mind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In 1964, Congress ordered the Department of Labor to recommend \"legislation to prevent arbitrary discrimination in employment because of age.\" The result was the Wirtz Report.

And the report made clear that the older people who suffer the disparate impact from such practices are\n   <em>\n    those trying to get hired in the first place\n   </em>\n   .

To the extent \u00a7 623(a)(2) could be considered ambiguous on the issue, the evidence of purpose weighs heavily in favor of allowing disparate impact claims by job applicants regardless of whether they come from inside or outside the company. Outside job applicants are a very large group of the ADEA's intended beneficiaries, and they are protected by the text of both its disparate treatment and disparate impact provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Comparisons and Precedent Regarding the Language of \u00a7 623(a)(2)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   With that understanding of the text, the practical consequences of the parties' alternative readings of paragraph (a)(2), and the report that was the catalyst for the Act, we return to paragraph (a)(2)'s language and examine it in light of related statutory provisions and past judicial interpretations. The parties draw our attention to the following circumstances. First, Title VII's parallel provision is now slightly different because it was amended in 1972 to add \"or applicants for employment\" after\n   <em>\n    Griggs v. Duke Power Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/\">\n    401 U.S. 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/\">\n    28 L.Ed.2d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971). Second, nearby provisions of the ADEA refer more directly to job applicants. Third, a 1994 decision of our court, since abrogated by\n   <em>\n    Smith v. City of Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/\">\n    544 U.S. 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/\">\n    161 L.Ed.2d 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005), categorically rejected disparate impact theories under the ADEA. None of these points changes our conclusion, drawn from statutory text, practical consequences, purpose, and history, that the ADEA's disparate impact provision protects both inside and outside job applicants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Title VII Parallel\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Differences Between Today's Title VII and the ADEA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Section 623(a)(2) tracks very closely a parallel provision for race, sex, religious, and national origin discrimination in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, with one notable difference-an explicit reference to job applicants. Title VII now provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees\n   <em>\n    or applicants for employ\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ment\n   </em>\n   in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   On the surface, it would seem easy to argue that the language difference between the disparate impact provisions in Title VII and the ADEA shows different meaning with respect to job applicants. The problem with that argument is that the \"or applicants for employment\" language was added to Title VII in 1972,\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Griggs v. Duke Power\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/\">\n    401 U.S. at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which recognized disparate impact claims for practices affecting both outside job applicants and employees seeking promotions and transfers. When\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   was decided, the statutory language in Title VII was the same as the language we examine here-it did not include the phrase \"applicants for employment.\" See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/\">\n    401 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   426 n.1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting original version of \u00a7 2000e-2(a). That's why\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   described\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   as \"a precedent of compelling importance\" in interpreting \u00a7 623(a)(2).\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/\">\n    544 U.S. at 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court framed the issue as whether an employer could require a high school education or passing a general intelligence test as \"a condition of employment in or transfer to jobs,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/\">\n    401 U.S. at 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , signaling that the disparate impact provision applied to both current employees and outside job applicants. The opinion also referred to the \"\n   <em>\n    hiring\n   </em>\n   and assigning of employees\" and to \"tests or criteria for\n   <em>\n    employment\n   </em>\n   or promotion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/\">\n    at 427, 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

It has-to resort again to the fable-provided that the vessel in which the milk is proffered be one\n   <em>\n    all seekers\n   </em>\n   can use.

There is no sign in the\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   opinion that the Court saw a relevant difference between current employees seeking a promotion or transfer and job applicants from outside the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Griggs and the 1972 Amendment to Title VII\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   was not altered by the 1972 amendment to Title VII. The year after\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   , Congress enacted the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972. It was a major bill that strengthened the powers of the EEOC and extended coverage of Title VII to state and local government employees, teachers, and federal employees. See Conf. Rep. on H.R. 1746, reprinted in 92nd Cong., 118 Cong. Rec. 7166, 7166-69 (March 6, 1972). One minor provision of the 1972 Act amended Title VII's \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(2) to add the express reference to \"applicants for employment.\" Pub. L. No. 92-261, \u00a7 8(a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=86%20Stat.%20109\">\n    86 Stat. 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972). There was no indication, though, that the particular amendment was intended to change the law as spelled\n   out in\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   . In fact, the conference committee's report to the Senate explained that the addition in \u00a7 8(a) was \"merely declaratory of present laws.\" See 118 Cong. Rec. at 7169. Congress included this subsection just to \"make it clear that discrimination against applicants for employment ... is an unlawful employment practice\" under both clauses of Title VII's \u00a7 2000e-2(a). 118 Cong. Rec. at 7169.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Confirming that point, the key committee reports do not discuss \u00a7 8(a) as a significant provision. If Congress had thought it was creating new law by extending disparate impact protection from current private-sector employees to reach all private-sector job applicants as well, that surely would have been significant enough to mention in the committee reports. The Senate reports contained the brief \"merely declaratory\" description of \u00a7 8(a) explained above. The House version of the conference committee report from a few days before contained the text of \u00a7 8(a) but provided no explanation of it. See H.R. Rep. 92-899 at 8, 19-20, reprinted in 92nd Cong., 118 Cong. Rec. 6643, 6645, 6648 (March 2, 1972). An earlier House report summarized the bill's major provisions, which were directed at different issues. H.R. Rep. 92-238 at 1, 4 (June 2, 1971), reprinted in 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2137, 2137, 2140 (explaining the \"basic purpose of H.R. 1746 is to grant the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission authority to issue ... judicially enforceable cease and desist orders\" as well as to extend protections to State and local government employees, Federal employees, and private-sector employees and labor union members at smaller organizations);\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 8-26, reprinted at 2143-60 (summarizing these provisions). With the focus on these other issues, the language in \u00a7 8(a) was not mentioned at all in the explanation. It appears only in passing in the section-by-section analysis. See\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-22, 30, reprinted at 2155-57, 2165. The explanation quotes\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   at length to emphasize the importance of disparate impact protections for \"the job seeker\" before noting that the \"provisions of the bill are fully in accord with the decision of the Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22, reprinted at 2156-57, quoting\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/\">\n    401 U.S. at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   As the Supreme Court has taught, Congress \"does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions-it does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\"\n   <em>\n    Whitman v.

In addition, there is no indication from the text of the 1972 Act amending Title VII that Congress intended that Act to serve in any way as a\n   statement about the ADEA. See Pub. L. No. 92-261,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=86%20Stat.%20103\">\n    86 Stat. 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 13 (1972).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Nevertheless, the defendant argues that we should infer from this 1972 amendment to Title VII that in clarifying existing Title VII law after\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   , and consistent with it, Congress was silently endorsing a narrower interpretation of the ADEA. This negative inference is not justified. The ADEA was never mentioned in the 1972 Act itself or in the conference report describing it. The 1972 Act was the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, and it amended\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   provisions of Title VII of the 1964 Act.

First, it returns to\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   itself to argue all of its plaintiffs were in fact already employed by Duke Power and were only seeking better jobs. So, according to the defendant,\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   is limited to fact patterns involving incumbent employees. We are not persuaded. Even if the\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs themselves were already employees, the Supreme Court did not limit its holding in\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   to that particular fact pattern, as we explained above.

But because the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Francis Parker School\n   </em>\n   was a job applicant and not an employee, the defendant argues here that enough of\n   <em>\n    Francis Parker School\n   </em>\n   survives to defeat Kleber's disparate impact claim.

In\n   <em>\n    Francis Parker School\n   </em>\n   , a sixty-three-year-old's application for a teaching job was not considered because, based on his experience, he would have qualified for a salary higher than the school could afford.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7411710\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/41/1073/\">\n    41 F.3d at 1075\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Without actually confirming with the applicant that his salary requirements would indeed be too high, the school moved ahead with other candidates.

Subsections (a), (b), and (c) are all worded slightly differently. In the following subsection (d), the ADEA prohibits retaliation by any of these private-sector actors. In another section, the ADEA provides for a different and even broader policy prohibiting age discrimination in the federal government employment context. \u00a7 633a(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Remember that the text of \u00a7 623(a)(2) -the provision we interpret here-does not specifically include or obviously exclude applicants for employment in such terms. Some other ADEA provisions do use the term \"applicant(s) for employment.\" See \u00a7\u00a7 623(c)(2), 633a(a). The question is whether the absence of this phrase in the private-employer-facing provisions of (a)(2) is meaningful.

The retaliation provision makes it unlawful for \"an employer to discriminate against any of his employees or applicants for employment\" in retaliation for opposing unlawful practices or participating in the investigation or litigation of an age discrimination complaint. \u00a7 623(d).

They were enacted together and are close to each other. But on closer examination, the labor union provision's phrase \"refuse to refer for employment any individual\" stands out. This change in language reflects an important substantive difference. Unlike most private employers, labor organizations often serve as referral agencies of sorts for job applicants, especially in markets where union membership may be a condition of employment. Under the original ADEA definition, one way a labor organization would fall under its coverage would be to \"operate[ ] a hiring hall or hiring office which procures employees for an employer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Stat.%20603\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 11(e),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Stat.%20606\">\n    81 Stat. 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20630\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). The fact that Congress included special, detailed language in (c)(2)-prohibiting a labor organization from adversely affecting an individual's status \"as an applicant for employment\"-to reflect a special function of labor organizations tells us little about what the broader private sector (a)(2) language means in light of\n   <em>\n    Nassar\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gomez-Perez\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Retaliation Provision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The defendant also urges us to compare the disparate impact provision in (a)(2) with the ADEA's retaliation provision, \u00a7 623(d). The retaliation provision was enacted at the same time as (a)(2) and makes it \"unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees or applicants for employment\" as a consequence of their opposition to unlawful practices or their involvement in the age discrimination complaint and resolution process. Pub. L. 90-202, \u00a7 4(d),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Stat.%20603\">\n    81 Stat. 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1967), codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20623\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   This provision refers to applicants for employment as distinct from employees, but the comparison fails to shed light on\n   the meaning of paragraph (a)(2) specifically. First, it is not clear that the enumeration in subsection (d) does anything more than recognize that subsection (a) as a whole unquestionably covers both employees and applicants-paragraph (a)(1), of course, makes it unlawful for an employer \"to refuse to hire or to discharge any individual,\" and we have explained why (a)(2) applies to job applicants. Subsection (d) extends retaliation protection to the same groups without any obvious reference to the disparate impact provision of paragraph (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   If it suggests anything useful here, the language in subsection (d) suggests that the key phrase in paragraph (a)(2) is the broad \"any individual.\" Later in the retaliation provision, perhaps as a shorthand, subsection (d) repeats the phrase \"individual, member or applicant for membership\" twice, signaling in the provision that \"individual\" is the key unit of analysis for retaliation by private sector employers and employment agencies. See \u00a7 623(d) ; see also\n   <em>\n    Sauzek v. Exxon Coal USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"917803\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/202/913/#p918\">\n    202 F.3d 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 918 (7th Cir. 2000) (noting that \u00a7 623(d) is directed at \"any individual\" in retaliation and failure-to-rehire case).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Second, the retaliation provision is notable for what it does not say. The defendant's no-outside-applicants view would find strength from this provision if it called out paragraph (a)(2) specifically and if it prevented retaliation against \"any of his employees or\n   <em>\n    internal\n   </em>\n   applicants for employment,\" or if it read \"any of his employees or applicants for\n   <em>\n    promotion or transfer\n   </em>\n   .\" It does not say anything to that effect, however.

In the district court, the defendant moved to dismiss the disparate impact claim on the additional ground that Kleber failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. It argued that Kleber's EEOC charge could not have notified the company that he alleged a practice of discrimination against older workers since he charged that \"\n   <em>\n    I\n   </em>\n   was not hired\" and therefore \"\n   <em>\n    I\n   </em>\n   have been discriminated against because of my age, 58.\" Dkt. 22-1 at 8 (emphasis added).

All actors who regularly recruit job applicants are specifically prohibited from engaging in age discrimination. In 1967, Congress made it unlawful \"for an employment agency to fail or refuse to refer for employment, or otherwise to discriminate against, any individual because of such individual's age, or to classify or refer for employment any individual on the basis of such individual's age.\" See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20623\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 623\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b) and 630(c) (defining \"employment agency\" as \"any person regularly undertaking with or without compensation to procure employees for an employer\"); see also Pub.

To rule for the defendant on this ground, we would have to conclude that the ADEA prohibits labor unions from imposing disparate impacts on applicants, and prohibits anyone else who recruits employees from \"classify[ing]\" applicants based on age, yet allows private employers to use screening criteria to the detriment of older applicants as long as they handle the applications themselves. This would be an odd reading, especially in light of the Wirtz Report and the rest of the original section 4, where Congress showed an intent to group employers, employment agencies, and labor organizations together with respect to retaliation, job advertisements, and the use of bona fide occupational qualifications and reasonable factors other than age.

Throughout the ADEA, Congress specifically used \"employees\" in some instances and \"applicants for employment\" in others. For example, \u00a7 4(c)(2), which prohibits labor organizations from acting, tracks the language from \u00a7 4(a)(2), but adds \"applicants for employment.\" Similarly, \u00a7 4(d), which provides retaliation protections, also extends this protection to \"applicants for employment.\" As the majority opinion admits, \u00a7 4(a)(2) does not reference, in any way, \"applicants for employment,\" \"prospective employees,\" \"job seekers,\" or any other terms that would allow us to conclude that Congress intended to cover prospective employees under the disparate impact provision. Conversely, \u00a7 4(a)(1) specifically states, \"to fail or refuse to hire\" due to one's age, thus explicitly implicating job applicants. Given Congress' omission of \"applicants for employment\" in \u00a7 4(a)(2), yet unquestionable inclusion of job applicants in several other places throughout the ADEA, including the section directly preceding \u00a7 4(a)(2), I must conclude that Congress intentionally excluded \"applicants for employment\" in \u00a7 4(a)(2) of the ADEA. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
