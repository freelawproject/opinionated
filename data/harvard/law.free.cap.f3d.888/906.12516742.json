Drake purportedly uses this road for agricultural purposes. Because constructing his road requires dredging and filling portions of Enemy Swim Lake and its surrounding creeks and inlets, he applied for permits from the United States Army Corps of Engineers (\"the Corps\") under the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\"). Between 1998 and 2009, the Corps issued six permit and exemption determinations to Drake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   But Drake is not the only property owner on Enemy Swim Lake. The majority of the lake's shoreline is owned by the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate Tribe (the \"Tribe\"). The lake is of significant historical and cultural value to the Tribe, and the Tribe fears that Drake's activities harm the lake. The Tribe asserts that Drake misrepresented his plans to the Corps and intends to develop the land rather than use it for agricultural purposes. In 2010, the Tribe sent the Corps a letter requesting that it recapture Drake's road project and order Drake to remove the entirety of his road. The Corps concluded that Drake was continuing to use his land for agricultural purposes and declined to intervene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Tribe brought the present action, arguing that the Corps had violated the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), the CWA, and the National Historic Preservation Act (\"NHPA\") in issuing the permit and exemption determinations to Drake. With one exception, the District Court\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   dismissed the Tribe's claims. The Tribe appeals.

Persons wishing to discharge dredged or fill material into navigable waters must obtain a permit from the Corps. Certain activities are exempted from the statutory permitting requirements.

But the statutory exemptions are covered by a \"recapture\" provision.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Drake's Permit Applications\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Merlyn Drake owns real property, which he purportedly uses for agricultural activities, adjacent to Enemy Swim Lake. Since 1998, Drake has been in the process of building a road across his property. Between 1998 and 2009, Drake filed with the Corps six permit applications under the CWA to dredge and fill portions of Enemy Swim Lake in furtherance of building his road. On appeal, the Tribe challenges the Corps's responses to three of these permit applications: (1) the 2003 farm-road exemption determination; (2) the 2006 farm-road exemption determination; and (3) the 2009 nationwide-permit determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 1998, Drake applied for a permit to build a bridge over an inlet of the lake. The Corps treated Drake's project as an exempt farm road. Drake later abandoned the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2000, Drake applied for a permit to fill the edge of Enemy Swim Lake to create a road bed to connect his house to an established road. The Corps issued Drake a nationwide-permit determination under then-Nationwide Permit 26.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Notice of Issuance, Reissuance, and Modification of Nationwide Permits,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20Fed.%20Reg.%2065%2C874\">\n    61 Fed. Reg. 65,874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 65,916 (Dec. 13, 1996) (permitting such discharge into headwaters or isolated waters if it does not cause the loss of more than three acres).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2003, Drake applied for two permits to further fill the lake for additional road projects. First, Drake applied for a permit to build a road system \"to unify residents to a single road complete with recorded easements.\" In response, the Corps issued Drake a nationwide-permit determination under Nationwide Permit 14. Second, Drake applied for a permit to build an access road across the inlet, wetland, and creek on the east side of Enemy Swim\n   Lake to provide access to his land for cattle grazing. In response, the Corps issued Drake a farm-road exemption determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2005, Drake applied for a permit to fill a creek that flows into Enemy Swim Lake in order to construct a bridge and continue access to his pasture. In May 2006, the Corps issued Drake another farm-road exemption determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Finally, in 2008, Drake applied for a permit to build an access road \"necessary to totally access [his] land.\" Drake initially represented to the Corps that he intended the road to be used for agricultural purposes. After further discussion with the Corps, Drake disclosed that he would potentially use the road to access a second residence that he intended to build. In May 2009, the Corps issued Drake a nationwide-permit determination under Nationwide Permit 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Tribe's Concerns\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Drake's permit applications have been fraught with public challenges from the Tribe and other neighbors. Following the 2003 nationwide-permit and farm-road exemption determinations, the Tribe became concerned about Drake's road projects. The Tribe owns eighty-eight percent of the shoreline of Enemy Swim Lake, which is of cultural, historical, and religious significance to the Tribe. In 1867, the Tribe's treaty with the United States government was partially negotiated on the shores of the lake. The lake is home to the Tribe's historic burial grounds. Its plants are used for ceremonial and medicinal purposes, and Tribe members fish on the lake. There can be no doubt that the Tribe has a significant interest in protecting the lake and the land surrounding it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In 2004, Alvah Quinn, the Tribe's Fish and Wildlife Director, received a phone call about Drake's plan to build a road. The Tribe became concerned that Drake's projects might interfere with the ability of its members to fish on the lake. Quinn called James Oehlerking, a member of the Corps, about the Tribe's concern, and further expressed concern that Drake would develop the land rather than use the road for agricultural purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Public concerns escalated, and eventually Senator Tim Johnson requested that the Corps hold a meeting to discuss concerns related to Drake's projects. The meeting was held on January 25, 2005. Quinn and Floyd DeCoteau, another member of the Tribe, attended. All four permit and exemption determinations issued by the Corps from 1998 to 2003 were discussed. According to the Corps, \"[a]s a result of the meeting, the Corps agreed to review the regulatory actions to determine if they were appropriate or if [the Corps] should assert discretionary authority by modifying, suspending, or revoking the nationwide permits.\" After further review, the Corps concluded that it did not \"believe any modification or revocation of the permits [was] required.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In the years following the 2005 meeting, the Tribe discussed Drake's projects with the Corps on a number of occasions. On February 8, 2007, Quinn called the Corps to express concerns that Drake was leveling land for cabins rather than to build a farm road. In July 2009, the Tribe again met with the Corps to express its concern that Drake was not using his land for agricultural purposes. The Corps disagreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Tribe's complaints culminated in a March 2, 2010, letter sent to the Corps. The Tribe argued that Drake obtained the permit and exemption determinations through misrepresentations about his projects and was abusing the farm-road exemption. Seeking relief, the Tribe argued\n   that Drake's roads fall within the CWA's recapture provision and that the Corps must (1) require Drake to remove the road, (2) require Drake to obtain a permit to continue construction of the road, and (3) impose civil penalties on Drake for his allegedly willful violations of the CWA. The Tribe also accused the Corps of failing to comply with the requirements of the NHPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Corps responded in an August 30, 2010, letter. With respect to its exemption determinations, the Corps stated that it believed, and continues to believe, that its decisions were supported by sufficient evidence that Drake was actually using his farm road for agricultural purposes. The Corps concluded that the exempted farm roads could not be recaptured because the roads continued to meet the requirements for the farm-road exemption. With respect to its nationwide-permit determinations, the Corps clarified that these projects were not exempt from regulation. However, according to the Corps, the roadways fit within the parameters of the nationwide permits and were each a single and complete project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Tribe brought this case on November 7, 2011. The Tribe asserted ten claims against the Corps under the APA, the CWA, and the NHPA arising out of the permit and exemption determinations issued to Drake:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   1. The Corps's decision that Drake's road is an exempt farm road is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   2. The Corps's failure to correct its initial decisions that Drake's road is an exempt farm road is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   3. The Corps must regulate Drake's unfinished project under the CWA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   4. The Corps's determination that Drake's activities have not been recaptured is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   5. The Corps's determination that Drake's road complies with its best management practices is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   6. The Corps's determination that Drake's fill of a spring feeding Enemy Swim Lake need not be regulated is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   7. The Corps's determination to allow Drake to stack permit applications, exemptions, and nationwide permits is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   8. The Corps violated the National Historic Preservation Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   9. The Corps failed to mitigate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   10. The Corps intentionally violated the CWA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Tribe requested that the District Court enjoin the Corps from permitting any activities in furtherance of the construction of the road and order the Corps to require Drake to remove the entire road. The District Court held four hearings before dismissing the majority of the Tribe's action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Finality of the 2010 Letter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Corps moved to dismiss the Tribe's claims based on the Corps's 2010 response letter. The Tribe argued that the Corps's initial permit and exemption determinations were preliminary decisions and that there was no final decision on any of those matters until August 30, 2010. The District Court concluded that the Corps completed its decisionmaking process with respect to those permit and exemption determinations when it issued Drake the determination letters. Thus, the District Court concluded that the Corps's determination letters constituted final agency actions and accordingly dismissed \"all claims the viability of which hinges on considering the August 30, 2010 letter to be a final agency action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Justiciability of the Recapture Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Corps moved to dismiss the Tribe's claims to the extent that they challenged nonjusticiable enforcement decisions of the Corps. The District Court cited\n   <em>\n    Missouri Coalition for the Environment v. Corps of Engineers of the U.S. Army\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that \"a decision not to modify, suspend or revoke a Section 404 permit is one committed to the Corps' absolute discretion and, as such, it is not reviewable under the Administrative Procedures Act.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10534619\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/866/1025/\">\n    866 F.2d 1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1032 n.10 (8th Cir. 1989),\n   <em>\n    abrogated on other grounds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Goos v. ICC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540704\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/911/1283/\">\n    911 F.2d 1283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 1990). With respect to the farm-road exemptions, the District Court concluded that \"[t]he Corps did not in fact 'modify, suspend or revoke' a \u00a7 404 permit here, but rather initially found an exemption to \u00a7 404 that allowed Drake to pursue certain projects.\" With respect to the nationwide permits, the District Court concluded that \"[t]he Corps ... failed to show that it has absolute agency discretion over finding \u00a7 404 exemptions and granting Nationwide Permits. ... However, the Corps' decision 'not to modify, suspend or revoke' those determinations subsequently appears to be committed to the Corps' absolute discretion.\" Thus, the District Court denied the Corps's motion to dismiss to the extent that the Corps sought dismissal of the Corps's permit and exemption determinations, but dismissed the Tribe's claims to \"the extent that the Corps' decisions not to modify, suspend, or revoke those determinations are non-justiciable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Statute of Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Corps moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because the Tribe's claims were brought after the six-year limitation period had expired. The District Court concluded that the Tribe was aware of the Corps's permit and exemption determinations by January 25, 2005, and the statute of limitations began running on that date. However, the District Court stated that it could not \"determine exactly which permits and exemptions were discussed in such a manner, without hearing evidence and evaluating the memory and credibility of witnesses.\" In response, the Tribe argued that it was entitled to equitable tolling. The District Court concluded that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) is jurisdictional and denied the Tribe's request for tolling. The District Court broadly granted the Corps's motion \"as to any and all Counts and claims challenging Corps' exemptions and Nationwide Permit determinations that were discussed during the January 25, 2005 meeting as having been granted, authorized, or determined.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Subsequently, the District Court held an evidentiary hearing to determine which permit and exemption determinations were discussed at the January 25, 2005, meeting. Following this hearing, the District\n   Court found that the 1998 exemption determination, the 2000 nationwide-permit determination, the 2003 exemption determination, and the 2003 nationwide-permit determination were all discussed at the meeting and concluded that any claims arising from those permit and exemption determinations were barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Tribe filed a motion for reconsideration on its request for equitable tolling based on intervening authority. The Tribe argued that the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Kwai Fun Wong\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588801\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1625/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 1625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588801\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1625/\">\n    191 L.Ed.2d 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), required the District Court to conclude that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) is not jurisdictional and therefore is susceptible to equitable tolling. In\n   <em>\n    Kwai Fun Wong\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that a different statute of limitations,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), is not jurisdictional.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    at 1638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In light of Eighth Circuit precedent, the District Court concluded that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) is not subject to equitable tolling. In the alternative, the District Court concluded that the Tribe would not be eligible for equitable tolling in this case because the Tribe did not meet its burden of showing that, \"despite the Tribe's diligent pursuit of its rights, some extraordinary circumstance prevented it from filing its dismissed claims on time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The \"Stacking\" Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Tribe argued that the Corps had unlawfully \"stacked\" permits and exemptions and therefore the 2009 nationwide permit was not issued for a \"single and complete project.\" In its final order, the District Court dismissed the Tribe's argument that Drake's 2009 nationwide permit was not a part of a \"single and complete project\" because the Corps's regulations authorize \"phased developments ... provided that each phase is a single and complete project and has independent utility.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    5. NHPA Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Tribe argued that the Corps did not consider the requirements of NHPA in issuing the 2009 nationwide-permit determination. The District Court concluded that the Corps's nationwide-permit determination was a federal undertaking and that the Corps failed to undergo the necessary NHPA analysis before issuing its determination letter. The District Court remanded this issue to the Corps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    I. CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THE 2010 LETTER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   We must first decide whether the Tribe's claims arising out of the Corps's 2010 response letter are justiciable. According to the Tribe, the 2010 letter consummated two of the Corps's earlier actions. First, the 2010 letter finalized the Corps's permit and exemption determinations.

At the time, Quinn was the Fish and Wildlife Director of the Tribe, charged with \"manag[ing] [the Tribe's] fish and wildlife resources.\" On November 8, 2004, Quinn called James Oehlerking about the Tribe's concerns. In his notes from the phone call, Oehlerking wrote that Quinn and the Tribe were concerned because they spear north of the crossing. In particular, Quinn testified that the Tribe was concerned that erosion would fill the mouth of the stream and eventually prevent fish from traveling up the stream. Oehlerking's notes also state, \"[Quinn] thinks Drake will get access and develop lots along the lake.\" Quinn agreed that he \"[d]efinitely\" spoke with Oehlerking about concerns that Drake would develop the land rather than using it for agricultural purposes. At the time of the phone call, the Tribe knew that Drake's project may interfere with its ability to fish on the lake and was suspicious that Drake intended to develop the land rather than use it for agricultural purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   On January 25, 2005, the Corps held a public meeting to discuss the four permit and exemption determinations issued to Drake from 1998 to 2003. Testimony from the attendees of the meeting and a subsequent letter to Senator Tim Johnson confirm that all four permits and exemptions were discussed at the meeting. A news article published in the Watertown Public Opinion newspaper states that concerns about the effects of Drake's project on fish hatcheries were discussed at the meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The District Court's conclusion that Quinn and DeCoteau attended the meeting as representatives of the Tribe is supported by evidence. Both Quinn and DeCoteau signed the sign-in sheet as \"SWO-Realty,\" indicating that they were attending the meeting in their representative capacities. At the time, Quinn was in charge of the Tribe's Fish and Wildlife program and therefore knew the effects that Drake's project would have on the Tribe's ability to fish on the lake. Following the meeting, Quinn told a reporter that he would take his concerns back to the Tribal Council. The reporter quoted Quinn in the published article:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Alvah Quinn, Sisseton-Wahpeton Tribal Wildlife Director said the Tribe is concerned about Drake's latest road for environmental reasons. He said the road could negatively impact spawning fish and that the road culvert capacity is a concern, given the upstream drainage area. \"We do have concerns about the fish in the stream,\" he said after the session. \"Somebody, whether it's a state, federal, or county agency needs to step up and enforce the laws they have.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Quinn agreed at the evidentiary hearing that these statements were accurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Despite any confusion that may exist about what did or did not occur at the meeting, the evidence supports the following: First, the Tribe was aware of Drake's project, and that the Corps had issued four permit and exemption determinations in furtherance of this project, no later than January 25, 2005. Second, the Tribe knew Drake's project may affect its ability to fish on the lake. Third, the Tribe was suspicious that Drake did not intend to use the land for agricultural purposes and would instead develop the land. Finally, Quinn-acting as a representative of the Tribe-expressed his belief that the Corps had a duty to \"enforce the laws they have.\" The District Court's findings are well supported by the record and not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   A reasonable person in the Tribe's position would be expected to know that Drake's road and the Corps's permit and exemption determinations affected their legal rights to fish on Enemy Swim Lake.\n   <em>\n    Dring\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413679\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/58/1323/#p1328\">\n    58 F.3d at 1329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The District Court therefore did not err in concluding that the Tribe's cause of action against the Corps accrued on January 25, 2005, when Quinn received sufficient information at the meeting to be aware of the permit and exemption decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Nevertheless, the Tribe argues that its cause of action did not accrue until it became aware that Drake changed the use of his road from agricultural purposes to development purposes in 2008. We disagree. The Tribe was well aware by January 25, 2005, that Drake's project (and therefore the Corps's 2003 exemption determination) threatened its fishing rights. The damage to the Tribe's fishing rights is a sufficient injury to bring a cause of action for purposes of seeking an injunction. As evidenced by Quinn's call with Oehlerking, the Tribe was also suspicious-even if it was not certain-that Drake intended to develop his land. The Tribe would have learned through the course of discovery whether the Corps was aware that Drake intended to develop his land rather than build a farm road. The Tribe had an obligation to pursue its rights diligently once it realized that the 2003 exemption threatened its fishing rights.\n   <em>\n    Holland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641601,12454867\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/631/\">\n    560 U.S. at 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641601,12454867\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/631/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Tribe has not presented any compelling evidence for us to conclude that it diligently pursued its rights after January 25, 2005.

The Corps argues that it could decide on remand that there is no way for Drake's road to comply with NHPA and vacate the 2009 permit decision, thereby providing the Tribe with the relief it requests.

Here, the District Court denied all relief requested by the Tribe except with regard to whether the 2009 permit violated the NHPA, which was remanded for the Corps to determine. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Giordano\n   </em>\n   , the District Court did not retain jurisdiction to hear the Tribe's arbitrary-and-capricious claim related to the 2009 permit but rather explicitly denied the Tribe's requested relief with respect to that claim. We therefore conclude that the District Court's decision constitutes a reviewable final decision for purposes of Section 1291.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Turning to the merits, the Tribe claims that the Corps acted arbitrarily and capriciously by determining that Drake's 2009 project qualified for a nationwide permit because the 2009 project was not a \"single and complete project.\" We apply the\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   (also known as\n   <em>\n    Seminole Rock\n   </em>\n   ) standard in cases involving an agency's interpretation of its own regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Auer v.

Lange, United States District Judge for the District of South Dakota.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    For purposes of brevity, we address the District Court's orders only as relevant to this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    We have long considered \u00a7 2401(a) a jurisdictional bar.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Konecny v.

Since the Supreme Court decided\n    <em>\n     Kwai Fun Wong,\n    </em>\n    the Sixth and Seventh Circuits have held that \u00a7 2401(a) is not jurisdictional.\n    <em>\n     Matushkina v. Nielsen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264187\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/289/\">\n     877 F.3d 289\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 292 n.1 (7th Cir. 2017) ;\n    <em>\n     Herr v.

Even before\n    <em>\n     Kwai Fun Wong\n    </em>\n    , the Fifth and Ninth Circuits held that \u00a7 2401(a) is not jurisdictional.\n    <em>\n     Clymore v. United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11192829\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/370/#p374\">\n     217 F.3d 370\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 374 (5th Cir. 2000) ;\n    <em>\n     Cedars-Sinai Med.

Nevertheless, because we decide the issue on other grounds, this case is not an appropriate vehicle to reconsider our prior decision that \u00a7 2401(a) is a jurisdictional statute of limitations.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    The District Court concluded that the Tribe's cause of action did not begin to accrue on November 8, 2004, because the Tribe was not aware at the time of the phone call that the Corps had issued an exemption to Drake. Whether the Tribe's cause of action accrued earlier than January 25, 2005, is immaterial to our decision.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
