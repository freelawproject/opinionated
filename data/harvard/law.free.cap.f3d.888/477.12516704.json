Clarksville owns and operates a natural gas distribution system that serves a \"significant geographic area\" in Montgomery County, as well as smaller, discrete areas in Cheatham and Robertson Counties, all in Tennessee. In addition, Clarksville operates distribution facilities that service the U.S. Army base at Fort Campbell-partly located in Kentucky-and provides gas service to 16 commercial customers through the \"Kentucky Service Line\" pipeline. The \"Kentucky Service Line\" pipeline extends from Clarksville's municipal system in Montgomery County 2,400 feet into Christian County, Kentucky.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On June 26, 2013, Clarksville filed an application with FERC, requesting a Natural Gas Act Section 7(f) service area determination covering its services to Fort Campbell and the Kentucky Service Line. Clarksville also requested a waiver of reporting, accounting, and other regulatory requirements that are primarily applicable to FERC-jurisdictional natural gas companies. In an order issued February 7, 2014, FERC granted these requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   During the proceeding, the Commission learned that Clarksville has a service agreement with the City of Guthrie, Kentucky (\"Guthrie\"). Under that contract, Clarksville transports natural gas to a meter and regulating station 20 feet south of the Tennessee/Kentucky border, where Guthrie receives the gas into a pipeline that crosses into Kentucky. Though Clarksville did not know for certain, it assumed that Guthrie sells the gas to retail customers in Kentucky. Having learned about the agreement between Clarksville and Guthrie, FERC stated-in a footnote in its order granting the requested service area determination-that the sales to Guthrie were covered under a blanket marketing certificate already granted by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20284.402\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 284.402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Relying on prior FERC orders, Clarksville argued that FERC lacked jurisdiction over these transactions because the NGA excludes municipalities from the ambit of FERC's jurisdiction. Although FERC acknowledged the precedent upon which Clarksville relied, FERC explained that it had \"reconsider[ed]\" this precedent.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C184\">\n    155 FERC \u00b6 61,184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at P. 11. Specifically, FERC explained that its prior \"interpretation of the municipal exemption created by operation\" of the NGA was \"overly expansive, at least to the extent it would allow municipal gas utilities to avoid NGA jurisdiction over the transportation and sale of gas for consumption in\n   <em>\n    other states\n   </em>\n   , because such an interpretation would create a regulatory gap.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C184\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original).

First, Clarksville explains that FERC's decision subjects it to the data retention and price reporting requirements set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20284.403\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 284.403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r's Br. 14 &amp; nn. 39-40.

Thus, because the transaction between Clarksville and Guthrie constitutes the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce, FERC contends that Clarksville's identity as a municipality is essentially irrelevant where the gas is \"dedicated to the interstate market.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C184\">\n    155 FERC \u00b6 61,184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at P. 14 (citing\n   <em>\n    Pub.

Indeed, Section 1(b) is not power-conferring or jurisdiction-creating and should not be read to say that FERC has jurisdiction over anything and everything related to the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce. None of the cases on which FERC relies stands for such a broad interpretation of FERC's authority. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Public Service Company of North Carolina, Inc. v. FERC\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit emphasized \"the convergence of three factors-(1) interstate transmission by a natural gas company, (2) Commission certification, and (3) the state's acquiescence in (1) and (2)\" that subjected the state to FERC regulation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"836754\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/587/716/\">\n    587 F.2d at 720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here,\n   by contrast, although Clarksville acceded to FERC jurisdiction when it applied for a Section 7 service area determination for Fort Campbell and the Kentucky Service Line, it did so only because its pipeline crossed state lines.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Intermountain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C359\">\n    97 FERC \u00b6 61,359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no similar acquiescence with respect to Clarksville's sales to Guthrie. Moreover, unlike\n   <em>\n    Intermountain\n   </em>\n   , in which we affirmed FERC's determination that it could regulate a municipality where its facilities crossed state lines because \"a municipality is authorized to act as a municipality only within its state of incorporation,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9320348,3719318\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/1281/\">\n    326 F.3d at 1284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Clarksville acts only within Tennessee, its state of incorporation, with respect to its sales to Guthrie.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=146%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C074\">\n    146 FERC \u00b6 61,074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at 61,310 (stating, without finding otherwise, Clarksville's representation that Guthrie owns and operates the pipeline that crosses the border). Accordingly, FERC's alternative argument fails as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we see no reason to deviate from the clear and unambiguous language of the statute and therefore grant the Petition for Review and vacate FERC's Service Area Order and Rehearing Order to the extent they are inconsistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Similarly, the entity challenging FERC's jurisdiction in\n    <em>\n     California v.
