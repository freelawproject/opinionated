First, he asserts that the\n   <em>\n    Yearsley\n   </em>\n   doctrine does not apply as a matter of law to federal claims. Next, he asserts that GDIT fails to qualify for\n   <em>\n    Yearsley\n   </em>\n   immunity both because the government did not authorize its actions and because the authorization was not validly conferred. Finally, he asserts that even if\n   <em>\n    Yearsley\n   </em>\n   immunity applies,\n   <em>\n    Yearsley\n   </em>\n   is a merits defense from liability rather than a jurisdictional immunity. We find these arguments unpersuasive, and now affirm the district court's dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pursuant to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, the United States is immune from private civil actions absent an express waiver.\n   <em>\n    Kerns v.

CMS maintains the HealthCare.gov website, through which individuals may enroll for health coverage under the ACA using an online application. The online application requires visitors to provide their name and phone number, and accept CMS's privacy policy by affirmatively clicking an \"Accept\" box acknowledging,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that CMS may use the phone number provided to contact them with more information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   To carry out their statutorily mandated obligations under the ACA, CMS awarded a contract to Vangent, Inc., which subsequently merged into GDIT, for contact center operations support for CMS programs, including the HealthCare.gov website. Under the contract, GDIT was required to make phone calls from January 1, 2015, through May 16, 2016, to inform individuals about their ability to buy health insurance through the health insurance exchanges created by the ACA. In accordance with this instruction, CMS authorized GDIT to use an autodialer to make the calls, provided a script for each call, and provided a list of phone numbers for each call. Section 17 of the CMS-GDIT contract also required GDIT to \"maintain a corporate compliance program\" that included \"[a]n internal monitoring and auditing function to help ensure compliance with statutes [and] regulations,\" and \"[a]n enforcement and disciplinary process to address violations of applicable statutes [and] regulations ....\" J.A. 731-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 1, 2015, pursuant to the ACA's statutory mandate, CMS sent GDIT approximately 2.65 million telephone numbers and directed GDIT to call each of those numbers over the next five days in accordance with their contract. The numbers were divided into seven lists specifying the exact day that GDIT was to call each number and which of the scripts CMS provided that GDIT was to use for each call. One of CMS's lists directed GDIT to call Cunningham's cell phone and approximately 680,000 other numbers the next day, December 2, 2015. GDIT made the autodialed, prerecorded call to Cunningham's cell phone on December 2, 2015. When Cunningham did not pick up, the prerecorded message left the following approximately 30-second voicemail message:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Hello!

This message was identical to the script CMS provided GDIT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Cunningham alleges that he received this autodialed, prerecorded phone call from GDIT advertising the commercial availability of health insurance without having given his prior consent, in violation of the TCPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As relevant here, the TCPA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   prohibits any person, absent the prior express consent of the recipient, from \"mak[ing] any call ... using any automatic telephone dialing system ... to a paging service [or] cellular telephone service ....\" Telephone Consumer Protection Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A)(3). The TCPA also authorizes a private right of action for conduct violating the Act. \u00a7 227(b)(3). However, \"[t]he United States and its agencies, it is undisputed, are not subject to the TCPA's prohibitions because no statute lifts their immunity.\"\n   <em>\n    Campbell-Ewald Co. v.

R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). On October 18, 2016, the district court issued an interim order concluding that GDIT was entitled to\n   <em>\n    Yearsley\n   </em>\n   immunity, and granted limited jurisdictional discovery for Cunningham to contest this determination. The district court issued this order, in part, because it concluded that CMS had \"authorized and instructed GDIT to do\n   <em>\n    exactly\n   </em>\n   what it did.\" J.A. 259. Discovery lasted 75 days and included six subpoenas, four Touhy requests, numerous document requests, six depositions of GDIT and CMS employees, and supplemental briefing on the issue. On May 1, 2017, the district court granted GDIT's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that GDIT was immune from suit under the\n   <em>\n    Yearsley\n   </em>\n   doctrine.

CMS contracted with GDIT to carry out this statutory mandate, and the contract required GDIT to call individuals about health insurance options. On December 1, 2016, CMS provided GDIT with a list of approximately 680,000 phone numbers, including Cunningham's cell phone number, and instructed GDIT to call the numbers on December 2, 2016, and leave a prerecorded message. The contract also permitted GDIT to use an autodialer to make the call. On December 2, 2016, GDIT used an autodialer to call Cunningham's cell phone number and left a voicemail with the exact script CMS had provided to GDIT. Quite plainly, GDIT performed exactly as CMS directed: GDIT called the number CMS instructed GDIT to call, on the prescribed day, and followed CMS's provided script when leaving the message.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Without contesting these facts, Cunningham nonetheless asserts that GDIT did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   perform as CMS directed. Cunningham argues that Section 17 of the CMS-GDIT contract required GDIT to follow applicable laws, and that by failing to independently obtain prior consent from each name on the list provided by CMS to ensure compliance with the TCPA, GDIT violated the contract, requiring this Court to find that CMS did not authorize GDIT's actions. This argument is unavailing. There is no indication that GDIT was authorized to contact these individuals other than to place the automated call, and GDIT was not permitted to deviate from the script provided. Deposition testimony from Naomi Johnson, the CMS Contracting Officer Representative, confirmed that CMS did not direct GDIT to obtain consent from the individuals on the call lists CMS provided, did not direct GDIT to investigate the numbers provided, and did not expect GDIT to obtain consent before making the calls. Therefore, we conclude that GDIT did not violate the contract by failing to independently obtain consent to make the phone call CMS instructed it to make.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Notably, this scenario is vastly distinguishable from the facts of\n   <em>\n    Campbell-Ewald\n   </em>\n   .

The purpose of\n   <em>\n    Yearsley\n   </em>\n   immunity is to prevent a government contractor from facing liability for an alleged violation of law, and thus, it cannot be that an alleged violation of law per se precludes\n   <em>\n    Yearsley\n   </em>\n   immunity. Consequently, we reject Cunningham's overinclusive interpretation of what constitutes a \"valid conferral\" of authority under this prong. We conclude that the government validly conferred the authorization for GDIT to make this phone call, satisfying step two of the\n   <em>\n    Yearsley\n   </em>\n   immunity analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Therefore, because the government authorized GDIT's actions and that authorization was validly conferred, we hold that the district court did not err in concluding that GDIT was entitled to derivative sovereign immunity for this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Finally, Cunningham asserts that even if the district court properly conferred\n   <em>\n    Yearsley\n   </em>\n   immunity on GDIT, the district court nonetheless erred in treating the\n   <em>\n    Yearsley\n   </em>\n   doctrine as immunity from suit and dismissing the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, rather than treating the doctrine as a merits defense to liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

In advancing this argument, Cunningham asserts that neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has squarely addressed the issue of whether the\n   <em>\n    Yearsley\n   </em>\n   defense is jurisdictional, and that the \"immunity\" provided by\n   <em>\n    Yearsley\n   </em>\n   is not necessarily a jurisdictional immunity.
