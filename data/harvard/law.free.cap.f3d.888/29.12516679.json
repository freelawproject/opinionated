Because the record on appeal is insufficient for us to proceed further, we will remand the case with instructions to determine whether the trusts at issue are of the traditional or business variety and whether there is diversity jurisdiction. We also instruct the District Court to give leave to further amend the complaint within a reasonable time to cure defective jurisdictional allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following an investment opportunity gone awry, the details of which are immaterial at this point, GBForefront, L.P., filed suit in the District Court against Forefront Management Group, LLC (\"FMG\"); Forefront Capital Management, LLC; Forefront Capital Markets, LLC; and Forefront Advisory, LLC, (collectively, the \"Defendants\") for breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Initially, GBForefront, which is a limited partnership, had sued only FMG, a limited liability company (or \"LLC\"), and alleged that the Court had diversity jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   because, among other things, GBForefront's general partner was an LLC whose sole member was a \"resident\" of Pennsylvania and \"none of [FMG's] members are residents of Pennsylvania.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (J.A. at 50, 719-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After years of litigation, GBForefront accepted an offer of judgment made by the Defendants pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68. The District Court accordingly entered judgment in favor of GBForefront and against the Defendants. Later, when a difficulty arose with satisfaction of the judgment, the parties submitted a joint motion to amend the judgment to effectuate a new settlement agreement. Pursuant to the terms of that agreement, GBForefront and the Defendants signed a consent judgment against Forefront Capital Markets, and they agreed that, in the event of any default by the Defendants in satisfying the settlement, GBForefront could immediately file a motion to enter that consent judgment. The District Court granted the joint motion, and everyone thought the case was over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   It was not. GBForefront soon alleged that \"[c]ertain Forefront entities\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   had defaulted on the terms of the settlement agreement, and it thus moved for entry of the consent judgment. (J.A. at 923). With the assistance of new counsel, the Defendants cross-moved to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, claiming that GBForefront had not adequately pled the citizenship of FMG and that complete diversity was lacking when the lawsuit was initially filed. The parties briefed the issue of diversity jurisdiction, but then came a twist. The Supreme Court issued its opinion in\n   <em>\n    Americold Realty\n   </em>\n   , specifically dealing with the citizenship of trusts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After holding a hearing and considering the parties' supplemental briefing on the new precedent, the District Court granted the Defendants' motion to dismiss because the Court determined the membership of GBForefront included at least three trusts whose beneficiaries were citizens of New Jersey\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and FMG also had a member who was a citizen of New Jersey.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court reasoned that\n   <em>\n    Emerald Investors\n   </em>\n   instructed it not to distinguish between traditional trusts and business trusts for jurisdictional purposes, and that\n   <em>\n    Americold Realty\n   </em>\n   required the citizenship of a business trust to include all its members, including its beneficiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   GBForefront timely appealed the dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, GBForefront argues that the\n   <em>\n    Americold Realty\n   </em>\n   holding described by the District Court applies only to business trusts, while the trusts composing GBForefront are traditional trusts whose citizenship is based only on the citizenship of their trustees. The Defendants of course disagree, asserting that\n   <em>\n    Americold Realty\n   </em>\n   requires that the citizenship of trust beneficiaries always be accounted for when determining diversity jurisdiction. The Defendants further assert that GBForefront comprises a series of trusts whose beneficiaries' citizenship prevents subject matter jurisdiction based on diversity. The resolution of this jurisdictional dispute accordingly turns on the Supreme Court's\n   <em>\n    Americold Realty\n   </em>\n   opinion. In our view, that case instructs that, for purposes of diversity jurisdiction, the citizenship of a traditional trust must be determined by the citizenship of its trustee alone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. General Principles of Diversity Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   It is fundamental that federal courts must have subject matter jurisdiction before reaching the merits of a case, and, as its name indicates, jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship requires that opposing parties be citizens of diverse states.\n   <em>\n    Zambelli Fireworks Mfg.

Distinguishing Between Traditional And Business Trusts In This Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The remaining question is how to distinguish between traditional and business trusts. The primary point of distinction is, again, in light of\n   <em>\n    Americold Realty\n   </em>\n   , that a traditional trust exists as a fiduciary relationship and not as a distinct legal entity.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594853\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1012/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1016 (citing Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 2 ). Another general distinction between traditional and business trusts is that a traditional trust facilitates a donative transfer, whereas a business trust implements a bargained-for exchange.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.I.

The Defendants point out that the trusts did not initiate the lawsuit, and rather are relevant only for jurisdictional purposes because they are limited partners of a limited partnership that in turn is a limited partner of the partnership that actually initiated the lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 1 (describing GBForefront's ownership structure). According to the Defendants,\n   <em>\n    Americold Realty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Carden\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Navarro\n   </em>\n   can be distinguished as applying only when the trust or trustee was the party that sued or was sued. Thus, they argue, the trust entities are involved in the lawsuit through the layers of GBForefront's ownership structure, so their beneficiaries are necessarily involved too. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The rules for determining citizenship do not change depending on whether a trust is embedded within another business entity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lincoln Benefit Life Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340529\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/800/99/#p107\">\n    800 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   105 n.16 (stating rule to trace citizenship through \"however many layers of partners or members there may be\" (citation omitted));\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Given the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Americold Realty\n   </em>\n   , the jurisdictional citizenship of a traditional trust is only that of its trustee. That rule is definitive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Unfortunately, the record on appeal is insufficient for us to apply that rule to resolve the Defendants' factual challenge to diversity jurisdiction in this case. In particular, the record is insufficient because GBForefront comprised five trusts but the record only contains the trust instrument for one of them. We must, therefore, remand to the District Court with instructions for it to determine, based on the foregoing guidance, whether the trusts at issue are traditional or business trusts and thus whether there is diversity jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

But in its initial complaint, GBForefront referred to a \"member\" of those entities. (J.A. at 50.) We understand GBForefront to be referring to the sole member of GBForefront's general partner, GBForefront General, LLC, and to the sole member of Weiner 2 General LLC, the general partner of GBForefront's limited partner WFP2, LP.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    At the time the complaint was filed, GBForefront, L.P., was a limited partnership composed of a general partner, GBForefront General, LLC, and a limited partner, WPF2, LP. The sole member of GBForefront General was Warren Weiner, alleged to be a resident of Pennsylvania. Limited partner WPF2 itself was a limited partnership composed of a general partner, Weiner 2 General LLC, and a series of five trusts as limited partners. The sole member of Weiner 2 General LLC was Warren Weiner. Those trusts were established for each of Warren Weiner's five grandchildren with Warren Weiner designated as the trustee of each trust. At least three of those grandchildren lived in New Jersey at the time the complaint was filed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    As the District Court noted, it is unclear which entities GBForefront was referring to.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    <em>\n     See supra\n    </em>\n    n.1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    GBForefront did not plead the citizenship of the beneficiaries and member in its complaint.\n    <em>\n     See infra\n    </em>\n    Section II.B.
