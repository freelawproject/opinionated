We reverse and instruct that the district court enter judgment in favor of the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Rent Control Ordinance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 1979, the City of Carson adopted a \"Mobile Home Space Rent Control Ordinance,\" establishing a seven-member Rent Review Board to \"hear and determine applications of property owners for rent adjustments.\" The ordinance directs the Board to grant property owners a \"fair, just and reasonable\" rent increase, one that both \"protects Homeowners from excessive\n   rent increases and allows a fair return on investment to the Park Owner.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   To balance these competing concerns, the ordinance lists several factors to be considered when evaluating a proposed rent increase, including changes in the Consumer Price Index (\"CPI\"), rent at comparable parks, capital improvements conducted since the last increase, and changes in operating and maintenance expenses. The listed factors, however, are neither exclusive nor dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To assist the Board, the City Council adopted Implementation Guidelines in 1998. The original Guidelines permitted, but did not require, the Board to conduct a \"Gross Profits Maintenance Analysis\" (\"GPM Analysis\") in evaluating a rent increase application. A GPM Analysis \"compares the gross profit level expected from the last rent increase granted to the park prior to the current application ... to the gross profit shown by the current application.\" The Analysis \"provide[s] an estimate of whether a park is earning the profit estimated to provide a fair return, as established by the immediately prior rent increase, with some adjustment to reflect any increase in the CPI.\" Acquisition debt service can be a relevant expense under the GPM Analysis \"if the purchase price paid was reasonable in light of the rents allowed under the Ordinance and involved prudent and customary financing practices.\" But the Guidelines expressly state that a GPM Analysis \"is not intended to create any entitlement to any particular rent increase.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In October 2006, the City amended the Implementation Guidelines to permit the Board also to conduct a \"Maintenance of Net Operating Income Analysis\" (\"MNOI Analysis\") when considering applications for rent increases. The MNOI Analysis \"compares the net operating income (NOI) level expected from the last rent increase granted to a park owner and prior to any pending rent increase application ... to the NOI demonstrated in any pending rent increase application.\" \"[C]hanges in debt service expenses are not to be considered in the\" MNOI Analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Colony's Purchase of the Mobile Home Park and Requested Rent Increases\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On April 4, 2006, Colony Cove Properties, LLC (\"Colony\") purchased Colony Cove Mobile Estates (\"the Property\"), a mobile home park in Carson, for $23,050,000; $18,000,000 of the purchase price was obtained through a loan. The annual debt service on that loan-$1,224,681-far exceeded the prior owner's annual profit of $718,240.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the time of purchase, the Implementation Guidelines provided only for the GPM Analysis. Colony first filed an application for a rent increase in 2007, after the Guidelines were revised to also allow an MNOI Analysis. That application sought a rent increase of $618.05 per space; it was later amended to seek only $200 per space. The Board's GPM Analysis suggested a rent increase of $200.93 per space, driven largely by the post-acquisition debt service. The Board's MNOI Analysis, which did not account for the debt service, suggested a rent increase of only $36.74. The Board adopted the MNOI Analysis and approved the $36.74 increase. In 2008, Colony requested a $342.46 rent increase. The Board again conducted both a GPM and an MNOI Analysis, adopted the latter, and granted an increase of $25.02.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Colony's Previous Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2008, Colony sued the City, asserting facial and as-applied takings and due process claims with respect to the Board's 2007 decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Colony Cove Props., LLC v.

The district court dismissed all of Colony's claims except for an as-applied regulatory takings claim premised on\n   <em>\n    Penn Central Transportation Co. v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769262\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/104/\">\n    438 U.S. 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769262\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/104/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769262\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/104/\">\n    57 L.Ed.2d 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Over the City's objection, the district court allowed a jury trial. At trial, Colony presented expert testimony that the Board's use of the MNOI Analysis and the consequent failure to take debt service into account in setting the 2007 and 2008 rents would cause Colony to lose rental income of approximately $5.7 million. Colony's owner, James Goldstein, also testified that, when he bought the Property, he expected the Board to consider debt service in future rent increase determinations, and he would not have paid $23 million for the park absent that expectation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The City moved for judgment as a matter of law after both the close of Colony's case and the close of evidence. After the district court denied the motions, the jury found that the Board's 2007 and 2008 decisions were regulatory takings and awarded Colony $3,336,056 in damages. The City then filed a renewed Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b) motion for judgment. The court denied the motion and awarded Colony prejudgment interest, attorneys' fees, and costs, entering a final judgment of $7,464,718.41.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The City timely appealed.

But Colony presented no evidence, expert or otherwise, about the Property's post-deprivation value. Rather, the only evidence concerned the amount of rent claimed to be lost over an 8-year period because of the Board's refusals to approve higher increases. Even assuming that the lost rental income asserted by Colony-$5.7 million-equates to diminution in property value, that reduction would only be 24.8% of the assumed $23 million pre-deprivation value of the Property, far too small to establish a regulatory taking.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Colony argues that post-deprivation \"sale value is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the only permissible basis to consider economic loss.\" We agree-for example, the discounted future cash flows produced by an income-producing property can provide an appropriate valuation methodology.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em>\n    Cienega Gardens v.

We address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   1. The Implementation Guidelines-even before the 2006 Amendment allowing MNOI Analysis-clearly could not have\n   formed the basis for an objectively reasonable expectation that the Board would always account for debt service in considering future rent increases. The Guidelines plainly stated that \"[n]o one factor in the Ordinance is determinative and the facts must be considered together and balanced in light of the purposes of the Ordinance and all the relevant evidence.\" More importantly, the Guidelines stressed that the GPM Analysis \"is not intended to create any entitlement to any particular rent increase.\" Indeed, Colony concedes that \"Carson does not permit an automatic rent increase based on a set formula.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   2. Goldstein's experience as an owner of another mobile home park in Carson in the two decades before his purchase of the Property did not establish a reasonable expectation that the Board would consider debt service in all rent increase applications. As a general matter, an investor must account for \"the burden of rent control\" in its expectations about future increased rental income.\n   <em>\n    Guggenheim v. City of Goleta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4199157\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/638/1111/#p1120\">\n    638 F.3d 1111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1120-21 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc). And, the Implementation Guidelines, adopted in 1998-long before the purchase of the Property-made plain that use of a GPM Analysis created no expectation to a particular rent increase. Moreover, the Board did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   consider acquisition interest expenses in Goldstein's first application for a rent increase at his other park. Goldstein initially applied for a $57.85 rent increase for that park, $41.38 of which related to increased debt service. The Board, however, granted only a $12 rent increase, which did not account for the debt service. Thus, an objectively reasonable person could not have expected that all future rent increase applications seeking increases because of debt service would be granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   3. Colony's contention that the two California Court of Appeal decisions require \"the City to take debt service into account in considering rent-increase applications, and ... preclude[d] the City from ... using MNOI,\" misreads both opinions. Neither mandates that a rent control board account for debt service in determining rent increases. Rather, both merely hold that a Board must conduct the analyses it represented it would conduct, without requiring the adoption of a particular method of analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Palacio de Anza\n   </em>\n   simply required a rent control board to apply its guidelines when considering a rent increase application.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=257%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20121\">\n    257 Cal.Rptr. at 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
