In any event, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution <em>(see, People v Contes, </em>60 NY2d 620), we find that it was legally sufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, resolution of issues of credibility, as well as the weight to be accorded to the evidence presented, are primarily questions to be determined by the jury, which saw and heard the witnesses <em>(see, People v Gaimari, </em>176 NY 84, 94). Its determination should be accorded great weight on appeal and should not be disturbed unless clearly unsupported by the record <em>(see, People v Garafolo, </em>44 AD2d 86, 88). Upon the exercise of our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>factual review power, we are satisfied that the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence <em>(see, </em>CPL 470.15 [5]).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">The sentence imposed was not excessive <em>(see, People v Suitte, </em>90 AD2d 80).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are either unpreserved for appellate review or without merit. Thompson, J. P., Pizzuto, Santucci and Joy, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
