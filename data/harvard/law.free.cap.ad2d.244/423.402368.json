In any event, the court properly intervened in an effort to clarify the issues and facilitate the expeditious and orderly progress of the proceedings <em>(see, People v Moulton, </em>43 NY2d 944; <em>People v Dominguez, </em>210 AD2d 249).</p><p id=\"b467-9\">The court\u2019s refusal to sanction the prosecution for the destruction of a tape of a telephone call made after the robbery to 911, the police emergency phone number, was not an improvident exercise of discretion. There was no showing of bad faith on the part of the People or prejudice to the defendant, and a \u201cSprint\u201d report of the telephone call was supplied <em>(see, People v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number><em>Gibbs, </em>211 AD2d 641; <em>People v Grice, </em>203 AD2d 587, 588; <em>People v Diggs, </em>185 AD2d 990, 991; <em>People v Deas, </em>174 AD2d 751, 752).</p><p id=\"b468-3\">The defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit <em>(see, People v Melendez, </em>55 NY2d 445; <em>Matter of Leon RR, </em>48 NY2d 117, 122-123).
