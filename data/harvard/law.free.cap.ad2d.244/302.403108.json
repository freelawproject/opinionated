The defendant third-party plaintiff Calcagno Construction Company (hereinafter Calcagno) was the general contractor and the third-party defendant, John DiNaso &amp; Sons, Inc. (hereinafter DiNaso), the injured plaintiff\u2019s employer, was the roofing subcontractor. While on the roof of the house examining the chimney, the injured plaintiff slipped on snow and fell on the roof injuring his left elbow.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The Supreme Court correctly denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment against Calcagno on its Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) cause of action and granted those branches of the cross motions of Calcagno and DiNaso which were for partial summary judgment dismissing that cause of action. Amirr\u2019s injury did not result from an elevation-related hazard such as falling from a height or being struck by a falling object that was improperly hoisted or inadequately secured (see, <em>Ross v Curtis-Palmer Hydro-Elec. Co., </em>81 NY2d 494, 501; <em>Rocovich v Consolidated Edison Co., </em>78 NY2d 509, 514; <em>see also, Mitchell v County of Jefferson, </em>226 AD2d 1109; <em>McCague v Walsh Constr., </em>225 AD2d 530; <em>White v Dorose Holding, </em>216 AD2d 290).
