A majority holds that the 1987 legislation is applicable to the weekly benefits of all workers injured before March 31, 1982, without regard to whether there was a prior adjudication in, or pursuant to, <em>Franks.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ANBm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Harry L. Quinton was bom in 1915. He worked for General Motors Corporation until July, 1974. After his last day of work at General Motors, he filed a petition for hearing, alleging that his employment had caused disabling silicosis and emphysema. A 1976 decision of a hearing referee provided an open award of benefits, requiring General Motors to pay weekly benefits until further order of the Bureau of Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation. The referee\u2019s decision was not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">1981 PA 203 added \u00a7 354 of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As explained in <em>Franks, </em>this section directs that worker\u2019s compensation benefits be reduced by the amount of certain pension and retirement payments that an injured employee may be receiving. The effective date was March 31, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">In April, 1982, and again in July, 1982, General Motors notified Quinton that his benefits would be reduced under \u00a7 354, reflecting a coordination of his after-tax pension benefit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Quinton filed a May, 1982, petition for hearing, and General Motors filed a July, 1982, notice of dispute. The referee\u2019s decision directed General Motors to restore Quinton\u2019s full weekly benefits, saying that \u00a7 354 \u201cmay not be applied retroactively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>The WCAB affirmed in 1983.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal. This Court held this case in abeyance pending a decision in Franks,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AkN\"><em>Franks </em>was decided in October, 1985. This Court held that \u00a7 354 was intended to apply retroactively, and thus \u201can employer may reduce the amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits payable after March 31, 1982, for periods of disability <em>after </em>that date, by deducting other employer-financed benefits as provided in \u00a7 354 . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A3N\">This Court then reversed the judgment of the WCAB in this case, and remanded to the WCAB \u201cfor entry of a judgment consistent with our decision in <em>[Franks].\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ATV\">On remand, a two-member panel of the WCAB ruled in May, 1986, that Quinton\u2019s benefits were subject to coordination under \u00a7 354 \u201ceffective March 31, 1982, and thereafter,\u201d pursuant to Franks.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>The Legislature quickly responded. 1987 PA 28 amended \u00a7 354, indicating its disagreement with the decision of this Court in Franks.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Legislature directed in amended subsections 354(17)-(20) that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>there be no coordination for persons like the plaintiff, whose injury was before March 31, 1982.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Subsections 354(17)-(20) were challenged in this Court, but the legislation was found to be constitutional. <em>Romein v General Motors Corp, </em>436 Mich 515; 462 NW2d 555 (1990).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Because <em>Romein </em>was being appealed to the United States Supreme Court, this Court stayed enforcement of subsections 354(17)-(20).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> After the United States Supreme Court affirmed <em>Romein </em>in March, 1992, this Court vacated the stay and directed that the statute be enforced.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">A lawyer representing Quinton wrote, in April, 1992, to General Motors, seeking repayment of all coordinated benefits, plus interest. When the money was not paid, the lawyer requested a hearing. A magistrate ordered General Motors to \u201crepay with interest all past coordinated benefits,\u201d and directed that General Motors \u201cshall not coordinate any future weekly Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits.\u201d The magistrate said that he was bound by the Legislature\u2019s action, and by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>the April, 1992, enforcement order that this Court entered following <em>Romein.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">General Motors again appealed. In January, 1994, the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission reversed the decision of the magistrate. It noted this Court\u2019s statement in <em>Romein </em>that \u00a7 354 \u201cmay validly be applied to all compensation liabilities within its terms <em>except those which have been reduced to final judgment before its </em>enactment.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The wcac ' referenced this Court\u2019s further explanation: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">We hold, therefore, that 1987 PA 28 is constitutional even though it applies to benefits due and payable for a period before the effective date of the statute. We hold further that only judgments entered under former law are immune from this legislative modification. This limitation protects the vested rights that form in reliance on an award at the moment it is reduced to a final judgment. [436 Mich 533.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The WCAC said that this \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d holding of <em>Romein </em>meant that 1987 PA 28 \u201ccannot be applied to the parties in this matter, because the right to coordinate was entered as a final judgment in 1986, before the effective date of the amendments.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Avc\">The Court of Appeals, in denying leave to appeal, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\">The Court orders that the application for leave to appeal is denied for lack of merit in the grounds presented in light of the final judgment entered by the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board on May 28, 1986, pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Supreme Court\u2019s direction in <em>Quinton v General Motors Corp, </em>424 Mich 884 (1986).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">The plaintiffs applied to this Court for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In <em>Romein, </em>this Court held that 1987 PA 28 was a constitutional exercise of the Legislature\u2019s authority. By enacting subsections 354(17&gt;(20), the Legislature established that persons injured before March 31, 1982, are not subject to the coordination requirements of \u00a7 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">This Court said, however, in <em>Romein </em>that the provisions of subsections 354(17)-(20) do not apply where the rights of the parties were reduced to final judgment before the effective date of 1987 PA 28:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\">The employers\u2019 right to coordinate benefits as provided by statute in 1982 was repealed by 1987 PA 28 through a constitutional exercise of legislative authority to regulate social and economic life. We hold that 1987 PA 28 does not violate the Due Process Clauses of the state and federal constitutions, the Contract Clause of the federal constitution, or the <em>Separation of Powers Clause of the Michigan Constitution, so long as it is not applied to impair coordination rights that were reduced to final judgment before its effective date. </em>[436 Mich 539-540 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>This Court declared this exception for final judgments because, at the time,' we were concerned that a broader order permitting all qualifying claimants to recover improperly coordinated benefits, regardless of the extent to which they had litigated their claims, might run afoul of either the Michigan or federal constitution. This Court\u2019s statement was, however, dicta. <em>Romein </em>and its companion case, <em>Gonzalez, </em>were on direct appeal; their cases had not, as had Quinton\u2019s case, been dismissed pursuant to <em>Franks </em>in an order that had become final before the enactment of the 1987 legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">It is well settled that issues neither briefed nor argued cannot be definitively decided, and that the Court\u2019s pronouncements,, especially dicta, without briefing and argument, are not stare decisis.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>1 therefore turn to the Michigan and United States Constitutions to consider what potential barriers to recovery Quinton\u2019s claim presents that were absent in <em>Romein.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">As most know from their early American history lessons, this country\u2019s founders and the authors of the Constitution of the United States of America established a tripartite system of government. The three branches, executive, judiciary, and legislative, are to remain separate and independent.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Of particular relevance to this case, the doctrine of separation of powers has been said by text writers to stand for the proposition that the Legislature may not frustrate the decisions of the judiciary by subjecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>them to \u201crevision, suspension, modification, or other review by the executive or legislative branches.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court early intimated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-4\">It is not within the power of a legislature to take away rights which have been once vested by a judgment. Legislation may act on subsequent proceedings, may abate actions pending, but when those actions have passed into judgment the power of the legislature to disturb the rights created thereby ceases)[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The doctrine of separation- of powers is expressly set forth in the Michigan Constitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">The powers of government are divided into three branches: legislative, executive and judicial. No person exercising powers of one branch shall exercise powers properly belonging to another branch except as expressly provided in this constitution. [Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">As in the federal system, this doctrine has been said to preclude the Legislature from reversing<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> or setting aside<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> a judgment entered by a court. <em>Wylie v Grand Rapids City Comm, </em>293 Mich 571, 582-583; 292 NW 668 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">While the accuracy of the foregoing statements concerning the power of a legislature to overrule a decision of a court, as expressed by this one Court of justice or the United States Supreme Court continues to go unchallenged in its most general sense, it has been noted by more than one constitutional scholar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>that \u201c[t]he source and contours of th[e] separation-of-powers limitation are somewhat murky . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> I take guidance from the recent decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Plaut v Spendthrift Farm, Inc, </em>514 US 211; 115 S Ct 1447; 131 L Ed 2d 328 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">In <em>Plaut, </em>purchasers of stock shares of a corporation brought an action against the corporation and other defendants, alleging violations of subsection 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> At the time, because subsection 10(b) did not contain an express provision concerning the length of the applicable period of limitation, there were questions concerning what limitation period would be accorded Plaut and other plaintiffs who filed similar actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The issue was settled finally by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &amp; Petigrow v Gilbertson, </em>501 US 350; 111 S Ct 2773; 115 L Ed 2d 321 (1991). The Court ruled that a uniform statute of limitations was to apply, which mandated that actions be brought within three years from the time the event constituting the violation took place or within one year after the discovery of the violation. As a result of <em>Lampf, </em>Plaut\u2019s complaint was dismissed as untimely by a United States district court. Plaut did not appeal the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">In response to <em>Lampf, </em>Congress amended the Securities Exchange Act by adding \u00a7 27A.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>27A allowed the reinstatement of any complaint alleging a violation of subsection 10(b) that was filed before June 20, 1991, the date <em>Lampf </em>was decided, provided that the complaint would have been timely under the local laws applicable to the particular jurisdiction.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Pla<em>ut </em>found \u00a7 27A to be unconstitutional as violative of the doctrine of separation of powers because it required the reopening and setting aside of final judgments entered by federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Although this Court is not bound by Justice Scalia\u2019s analysis for the Court in <em>Plaut, </em>where, as here, state separation of powers concerns are implicated, we acknowledge the weight a decision of the highest court in the land carries. Because I find Justice Scalia\u2019s reasoning historically compelling, logically persuasive, and consistent with Michigan separation of powers jurisprudence, I adopt his analysis to the extent it is applicable to the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>The <em>Plaut </em>majority stated that \u201cCongress may not declare by retroactive legislation that the law applicable to that very case was something other than what the courts said it was.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> It also implicitly recognized, however, the flexibility of the doctrine of separation of powers. The Court distinguished earlier cases in which separation of powers concerns were present, yet not invasive enough to render the legislation unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The majority in <em>Plaut </em>observed that legislative action had been upheld as valid in cases where the tribunal issuing the judgment was not an article III court, <em>Sampeyreac v United States, </em>32 US (7 Pet) 222; 8 L Ed 665 (1833);<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> where the judgment came from an administrative agency, <em>Paramino Lumber Co v Marshall, </em>309 US 370; 60 S Ct 600; 84 L Ed 814 (1940);<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> where the government had waived its right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>to have the judgment accorded conclusive res judicata effect, <em>United States v Sioux Nation, </em>448 US 371; 100 S Ct 2716; 65 L Ed 2d 844 (1980), <em>Cherokee Nation v United States, </em>270 US 476; 46 S Ct 428; 70 L Ed 694 (1926);<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and where the Congress acted to validate public, rather than private, rights; <em>Pennsylvania v Wheeling &amp; Belmont Bridge Co, </em>59 US (18 How) 421; 15 L Ed 435 (1855).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>iv</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">An analysis of subgroups ir which workers injured before March 31, 1982, fall indicates that resolution of the separation of powers issue, in accordance with <em>Plant, </em>clearly entitles most workers affected to a full, unreduced, and uncoordinated benefit, either because no case was ever pending before the WCAB or because their cases were dismissed by the wcab, an administrative tribunal and not a court, on its own initiative, and not pursuant to a directive from this Court or the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Because the doctrine of separation of powers bars the Legislature from reopening and setting aside orders entered by a <em>court, </em>workers injured before March 31, 1982, should be divided into two groups: those who accepted coordination and thus a reduced weekly benefit from and after March 31, 1982, without filing a petition seeking a hearing, and those who objected and sought a hearing resulting in an administrative or judicial determination. Those who objected and sought a hearing may be further divided into two groups: those whose cases were pending before the wcab when <em>Franks </em>was decided, and those whose cases had been decided by the wcab and were pending in the judicial appellate pipeline before the Court of Appeals or this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">No administrative or court order was entered concerning those who did not object, and who accepted a reduced benefit, and thus no separation of powers issue can arise respecting the 1987 retroactive legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>tive directive barring coordination. They were paid in full in 1987 by General Motors an uncoordinated benefit from and after March 31, 1982, pursuant to subsections 354(17)-(20) as added by the 1987 legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">An administrative tribunal is not a court \u2014 it is not part of the judicial branch of government. Because the WCAB is not a court, but an administrative tribunal, arguably there is no separation of powers issue with respect to those workers whose cases were pending before the wcab when <em>Franks </em>was decided, and whose cases were dismissed or resolved on the initiative of the WCAB on the basis of <em>Franks </em>by entry of an order on the authority of <em>Franks. Paramino Lumber Co v </em>Marshall<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> was distinguished in <em>Plaut </em>on that basis.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Simply because an administrative tribunal cites a rule of law or other precedent established by a court does not convert the order of an administrative tribunal into an order of a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Following this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Franks, </em>orders were entered by this Court in <em>Quinton </em>and in at least thirty-nine other cases, remanding them to the wcab \u201cfor entry of a judgment consistent with <em>Franks . . . </em>.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Although the operative order reducing Quinton\u2019s benefits was entered by the WCAB, rather than by a court, under the circumstance that the wcab acted at the express direction of this Court in entering a judgment consistent with this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Franks, </em>it is, I think, clear that those orders should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>be deemed to be, for separation of powers analysis, orders entered by a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">We are not informed concerning the nature of the orders entered by the Court of Appeals in the cases pending before it when <em>Franks </em>was decided, whether they, too, directed the WCAB to enter a judgment consistent with this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Franks, </em>or whether they simply remanded for reconsideration in light of <em>Franks, </em>nor are we informed how many such orders were entered by the Court of Appeals. Although not necessary to decision, since I conclude that because there is no reopening or setting aside of an order or judgment, the doctrine of separation of powers was not violated, I am inclined to treat an order entered by an administrative tribunal, pursuant to a court order directing reconsideration in light of a recently announced judicial decision, as an order implicating the doctrine of separation of powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">In <em>Plant, </em>subsection 27A(b) provided that certain actions that had been <em>\u201cdismissed </em>as time barred\u201d and \u201cwhich would have been timely filed\u201d under concepts identified in \u00a7 27A <em>\u201cshall be reinstated </em>on motion by the plaintiff not later than 60 days after December 19, 1991.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The United States Supreme Court summarized its holding in the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">By retroactively commanding the federal courts to <em>reopen </em>final judgments, Congress has violated this fundamental principle.[<footnotemark>35</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>We know of no previous instance in which Congress has enacted retroactive legislation requiring an Article III court to <em>set aside </em>a final judgment, and for good reason. The Constitution\u2019s separation of legislative and judicial powers denies it the authority to do so. Section 27A(b) is unconstitutional to the extent that it requires federal courts to <em>reopen </em>final judgments entered before its enactment. [Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>36</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The key words in the summarizing statements are \u201creopen\u201d and \u201cset aside.\u201d The 1987 legislation amending \u00a7 354 \u2014 in contrast with subsection 27A(b), which expressly required the \u201creinstatement\u201d of actions that had been \u201cdismissed,\u201d and thus the \u201creopening\u201d and \u201csetting aside\u201d of final judgments entered by United States district courts \u2014 did not require the reopening or setting aside of any order entered by the wcab pursuant to <em>Franks.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Pursuant to the 1986 WCAB order entered in <em>Quinton, </em>General Motors paid him a reduced coordinated weekly benefit of $18.79 until the effective date of the 1987 legislation.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Thus, the order entered pursuant to this Court\u2019s directive remanding to the wcab for entry of an order pursuant to <em>Franks, </em>was implemented \u2014 it was not reopened or set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">General Motors concedes that from and after the May 14, 1987, effective date of the 1987 legislation, the weekly benefit may not be reduced by coordination with Quinton\u2019s pension. Thus, General Motors does not claim that the doctrine of separation of pow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>ers precludes the Legislature from modifying, reopening, or setting aside the orders entered by the WCAB pursuant to <em>Franks </em>from and after the effective date of the 1987 legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">The issue then becomes whether the 1987 legislation violates the doctrine of separation of powers in requiring that Quinton and others be paid for the period between the March 31, 1982, effective date of the 1981 legislation and the May 14, 1987, effective date of the 1987 legislation, the weekly benefit, without reduction for coordination with a pension or other retirement benefits identified in the 1981 legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Because the 1987 legislation does not, with regard to periods before the May 14, 1987, effective date of the 1987 legislation, require a reopening or setting aside of the 1986 WCAB orders, except possibly with respect to periods after the effective date of the 1987 legislation \u2014 which General Motors concedes does not involve any separation of powers issue \u2014 the 1987 legislation does not violate the doctrine of separation of powers concerning periods before its effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">To be sure, the 1987 legislation sought to modify the result of <em>Franks, </em>by barring coordination retroactively between March 31, 1982, and May 14, 1987, and by requiring repayment by General Motors to workers injured before March 31, 1982, of amounts deducted pursuant to <em>Franks. </em>But, <em>Plaut </em>does not preclude the Legislature from so modifying the operative effect of a prior judgment or order, if this can be accomplished without reopening or setting aside a judgment entered by a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The 1987 legislation operates independently of reopening or setting aside the 1986 WCAB orders. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>simply requires payment to all in Quinton\u2019s class an uncoordinated benefit from and after March 31, 1982. It is of no importance whether the Legislature, in fact, intended, when 1981 PA 203 was enacted, that benefits would be coordinated, as this Court concluded in <em>Franks, </em>or simply changed its mind and decided, after the clamor following the announcement of this Court\u2019s decision in Franks, to amend the law to repeal and eliminate coordination retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">The 1987 legislation, requiring payment to each worker of the amount that was deducted, does not implicate the doctrine of separation of powers simply because it modifies the operative effect of the <em>Franks </em>decision <em>retroactively. </em>The Legislature can constitutionally accomplish its will without a violation of the doctrine of separation of powers because this was accomplished independently of any reopening or setting aside of orders entered pursuant to. <em>Franks.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">It might be urged that it elevates form over substance to hold that the doctrine of separation of powers does not preclude the Legislature from accomplishing indirectly by independent or separate legislation changes in the operative effect of a prior judgment that are in practical effect tantamount to reopening or setting aside a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">It is, however, fundamental that the Legislature is empowered to overrule a judicial decision, and change the substantive law; that it may do so prospectively is indisputable. That it may even do so retroactively, at least insofar as worker\u2019s compensation benefits are concerned, is equally well established as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>set forth in <em>Romein </em>and in the decisions discussed in part vi.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">There is thus unavoidable tension between the power of the Legislature to legislate retroactively and the judicial power to enter final judgments. Where to draw the line is then the question \u2014 should it be drawn to bar only retroactive legislation that actually reopens or sets aside a judgment, or also to bar retroactive legislation that does not actually do so, but has the operative effect of doing so?</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Text writers and others have written in broad terms regarding the scope of the doctrine of separation of powers. It is significant, however, that <em>Plant </em>appears to be the first pertinent<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> decision of the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Supreme Court to actually hold that an act of Congress was unconstitutional because it violated the doctrine of separation of powers. In all the other cases, Sampeyreac,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> <em>Paramino Lumber </em>Co,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> <em>Sioux </em>and <em>Cherokee </em>Nation,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> <em>Wheeling &amp; Belmont Bridge </em>Co,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> and Robertson,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> the legislation was found to be constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">In the three Michigan cases where the doctrine of separation of powers was adverted to, only <em>Moser v White, </em>29 Mich 59 (1874),<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> held the legislative act to be unconstitutional insofar as it would reopen a final judgment. In <em>Wylie v Grand Rapids City Comm, supra, </em>this Court found, after discussing in dicta the doctrine of separation of powers, that the act was not retroactive and, hence, did not apply to judgments entered before the legislation was enacted.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> In <em>Butler v Saginaw Co Bd of Supervisors, </em>26 Mich 21, 27-28 (1872), this Court found, after first referring in dicta to the doctrine of separation of powers, that the curative act failed to overcome the deficiencies in the law and in the procedure followed, so that the application for a writ of mandamus to compel the board of supervisors to levy drain taxes must be denied. The Court observed with some delicacy: \u201cThe line which separates judicial from legislative authority is clear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>distinct, and the principle is so well settled and understood that it is seldom called in question, and probably not often violated except through inadvertence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Plant </em>is limited to a \u201creopening\u201d or \u201csetting aside\u201d of a final judgment.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The Court said that \u201cthe doctrine of separation of powers is a <em>structural safeguard </em>rather than a remedy to be applied only when specific harm, or risk of specific harm, can be identified,\u201d (emphasis in original) and spoke of the importance of \u201cestablishing high walls and clear distinctions because low walls and vague distinctions will not be judicially defensible in the heat of interbranch conflict.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Were this Court to expand the doctrine of separation of powers beyond the actual \u201creopening\u201d or \u201csetting aside\u201d of a judgment to bar acts of the Legislature that do not actually reopen or set aside final judgments, but have the operative effect of doing so, it would become engaged in drawing vague rather than clear distinctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The doctrine of separation of powers operates somewhat arbitrarily. Of those who were injured before March 31, 1982, probably the greatest number<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> are in the subgroup consisting of those who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>accepted coordination without seeking a hearing. Their claims clearly cannot be denied \u2014 even though the operative effect of recognizing their claims undercuts this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Franks </em>\u2014 on the basis of the doctrine of separation of powers because there is neither a judgment of a court nor even a WCAB order requiring coordination.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">Similarly, the subgroup consisting of those whose cases were still pending before the WCAB when <em>Franks </em>was decided, who arguably cannot be precluded under the doctrine of separation of powers, because the WCAB orders requiring coordination pursuant to <em>Franks </em>were entered on the wcab\u2019s initiative without a directive from the Court of Appeals or this Court, also can be seen as benefiting by a somewhat arbitrary line.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Since the doctrine of separation of powers, as elucidated in <em>Plant, </em>is a structural safeguard, a prophylactic device, rather than an immutable principle, there is no need to erect a wall higher than that established by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Plant, </em>where the holding is limited to actually \u201copening\u201d or \u201csetting aside\u201d a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">In <em>Romein, </em>this Court affirmed the power of the Legislature to enact a retroactive benefit, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>United States Supreme Court affirmed, saying there was no due process violation.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">A worker\u2019s compensation award is distinguishable from a judgment in an action in tort or for breach of contract. Worker\u2019s compensation provides a system of income maintenance. <em>Franks, supra </em>at 654. Partially in recognition of this, the Court has held that a worker\u2019s compensation award is subject to modification both prospectively and retrospectively, in response to changes in law and fact. See <em>Goines v Kelsey Hayes Wheel Co, </em>294 Mich 156, 158; 292 NW 686 (1940); <em>Romein, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Because the circumstances affecting a worker\u2019s compensation award are subject to change, this Court has said that, unlike awards handed down in cases arising in other areas of law, \u201cthe amount of an employee\u2019s award [in a worker\u2019s compensation case] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>is never final . . .\" <em>Pike v City of Wyoming, </em>431 Mich 589, 602; 433 NW2d 768 (1988). \u201cFinality is not in the design or the interest of the workers\u2019 compensation scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606 (Brickley, J., concurring).<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">This Court has also recognized that when an award granted pursuant to the worker\u2019s compensation act is to be paid \u201cuntil further order,\u201d as is the case here, it is not a \u201cfinal determination\u201d and it cannot be \u201caccorded the conclusive effect of res judicata . . . .\u201d <em>Kosiel v Arrow Liquors Corp, </em>446 Mich 374, 381; 521 NW2d 531 (1994). See also <em>White v Michigan Consolidated Gas Co, </em>352 Mich 201, 210; 89 NW2d 439 (1958) (decision from the wcab \u201cordering payment of compensation until further order of the board . . . does not finally determine rights to compensation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">More fundamentally, as this Court made clear in <em>Romein, </em>an award may be retroactively increased, decreased, or modified legislatively with respect to coordination or otherwise at any time. An employer has \u201cno vested rights in the finality of the coordinated benefits paid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The factual matrix in this case is thus distinguishable from that in <em>Plaut. </em>United States District Court decisions, following the holding in <em>Lampf </em>that no cause of action may lie, could not have been disturbed after the right to an appeal had run, absent exceptional circumstances not relevant. Unlike wcab <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>awards, those decisions were, in every sense, final judgments.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Unlike Plant, where \u201c[t]o be sure, \u00a7 27A(b) <em>reopens </em>(or directs the <em>reopening </em>of) final judgments in a whole class of cases,\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> (emphasis added) the Legislature, by enacting 1987 PA 28, did not subject to reopening either the decision of this Court remanding Quinton\u2019s case in light of <em>Franks </em>or the WCAB\u2019s order on remand pursuant to <em>Franks.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>As this Court made clear in prior decisions and discussed above, because a worker\u2019s compensation award is always subject to modification for any of a number of reasons and is never final, a change in the amount of an award is distinguishable from a change in a determination of eligibility or work-relatedness of the injury or disability. <em>White v General Motors Corp, </em>431 Mich 387, 395-396, n 7; 429 NW2d 576 (1988); <em>Pike, </em>431 Mich 599-602. Similarly, a statute that provides a retroactive increase in the amount of benefits to be paid to an employee \u201cdiffers qualitatively\u201d from one that affects a claimant\u2019s eligibility or work-relatedness. <em>Romein, supra </em>at 532 (citing <em>White, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Further, 1987 PA 28 does not require the Court to \u201creopen\u201d anything. The wcac findings of fact are not affected, nor are any new findings required.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> No new evidentiary matters are considered. The initial hearing and determination remain intact and unaffected. The only consequence is that Quinton\u2019s recovery will be enlarged by an amount determined in a manner <em>independent </em>of all factors considered at the initial eligibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The effect of the Legislature\u2019s enactment of 1987 PA 28 is not to send the case back for a new order on the basis of the merits. Rather than modifying an existing order, the legislation may more properly be seen as providing a <em>new benefit. </em>As the branch of government responsible for promulgation of the state\u2019s laws, the Legislature may pursue by rational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>means any legitimate purpose. <em>Grocers Dairy Co v Dep\u2019t of Agriculture Director, </em>377 Mich 71, 76; 138 NW2d 767 (1966). This no doubt includes the power to provide an economic benefit to a class of persons that it considers deserving even if a court had ruled otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">vn</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">There is, indeed, an element of injustice to General Motors, Ford Motor Company,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> and any other employer who may have obtained orders from the wcab on remand from this Court or the Court of Appeals directing that benefits be coordinated, in denying them any benefit from their victory in <em>Franks. </em>But there would also be an element of injustice in requiring coordination for five years until the May 14, 1987, effective date of the 1987 legislation, for pre-March 31, 1982, injured workers who contested the employer\u2019s claim that benefits should be coordinated<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> and sought a hearing, while allowing injured workers, who sat on their rights and did not contest coordination, payment in full without coordination of their weekly benefits because no judgment of a court, or even an order of the WCAB, had been entered.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">If the wcab\u2019s 1986 decision on remand ordering coordination in Quinton\u2019s case were insulated from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>the will of the Legislature as expressed in subsections 354(17)-(20) by the doctrine of separation of powers, then the result would be that Quinton could receive only coordinated benefits until May, 1987, while the worker who sat on his rights would receive full uncoordinated benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">The United States Supreme Court recognized that similarly situated plaintiffs should be treated in like fashion in its review of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Romein. </em>In dismissing General Motors\u2019 due process argument, the Court commented that one of the legitimate objectives accomplished by the 1987 legislation was that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">equalized the payments made by employers who had gambled on <em>[Franks] </em>with those made by employers who had not. <em>Cf. United States v Sperry Corp, </em>493 US 52, 64-65 [110 S Ct 387; 107 L Ed 2d 290] (1989) (legitimate to legislate retrospectively in order to ensure that similarly situated persons bear similar financial burdens of program).[<footnotemark>57</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">A commentator observed that \u201c [t]he legitimacy of the judiciary depends, in large part, upon the treatment of like cases in a like manner.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AeI\">The function of the doctrine of separation of powers is to protect the independence of the judiciary by insulating from legislative encroachment final judicial judgments, and is not to attempt to achieve real or abstract justice between private litigants. But in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>deciding where to draw the line, this Court should consider whether there is need, in order to protect the independence of the judiciary, to draw the line differently or erect the wall higher than the United States Supreme Court did in <em>Plant. </em>I conclude, having in mind the infrequency with which legislation is enacted that even arguably crosses the separation of powers line, that there is no need to do so in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">vm</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">A properly enacted statute is binding law except to the extent that it violates the United States Constitution or the Constitution of Michigan. As an equal branch of government, the judiciary is obliged to enforce the enactments of the Legislature to the extent permitted by the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">General Motors does not dispute that Quinton, having suffered his disabling injury before 1982, was among the class of applicants that the Legislature, through 1987 PA 28, intended would enjoy uncoordinated benefits. It is well settled that the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act is to be construed to accomplish its remedial purposes.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>because 1987 PA 28 does not violate either the United States or Michigan Constitution, Quinton is entitled to receive benefits improperly coordinated.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">The January, 1994, decision of the wcac should be reversed, and the case remanded to the wcac for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-8\"> MCL 418.354; MSA 17.237(354).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b218-9\"> MCL 418.101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.237(101) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b218-10\"> General Motors also told him that he had been \u201coverpaid\u201d $892.36 in worker\u2019s compensation since March 31, 1982, and that he should make arrangements to reimburse this amount.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b219-5\"> The panel issued three separate opinions, reflecting a split with regard to whether General Motors should be assessed a penalty under MCL 418.801; MSA 17.237(801).

The second type of unconstitutional restriction upon the exercise of judicial power identified by past cases is exemplified by <em>Hayburn\u2019s Case </em>[n 19 <em>supra\\, </em>which stands for the principle that Congress cannot vest review of the decisions of Article HI courts in officials of the Executive Branch.

There is no serious argument that the decision of this Court in <em>Chambers v General Motors </em>Corp, a companion case to <em>Franks v White Pine Copper </em>Div,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> incorrectly interpreted the intent of the Legislature. In indicating that I would grant the motion for reconsideration, which was supported by, among others, former Governor William Milliken, I observed that, given the \u201charsh and unforeseen consequences\u201d of the decision, inclinations to support the finality of litigation should yield to the question whether we had correctly determined the intent of the Legislature, 424 Mich 1202 (1985). Because we would compound the error committed by the denial of reconsideration and further penalize employees who pursued their rights, it would be unconscionable not to recognize a public-policy exception to res judicata in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The crucial issue in this case is whether the doctrine of res judicata as construed in Michigan applies to bar plaintiff from again litigating whether his worker\u2019s compensation award should be subjected to coordination with other sources. The doctrine of res judicata</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">applies not only to issues of fact and law which were actually litigated and decided, but also to any issue which might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>have been litigated at that time. . . . Therefore, if during the adjudication of a dispute a pertinent issue of law or fact is raised and decided, or properly should have been raised, res judicata will bar the relitigation of that issue in a subsequent action. <em>[Pike v City of Wyoming, </em>431 Mich 589, 612-613; 433 NW2d 768 (1988) (Boyle, J., dissenting).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">In other words, under the doctrine of res judicata, claims that were or could have been reduced to final judgment are barred from being brought a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">All members of the Court have recognized that res judicata is a judicially created doctrine. <em>Riley v Northland Geriatric Center (After Remand), </em>431 Mich 632; 433 NW2d 787 (1988). In <em>Pike, </em>a majority of this Court held that the doctrine of res judicata, while applicable in worker\u2019s compensation proceedings, is not always a bar to modifications of worker\u2019s compensation awards where there has been a subsequent change in the law. 431 Mich 598-599 (opinion of Griffin, J.); 431 Mich 608 (Brickley, J., concurring).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In my dissent in <em>Pike, </em>I advocated a stricter application of res judicata to worker\u2019s compensation proceedings and contended the doctrine applied both to rulings regarding eligibility and to rulings regarding the amount of benefits. 431 Mich 620. I also acknowledged, however, that, in some cases, \u201c[t]here may be matters of public policy so extraordinary as to justify a departure from res judicata principles.\u201d 431 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>630.

Comment e to \u00a7 26, p 239, states that res judicata should not be applied where it would be inequitable to do so,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\">especially when there is a change of law after the initial decision. When such inequities involve important ongoing social or political relationships, a second action should be allowed even if the claim set forth is not viewed as different from that presented in the initial proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">A rigid interpretation of res judicata would perpetuate the harsh consequences this Court declined to revisit in <em>Chambers </em>and hinder implementation of the Legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Given the importance of the principle that litigation should come to an end, exceptions should be employed sparingly. However, as Professor Moore has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">A good case can be made for the proposition that frank recognition of some limited power to temper rules along equitable lines results in their more faithful application. Justice is like a balloon full of water; squeeze it at one point and it bulges at another.

As stated by Justice Boyle in <em>Pike v City of Wyoming, </em>431 Mich 589, 620; 433 NW2d 768 (1988), the principle of finality should apply to <em>court </em>rulings both with respect to eligibility for benefits and to the amount of those benefits. Accordingly, I would hold that the 1986 order was final with respect to accrued benefits subject to the order. Conversely, <em>prospective </em>benefits, accruing <em>after </em>the 1986 order, would not be final because \u201c[t]here are no vested rights in the amount of liability established at the time of an injury.\u201d <em>Romein v General Motors Corp, </em>436 Mich 515, 531; 462 NW2d 555 (1990). Therefore, under our analysis in <em>Romein, </em>I believe that this employer had a vested right to coordinate benefits for the period subject to this Court\u2019s remand order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Consequently, I believe that legal principles should lead to the conclusion that the employer should be allowed to coordinate benefits for that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Nevertheless, the <em>equitable </em>considerations presented by this employee and other similarly situated employees would justify this Court in setting aside the 1986 orders and precluding coordination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pursuant to <em>Romein, </em>employees who were injured before March 31, 1982, but who quietly accepted coordination of their benefits after 1981 PA 203, are not sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>ject to any coordination. In contrast, under my analysis, employees injured before March 31, 1982, like Quinton, who did not quietly accept coordination, but instead pursued their rights to appeal, which unfortunately resulted in disadvantageous results to them in this Court, <em>would </em>be subject to coordination for the period covered by this Court\u2019s 1986 remand orders to the WCAB. However, it would be manifestly unfair to penalize employees who vigorously pursued their rights, while rewarding those similarly situated employees who did not pursue their rights. Further, the Legislature expressly indicated in 1987 PA 28 that it did not intend employees injured before March 31, 1982, to be subject to any coordination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Given the unfairness of treating employees injured before March 31, 1982, differently, in addition to the express legislative intent not to subject these employees to coordination of benefits, I believe that we should preclude coordination of benefits for all such employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">In sum, I concur with the disposition of this case, remanding to the wcac for further proceedings. However, I would not reach the separation of powers issue addressed by the lead opinion. Instead, I would invoke our equitable power and grant equitable relief to Quinton.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b250-9\"> 424 Mich 884 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b251-5\"> The subject period was from March 31, 1982, the effective date of 1981 PA 203, through May 28, 1986, the date of the WCAB order on remand from this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b251-6\"> MCR 7.316(A)(7) provides that this Court may enter any relief that the case requires.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b252-8\"> See Levin, J., <em>ante </em>at 70, n 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b252-7\">Riley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9c\">(dissenting). We granted leave to consider whether the order entered by the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board was a final \u201cjudgment\u201d and therefore an exception to <em>Romein v General Motors Corp, </em>436 Mich 515; 462 NW2d 555 (1990), aff\u2019d 503 US 181; 112 S Ct 1105; 117 L Ed 2d 328 (1992), in which this Court upheld 1987 PA 28 prohibiting coordination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>benefits for injuries arising before March 31, 1982. Instead, the lead opinion evades the fundamental issue in this case in order to revisit the due process and separation of powers issues already decided by this Court in <em>Romein. </em>The lead opinion declares that the minimal constitutional protection afforded by the final judgment exception established by the Court in <em>Romein </em>is dicta. The lead opinion then engages in a separation of powers discussion and ultimately concludes that the doctrine is not violated because 1987 PA 28 did not, consistent with <em>Plaut v Spendthrift Farm, Inc, </em>514 US 211; 115 S Ct 1447; 131 L Ed 2d 328 (1995), \u201creopen\u201d or \u201cset aside\u201d a judgment entered by a court. Because I believe the lead opinion has misstated the issue and reached an erroneous conclusion, I dissent and would affirm the decision of the WCAB.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">In <em>Chambers v General Motors Corp, </em>decided with <em>Franks v White Pine Copper Div, </em>422 Mich 636; 375 NW2d 715 (1985), this Court decided whether 1981 PA 203, providing for coordination of benefits under MCL 418.354; MSA 17.237(354), applied to persons injured before the March 31, 1982, effective date.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court held that the unambiguous language of \u00a7 354 required coordination of worker\u2019s compensation and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>specified benefits for all compensable periods, after the effective date of the statute, regardless of the date of the worker\u2019s injury. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">The statute does not limit its application to cases where workers\u2019 compensation payments are made to an employee <em>for injuries incurred after its effective date, </em>[i.e.,] <em>for injuries incurred after March 31, 1982. </em>Nor does it contain any language indicating that it should <em>not </em>be applied when payments are being made <em>for injuries that occurred prior to March 31, 1982. </em>The Legislature\u2019s failure to do so leaves the section generally applicable to payments made after its effective date. <em>[Id. </em>at 651 (emphasis in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">In response to <em>Franks, </em>the Legislature enacted 1987 PA 28, \u00a7\u00a7 (17) through (20), overruling this Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 354.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The new legislation prohibited coordination of benefits of <em>any </em>person injured before March 31, 1982, the effective date of the coordination provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Subsequently, in <em>Romein, </em>this Court decided the constitutionality of 1987 PA 28. Defendant General Motors contended that it relied on the \u00a7 354 coordination provision between March 31, 1982, and May 14, 1987, the date the Legislature amended \u00a7 354. General Motors claimed a vested right to have its liability for those periods determined by the law then in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>The Court concluded that the separation of powers<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and one court of justice<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provisions were not violated under the Michigan Constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <em>Romein </em>Court, however, conditioned the constitutionality of 1987 PA 28 as follows: \u201cSuch retroactive amendments based on prior judicial decisions are constitutional if the statute comports with the requirements of the Contract and Due Process Clauses of the federal and state constitutions, and <em>so long as the retroactive provisions of the statute do not impair final judgm</em>ents.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 537 (emphasis added). The lead opinion improperly dismisses this controlling language as dicta.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Although <em>Romein </em>clearly held that workers have no vested rights in the finality of coordinated benefits paid, implicit in the Court\u2019s holding is that rights <em>do </em>vest for purposes of due process when <em>judgments </em>are entered by the wcab at the direction of an appellate court pursuant to former law. Otherwise, <em>Romein </em>would be internally inconsistent because nothing would constitute a final judgment, regardless of the extent to which the parties have litigated the controlling law.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Consequently, there must be a distinction for purposes of finality between the situation in which the WCAB enters its own decision and the situation in the present case in which this Court, relying on its then-recent pronouncement of the law in <em>Franks, </em>remanded to the wcab for entry of judgment. In order to read <em>Romein </em>and <em>Pike v City of Wyoming, </em>431 Mich 589; 433 NW2d 768 (1988), consistently, I would distinguish <em>Pike. </em>In <em>Pike, </em>the lead opinion held that \u201c[b]ecause the amount of an employee\u2019s award is never final, res judicata principles do not apply to a change in the amount of benefits the claimant receives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 602. However, the rule announced in that decision, striking the gender-based conclusive presumption of a wife\u2019s dependency, was applied without upsetting a previous judgment entered by the wcab <em>at the direction of this Court. </em>This Court had not <em>previously </em>upheld the conclusive dependency provision with respect to the worker in <em>Pike. </em>That worker merely had a decision by a hearing referee because \u201cthere [had been] no appeal,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 592, when this Court later changed the amount of his benefits to reflect the change in the law announced with that very decision. The lead opinion relies on this dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>tinction to conclude that the <em>Romein </em>exception is merely dicta. I disagree. The lead opinion later more explicitly and honestly states the effect of its decision today, i.e., to overrule rather than disregard the minimal protection the judgment exception established. See ante, part vi(a) at 90-92.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">As the Court stated in Romein, such a judgment exception \u201cprotects the vested rights that form in reliance on an award at the moment it is reduced to a final judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 533. The employer has a greater expectation of finality after litigation and decision by the appellate courts of this jurisdiction. A decision of the wcab is less immune to a change in the law than the appellate courts of this state. Accordingly, this language is not dicta, but forms the very basis on which the constitutionality of 1987 PA 28 was conditioned.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The lead opinion essentially concedes this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>This Court declared this exception for final judgments because, at the time, we were concerned that a broader order permitting all qualifying claimants to recover improperly coordinated benefits, <em>regardless of the extent to which they had litigated their claims, might run afoul of either the Michigan or federal constitution. [Ante </em>at 74 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Therefore, when this Court previously remanded <em>Quinton </em>\u201cfor entry of a <em>judgment </em>consistent with Franks,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> General Motors obtained a final judgment within the purview of <em>Romein </em>and the award was then \u201cimmune from [subsequent] legislative modification.\u201d <em>Romein, supra </em>at 533.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Properly analyzed pursuant to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Romein, </em>the decision of the wcab allowing coordination of Quinton\u2019s benefits through the effective date of 1987 PA 28 should be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">H</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Although <em>Romein </em>is dispositive, the lead opinion engages in an irrelevant discussion of separation of powers. Asserting that it is not controlling, the lead opinion relies on <em>Plaut, supra. Ante </em>at 77-78. The lead opinion maintains that consistent with <em>Plaut, </em>the legislation now at issue did not \u201creopen\u201d or \u201cset aside\u201d the 1986 wcab orders. The lead opinion\u2019s characterization is a result-oriented application of those terms from <em>Plaut. </em>Once this Court accepts the premise that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>an order or judgment entered by the WCAB pursuant to a remand order by this Court is an order implicating the doctrine of separation of powers, as the lead opinion properly does, it is immediately apparent that the 1987 legislation is an intrusion on the judiciary. The threat to the independence of the judiciary is increased with the lead opinion\u2019s holding today.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Not only has the Court violated the fundamental principle that \u201cthe proper construction of a statute is a judicial function,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but it now continues the assault by allowing a judgment entered by the WCAB at the direction of this Court to be set aside. In total disregard for even the minimal protection established by <em>Romein, </em>the lead opinion characterizes the legislation as \u201cmodifying the operative effect of a prior judgment or order\u201d that evidently \u201ccan be accomplished without reopening or setting aside a judgment entered by a court.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 84. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">To say that the 1987 legislation \u201csimply requires payment to all in Quinton\u2019s class an uncoordinated benefit from and after March 31, 1982,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 85, is the unquestionable equivalent of setting aside a previous determination by this Court. This Court allowed coordination of benefits for all injuries occurring before March 31, 1982, and the Legislature <em>explicitly </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>set aside that holding and ruled that there could be no coordination for persons injured before that date: \u201cThe decision of the Michigan Supreme Court in <em>Franks v White Pine Copper Div, </em>422 Mich 636 (1985) is declared to have been <em>erroneously rendered </em>insofar as it interprets this section . . . MCL 418.354(17); MSA 17.237(354)(17) (emphasis added). No clearer example of setting aside a judgment or order of a court is imaginable.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">HI</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The parties disagree whether the wcab has the authority to enter a \u201cjudgment\u201d and, if so, whether a judgment was entered. In doing so, the parties elevate form over substance. Irrespective of the language the Court used to establish the <em>Romein </em>exception and the language previously used in its remand order in the present case, it is clear that both refer to the same action of the wcab (entering an order at the direction of an appellate court) that finally determined the rights of the parties with respect to coordinating benefits upon entry of a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Moreover, plaintiffs\u2019 argument that \u201cjudgment\u201d in the context of <em>Romein </em>means judicial enforcement by a circuit court pursuant to MCL 418.863; MSA 17.237(863) rather than entry of an order at the direction of an appellate court is absurd.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>\u00a7 863 is to protect the interests of persons awarded worker\u2019s compensation by providing them with prompt enforcement by a circuit court in situations in which the employer fails to pay an award. See <em>Wyrybkowski v Cobra Pre-Hung Doors, Inc, </em>66 Mich App 555; 239 NW2d 660 (1976). A circuit court judgment is merely entered \u201c \u2018in accordance\u2019 with the award, which means that it should <em>recite </em>and <em>follow </em>the award, which furnishes the data for further action of the court.\u201d <em>Brown v George A Fuller Co, </em>193 Mich 214, 219; 159 NW 376 (1916) (emphasis added). Therefore, the primary purpose of entering a judgment in circuit court is to ensure satisfaction of the worker\u2019s compensation award. It cannot fairly be said that a judgment by a circuit court produces a more final decision for purposes of res judicata after judgment is entered by the WCAB at the direction of an appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">This Court remanded Quinton\u2019s earlier petition for entry of a \u201cjudgment\u201d consistent with <em>Franks. </em>The wcab responded by entering a judgment that is properly understood as fulfilling the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order and falls squarely within the judgment exception established by <em>Romein. </em>Therefore, the decision of the wcab should be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b261-6\">Brickley, C.J., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b261-7\">Weaver, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-6\"> <em>Chambers </em>described the application of \u00a7 354 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">This section provides that an employer may coordinate employee benefits, by applying against its workers\u2019 compensation obligations payable for compensable periods after its effective date, that portion of certain other benefits, such as pensions and social security payments, also received by the employee and financed by the employer. <em>[Id. </em>at 647.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b254-9\"> The relevant portion of the amendment states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-10\">The decision of the Michigan Supreme Court in <em>Franks v White Pine Copper Div, </em>422 Mich 636 (1985), is declared to have been erroneously rendered insofar as it interprets this section, it having been and being the legislative intention not to coordinate payments under this section resulting from liability pursuant to section 351, 361, or 835 for personal injuries occurring before March 31, 1982.
