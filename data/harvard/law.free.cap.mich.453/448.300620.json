The Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court\u2019s holding, aptly setting forth the history of the case as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">[DJefendant, Department of Corrections (doc), appeals as of right from the circuit court\u2019s order granting summary disposition for plaintiffs Freddy Dean, George Scandalis, and Paul McCormick. William Newton, Herman Ridgell, Jr., and Miguel Hermosillo (the intervening plaintiffs) permissively intervened after the circuit court\u2019s decision in the original matter, seeking identical relief. The circuit court granted the intervening plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary disposition. In Docket No. 166024, intervening defendant Wayne County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Prosecutor (the prosecutor) appeals as of right from the circuit court\u2019s order granting summary disposition for the intervening plaintiffs and challenges the court\u2019s grant of permissive intervention to them.

Plaintiffs subsequently filed this declaratory judgment action against the doc seeking a judgment that MCL 333.7401(3); MSA 14.15(7401)(3) did not prohibit them from receiving disciplinary credits against those sentences. Both parties moved for summary disposition. The trial court denied the doc\u2019s motion, granted summary disposition for plaintiff\u2019s [sic], and entered a declaratory ruling that stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 eligibility for disciplinary credits is not affected by the provision in MCL 333.7401(3) which precludes \u2018reduction in that mandatory term of imprisonment by disciplinary credits\u2019 for those individuals sentenced under MCL 333.7401(2)(a)(i) through (iv) and MCL 333.7403(2)(a)(i) through (iv), who are sentenced to a minimum term below the mandatory minimums contained in those statutory provisions, such departures being pursuant to MCL 333.7401(4).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">After that order, three additional groups of similarly situated inmates moved for permissive intervention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">The original parties stipulated the first group\u2019s intervention and the trial court granted the second group intervention. Both groups moved for summary disposition on the same grounds as the original plaintiffs, and the trial court granted the motions. The third group, Newton, Ridgell, and Hermosillo, also moved to intervene and the motion was granted. The prosecutor then moved to intervene and the trial court granted that motion. Newton, Ridgell, and Hermosillo subsequently moved for summary disposition on the same grounds as the original plaintiffs, which the trial court also granted. Defendant doc moved for a stay of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>trial court\u2019s declaratory order, which this Court granted in an order entered on July 7, 1993.

Our inquiry centers on the interpretation of MCL 333.7401(3); MSA 14.15(7401)(3) and its interrelationship with subsections 7403(2)(a)(ii)-(iv) and (3) and 7401(2)(a)(ii)-(iv) and (4).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The only question before us is whether the Legislature intended that persons sentenced under the departure provisions should be eligible for disciplinary credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Where the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, the intent of the Legislature must be effectuated according to its plain meaning. <em>Victorson v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>439 Mich 131, 137-138; 482 NW2d 685 (1992). Where, as here, the language is not plain, but is subject to varying interpretations, we look to the purpose of the act to ascertain legislative intent. <em>Longstreth v Gensel, </em>423 Mich 675, 680; 377 NW2d 804 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The penalty provisions for controlled substances provided in the Public Health Code can be traced to 1978 PA 368. Those provisions imposed significantly enhanced penalties for violations involving controlled substances, repealing the previous indeterminate scheme under the Controlled Substances Act of 1971 and replacing it with a scheme tying mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment to the type and weight of the substance involved.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There is no dispute that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>the purpose of these severe penalties was to deter illicit drug dealing. <em>People v Morris, </em>450 Mich 316, 327; 537 NW2d 842 (1995). The act required judges to impose mandatory minimum sentences for violations involving 50 grams to 650 grams or more of cocaine<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and prevented individuals subject to a mandatory term of imprisonment under subsections 7401(2)(a)(i)-(iii) or 7403(2)(a)(i)-(iii) from receiving probation, a suspended sentence, or parole \u201cduring that mandatory teim, except and only to the extent that those provisions permit probation for life.\u201d However, as originally enacted, the provision did not preclude defendants from receiving disciplinary credits or other sentence-credit reductions of the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>In 1987, the Legislature enacted PA 275, which amended the act to mitigate certain features of the penalty scheme and enhance others. Mandatory minimums were reduced from 20 to 10 years for persons who violated the statute with respect to amounts between 225 grams or more, but less than 650 grams, and from 10 to 5 years for violations involving between 50 grams or more, but less than 225 grams. At the same time, subsection 7401(4) was added, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>which authorized departure from the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment where substantial and compelling reasons existed for doing so. However, with regard to violations involving less than fifty grams, which previously had not required a minimum term, the Legislature imposed a new one-year minimum term of imprisonment and provided an alternative of lifetime probation. Additionally, the Legislature eliminated lifetime probation as a sentence alternative to a violation involving 50 grams or more but less than 225 grams. Finally, the Legislature appended to the provision precluding probation, parole, or sentence suspension during the mandatory term the explicit directive precluding a reduction in the mandatory term of imprisonment by good-time credits, disciplinary credits, \u201cor any other type of sentence credit reduction.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>The structure of the amendments and the legislative analysis support the conclusion that the purpose of the amendment was to strengthen the penalties proscribed for specified controlled substance offenses, while granting judges greater discretion in sentencing where that discretion was warranted.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The intent of the Legislature was to \u201cput some teeth into the controlled substances Act by ensuring that anyone convicted of illegal drug deals, regardless of the quantity involved, would face mandatory imprisonment.\u201d Senate Fiscal Agency Analysis, SB 277, Second Analysis, July 14, 1987. As noted by the Senate Fiscal Agency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>[MJany believe that the law should be amended to mandate imprisonment for even small quantities of illegal drags, as well as to remove the option of lifetime probation for large quantities. In addition, some criticize the law for excessive rigidity in its prescription of mandatory prison terms. [Senate Fiscal Agency Analysis, SB 277 (as enrolled), Third Analysis, January 19, 1988.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">In 1989, the statute was again amended.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Legislature restored the mandatory minimum sentences to the original (pre-1987 amendment) levels for all amounts between 50 and 650 grams. The one-year mandatory minimum for an amount less than fifty grams, with lifetime probation as an option, and the elimination of lifetime probation for 50 to 225 grams were carried forward from the 1987 act. While the mandatory minimum sentences were restored to twenty and ten years, respectively, the Legislature continued the departure authorization as well as the language precluding a \u201creduction in that mandatory term . . . .\u201d Thus, the Legislature augmented the punishment for major drug offenders, while continuing the policy of permitting downward departures. An argument advanced in support of returning to the original mandatory minimum sentences was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">The acts (Public Act 275 of 1987 and Public Act 47 of 1988) reducing specified minimum prison terms for illegal manufacture, delivery, or possession of larger quantities of narcotics and cocaine dangerously weakened the law governing controlled substances offenses. The bill would deter drag trafficking by increasing those mandatory minimum prison terms back up to their original levels. [House Legislative Analysis, HB 4698 (as enrolled), Second Analysis, July 28, 1989.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Plaintiff essentially contends that an individual receiving a departure from the minimum term of imprisonment is not subject to <em>the </em>mandatory term of imprisonment and so is eligible to receive disciplinary credits for the minimum term. The circuit court judge agreed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-4\">And, my construction is here the Legislature had reasons for adding subsection 4 of 333.7401 so that you can depart from <em>the </em>minimum term of imprisonment. And, that once having done that, a person is ... no longer subject to <em>the </em>mandatory penalty, and thus, the restriction imposed in terms of parole or in this case disciplinary credits does not apply. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">We disagree. The legislation does not use the term <em>the, </em>but instead provides that an \u201cindividual subject to <em>a </em>mandatory term of imprisonment . . . shall not . . . receive a reduction in <em>that </em>mandatory term of imprisonment by disciplinary credits or any other type of sentence credit reduction.\u201d MCL 333.7401(3); MSA 14.15(7401)(3). (Emphasis added.) Clearly plaintiff was subject to <em>a </em>mandatory term of imprisonment when he was sentenced to 12 to 30 years imprisonment for the drug offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">We conclude that to effectuate the legislative intent, the phrase <em>\u201ca </em>mandatory term of imprisonment\u201d must be read to mean <em>any </em>minimum term of imprisonment imposed by a judge under this statute. Although penal in nature, these provisions are found in the Public Health Code, which is to be liberally construed for the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the people of this state. MCL 333.1111(2); MSA 14.15(1111)(2). This directive militates against the claim that the phrase \u201can individual subject to\u201d a mandatory term applies only to a person actually sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>jected to a mandatory term. We therefore decline to accept plaintiffs interpretation of the statute and instead hold that a sentence imposed on an individual \u201csubject to a mandatory term of imprisonment\u201d includes those sentences imposed pursuant to the downward departure provisions of subsections 7401(4) and 7403(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">While the creation of the authority to depart from mandatory minimums was intended to ameliorate the harsh consequences of automatic imposition of statutory minimums, it cannot be argued seriously that the Legislature intended to afford either trial judges or corrections officials unfettered discretion. As we observed in <em>People v Fields, </em>448 Mich 58; 528 NW2d 176 (1995), the term \u201csubstantial and compelling\u201d authorizes deviation from the minimum term only on a demonstration of sufficient objective and verifiable factors on the record. To construe the statute as plaintiff suggests would lead to the conclusion that the trial court has the authority to suspend sentences, a construction in clear contravention of the legislative purpose and the explicit directive that an \u201cindividual subject to a mandatory term of imprisonment . . . shall not be eligible for probation, suspension of that sentence, or parole during that mandatory term . . . .\u201d Thus, the fact that the Legislature permitted the exercise of trial court sentencing discretion when supported by substantial and compelling reasons suggests neither that the Legislature intended <em>automatic </em>disciplinary credits for violators of the act nor that it authorized probation or a suspended sentence. The statutory scheme contemplates that mini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>mum sentences will be imposed in all but the most unusual cases. We are confident the Legislature did not intend to allow the Department of Corrections to undermine what was intended to be the deterrent effect of the statute by granting sentence reductions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">That the Legislature intended to enforce stronger penalties for major drug offenses while allowing judges greater flexibility in sentencing certain offenders cannot be disputed. Interpreting this statute with that goal in mind, we hold that defendants who are sentenced pursuant to the downward departure provisions of subsections 7401(4) and 7403(3) are individuals \u201csubject to a mandatory term of imprisonment\u201d as that term is used in subsection 7401(3) and thus are not eligible to receive a reduction in that mandatory term of imprisonment by disciplinary credits or any other type of sentence-credit reduction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b613-7\">Brickley, C.J., and Riley and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-7\"> There is some discrepancy in the materials before this Court regarding whether Mr. Dean was convicted of possession of a controlled substance pursuant to MCL 333.7403(2)(a)(ii); MSA 14.15(7403)(2)(a)(\u00fc) or delivery of a controlled substance pursuant to MCL 333.7401(2)(a)(ii); MSA 14.15(7401)(2)(a)(ii).

[MCL 333.7401(3); MSA 14.15(7401)(3) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">The majority focuses on <em>\u201csubject </em>to a mandatory term of imprisonment,\u201d but does not discuss <em>\u201cduring </em>that mandatory term,\u201d or <em>\u201creduction in </em>that mandatory term.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">Although <em>\u201csubject </em>to a mandatory term\u201d refers to a mandatory term that might possibly be imposed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>whether actually imposed, <em>\u201cduring </em>that mandatory term\u201d refers to a mandatory term actually imposed. (Emphasis added.) Otherwise, a person sentenced, as here, to serve a term of years less than a mandatory term of years provided by statute would not, in the majority\u2019s construction of the statute, be eligible for \u201cparole during that mandatory term.\u201d That would be a result manifestly inconsistent with the statutory authorization of a downward departure from a mandatory minimum term. The statute clearly contemplates that a person who has served a reduced term \u2014 here twelve years \u2014 is eligible for parole although the mandatory minimum term is longer\u2014 here twenty years \u2014 and parole would be a \u201cparole <em>during </em>that mandatory term.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Similarly, because the sentence actually imposed was not the mandatory minimum term, such a person, sentenced to serve a reduced term as the result of a downward departure, is eligible to receive a reduction in the term of imprisonment as a result of disciplinary or other sentence credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Stated in the language of the statute, a person sentenced to serve twelve to twenty years, who receives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>disciplinary or other sentence credits, has not received \u201ca <em>reduction in </em>that mandatory term of imprisonment by disciplinary credits or any other type of sentence credit reduction.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The mandatory term is \u201creduced,\u201d not by disciplinary or other sentence credits, but as a result of the downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">The mandatory term is no longer applicable to a person who, although \u201csubject\u201d to the mandatory minimum, is sentenced to a term less than the mandatory minimum. Because a person serving a downward departure sentence is not serving a mandatory term, allowing disciplinary or other sentence credits does not constitute \u201ca <em>reduction in </em>that mandatory term of imprisonment by disciplinary credits or any other type of sentence credit reduction.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">It is therefore beside the point that Dean was \u201csubject to a mandatory term of imprisonment,\u201d as the majority states and restates throughout its opinion, ignoring \u201cduring\u201d and \u201creduction in that mandatory term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Policy arguments that the Legislature intended harsh punishment, and \u201ccould not\u201d have intended to further reward persons who obtain a downward departure from the mandatory minimum sentence, ignore that the Legislature authorized a judge to depart downward on finding substantial and compelling reasons therefor,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that there is at least as much reason for the Legislature to have so further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>rewarded persons, like Dean, who receive a lesser, downward departure sentence, simply because a judge has identified Dean as a person who should have the opportunity to return to society earlier than had a mandatory minimum sentence been imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The Legislature could have decided, although, to be sure, we do not know whether it so decided, that persons so identified by a judge are as deserving of disciplinary or other sentence-credit reduction as offenders generally, including armed robbers, rapists, and second-degree murderers. Absent evidence of what the Legislature\u2019s intent in this regard might have been, this Court cannot properly indulge assumptions regarding the Legislature\u2019s intent that are opposed by other plausible assumptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">We know that the legislative purpose in barring \u201cparole during that mandatory term\u201d and \u201creduction in that mandatory term\u201d by disciplinary or sentence credits was to assure that the mandatory minimum term the offender faced, and thus was \u201csubject\u201d to receiving, would be fully served without reduction by parole or disciplinary or sentence credits. That is the apparent and undoubted, literally stated purpose. There is no justification for embellishing beyond that apparent and undoubted purpose by reading into the literal language,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which speaks only of a reduction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>sentence \u201cduring that mandatory term,\u201d a broader purpose barring reduction by disciplinary or sentence credits of a sentence other than a mandatory minimum sentence. The statute speaks only of a \u201creduction in\u201d a mandatory minimum sentence, and does not bar a reduction, by disciplinary or sentence credit, of a downward departure, nonmandatory sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">In conclusion, the statute proscribes only a reduction in a <em>mandatory </em>term of imprisonment by disciplinary or other sentence credits.
