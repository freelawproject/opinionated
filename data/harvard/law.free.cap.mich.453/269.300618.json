We would hold that the Michigan Constitution, as the United States Constitution, does not prohibit successive state and federal prosecutions. In so holding, we would overrule <em>People v Cooper, </em>398 Mich 450; 247 NW2d 866 (1976). We would remand to allow the trial court to consider whether these successive prosecutions were prohibited by MCL 333.7409; MSA 14.15(7409).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">\n<em>HERMIZ</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">In October, 1989, Issam Hermiz was indicted in federal court in the middle district of Florida for conspiring to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, 21 USC 841(a)(1). Hermiz was convicted as charged and sentenced to a prison term of 211 months. In July, 1990, Hermiz was indicted in Oakland County, Michigan, for conspiracy to possess with intent to deliver in excess of 650 grams of cocaine, MCL 333.7401(2)(a)(i); MSA 14.15(7401)(2)(a)(i). After a jury trial, Hermiz was convicted as charged and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. Hermiz appealed, arguing that the Oakland County indictment violated the double jeopardy prohibition. The Court of Appeals affirmed Hermiz\u2019 conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This Court granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm in part and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\n<em>MEZY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">In August, 1988, Basil Mezy was indicted in federal court of the eastern district of Michigan for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than four kilograms of cocaine, 21 USC 841(a)(1) and 846.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mezy pleaded guilty of laundering money instruments,</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>18 USC 1956(a)(2)(B)(ii)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in exchange for a dismissal of the conspiracy charge. He was sentenced to thirty-three months in federal prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">In June, 1989, Mezy was indicted in federal court for the middle district of Florida for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, 21 USC 841(a)(1) and 846, and interstate travel to facilitate a cocaine conspiracy, 18 USC 1952(a)(3). Mezy was convicted of one count of the former and two counts of the latter. Mezy was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of twenty-two and five years. These terms are to run consecutively to the money-laundering sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">In July, 1990, Mezy was charged in Oakland Circuit Court with conspiracy to possess with intent to deliver more than 650 grams of cocaine, MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>333.7401(2)(a)(i); MSA 14.15(7401)(2)(a)(i).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mezy was subsequently convicted as charged and received the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole. Mezy appealed, arguing that the Oakland County indictment violated the double jeopardy prohibition. The Court of Appeals, relying on the conviction in the federal court for the eastern district of Michigan, reversed Mezy\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This Court granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We would reverse and remand with instructions:</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">In Mezy\u2019s case the first issue is whether, for purposes of a double jeopardy analysis, we should consider the charge on which Mezy was indicted in the Eastern District of Michigan, conspiracy to possess with intent to deliver more than four kilograms of cocaine, or the charge to which he pleaded guilty, laundering money instruments. We follow the federal rule and hold that a prosecution on charges dismissed pursuant to a plea agreement does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause where the newly charged offense is a different offense for double jeopardy purposes than the crime to which the defendant has pleaded guilty. See <em>United States v Gamer, </em>32 F3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>1305, 1311, n 6 (CA 8, 1994); <em>United States v </em>Rivera-Feliciano, 930 F2d 951, 953-954 (CA 1, 1991);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> see also <em>Ricketts v Adamson, </em>483 US 1, 8; 107 S Ct 2680; 97 L Ed 2d 1 (1987) (the Court noted that a plea of guilty for a lesser included offense generally would have precluded a charge of the greater offense on double jeopardy grounds except for the fact that the defendant violated his plea agreement). Jeopardy does not attach to charges dismissed as part of a plea agreement. <em>Gamer, supra </em>at 1311, n 6. <em>United States v Vaughan, </em>715 F2d 1373, 1376-1377 (CA 9, 1983). Thus, we may consider only the charge to which Mezy pleaded guilty, laundering money instruments, not the charge on which he was indicted. This prior conviction of laundering money instruments raises no double jeopardy issues under either the statute or the constitution with respect to Mezy\u2019s state court indictment for conspiracy to possess with intent to deliver more than 650 grams of cocaine. See <em>United States v Felix, </em>503 US 378, 388-389; 112 S Ct 1377; 118 L Ed 2d 25 (1992) (a substantive crime and a conspiracy to commit that crime are not the same offense for double jeopardy purposes).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>m</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Both defendants assert that their Oakland Circuit Court indictments were barred under the Michigan Constitution\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause, relying on <em>People v Cooper, supra. </em>The information regarding the federal convictions is very sparse. In considering whether there are one or two conspiracies for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, the following factors are considered: time, persons acting as coconspirators, statutory offenses charged in indictm\u00e9nts, overt acts charged by government, and places where events alleged as part of conspiracy took place. <em>United States v Thomas, </em>759 F2d 659 (CA 8, 1985). The defendants clearly met the initial burden of establishing a prima facie nonfrivolous claim of double jeopardy. This was done primarily by showing the similarity of the charges, and the substantial overlap in time of the two conspiracies charged. Thus, the burden shifted to the government to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence why double jeopardy principles do not bar prosecution. <em>United States v Schinnell, </em>80 F3d 1064, 1066 (CA 5, 1996).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The peo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>pie failed to meet this obligation, because not enough information was provided to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the offenses were distinct. The people have not demonstrated that the trial court committed any clear error in its findings of fact, or that it erred in its application of the constitutional test under <em>Thomas </em>in concluding that the people failed to carry their burden. Thus, for purposes of the constitutional double jeopardy claim, we must assume that the federal and state conspiracies are the same. This leads us to address, as requested by the plaintiffs, the continuing validity of <em>Cooper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The United States Constitution provides: \u201c[N]or shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb . ...\u201d US Const, Am V. The United States Supreme Court has consistently held that successive state and federal prosecutions are not a violation of the Fifth Amendment. <em>Bartkus v Illinois, </em>359 US 121, 132; 79 S Ct 676; 3 L Ed 2d 684 (1959). The reasoning behind this holding was clearly set out in <em>Heath v Alabama, </em>474 US 82, 88; 106 S Ct 433; 88 L Ed 2d 387 (1985).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">The dual sovereignty doctrine is founded on the common-law conception of crime as an offense against the sovereignty of the government. When a defendant in a single act violates the \u201cpeace and dignity\u201d of two sovereigns by breaking the laws of each, he has committed two distinct \u201coffences.\u201d As the Court explained in <em>Moore v Illinois </em>[55 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>US] (14 How) 13, 19; 14 L Ed 306 (1852), \u201c[a]n offence, in its legal signification, means the transgression of a law.\u201d Consequently, when the same act transgresses the laws of two sovereigns, \u201cit cannot be truly averred that the offender has been twice punished for the same offence; but only that by one act he has committed two offences, for each of which he is justly punishable.\u201d [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The language of the Michigan Constitution\u2019s double jeopardy provision is substantially similar to that of the United States Constitution. The Michigan Constitution was amended in 1963 to provide: \u201cNo person shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy.\u201d Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15. Before 1962, the wording of Michigan\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause was, \u201cNo person, after acquittal upon the merits, shall be tried for the same offense.\u201d Const 1908, art 2, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">When construing a constitution, the Court\u2019s task is to \u201cdivine the \u2018common understanding\u2019 of the provision, that meaning \u2018which reasonable minds, the great mass of the people themselves, would give it.\u2019 \u201d <em>People v Nash, </em>418 Mich 196, 209; 341 NW2d 439 (1983). Relevant considerations include the constitutional convention debates, the address to the people, the circumstances leading to the adoption of the provision, and the puxpose sought to be accomplished. <em>Id. </em>at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">At the 1961 Constitutional Convention a delegate stated that the Supreme Court of Michigan virtually had held the prior provision to mean \u201cthe same thing as the provision in the federal constitution, which is what we have put in . . . .\u201d Another delegate expressly agreed that the change in the language would make no change \u201cin the rule we have hitherto had.\u201d 1 Official Record, Constitutional Convention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>1961, p 539. In light of this clear expression of intent by the convention delegates that there be no change in the then-existing case law, we find it significant that in 1958 this Court had held, \u201cWhen a defendant has violated both State and Federal laws he is liable to each sovereign and subject to prosecution by each.\u201d <em>In re Illova, </em>351 Mich 204, 209; 88 NW2d 589 (1958).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">In 1976 this Court held that this constitutional provision \u201cprohibits a second prosecution for an offense arising out of the same criminal act unless it appears from the record that the interests of the State of Michigan and the jurisdiction which initially prosecuted are substantially different.\u201d <em>People v Cooper, supra </em>at 461. Finding the case to have been wrongly decided, we would overrule <em>People v Cooper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\"><em>Cooper </em>stated that it questioned the continued validity of United States Supreme Court decisions,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and therefore the Court \u201cpreferred to rest the deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>sion on our state constitution.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In so doing this Court failed to follow the general rule that \u201c[u]nless there is a compelling reason to afford greater protection under the Michigan Constitution, the Michigan and federal provisions will be treated as affording the same protections.\u201d <em>People v Perlos, </em>436 Mich 305, 313, n 7; 462 NW2d 310 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">We would now join the overwhelming majority of state courts that recognize the validity of dual federal and state convictions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In accordance with this recognition that state and federal governments may punish the same offenses, we would hold that neither defendant\u2019s subsequent state prosecution violated the double jeopardy provisions of the Michigan or United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Defendants also assert that their Oakland Circuit Court indictments were barred by MCL 333.7409; MSA 14.15(7409), arguing that the indictments in state court arose out of the same acts on which their convictions in the Florida federal court were based. MCL 333.7409; MSA 14.15(7409), enacted in 1978, applies only to controlled substance crimes. Section 7409 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">If a violation of this article is a violation of a federal law or the law of another state, a conviction or acquittal under federal law or the law of another state for the same act is a bar to prosecution in this state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">As of the fall of 1995, twenty-six states had enacted some form of statute barring subsequent prosecutions. Bollinger, <em>Defending dual prosecutions: Learning how to draw the line, </em>10 Crim Just 16, 18 (Fall, 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">In enacting MCL 333.7409; MSA 14.15(7409) the Legislature was not codifying the rule set forth in <em>People v Cooper, supra, </em>as can be seen by the significant differences between the statute and case law. <em>Cooper </em>applies to all criminal offenses, while \u00a7 7409 concerns only controlled substances. <em>Cooper </em>allows for dual prosecution when the state\u2019s interest is not protected by the federal prosecution, while \u00a7 7409, by contrast, is a complete bar to dual prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">We would hold that the defendants bear the burden both of production and persuasion to prevail on their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>argument that the statute applies to bar a second prosecution. As a general rule, this Court has the power to allocate the burden of proof. <em>People v D\u2019Angelo, 401 </em>Mich 167, 182; 257 NW2d 655 (1977). Because the statute does not state who shall bear the burden of proof, we are free to assign it as we see fit, as long as we do not transgress the constitutional requirement that we not place on the defendant the burden of persuasion to negate an element of the crime. <em>Patterson v New York, </em>432 US 197; 97 S Ct 2319; 53 L Ed 2d 281 (1977); <em>People v Pegenau, </em>447 Mich 278, 317; 523 NW2d 325 (1994) (Boyle, J., concurring in the result). This statutory exclusion does not call into question defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. The defendant is alleging that he should be insulated from prosecution regardless of whether he is guilty. MCL 333.7531; MSA 14.15(7531) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">It is not necessary for this state to negate any exemption or exception in this article in a complaint, information, indictment, or other pleading or in a trial, hearing, or other proceeding under this article. The burden of proof of an exemption or exception is upon the person claiming it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">As in <em>People v Pegenau, supra, </em>defendant is attempting to establish an exemption or exception to a controlled substances offense. In this situation, the presence of a conviction or acquittal under federal law or the law of another state for the same act is analogous to an affirmative defense. <em>Id. </em>at 289. Thus, it is appropriate to place the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence on the defendant. See <em>D\u2019Angelo, supra </em>at 182.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">We are asked to determine whether the statute prohibits the state\u2019s prosecution of defendants. The key phrase in \u00a7 7409 is \u201cthe same act.\u201d In this, the statute differs from the United States and Michigan Constitutions, both of which discuss the same <em>offense.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">New Jersey has an almost identical statute,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> which was applied in <em>State v Ableman, </em>72 NJ 145; 368 A2d 356 (1977). In that case the defendant had been convicted in federal court of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute hashish, and of possession with intent to distribute hashish. The issue presented to the court was whether the statute barred subsequent state prosecution of a charge of unlawful distribution of hashish. As explained in the concurring opinion, the court ruled that \u201cwhere a defendant involved in a large-scale operation of illegal drug traffic pleads guilty of possession with intent to distribute a great quantity of narcotics in a federal court located in a foreign state, [the statute] does not stand as a bar to a State prosecution for distribution of a portion of those narcotics.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151 (Pashman, J., concurring in the result).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The gist of the crime of conspiracy is the agreement of the conspirators to commit one or more unlawful acts, where one or more of the conspirators do \u201cany act to effect the object of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>Braverman v United States, </em>317 US 49, 53; 63 S Ct 99; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>87 L Ed 23 (1942). In order to determine what the extent of the agreement is, so that we may determine whether there are two conspiracies or only one, we will use the same \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test used in constitutional double jeopardy analysis. This test includes the following factors: 1) time, 2) persons acting as coconspirators, 3) the statutory offenses charged in the indictments, 4) the overt acts charged by the government or any other description of the offenses charged that indicate the nature and scope of the activity that the government sought to punish in each case, and 5) places where the events alleged as part of the conspiracy took place. The essence of the determination is whether there is one agreement to commit two crimes, or more than one agreement each with a separate object. <em>United States v Thomas, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Because this is the first time this Court has addressed the burden of proof for MCL 333.7409; MSA 14.15(7409), and the lower courts did not fully address the applicability of the statute, we remand to allow the trial court to hold any further proceedings necessary and make a determination of whether there were multiple conspiracies.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Defendant Hermiz argues that in his rebuttal at closing arguments the prosecution improperly vouched for the credibility of its witnesses. Defendant objected to this argument at trial. The trial judge merely noted defendant\u2019s objection and did not give corrective instructions. Although we agree that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was improper, we would affirm Hermiz\u2019 conviction because we find the misconduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>to be harmless. Review of the record convinces us that the error had only slight or negligible influence on the verdict. Therefore, the error was harmless. <em>People v Mateo, </em>453 Mich 203, 221; 551 NW2d 891 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">We would affirm in part the opinion of the Court of Appeals affirming defendant Hermiz\u2019 conviction, reverse the Court of Appeals opinion vacating defendant Mezy\u2019s conviction, and remand for further proceedings. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b436-7\">Boyle and Riley, JJ., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\"> 207 Mich App 449; 526 NW2d 1 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b423-9\"> 450 Mich 871 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b423-10\"> 21 USC 841(a)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-11\">(a) Except as authorized by this title, it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-12\">(1) to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance ....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b424-7\"> 18 USC 1956(a)(2)(B)(ii) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-8\">Whoever transports, transmits, or transfers, or attempts to transport, transmit, or transfer a monetary instrument or funds from a place in the United States to or through a place outside the United States or to a place in the United States from or through a place outside the United States\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-9\">(B) knowing that the monetary instrument or funds involved in the transportation represent the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity and knowing that such transportation is designed in whole or in part\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-10\">(ii) to avoid a transaction reporting requirement under State or Federal law,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-11\">shall be sentenced to a fine of $500,000 or twice the value of the monetary instrument or funds involved in the transportation, whichever is greater, or imprisonment for not more than twenty years, or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b425-7\"> MCL 333.7401(2)(a)(i); MSA 14.15(7401)(2)(a)(i) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-8\">A person who violates this section as to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-9\">(a) A controlled substance classified in schedule 1 or 2 that is a narcotic drug described in section 7214(a)(iv) and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-10\">(i) Which is in an amount of 650 grains or more of any mixture containing that substance is guilty of a felony and shall be imprisoned for life.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b425-11\"> 208 Mich App 545; 528 NW2d 783 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b425-12\"> 450 Mich 871 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b426-5\"> Of course, a defendant could bring a claim that this newly charged offense violated the terms of his plea agreement. <em>Rivera-Feliciano, supra </em>at 952, n 1.

However, I am unable to support the decision to overrule this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>People v Cooper, </em>398 Mich 450; 247 NW2d 866 (1976). I therefore dissent from part in of the lead opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">I concur with the decision to remand even though several factors appear to suggest that the defendants were not prosecuted twice for the same act. The alleged conspiracies were separate in time, although there was an overlap of some two years. The persons involved in each conspiracy were different, although again there was some overlap. The charged offenses were the same, consisting of the conspiracy to possess cocaine with the intent to distribute it, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>the amounts charged were different. The overt acts varied greatly between the indictments. The locales of the offenses also differed. Finally, the conspiracies differed in scope, with one aiming at large-scale national distribution and the other at local, street-level transactions. However, because this Court has not previously addressed the burden of proof, it is appropriate to remand to allow the trial court to apply the correct burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">In <em>Cooper, </em>this Court held that the Michigan Constitution forbids a second prosecution for the same offense by the state unless the interests of the state and the initial prosecutor are \u201csubstantially different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 462. Whether or not the members of this Court feel that the case was wrongly decided, principles of stare decisis require its continued vitality until and unless review is required for the resolution of the case before us. The instant cases may be decided on statutory grounds, making it unnecessary to reach the constitutional question of double jeopardy that invites review of <em>Cooper. </em>On remand, the trial court may conclude that MCL 333.7409; MSA 14.15(7409) bars the second prosecutions of the defendants. If so, there will be no need to perform double jeopardy analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">It is also unnecessary to reach <em>Cooper </em>because double jeopardy is not implicated by the facts before us. The lead opinion does conclude that, for double jeopardy purposes, the defendants established a prima facie claim that the prosecutions were for the same offense and that the government then failed to demonstrate that prosecution was not barred. I would conclude that the defendants did not make a prima facie showing and that a preponderance of the evidence demonstrated that the offenses were distinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>I dissent from the lead opinion\u2019s reliance on the overlap in time and the similarity of the charges to conclude that the defendants made an unrefuted prima facie showing that they were prosecuted twice for the same offense. <em>Ante </em>at 277. I cannot assign the same weight to these similarities as the lead opinion does. Unfortunately, far more persons are charged with identical drug offenses than could ever be linked together in one conspiracy. Similarly, many drug offenses occur at the same time without being connected. The overlap in the time and charges is more symptomatic of the drug problems in our society than of any connection between the offenses charged. The preponderance of the evidence before the Court demonstrates that the conspiracies were separate.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The evidence is sufficient to overcome the defendants\u2019 prima facie double jeopardy case \u2014 if, indeed, they made such a showing. Both lower courts should have held that the government met its burden of demonstrating that the conspiracies were separate. I would hold that there is no need for further double jeopardy analysis, so this Court need not address <em>Cooper.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b438-6\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ask\"><em>(dissenting). </em>The question is whether the State of Michigan may prosecute the defendants for conspiracy to possess with intent to deliver in excess of 650 grams of cocaine after they had been prosecuted and convicted in federal court of similar offenses.

Because the lead opinion states in part in why it would overrule <em>Cooper, </em>we respond stating why we would not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">We also disagree with the lead opinion\u2019s conclusion, in part II, that defendant Mezy\u2019s federal indictment and plea have no bearing on the statutory or constitutional double jeopardy analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Section 7409 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">If a violation of this article is a violation of federal law or the law of another state, a conviction or acquittal under federal law or the law of another state for the same act is a bar to prosecution in this state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">As the lead opinion observes, \u00a7 7409 did not codify this Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Cooper. </em>Its reach is both more limited \u2014 it only applies to violations of the Public Health Code \u2014 and less limited \u2014 it does not state the exceptions enumerated in <em>Cooper </em>that might allow a subsequent prosecution in some cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">The Legislature expressed its concern with successive prosecutions by enacting \u00a7 7409 of the Public Health Code. Other states have enacted similar provisions under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Similarly, the Attorney General of the United States promulgated what has come to be known as the <em>Petite </em>policy, a general prohibition of federal prosecutions following a state' prosecution absent approval from an assistant attorney general of the United States.\"<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The rationale for the <em>Petite </em>policy respecting successive federal and state prosecutions is informative regarding the legislative intent in enacting \u00a7 7409.

If the federal government has already made expenditures to investigate, prosecute, and incarcerate a defendant, a second prosecution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>with duplicate costs of investigation, prosecution, and incarceration can be seen by a legislature as wasteful.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Alabama has provided another reason for its version of this statute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">One of the purposes of enacting the Alabama Controlled Substances Act was \u201cto standardize all laws in this State to be in conformity with the new Federal Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970.\u201d Clearly the purpose and intent of Section 20-2-77 is to bar a state prosecution when the defendant has been previously convicted in federal court (or the court of another state) for the same act.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">These legislative goals protect citizens from continual harassment, coordinate federal and state drug prosecutions, and protect the taxpayers from unnecessary costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The lead opinion quotes from the concurring opinion in <em>State v Ableman, </em>72 NJ 145; 368 A2d 356 (1977).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The majority in <em>Ableman </em>affirmed the reasoning of the lower court, which had cited with approval <em>State v Krell, </em>125 NJ Super 457, 461-462; 311 A2d 399 (1973). In <em>Krell, </em>the judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-9\">The four sections preceding section 25 [the comparable New Jersey statutory provision], under captions reading \u201cProhibited Acts,\u201d expressly set forth what acts are unlawful ... . Since, therefore, the act expressly sets forth the acts which are unlawful, it follows that what is meant by the \u201csame act\u201d specified in section 25 is any act expressly prohibited by the preceding sections 19 through 22.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Because the defendants in <em>Krell </em>had not been charged in federal court with distribution of narcotics, one of the four acts listed in the New Jersey statute, the superior court held that they could face state prosecution on that charge. A conspiracy charge was barred, however, because of an earlier federal prosecution for conspiracy, and the state charges of possession and possession with intent to distribute were barred by the federal prosecution for possession with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The New Jersey court thus took a common-sense approach to the definition of \u201csame act.\u201d Similarly, Michigan\u2019s statute should be read to prohibit prosecutions for conspiracy in Michigan when the federal prosecution is for the same conspiracy, even if the federal conspiracy is broader and partly, though not exclusively, includes the conduct in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">The lead opinion begins its statutory analysis stating, \u201cThe key phrase in \u00a7 7409 is \u2018the same act.\u2019 In this, the statute differs from the United States and Michigan Constitutions, both of which discuss the same <em>offense.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Although noting this \u201ckey\u201d difference, the lead opinion provides no explanation of its significance. Insight can be gained from Justice Coleman\u2019s concurrence in <em>Cooper. </em>She disagreed with part of the rationale of the majority, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">I would <em>narrow </em>the rale accepted from <em>Commonwealth v Mills, </em>447 Pa 163; 286 A2d 638 (1971), which \u201cprohibits a second prosecution for an offense arising out of the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>criminal <em>act\" </em>to one which \u201cprohibits a second prosecution for the same <em>offense.\" [Cooper </em>at 463 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Tennessee applied a similar analysis when construing its statutory double jeopardy bar.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">It is apparent that the Tennessee Drug Control Act of 1971 was enacted to compliment the then existing federal laws regarding drug control and that [Term Code Ann] 53-11-404 was included to effectuate that purpose. The provision that bars prosecution for the \u201csame act\u201d necessarily contemplates that the different jurisdictions may prohibit an act by means of defining offenses differently while still protecting the same interests, i.e., criminalizing drug trafficking. . . . TCA 53-11-404 requires a factual analysis to determine whether or not a person is being prosecuted for an offense based upon an act when such act was an offense or was included in an offense in another jurisdiction and' for which act that person has previously been convicted or acquitted. <em>[State v Mongiove, </em>1991 Term Crim App LEXIS 77, *18.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">The signers of the lead opinion rely on federal cases for assistance in articulating a standard for determining whether there are one or more conspiracies.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Court should also look to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Brown v Ohio, </em>432 US <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>161, 168-169; 97 S Ct 2221; 53 L Ed 2d 187 (1977), in which this Court held that greater and lesser included offenses must be considered the \u201csame\u201d for federal constitutional double jeopardy analysis, and that \u201c[wjhatever the sequence may be, the Fifth Amendment forbids successive prosecution and cumulative punishment for a greater and lesser included offense.\u201d Thus, if one conspiracy is encompassed by another for constitutional double jeopardy analysis, prosecution is barred by \u00a7 7409, which uses the broader term \u201cact\u201d to describe when prosecution of the charge also would be barred in the federal courts as the same \u201coffense.\u201d As <em>Brown </em>makes clear, even if a trial of the smaller subset of allegations is held first, it bars a second prosecution for the larger scope of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">I agree with the Court of Appeals in <em>Mezy </em>and the lead opinion that the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test is useful in applying Michigan\u2019s bar against double jeopardy, both under the statute and the state constitution. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit emphasized in <em>United States v Thomas, </em>759 F2d 659, 662 (CA 8, 1985), immediately after listing the five factors cited in the lead opinion that this is a comprehensive inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">These factors are guidelines only. The essence of the determination is whether there is one agreement to commit two crimes, or more than one agreement, each with a separate object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">We will therefore look beyond the indictments and consider all the evidence we have before us.

Remand for further fact finding is therefore necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The lead opinion, in explaining the test to be employed and the degree of proof needed to satisfy it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>places the burden on the defendants to prove that the statutory bar applies.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>1 agree that the burden should be placed on the defendants under MCL 333.7531; MSA 14.15(7531).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">We are of the opinion that the Court of Appeals in <em>Hermiz </em>erred in not employing the <em>Thomas </em>test for multiple conspiracies. Instead, it narrowly focused on language in <em>People v Sturgis, </em>427 Mich 392, 401; 397 NW2d 783 (1986), that, under the state constitutional analysis, part of Michigan\u2019s broader \u201csame transaction\u201d test includes whether all the charges \u201cdemonstrate \u2018a single intent and goal.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The Court of Appeals said that there was \u201cno indication in the record that the \u2018single intent and goal\u2019 of the conspirators in Florida was to conspire to possess with intent to deliver more than 650 grams of cocaine in Michigan.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This analysis ignores the holding in <em>Brown </em>that a prosecution for a lesser included offense bars a subsequent prosecution for a greater offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">If Mezy and Hermiz were prosecuted in Florida for the conspiracy to buy cocaine for distribution in Oakland County and elsewhere in Michigan, a prosecution in Oakland County for conspiracy to distribute that cocaine in that county would be a prosecution for the same offense. This is true even if others in the Florida prosecution were not solely focused on selling the cocaine in Oakland County. The Court of Appeals approach would produce the same anomaly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>in a conspiracy context that the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit noted in <em>Thomas:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">If [this test] is the sole standard used to determine whether multiple conspiracies exist, then prosecutors could drawn up [sic] two indictments and by skillfully choosing different sets of overt acts make one conspiracy appear to be two. <em>[Id. </em>at 662.][<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Ignoring the rule of construction that constitutional questions should not be reached if a statutory analysis obviates the inquiry, the lead opinion proposes to overrule <em>Cooper. </em>In the circumstance that the lead opinion concludes that a remand is necessary to evaluate the statutory claim, there is no reason to reach <em>Cooper. </em>Because the lead opinion does so, I write to explain why we are of the opinion that the lead opinion errs in its analysis of <em>Cooper </em>and its proposal to overrule it.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">The lead opinion proposes to overrule <em>Cooper </em>because it concludes that this Court failed to follow the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d that, \u201c[u]nless there is a compelling reason to afford greater protection under the Michigan Constitution, the Michigan and federal provisions will be treated as affording the same protections.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>The \u201ccompelling reason\u201d test was not announced until after <em>Cooper </em>was decided, and it has principally been employed in cases arising under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">A review of the record and briefs in this Court when <em>Cooper </em>was decided demonstrates the error in the lead opinion\u2019s assertion. Marx Cooper\u2019s brief to this Court, as well as the briefs of amici curiae, all discussed the conflict between protecting an accused from being twice put in jeopardy and the dual sovereignty doctrine set forth in <em>Bartkus v Illinois, </em>359 US 121; 79 S Ct 676; 3 L Ed 2d 684 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The defendant\u2019s brief not only addressed how the reasoning underlying <em>Bartkus </em>had been undermined by subsequent federal case law, but it also discussed why the Michigan Constitution should be read as providing stronger double jeopardy protections. The defendant also discussed some of the scholarly criticisms of the dual sovereignty doctrine (whether based on subsequent federal case law, the practical reasons for disagreeing with <em>Bartkus, </em>or constitutional/jurisprudential objections to trying someone twice for essentially the same act) and provided this Court with a comprehensive list of scholarly articles reviewing the dual sovereignty doctrine.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The defendant in that case said, \u201cIt would be hard to find a practice more universally condemned by the legal scholars than this double jeopardy practice of successive federal-state trials for the same act.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Court was provided a full review of the case law and supplementary materials on this issue. This Court reviewed this material, made its decision, and chose to read the Michigan Constitution as prohibiting most successive state prosecutions. The lead opinion\u2019s bold but unsupported assertion that this Court failed to consider the issue before it and give proper deference to federal case law is clearly incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><em>Cooper </em>did not rely on an anticipated change in federal double jeopardy jurisprudence that has not occurred since <em>Cooper </em>was decided. While <em>Cooper </em>noted that the rationale in <em>Bartkus </em>had been undermined by subsequent cases, the Court <em>explicitly </em>stated that it was not resting its decision on what the United States Supreme Court had done or might do.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Court based its opinion on the Michigan Constitution because it was persuaded that it requires the heightened protection of double jeopardy values.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">There is no evidence in <em>Cooper </em>that this Court did not understand the consequences of its decision or that it acted on a whim. The opinion was reasoned and careful. Although the opinion did not use the words \u201ccompelling reason,\u201d the Court found significant, compelling merit in the criticisms of the dual sovereignty doctrine and the failure of that doctrine to protect the rights of the accused. The Court balanced the state\u2019s interests in prosecuting those who had broken the law and the defendant\u2019s right to avoid multiple prosecutions, and said: \u201cWe feel that the interests of the state and the defendant are best accommodated by the approach of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in <em>Commonwealth v Mills, </em>447 Pa 163; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>286 A2d 638 (1971).\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> While Justice Coleman did not fully agree with the reasoning in <em>Cooper, </em>she concurred in the result, making that decision to read the Michigan Constitution as barring multiple federal-state prosecutions unanimous.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Further support for the view that this Court thoughtfully and fully considered its decision and concluded that it should depart from the <em>Bartkus </em>construction appears in this Court\u2019s subsequent decisions affirming the result and the rationale in <em>Cooper. </em>In <em>People v Gay, </em>407 Mich 681, 693-694; 289 NW2d 651 (1980), this Court said that, in <em>Cooper, </em>\u201cwe found that emerging Federal trends in recent years <em>and the dictates of our own Constitution </em>required us to impose limits on what dual sovereignty would permit. . . . [T]his Court also recognized the fundamental need to safeguard defendants\u2019 constitutional rights. We therefore prohibited dual prosecution where the interests of the state are not \u2018substantially different.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) The Court stated the public policy reasons for its decisions, and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\"><em>Cooper </em>represents a <em>strong and uncompromising </em>statement by this Court that a defendant\u2019s right not to be twice tried in Federal and state court for the same criminal act will be <em>jealously </em>guarded except in extreme cases where Federal laws are framed to protect substantially different social interests. . . . <em>Cooper </em>makes clear that as <em>a. firm rule </em>dual prosecution ordinarily will not be tolerated in Michigan. . . . Further, since this safeguard of defendant\u2019s right against double jeopardy is of a constitutional magnitude, <em>it must receive this Court\u2019s close consideration. [Id. </em>at 694-695 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Once again, while not all the members of the Court in <em>Gay </em>agreed with the application of the balancing of interests test outlined in <em>Cooper, </em>the Court unanimously upheld the rationale of <em>Cooper </em>and unanimously agreed it was necessary to apply the decision retroactively. This Court again unanimously reaffirmed the rationale of <em>Cooper </em>in <em>People v Formicola, </em>407 Mich 293; 284 NW2d 334 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The lead opinion relies on <em>In re Illova, </em>351 Mich 204; 88 NW2d 589 (1958), for the proposition that this Court had accepted the dual sovereignty principle before <em>Cooper </em>was decided. This Court distinguished <em>Illova </em>in <em>Cooper </em>as a case concerning jurisdiction, not double jeopardy.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Contrary to the lead opinion\u2019s claim, there is <em>every </em>\u201creason to suppose that <em>Illova </em>was not an accurate expression of the state of the case law on <em>double jeopardy </em>at the time of the Constitutional Convention . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The lead opinion also fails to accord proper deference to the principle of stare decisis. This Court once observed long ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">The rule of <em>stare decisis </em>establishes uniformity, certainty, and stability in the law, but it was never intended to perpetuate error or to prevent the consideration of rule of law to be applied to the ever-changing business, economic, and political life of a community Only in the rare case when it is clearly apparent that an error has been made, or changing conditions result in injustice by the application of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>outmoded rale, should we deviate from following the established rale. <em>[Parker v Port Huron Hosp, </em>361 Mich 1, 10; 105 NW2d 1 (I960).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">This is not the \u201crare case when it is <em>clearly apparent </em>that an error has been made,\u201d but rather one where the lead opinion simply disagrees with the decision in <em>Cooper </em>and ignores the basic principles underlying stare decisis. There is not a crisis of criminals terrorizing the people of this state after a federal prosecution for a drug or other offense. There has not been a factual change other than the failure of the United States Supreme Court to overrule <em>Bartkus </em>(in part because of the principles of stare decisis), a change that this Court explicitly in <em>Cooper </em>distanced itself from requiring.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">As the United States Supreme Court recently stated in the context of the abortion debate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">[T]he Court could not pretend to be reexamining the prior law with any justification beyond a present doctrinal disposition to come out differently from the Court of 1973. To overrule prior law for no other reason than that would run counter to the view repeated in our cases, that a decision to overrule should rest on some special reason over and above the belief that a prior case was wrongly decided. <em>[Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v Casey, </em>505 US 833, 864; 112 S Ct 2791; 120 L Ed 2d 674 (1992).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">The lead opinion does not state a \u201cspecial reason\u201d for overruling <em>Cooper. </em>It does not discuss the strong scholarly opposition to the dual sovereignty doctrine in <em>Bartkus, </em>or other states\u2019 decisions that explain the flaws in the dual sovereignty doctrine, or this Court\u2019s decisions that have consistently reaffirmed <em>Cooper. </em>The lead opinion simply states without support that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>this Court did not give proper deference to federal decisions, and then proposes to overrule <em>Cooper. </em>This is nothing more than a \u201cbelief that a prior case was wrongly decided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The lead opinion\u2019s approach is troublesome. It undermines the authority of this Court. As Justice O\u2019Connor observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">The Court must take care to speak and act in ways that allow people to accept its decisions on the terms the Court claims for them, as grounded truly in principle, not as compromises with social and political pressures having, as such, no bearing on the principled choices that the Court is obliged to make. Thus, the Court\u2019s legitimacy depends on making legally principled decisions under circumstances in which their principled character is sufficiently plausible</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">There is a limit to the amount of error that can plausibly be imputed to prior courts. If that limit should be exceeded, disturbance of prior rulings would be taken as evidence that justifiable reexamination of principle had given way to drives for particular results in the short term. The legitimacy of the Court would fade with the frequency of its vacillation. [505 US 865-866.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">While Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s decision in <em>Planned Parenthood </em>has been criticized by some, her articulation of the principles underlying the doctrine of stare decisis and the obligation of an appellate court to overrule its prior decisions only after careful and thoughtful deliberation producing a strong conviction that the prior case was wrongly decided, only when there is a \u201ccompelling\u201d reason to abandon the prior decision, is legally sound. To overrule precedent of this Court with so little evaluation of the costs and benefits of the established rule would be a lamentable departure from the rule of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>The concerns addressed by this Court in <em>Cooper </em>and <em>Gay, </em>as well as those stated in judicial opinions in other states and scholarly writings, remain. The right against being put twice in jeopardy is a personal right that would be impinged by successive federal and state prosecutions. This right must give way when the prosecutions serve significantly different ends. But unless the subsequent state prosecution is shown to meet the test set forth in <em>Cooper, </em>the individual\u2019s right to protection from further governmental prosecution should prevail. Nothing has occurred factually or jurisprudentially to change the fundamental impolicy of successive prosecutions. Until it can be shown otherwise, we should continue to follow <em>Cooper.</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The lead opinion states, in the <em>Mezy </em>case, \u201cJeopardy does not attach to charges dismissed as part of a plea agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">We would agree that if a defendant withdraws a guilty plea and the prosecutor seeks to reinstate the original charges, jeopardy has not attached to the original charges.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> If, however, a plea is accepted and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>accompanying counts are dismissed <em>with prejudice, </em>other considerations come into play.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The lead opinion\u2019s reference to a federal \u201crule\u201d overstates the law. Courts that have adopted this \u201crule\u201d have stated it in passing, such as in the footnotes cited by the lead opinion,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> or, when in the main body of the opinion, in cases where the discussion is not critical to resolution of the issue before the Court.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The cases cited by the lead opinion are thus</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>not on point, nor are the cases cited by the cases cited in the lead opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Section 7409 literally speaks only of \u201ca conviction or acquittal under federal law,\u201d and thus is subject to the construction that a dismissal with prejudice of a federal prosecution, not being either a \u201cconviction or acquittal,\u201d is not a bar to prosecution in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The literal, or as it is sometimes stated, the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of a statute is often held to be the correct construction of legislative intent. But in other cases, this Court has looked beyond the literal meaning to the spirit of the statute for guidance to the correct construction. \u201cFew words have a \u2018content so intrinsic\u2019 that their meaning does not become doubtful in the context of a particular question.\u201d <em>People v McFarlin, </em>389 Mich 557, 563; 208 NW2d 504 (1973), where this Court held that a statute providing that the disposition of a child, under the chapter of the probate court concerning juveniles, shall not in any \u201ccriminal or any other cause or proceeding whatever\u201d be evidence against the child \u201cfor any purpose whatever,\u201d does not bar a judge from considering an adult offender\u2019s juvenile offense record as a factor in imposing sentence upon him. Since the lead opinion does not recognize and discuss the issue as one of statutory construction, there is no need to further respond in this regard. See also <em>Lawrence v Toys R Us, </em>453 Mich 112; 551 NW2d 155 (1996), where this Court today similarly departs from a literal or \u201cplain meaning\u201d in construing the worker\u2019s compensation act.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>And while it is certainly doubtful whether a dismissal of a federal charge as part of a plea bargain can be seen as having occurred after the accused was in jeopardy, there are other constitutional principles, particularly the Due Process Clause, that might bar a state prosecution, following dismissal of a federal charge as part of a plea bargain, for essentially the same reasons that this Court concluded in <em>Cooper </em>that multiple prosecutions by both the state and the federal government is unnecessarily onerous and to be avoided except in compelling circumstances not present in the instant cases.</p>\n<judges id=\"b457-4\">Cavanagh and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-11\"> MCL 333.7409; MSA 14.15(7409).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b439-12\"> New Jersey, Ohio, Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Tennessee are among the states that have enacted a version of this statute.

The United States Supreme Court noted this policy <em>Petite v United States, </em>361 US 529; 80 S Ct 450; 4 L Ed 2d 490 (1960). See 3 LaFave <em>&amp; </em>Israel, Criminal Procedure, \u00a7 24.5, p 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">The federal courts have ruled that the <em>Petite </em>policy is an internal guideline of the Department of Justice that provides no substantive rights for defendants to challenge a violation of the policy. See, e.g., <em>United States v Pungitore, </em>910 F2d 1084, 1120 (CA 3, 1990). In Michigan, however, the policy respecting drug offenses is statutory, providing defendants with an opportunity to challenge a prosecution that violates \u00a7 7409.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b440-12\"> <em>Rinaldi v United States, </em>434 US 22, 31; 98 S Ct 81; 54 L Ed 2d 207 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b441-10\"> <em>Barnett v State, </em>373 So 2d 1226, 1228 (Ala Crirn App, 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b441-11\"> <em>Ante </em>at 284.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b442-9\"> <em>Ante </em>at 284 (emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b443-9\"> While the totality of the circumstances test outlined in the lead opinion is useful, it should not finish the inquiry whether these defendants were prosecuted for the \u201csame act.\u201d Other states have held that federal conspiracy charges bar prosecution for an in-state conspiracy when the two involve the same set of criminal acts, even if the federal conspiracy was broader in scope. <em>Krell, supra; Commonwealth v Savage, </em>388 Pa Super 561; 566 A2d 272 (1989); <em>People v Abbamonte, </em>43 NY2d 74; 400 NYS2d 766; 371 NE2d 485 (1977).

Before an appellate court can adequately review a trial court\u2019s findings for clear error, it must first have the trial court\u2019s findings made under the proper standard. The record before this Court is insufficient to preemptively determine whether the defendants faced multiple prosecution for the same act.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">Similarly, the concurring opinion also errs in finding, under the constitutional analysis, that these were separate conspiracies. The opinion does not discuss trial court findings of fact, made after that court heard the testimony in the state trials, reviewed both the federal and state indictments and accompanying exhibits, the federal and state statutes the defendants were found to have violated, the testimony of witnesses at the federal trial, the testimony before both the federal and state grand juries, the testimony taken during the preliminary examination and at a federal forfeiture proceeding, and the testimony during the evidentiary hearing on the double jeopardy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">The opinion does not attempt to explain away these findings of fact, made by the trial court \u201cafter laboriously considering all these factors.\u201d The clear error standard is designed to protect against an appellate judge hastily substituting his reaction to the generally limited evidence before him for the considered evaluation of a more informed trial court judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b446-8\"> <em>Ante </em>at 282-283.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b446-9\"> 207 Mich App 449, 451; 526 NW2d 1 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b446-10\"> <em>Id. </em>at 452.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b447-9\"> This also explains why <em>Brown v Ohio\u2019s </em>discussion of greater and lesser included offenses also applies to greater and lesser factual conspiracies.
