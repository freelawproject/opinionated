We conclude that the public-duty doctrine remains valid in Michigan. We also conclude that the most appropriate special-relationship test for examining the relationship between police officers and private individuals is the test articulated by the New York Court of Appeals in <em>Cuffy v City of New York, </em>69 NY2d 255; 513 NYS2d 372; 505 NE2d 937 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">This case comes to us to consider defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition alleging a failure \u201cto state a claim on which relief can be granted.\u201d MCR 2.116(C)(8). Therefore, for purposes of deciding if the lower courts correctly ruled on the motion, we accept all well-pleaded facts in plaintiff\u2019s complaint as true. <em>Wade v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>439 Mich 158, 162-163; 483 NW2d 26 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">Plaintiff alleges that defendant, Detroit Police Officer Keith D. Beasley, was grossly negligent when he responded to a telephone call requesting aid on behalf of decedent, Phoebe Obleton. At 12:30 A.M., on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Tuesday, October 9, 1990, through the decedent\u2019s bathroom window, her neighbors saw her husband attack her. They also heard the decedent screaming for help. Responding to the situation, two of the neighbors telephoned Detroit\u2019s 911 emergency dispatch service requesting emergency assistance on behalf of decedent. Further calls to 911 followed. Finally, at 12:40 A.M., neighbors placed a direct call to the local police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">At 1:30 A.M., Officer Beasley and another police officer arrived at the decedent\u2019s residence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Decedent\u2019s neighbors met the officers, explained that they had seen the decedent\u2019s husband attacking her, communicated that they heard her scream for help, and informed the officers of her apartment number. The complaint alleges that, in response, the officers, \u201cafter taking down the witnesses\u2019 names, simply circled the building and left without ever attempting to knock on Plaintiff decedent\u2019s apartment door, or make any attempt to contact Plaintiff decedent or determine if, in fact, she was being or had been attacked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">At 4:15 A.M., the decedent\u2019s husband telephoned Detroit\u2019s 911 service to report that he had stabbed his wife to death. At 4:50 A.M., three hours and twenty minutes after Officer Beasley arrived outside the decedent\u2019s residence, she died.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Sheila White, as personal representative of the decedent\u2019s estate, filed a suit against the City of Detroit, the City of Detroit Police Department, the 911 operator, and both responding police officers. The trial court dismissed the claims against the city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>and the police department on the basis of governmental immunity. The 911 operator and defendant Officer Beasley moved for summary disposition for failure \u201cto state a claim on which relief can be granted.\u201d MCR 2.116(C)(8). Defendants relied exclusively on the public-duty doctrine, arguing that they owed a duty to the public only, not to the decedent as an individual. The trial court denied their motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The Court of Appeals reversed with respect to the 911 operator.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 206 Mich App 459, 462; 522 NW2d 681 (1994). It reasoned that the public-duty doctrine applied to the 911 operator and that the relationship between the decedent and the 911 operator was too attenuated to satisfy the special-relationship exception to the public-duty doctrine. <em>Id. </em>However, it upheld the trial court\u2019s denial of summary disposition for Officer Beasley. <em>Id. </em>at 466. It found that defendant\u2019s arrival at the crime scene was sufficient to satisfy the special-relationship exception to the public-duty doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 462. Defendant appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Defendant\u2019s appeal places two issues squarely before this Court. First, because we have not yet addressed the issue, we must decide if the public-duty doctrine is viable in Michigan. Second, provided that we accept the existence of the public-duty doctrine, we must also define the limits of the doctrine\u2019s special-relationship exception when applied to police officers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">THE PUBLIC-DUTY DOCTRINE</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">We hold that the public-duty doctrine applies in Michigan. As defined by Justice Cooley, the public-duty doctrine provides</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">[t]hat if the duty which the official authority imposes upon an officer is a duty to the public, a failure to perform it, or an inadequate or erroneous performance, must be a public, not an individual injury, and must be redressed, if at all, in some form of public prosecution. On the other hand, if the duty is a duty to the individual, then a neglect to perform it, or to perform it properly, is an individual wrong, and may support an individual action for damages. [2 Cooley, Torts (4th ed), \u00a7 300, pp 385-386.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Applied to police officers, the public-duty doctrine insulates officers from tort liability for the negligent failure to provide police protection unless an individual plaintiff satisfies the special-relationship exception. See <em>Cuffy, </em>69 NY2d 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Currently, the public-duty doctrine is under attack because some commentators believe that the doctrine unjustifiably creates inequitable and harsh results for plaintiffs. The doctrine has an \u201call or nothing\u201d character that may deny a plaintiff recovery just because the tort was committed by a public, rather than a private, employee. The problems stemming from the doctrine\u2019s \u201call or nothing\u201d character are compounded by the lack of guidance in defining which duties are public and which are specific individual duties. Partly on the basis of these concerns, some courts have abandoned the public-duty doctrine altogether.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See, e.g., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number><em>Ryan v State, </em>134 Ariz 308, 310; 656 P2d 597 (1982), and <em>Leake v Cain, </em>720 P2d 152, 159 (Colo, 1986). While the inequitable and harsh results created by the doctrine are a significant concern when the doctrine is applied to most government employees, we conclude that the dangerous work environment inherent in police activities is a counterbalancing concern when the doctrine is applied to police officers, as will be discussed in part m of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Otherwise, there are two basic justifications for retaining the public-duty doctrine. First, the doctrine protects governments from unreasonable interference with policy decisions, and, second, it protects government employees from unreasonable liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">We agree that the public-duty doctrine serves a useful purpose by protecting governments from unreasonable interference with policy decisions. As noted by the Supreme Court of Illinois, while deciding a suit alleging that the failure to enforce the City of Chicago\u2019s housing code led to a child\u2019s injury,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">If the failure of the city to enforce [an] ordinance should render it liable for injuries sustained thereby, the tremendous exposure to liability would certainly dissuade the city from enacting ordinances designed for the protection and welfare of the general public, and thereby the general pubT lie would lose the benefit of salutary legislative enactments. <em>[Stigler v Chicago, </em>48 111 2d 20, 24-25; 268 NE2d 26 (1971).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">We find the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Illinois persuasive. A convincing justification for the contin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ued recognition of the public-duty doctrine is its purpose of shielding governmental units from liability \u201cwhen its employees act, or refuse to act, so as to conform to a municipal ordinance and/or a state statute.\u201d <em>Sawicki v Village of Ottawa Hills, </em>37 Ohio St 3d 222, 226; 525 NE2d 468 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Further, tort liability should not be based on statutes and ordinances that are not traditionally relied on to impose liability or do not themselves specifically expose government employees to liability. Such liability may also deter the governmental entity from enacting protective legislation, fearing that the added cost of employee liability will eventually be borne by the governmental entity. Additionally, we note that mechanisms besides the threat of liability in negligence exist to hold employees accountable for failure to conform to statutes and ordinances. See <em>Ezell v Cockrell, </em>902 SW2d 394, 398 (Term, 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Similarly, we agree that the public-duty doctrine is justified to the extent that it clarifies that a government employee\u2019s job title alone does not create a duty between the employee and specific members of the public. For example, police officers should not be liable for insuring the general public\u2019s welfare just because their job title lists them as \u201cpolice officers.\u201d Police officers should not be liable \u201cfor failing to protect a member of the general public from a criminal act of which they were not aware but should have anticipated and prevented . . . <em>De Long v Erie Co, </em>60 NY2d 296, 304; 469 NYS2d 611; 457 NE2d 717 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Further, we agree that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">[f]or the courts to proclaim a new and general duty of protection in the law of tort, even to those who may be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>particular seekers of protection based on specific hazards, could and would inevitably determine how the limited police resources of the community should be allocated and without predictable limits. <em>[Pass v City of New York, </em>22 NY2d 579, 581-582; 240 NE2d 860 (1968).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Therefore, we agree that the public-duty doctrine should shield a government employee from liability that is based solely on that employee\u2019s particular job title.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">In conclusion, we find that the public-duty doctrine still serves several useful purposes. The government should be protected from unreasonable interference with policy decisions. Government employees should enjoy personal protection from tort liability based on their action in conformity with, or failure to conform to, statutes or ordinances not intended to create tort liability. The job titles of government employees alone should not create a duty to specific members of the public. Therefore, we adhere to the public-duty doctrine in Michigan to the extent that the doctrine achieves these objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">the special-relationship exception</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">The special-relationship exception to the public-duty doctrine exposes a government employee to liability for the employee\u2019s actions whenever a court finds that the government employee has a \u201cspecial-relationship\u201d with the plaintiff. <em>Sawicki, </em>37 Ohio St 3d 230. Whether or not the employee has a \u201cspecial-relationship\u201d with the plaintiff is determined by the specific test applicable in that state. A survey of special-relationship tests reveals deep disagreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>among the states regarding the exact nature of the \u201cspecial-relationship\u201d the plaintiff must prove.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The only special-relationship test adopted in more than one state is the test adopted by the New York Court of Appeals in <em>Cuffy, supra </em>at 260. The <em>Cuffy </em>test has also been adopted in Ohio and, with modification,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in Georgia. <em>Sawicki, </em>37 Ohio St 3d 232; <em>City of Rome v Jordan, </em>263 Ga 26, 29; 426 SE2d 861 (1993). The elements of the <em>Cuffy </em>test are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">(1) an assumption by the municipality, through promises or actions, of an affirmative duty to act on behalf of the party who was injured;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">(2) knowledge on the part of the municipality\u2019s agent that inaction could lead to harm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\">(3) some form of direct contact between the municipality\u2019s agents and the injured party; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">(4) that party\u2019s justifiable reliance on the municipality\u2019s affirmative undertaking .... <em>[Cuffy, </em>69 NY2d 260.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">We recognize that this test is somewhat arbitrarily restrictive. On first glance the test reads more like a test for promissory estoppel under contract law than a test for a special relationship in tort. However, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>also recognize that police officers are employed to work in a \u201cmilieu of criminal activity where every decision is fraught with uncertainty.\u201d <em>Ezell, supra, </em>398. Because of the unusual and extraordinary nature of police work it is unfair to allow \u201ca jury of laymen with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight to second-guess the exercise of a policeman\u2019s discretionary professional duty.\u201d <em>Shore v Stonington, </em>187 Conn 147, 157; 444 A2d 1379 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The test articulated in <em>Cuffy </em>responds to these concerns by insulating police officers from liability arising from their tortious on the job conduct in almost all instances where a plaintiff alleges a failure to provide police protection. Yet, the test also provides plaintiffs some relief in the particularly egregious case of an officer promising police protection, but negligently carrying out that promise. Although this test may deny recovery to some deserving plaintiffs, we prefer to be cautious when exposing police officers to on the job liability. Police officers must work in unusual circumstances. They deserve unusual protection. Therefore, at least when applied to police officers, we would adopt the <em>Cuffy </em>special-relationship test.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">JUSTICE LEVIN\u2019S DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">In his dissent, Justice Levin argues that this Court is compelled to abandon the public-duty doctrine for two reasons: because it is not a part of the law of this state and because the doctrine is inconsistent with MCL 691.1407(2); MSA 3.996(107)(2). We conclude that the dissent overstates the argument. This Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>is free to abandon the public-duty doctrine, but not compelled to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">First, the public-duty doctrine is a part of the law of this state. In recent years the Court of Appeals has consistently relied on the doctrine.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Admittedly, before this case, this Court has not chosen to recognize the doctrine, but that is not sufficient grounds to ignore Court of Appeals precedent. This Court\u2019s previous failure to recognize the public-duty doctrine simply leaves open the question whether this Court should adopt the doctrine. It does not prevent this Court from adopting the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">On the other hand, what is not a part of the law of this state is the recognition of any duty in tort on the part of the police \u201cunder state law and the Charter of the City of Detroit to protect the public.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Post </em>at 354. <em>Fiser v City of Ann Arbor, </em>417 Mich 461; 339 NW2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>413 (1983), relied on by the dissent, simply recognizes that, where the Legislature has provided an exception to statutory immunity, the police are subject to the same tort concepts affecting liability faced by private individuals. In this state, as in all other states that we are aware of, police are not subject to greater tort liability than would be faced by any other member of society with similar training, knowledge, and skill.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Similarly, we conclude that the dissent has confused the term \u201cduty\u201d as used in the former text of MCL 92.4; MSA 5.1752 with the concept of duty as an element of tort law. Aside from tort law, \u201cduty\u201d also means any \u201caction or a task required by one\u2019s position or occupation.\u201d <em>Random House College Dictionary: Revised Edition. </em>It is in this sense that MCL 92.4; MSA 5.1752 enumerates the tasks and powers assigned to police officers. The Legislature' never intended MCL 92.4; MSA 5.1752 to impose a duty in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Second, we disagree with Justice Levin\u2019s assertion that the public-duty doctrine is a doctrine of governmental immunity. Instead, we conclude that the public-duty doctrine is a doctrine of tort law. See <em>Sawicki, </em>37 Ohio St 3d 230. The doctrine determines whether a duty in tort exists, not whether an individual is immune from an otherwise existing tort duty. Accordingly, it is part of tort law. As a result, the public-duty doctrine is consistent with 1986 PA 175, MCL 691.1407(2); MSA 3.996(107)(2), and neither <em>Ross v Consumers Power Co (On Rehearing), </em>420</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Mich 567; 363 NW2d 641 (1984),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> nor 1986 PA 175 compels this Court to abandon the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">APPLICATION OF THE PUBLIC-DUTY DOCTRINE</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">With the public-duty doctrine and its special-relationship exception defined, we must now decide whether summary disposition was appropriate in the case before us. We conclude that it was. We employ a two-part analysis to reach this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">First, we conclude that the public-duty doctrine shields the officer from liability for the charged conduct. Plaintiffs complaint alleges a failure to provide police protection. Therefore, unless the facts of this case fit the special-relationship exception, the public-duty doctrine instructs that the officer did not owe a duty in tort to any individual, including decedent. Second, we find that the facts in this case do not establish a special relationship between the officer and decedent. Employing the newly adopted special-relationship test, we conclude plaintiff has failed to allege at least two of the elements necessary to the establishment of a special relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">First, plaintiff did not allege facts sufficient to suggest that there was direct contact between the police officer and decedent. There is no allegation of direct contact before the attack, and during the attack decedent only succeeded in contacting her neighbors \u2014 not the police. Second, plaintiff failed to suggest that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>decedent justifiably relied on any affirmative action taken by the police department. Because decedent never directly contacted the police, she had no knowledge of a promise on which she could rely.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">Further, any argument that she relied on the police officer because she knew that it was the officer\u2019s \u201cduty\u201d to aid victims of crime runs contrary to our rationale for adopting the public-duty doctrine itself. Such an argument is tantamount to arguing that a tort duty can be established solely on the basis of defendant\u2019s job title. Because we adopted the public-duty doctrine in part to protect government employees from liability based solely on their job title, we refuse to allow the exception to contradict the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Therefore, plaintiff has failed to allege facts sufficient to satisfy the special-relationship exception. Under the public-duty doctrine, the police officer did not owe a duty in tort to decedent, an individual. As a result, plaintiff has failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted. Accordingly, we would reverse the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the trial court for entry of an order granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<judges id=\"b475-6\">Riley and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Brickley, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-8\"> The other officer is named in plaintiff\u2019s complaint but did not join defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition.

I also agree with the adoption by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>the lead opinion of the test in <em>Cuffy v City of New </em>York<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for cases of nonfeasance. The special-relationship exception is in essence a variation of the special-relationship standard of traditional negligence law that recognizes that where a \u201cdefendant has gone so far in what he has actually done, and has got himself into such a relation with the plaintiff, that he has begun to affect the interests of the plaintiff adversely,\u201d Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed), \u00a7 56, p 375, the line between active and passive conduct has been crossed and social policy justifies recognition of a duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">I disagree with broader language in the lead opinion suggesting that the public-duty doctrine applies when an officer\u2019s affirmative misconduct causes harm. This inquiry is different from the question whether, under the common law, the officer was liable for misfeasance and whether MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107) definitively sets forth the parameters for such a cause of action against police officers, <em>post </em>at 353-355 (Levin, J.). The facts of this case do not require us to resolve whether the public-duty doctrine should be applied to insulate government agents who have assumed a duty and whose affirmative misconduct causes harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">This case is before us on a motion for summary disposition brought pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(8). Under the rule, summary disposition is granted if the claim is so clearly unenforceable as a matter of law that no factual development could possibly justify recovery. Plaintiff\u2019s claim is tested by the pleadings alone, and all factual allegations contained in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>complaint must be accepted as true. <em>Simko v Blake, </em>448 Mich 648, 654; 532 NW2d 842 (1995). In this case, plaintiffs factual allegations in the complaint are, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">Defendant] ] Detroit Police Officers[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] . . . arrived upon the scene and were met by . . . decedent\u2019s neighbors who explained that [decedent] was in apartment #203, that she had been screaming for help and that they witnessed her being attacked through her bathroom window.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">. . . That Defendant Police Officers, after taking down the witnesses\u2019 names, simply circled the building and left without ever attempting to knock on . . . decedent\u2019s apartment door, or make any attempt to contact . . . decedent or determine if, in fact, she was being or had been attacked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">That . . . decedent died . . . three hours and twenty minutes after Defendant! ] Detroit Police Officers had arrived on the scene and failed to take action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">Plaintiff alleged in the complaint that this inaction by defendant police officers was grossly negligent, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-10\">In Defendants [sic], Detroit Police Officers, failing to attempt to ascertain . . . decedent\u2019s condition, or to render assistance in any way whatsoever when at the scene, and having been informed that . . . decedent had been under attack in her apartment shortly before their arrival;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-12\">In Defendant officers [sic] negligently failing to take any actions whatsoever to render assistance to . . . decedent after being apprised that there was a woman, in an identi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>fied apartment, screaming for help because her husband was about to kill her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Clearly, plaintiff is not alleging that defendant Beasley\u2019s affirmative actions caused the harm. Rather, plaintiff asserts that his inaction \u2014 his failure to render assistance \u2014 led to the harm. This is a crucial difference. As we stated in <em>Williams v Cunningham Drug Stores, Inc, </em>429 Mich 495, 498-499; 418 NW2d 381 (1988):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">In determining standards of conduct in the area of negligence, the courts have made a distinction between misfeasance, or active misconduct causing personal injury, and nonfeasance, which is passive inaction or the failure to actively protect others from harm. The common law has been slow in recognizing liability for nonfeasance because the courts are reluctant to force persons to help one another and because such conduct does not create a new risk of harm to a potential plaintiff. Thus, as a general rule, there is no duty that obligates one person to aid or protect another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Thus, the Court in <em>Williams </em>concluded that for a person to be liable for nonfeasance, there must be a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d that imposes a duty to protect the other. 429 Mich 499. Although the issue in <em>Williams </em>involved a private citizen\u2019s failure to prevent a criminal assault, the Court\u2019s observation applies here. Neither police officers nor private citizens have a duty to rescue at common law. Prosser &amp; Keeton, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 56, pp 373 ff. Where liability has been imposed for nonfeasance, it has been on the basis of recognizing an affirmative duty to act based on a special relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 373. An allegation that an officer failed to rescue someone in danger is a charge that an officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>has not fulfilled a sworn duty as an officer. MCL 752.11; MSA 28.746(101). However, as Justice Cavanagh correctly observes, executive decisions regarding use of resources in protection of the general public is of such overarching public importance that declining to impose an affirmative duty under this aspect of the public-duty doctrine continues to serve a vital social purpose. Whether to apply the public-duty doctrine where active misconduct causes a person\u2019s injury, however, is a more difficult question.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Review of the special-relationship test found in <em>Cuffy v City of New York </em>and adopted by this Court today, suggests that it is meant to apply only in cases of nonfeasance. <em>Cuffy </em>explains that its special-relationship test is an exception to the general rule that \u201ca municipality may not be held liable for injuries resulting from a simple <em>failure to provide </em>police protection . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 260 (emphasis added). The test allows liability to be imposed on a municipality in the narrow circumstance where there is direct contact between a citizen and an officer, an officer assumes an affirmative duty to act, knows that inaction could lead to harm, and the citizen justifiably relies on the officer\u2019s affirmative undertaking. The test, by its own terms, can only be applied in an instance where the officer failed to carry out a promise or an assumed duty to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">This case, of course, does not involve active misfeasance. At most, defendant Beasley\u2019s passive inaction could be said to be inconsistent with his duty to prevent crime or to provide police protection. While the result in this case is harsh, a contrary result could lead to officers arresting (and detaining) all persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>who might conceivably jeopardize a foreseeable plaintiff. Because the specific holding of the lead opinion strikes the appropriate public policy balance, I agree that the public-duty doctrine applies. I also agree that plaintiffs complaint fails to satisfy the <em>Cuffy </em>special-relationship test. While the line between nonfeasance and misfeasance is admittedly imprecise, I would explicitly hold that we do not decide the question of the applicability of the public-duty doctrine to affirmative misconduct.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-7\"> 69 NY2d 255; 505 NE2d 937 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b477-13\"> Two police officers were named as defendants in the complaint; the only police officer before this Court, however, is defendant Beasley.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b480-5\">Cavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahp\"><em>(concurring in part and dissenting in part). </em>I agree with the lead opinion that the public-duty doctrine serves a useful function and should be continued. However, I dissent from the lead opinion\u2019s definition of the special-relationship exception to the public-duty doctrine. I would also limit the scope of this opinion to only those cases in which liability is alleged on the basis of the police officer\u2019s failure to protect an individual from the actions of a <em>third party. </em>This case should have no bearing in . a case involving an injury caused by the police officer\u2019s own actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The \u201cduty to provide police protection ... is vested in the government by constitution and statute.\u201d <em>Williams v Cunningham Drug Stores, Inc, </em>429 Mich 495, 501; 418 NW2d 381 (1988). The Legislature has provided that government officers and employees are immune from tort liability while engaged in governmental functions if they are acting or reasonably believe they are acting within the scope of their authority and their conduct falls short of gross negligence. MCL 691.1407(2); MSA 3.996(107)(2). However, before reaching any issue of breach, causation, or damages, the first question in any negligence action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>involves duty. \u201cDuty exists because the relationship between the parties gives rise to a legal obligation.\u201d <em>Bertrand v Alan Ford, Inc, </em>449 Mich 606, 614; 537 NW2d 185 (1995), citing <em>Moning v Alfono, </em>400 Mich 425, 438-439; 254 NW2d 759 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The public-duty doctrine begins with the premise that police officers<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> owe a duty to the public to investigate crime and to protect the citizenry <em>because </em>they are police officers. Further, the public-duty doctrine recognizes that police officers and their departments must make discretionary or policy decisions in order to carry out the duties imposed on them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For instance, a police station may receive several distress calls at once, and, because of limited resources, must assign a priority to those calls. The legal tort system is ill-equipped to second-guess a discretionary decision to prioritize calls in order of perceived need and availability of officers to respond. Evaluations of the propriety of decisions such as budgetary items, training, equipment, procedures, and response techniques, are best left to the other branches of government. <em>Cuffy v City of New York, </em>69 NY2d 255, 260; 513 NYS2d 372; 505 NE2d 937 (1987) (\u201ca municipality\u2019s provision of police protection to its citizenry has long been regarded as a resource-allocating function that is better left to the discretion of the policy makers\u201d). Accordingly, the public-duty doctrine precludes bas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>ing tort liability solely on the obligations owed by police officers to the public <em>at large.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Nevertheless, the special-relationship exception to the public-duty doctrine is based on the recognition that there are situations in which discretionary or policy decisions are no longer at issue because the decision to assist a particular individual has already been made. The issue then becomes whether the police officer\u2019s connection to a particular individual has created an actionable special and identifiable obligation to render assistance to that individual. Indeed, the common theme underlying all the various definitions of special relationship explored by the lead opinion is an attempt to test the validity of this connection. When the connection is strong enough so that a relationship between the police officer and the victim arises that is distinct from the relationship between the police officer and the public at large, the courts will impose a special duty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, I believe that the <em>Cuffy </em>test adopted by the lead opinion places unfair obstacles before the potential plaintiffs who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>were the most helpless and the victims of crime most at risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The <em>Cuffy </em>test requires two primary elements: direct contact and justifiable reliance. I agree that the \u201ccontact\u201d element serves a useful function in most situations. In order for tort liability to attach to a grossly negligent response to the plaintiff\u2019s peril, the police officer first must have been made aware that the victim may have been in peril. This would normally be accomplished through a call for assistance. However, I would not require the victim himself to have placed the call. Such a rule results in a perverse sliding scale where the more helpless the victim, the more likely that the officer can act, or fail to act, with impunity. For instance, a kidnapping victim should not be denied tort damages <em>solely </em>because he could not personally dial 911. Accordingly, I would eliminate the adjective \u201cdirect.\u201d I would hold that in order to establish the contact element of the special-relationship exception, the plaintiff would have to prove that he, or someone on his behalf, contacted the police.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Here, the victim allegedly called out to her neighbors to call the police, and they did so, <em>on her behalf </em>I would hold that the contact element has been sufficiently established in the plaintiff\u2019s pleadings to survive summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">My more serious disagreement with the <em>Cuffy </em>test is with the \u201creliance\u201d element. Although the \u201cjustifiable reliance\u201d requirement may work satisfactorily with respect to an obligation to protect an individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>from <em>future </em>harm, when strictly applied to crimes in progress, it can lead to harsh and seemingly unjust results. The <em>Cuffy </em>test leads to an odd unjust result where the victim <em>least </em>able to help himself, that is, least able to change the course of his actions, is the one <em>least </em>able to \u201crely\u201d on the police officer\u2019s obligation to help him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Instead, I believe that the special-relationship test should flow from the time-honored and fundamental tort principle that people owe a duty to foreseeable plaintiffs. I believe that a foreseeable-plaintiff requirement would make a more logical, flexible, and workable solution to situations where the crime was already in progress at the time the police were contacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">In such circumstances, I would hold that the plaintiff would have to prove that he was an identifiable foreseeable victim of a crime in progress by establishing the following elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">(1) the officer actually arrived on the scene;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">(2) the officer knew or should have known that an identifiable crime was in progress and that the plaintiff was or would be an identifiable victim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">(3) the officer should have reasonably foreseen that the identifiable victim would suffer further bodily harm if the officer did not intervene;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-9\">(4) the officer had the resources available on the scene to render assistance; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>(5) the officer\u2019s intervention could have changed the outcome.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">In such a case, the officer should owe a duty actionable in tort to the identifiable foreseeable victim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The justifiable reliance requirement is not all that different, and I would not oppose its use as an <em>alternative </em>theory. \u201cJustifiable\u201d implies that the police officer made a promise to the individual to protect him from some harm, which the police officer should reasonably have foreseen would have led to reliance. Reliance in turn means that the individual altered his course of action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The promise that led to justifiable reliance was no longer a policy or discretionary consideration whether or when to respond to the individual\u2019s request for assistance because the decision to respond to the individual had already been made. At that point, it became an actionable special duty to the individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Similarly, when the police officer arrives at the scene of a crime in progress, there is no longer at issue a generalized discretionary or policy decision whether or when to respond to a call for assistance. The police officer <em>has </em>responded. At that point, the police officer faces a ministerial obligation to perform his police officer\u2019s duty to protect <em>this </em>victim, who is in peril from <em>this </em>crime in progress, by using the specialized training and resources available to him as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>police officer. If intervention could alter the outcome and prevent further bodily harm to the victim, then I believe that the police officer should have a special duty to this foreseeable identifiable victim that is actionable in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Here, the plaintiff has alleged that Officer Beasley arrived at the scene and was informed by neighbors that they had seen and heard Phoebe Obleton being attacked by her husband. The plaintiff has further alleged that, as a result of Officer Beasley\u2019s failure to perform his duties, the victim sustained severe stab wounds that caused her death more than three hours later. I would hold that the plaintiff has pleaded sufficient facts to establish that defendant Beasley owed a special duty to the plaintiff to survive the MCR 2.116(C)(8) motion for summary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">I note that in order to succeed at trial, the plaintiff would still have to prove all these allegations and further would have to prove that the police officer\u2019s actions were grossly negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b486-8\">Mallett, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-6\"> Although I am limiting the focus of my opinion to police officers, I believe that it would similarly apply to fire fighters, life guards, and similar governmental safety professionals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b481-7\"> The Legislature has disregarded any distinction between discretionary or ministerial acts with respect to the tort liability of governmental individuals.

The Court declared that lower level officials, employees and agents were immune only when they were</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>1) acting during the course of their employment and acting, or reasonably believe they are acting, within the scope of their authority;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">2) acting in good faith; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">3) <em>performing discretionary, as opposed to ministerial acts.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">Under this test, no individual immunity exists for <em>ultra vires </em>activities.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">The Court then proceeded to define \u201cdiscretionary\u201d and \u201cministerial acts,\u201d adding for clarity \u201cthe word \u2018decisional,\u2019 \u201d so the operative term would be \u201cdiscretionary-decisional\u201d acts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">Within a year and a half, the Legislature responded to <em>Ross </em>with the enactment of 1986 PA 175. The House Legislative Analysis observed that the statute dealt with in <em>Ross </em>did not address officer-employee immunity, but traditionally those \u201cindividuals have been absolutely immune from tort liability when engaged in discretionary, as opposed to ministerial, acts within the scope of their authority.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The House Analysis continued that \u201c[t]wo 1979 Michigan Supreme Court decisions, however [undoubtedly <em>Bush v Oscoda </em>and <em>Lockaby v Wayne Co], </em>confused the issue by tending to define individual immunity with respect to <em>'governmental function,\u2019 i.e., whether the individual was performing primarily discretion</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number><em>ary activities that were of the essence to </em>government,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The analysis further continued that the 1986 legislation would define governmental function as it was defined in <em>Ross,</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and would eliminate the discretionary-ministerial distinction, providing expressly that <em>\u201cwithout regard to the discretionary or ministerial nature of the conduct in question\u201d </em>(emphasis added), a governmental employee would be immune if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">(a) He or she is acting or reasonably believes he or she is acting within the scope of his or her authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">(b) The governmental agency is engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">(c) The officer\u2019s, employee\u2019s, member\u2019s, or volunteer\u2019s conduct does not amount to gross negligence that is the proximate cause of the injury or damage.

Since only rarely does a statute expressly provide for tort liability, the lead opinion could stop there and direct that plaintiffs complaint be dismissed. There is no need to incorporate the public-duty or special relationship doctrines for police officers, and potentially for other governmental employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">The majority states that \u201cthe public-duty doctrine is a doctrine of tort law.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Whether labeled a doctrine of tort law, or a doctrine of governmental immunity, or a revelation, it is a common-law creation of this Court that provides police officers with de facto immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>The statute sets July 1, 1965, as the date as of which common-law immunity is to be determined.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> If this Court were free to continue to engage in so-called common-law development of tort law \u2014 for governmental liability and immunity purposes only\u2014 plaintiffs might someday argue for this Court to readopt its position in <em>Pittman v City of Taylor, </em>398 Mich 41; 247 NW2d 512 (1976), where this Court abrogated common-law immunity. Section 7(1) indicates the Legislature\u2019s intent to halt common-law development after July 1, 1965. The majority assumes the power to create another layer of immunity, in the guise of a tort law doctrine, for which there was no precedent in 1965.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">The legislative intent expressed in subsection 7(1) is clear: the courts are not to continue to write governmental immunity law, whether under one label or another.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The signers of the lead opinion err in asserting that 1986 PA 175 \u201cis consistent with\u201d their expansion of governmental immunity.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The lead opinion\u2019s error is highlighted in its footnote 9, where it states that \u00a7 7(1) would actually compel this Court to recognize the doctrine \u201cto the extent that the doctrine shields the state from liability.\u201d The 1986 act supplanted <em>Ross </em>and other decisions after July 1, 1965. The public-duty doctrine had not been adopted in any reported appellate judicial opinion in this state before July 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>1965. Subsection 7(1) is not a mandate to this Court to adopt all mechanisms that shield the state from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Before the 1986 amendments, <em>Ross </em>established the common-law liability of lower level governmental employees by providing immunity for all acts that were discretionary-decisional, while providing for liability when a ministerial-operational function was performed negligently.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The 1986 legislation changed the law of immunity by <em>increasing </em>the immunity of lower level employees for ministerial acts, allowing liability only when the conduct constituted gross negligence, rather than simple negligence. At the same time, however, the act <em>decreased </em>immunity by allowing liability to attach for grossly negligent discretionarydecisional actions, actions that had previously been completely immune from liability (absent exceptions not relevant here, such as intentionally tortious acts). This is the only reading of 1986 PA 175 that gives full effect to the abolition of the discretionary/ministerial distinction and the establishment of gross negligence as the standard of care.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>The lead opinion argues \u201cthat the dangerous work environment inherent in police activities is a counterbalancing concern\u201d when deciding whether the public-duty doctrine should be adopted.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This is the same reason this Court advanced in the <em>Zavala </em>segment of <em>Ross </em>to justify insulating the officers involved on the basis of the discretionary nature of their inaction.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">vi</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The lead opinion states that the question presented is whether \u201cthe public-duty doctrine should <em>still </em>be recognized in Michigan,\u201d and \u201cconclude[s] that the public-duty doctrine <em>remains </em>valid in Michigan.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The concurring-dissenting opinion similarly asserts that the public-duty doctrine \u201cshould be continued,.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) When so asserting, neither opinion discusses prior Michigan case law, nor does either opinion state when, before the 1986 legislation was enacted, the public-duty doctrine was adopted.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\"><em>Ross </em>was one of nine cases consolidated on appeal, decided in one opinion entitled <em>Ross v Consumers Power Co (On </em>Rehearing). In one of the cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number><em>Zavala v Zinser, </em>123 Mich App 352; 333 NW2d 278 (1983), a divided Court of Appeals dismissed an action against police officers on the basis of the public-duty doctrine.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">This Court expressly declined in <em>Ross </em>to decide whether to adopt the public-duty doctrine,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and ruled that summary judgment was properly granted, dismissing the action against the police officers, because the \u201cplaintiffs merely alleged negligent performance of a discretionary-decisional act . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The Court thus predicated affirmance of the Court of Appeals decision on the discretionary-ministerial distinction, not on the public-duty doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The lead opinion, in holding that the public-duty doctrine applies in Michigan, quotes Justice Cooley\u2019s description of the public-duty doctrine in his treatise on the law of torts.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Justice Cooley\u2019s treatise, as edited in the 4th edition, cited one Michigan case, his opinion for the Court in <em>Moss v Cummings, </em>44 Mich 359; 6 NW 843 (1880). There, a tax assessor was alleged to have undervalued property in his jurisdiction. Landowners sued for recovery of taxes they had paid on the theory that the assessor\u2019s undervaluation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>was illegal and therefore any tax collection was void. This Court rejected the landowner\u2019s claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">The failure to perform a public duty can constitute an individual wrong only when some person can show that in the public duty was involved also a duty to himself as an individual, and that he has suffered a special and peculiar injury by reason of its nonperformance. <em>[Id. </em>at 360-361.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The Court observed, however, that <em>an action would lie </em>for overvaluation of the property: \u201cWe have held that the collection of the tax levy might be restrained in such a case, so far, at least, as it was excessive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Thus, if the plaintiff could show injury, such as a landowner whose property was overvalued, an action would lie even though the tax assessor\u2019s duty was to the public at large.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>Moss v Cummings </em>was essentially a standing, not a public-duty, case.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">This becomes even clearer upon consideration of <em>Raynsford v Phelps, </em>43 Mich 342; 5 NW 403 (1880), decided shortly before <em>Moss v Cummings </em>was decided. There Justice Cooley, again writing for the Court, declared that an action could be maintained against a tax collector who had negligently allowed a tax lien to attach to a parcel of real estate, forcing the mortgage holder to redeem the property at a tax sale. The mortgagee sought to collect his damages, with the tax collector arguing that he owed no duty to individuals. This Court held that an action could be maintained because there was a <em>special injury.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>It is <em>immaterial </em>that the duty is one primarily imposed on public grounds, and therefore <em>primarily a duty owing to the public: </em>the right of action springs from the fact that the private individual receives a special and peculiar injury from the neglect in performance, which it was in part the purpose of the law to protect him against.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">[The plaintiff] has a right to understand that the officer is commissioned by the law to act only with due respect to the rights of individuals, and that if he acts otherwise and causes special injury, he disobeys his commission and is not within the protection the commission might otherwise give. <em>[Id., </em>pp 345-346 (emphasis added).][<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">More recently, at a time when this Court was composed of the same persons who composed the Court when <em>Ross </em>was decided,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> this Court decided <em>Fiser v City of Ann Arbor, </em>417 Mich 461; 339 NW2d 413 (1983), holding that an action could be maintained against police officers for their negligence in a high speed chase that caused the suspect to crash into the plaintiffs vehicle.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The Court found a specific duty under general statutes regulating police conduct on the roadways that the defendants had claimed was a \u201cduty they owe to the public.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 470.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Section 5 of the governmental tort liability act,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> providing that <em>governmental agencies </em>are subject to liability for the negligent operation of a motor vehicle by an officer, agent, or employee, was involved.

Under the circumstance that the issue has been briefed, this Court should review 1986 PA 175 to determine if a public-duty doctrine is consistent with the 1986 amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">The Legislature has created a comprehensive scheme of tort liability for governmental employees, including providing immunity to employees if they meet all the criteria listed in subsections a, b, and c. (See n 36.) If these criteria are not met, the statute allows a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>The majority adds an additional prong to the test: At least in the case of police officers, and possibly others, even if they fail to meet the criteria of \u00a7 7(2), there will still be immunity if the officer\u2019s responsibility is characterized as a duty to the public at large and the conduct alleged did not establish a judicially created and defined \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the victim and the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">These additional requirements are not required to save the statute from constitutional infirmity, nor are they a reasonable construction of the text.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The public-duty doctrine is a judicial creation that engrafts additional requirements inconsistent with the language chosen by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The reasons advanced by the majority for adopting the public-duty doctrine are policy judgments that the Legislature was able to review when it enacted \u00a7 7(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The Legislature has provided what it determined to be sufficient protection for all governmental employees by requiring a showing of gross negligence. If police officers require additional protection, the policy arguments contained in the majority opinion will serve them well. In a court of law, those arguments should not.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">While this Court has held that exceptions to the statutory immunity are to be strictly construed, it is not this Court\u2019s role to <em>eliminate </em>causes of action the Legislature has granted, nor is it our role to protect the government from suits. Our obligation is to construe the statutory provisions involved, including eval<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>uating common-law doctrines that might or might not have been adopted before the enactment of these statutory provisions, and determine if they are consistent with the legislative enactment.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The public-duty doctrine, as articulated by the majority in separate opinions, serves to shield the government from liability despite grossly negligent conduct by its employees, in contravention of the Legislature\u2019s decision to limit immunity and provide for liability for gross negligence. As stated by the Alaska Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">[W]e consider that the \u201cduty to all, duty to no-one\u201d doctrine is in reality a form of sovereign immunity, which is a matter dealt with by statute in Alaska, and not to be amplified by court-created doctrine. <em>[Adams v State, </em>555 P2d 235, 241 (Alas, 1976).[<footnotemark>39</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>The police have a duty under state law and the Charter of the City of Detroit to protect the public and to perform their jobs with due care.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> These legislative pronouncements state a police officer\u2019s duty in mandatory terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The Legislature has thus created the cause of action for breach of a policeman\u2019s duty. I do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>argue for creation of a common-law duty, but merely recognition of the statutory duty the Legislature has imposed on police officers.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Section 7(2) does not define the scope of a governmental employee\u2019s duty. That duty is expressed in the enactments of the Legislature and in the Detroit City Charter, the very same provisions of law relied on to define \u201cgovernmental function,\u201d which, under <em>Ross, </em>as codified in the 1986 legislation, immunizes the City of Detroit from liability.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The elimination of the pre-1986 discretionary-ministerial distinction evidences a legislative intent to avoid the inquiry otherwise necessary to determine whether a duty is owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Moreover, the 1986 legislation defines the duty pursuant to which a governmental employee is subject to liability. Section 7(2) (c) provides immunity to a governmental employee whose \u201cconduct does not amount to gross negligence,\u201d <em>when </em>the governmental agency for whom the governmental employee is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>working \u201cis engaged in the exercise or discharge of a <em>governmental function\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\"><em>Governmental function </em>is defined as \u201can activity which is expressly or impliedly mandated or authorized by constitution, statute, local charter or ordinance, or other law.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The combining in \u00a7 7(2) of these factors, all of which must be met, for there to be immunity, obliges this Court to find grossly negligent conduct to be actionable when an employee is engaged in a governmental function, because, if the employee were not so engaged, there would be no immunity, the gross negligence standard would not apply, and then the officer would be subject to personal liability for ordinary negligence. Because defendant officers were engaged in a governmental function, the scope of their duty is determined by the scope of the governmental function in which they were engaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Many duties recognized in tort are \u201cpublic\u201d in that the duty does not specifically run to one person or group of persons. Motorists driving on Michigan roadways owe a duty to all drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and property owners (i.e., the public generally) to operate their vehicles with due care. While a driver may only be sued for breach of this duty by someone injured because of the breach, the duty is not a limited one running only from the motorist to the victim.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Because a breach by a person who is not a governmental employee of a duty owed to the general public is actionable by one private citizen against the other, it is apparent that merely because a particular duty may be owed to the general public does not justify the conclusion that the breach is not actionable. The emptiness of the concept that a duty to all is a duty to none, or at least not actionable by anyone once characterized as a \u201cpublic duty,\u201d emphasizes that the majority\u2019s conclusion is another ipse dixit resurrecting sovereign immunity under another name.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The lead opinion contends that \u201cthe public-duty doctrine serves a useful purpose by protecting governments from unreasonable interference with policy decisions.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The concurring-dissenting opinion similarly argues: \u201cThe legal tort system is ill-equipped to second-guess a discretionary decision.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The majority\u2019s analysis is rooted in a mistrust of the legal system, so stated in the opinions of the majority, who fear liability will be imposed because of inappropriate second-guessing by juries of what police officers should have done in a particular circumstance.
