Before trial defendant filed a motion to proceed in propria persona.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After careful examination of defendant pursuant to MCR 6.005(D),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the court granted his motion to represent himself and appointed an attorney to assist him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of two of the three initial counts. Immediately following this verdict, the court proceeded to address the habitual offender charge.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\"><em>The Court </em>Okay. Apparently, at this point, the only choice, Mr. Lane, would either be to admit to the prior convictions. Do you have a copy of the information in front of you or one available?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">I\u2019ll just go through them very briefly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-9\">Do you know what you wish to do, regarding those allegations, at this point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-10\"><em>Mr Lane: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-11\"><em>The Court: </em>And that would be, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-12\"><em>Mr. Lane: </em>Go to trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-13\"><em>The Court: </em>Okay. At that, we will have the jury brought back in, and we will proceed to trial on that issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-14\">Following the trial of the habitual offender charge, the defendant was found guilty of being an habitual offender, fourth offense. Over 3V2 months later, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>defendant was sentenced by the court to three concurrent prison terms of forty to 180 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Defendant appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed defendant\u2019s convictions, holding that the court\u2019s failure to comply with MCR 6.005(E) at the habitual offender trial and the sentencing hearing did not require reversal because \u201clegal counsel was available to defendant in an advisory capacity during all the proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">This Court granted leave to appeal<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> limited to the issue whether the trial court committed error requiring reversal in failing to comply with MCR 6.005(E) before the habitual offender trial and sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">We first address what must be done at subsequent proceedings to comply with the court rule. MCR 6.005(E) requires only that the record show that the court advised the defendant of the right to an attorney and informed the defendant that an attorney would be appointed for him if the defendant were indigent, and that defendant either waived the right to counsel or requested a lawyer. In most circumstances, these requirements would be adequately met by the judge telling the defendant that in the upcoming proceeding he has the right to an attorney, at public expense if necessary, and asking the defendant whether he wishes to have an attorney or to continue to represent himself. If, in the judge\u2019s opinion, the defendant no longer clearly understands the options afforded to him, and the disadvantages of each, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>judge should once again engage in the extensive <em>Anderson </em>litany<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> before obtaining either a valid waiver or a request for counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The people concede that before both the habitual offender trial and the sentencing hearing the trial court did not comply with MCR 6.005(E). The court did not explicitly advise the defendant on the record of his right to a lawyer\u2019s assistance, nor did it determine if defendant still waived that right. The question now becomes whether these errors require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Initially, we note that the Court of Appeals reasoning, that remand was not required because defendant had legal counsel available to him in an advisory capacity during the proceedings, is erroneous. The presence of standby counsel does not legitimize a waiver-of-counsel inquiry that does not comport with legal standards. The presence of standby counsel is not recognized as an exception to the <em>Anderson </em>or court rule requirements. <em>People v Dennany, </em>445 Mich 412, 416; 519 NW2d 128 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The Court of Appeals made this same error in <em>People v Riley, </em>156 Mich App 396, 401; 401 NW2d 875 (1986). In that case defendant argued on appeal that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>\u201cthe trial court erred by not informing him at the arraignments, conference calls, or sentencing of his right to an attorney at public expense pursuant to . . . MCR 6.101(C).\u201d We overrule that portion of the opinion that held that when the court appointed advisory counsel for the defendant, that sufficed to inform him of his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The next question is what standard must be used to determine whether the court\u2019s failure to properly advise the defendant requires reversal. This Court has already held that failure to strictly adhere to the court rules in and of itself does not mandate reversal. See <em>Guilty Plea Cases, </em>395 Mich 96; 235 NW2d 96 (1975); <em>People v Dennany, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">In <em>Dennany, supra </em>at 439, this Court said that whether a particular departure from the court rules regulating the initial waiver justifies reversal depends on the nature of the noncompliance. Here, however, we are not dealing with an initial waiver and its attendant constitutional implications. No one has alleged that the waiver at subsequent proceedings is required by the Michigan or United States Constitutions. As Justice Boyle noted in her dissent in <em>Dennany, supra </em>at 464, \u201c[t]he requirement in MCR 6.005(E) that a trial court obtain a new waiver at every subsequent proceeding is neither compelled nor discussed by <em>Faretta [v California, </em>422 US 806; 95 S Ct 2525; 45 L Ed 2d 562 (1975)], <em>McKaskle [v Wiggins, </em>465 US 168; 104 S Ct 944; 79 L Ed 2d 122 (1984)], or <em>Anderson.\" </em>Thus, the standard of review for a subsequent waiver need not be the same as the review of an initial waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>We hold that the failure to comply with MCR 6.005(E) is to be treated as any other trial error. The procedure for reviewing unpreserved, nonconstitutional plain error is set forth in <em>People v Grant, </em>445 Mich 535; 520 NW2d 123 (1994).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under that standard, a plain, unpreserved error may not be considered by an appellate court for the first time on appeal unless the error could have been decisive of the outcome or unless it falls under the category of cases, yet to be clearly defined, where prejudice is presumed or reversal automatic. <em>Grant, </em>p 553. It is clear that this case does not fall into the latter category, and we need only decide if the error affected defendant\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">HABITUAL OFFENDER TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Review of the record of the trial and conviction of the habitual offender charge convinces us that, the court\u2019s failure to follow the court rule could not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>been decisive of the outcome. This trial took place immediately after defendant\u2019s trial on the assault charges. Not only is it implausible to think that defendant would have requested counsel, but defendant\u2019s doing so would not have affected the outcome of the trial. The charges were straightforward and the prior convictions clearly documented. No other result would have been possible, even with the assistance of counsel. We decline to review the merits of this assignment of error and affirm defendant\u2019s conviction of being an habitual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">SENTENCING hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">At the sentencing hearing, the court again failed to advise defendant of the right to counsel. We find that this omission could have been decisive of the outcome. The sentencing hearing took place <em>3\u00bd </em>months after the initial trial and waiver, and the record reflects defendant\u2019s obvious confusion and lack of preparation. Had defendant been advised of his right to counsel, he may well have availed himself of that opportunity, and this decision could have been decisive of the outcome. See <em>Grant, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">This now leads us into the area left unresolved by <em>Grant- </em>-what is the standard of reversal when the Court considers unpreserved, nonconstitutional error? We assume for purposes of the argument that the error in deviating from the court rule could have been decisive of the outcome under <em>Grant. </em>However, no argument has been advanced that the error was prejudicial. We conclude that the error was harmless under any standard because defendant has not alleged that the error has prejudiced him in any way, and affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>regarding the habitual offender sentence. At this time we do not address the standard for reversal of plain, unpreserved, nonconstitutional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">We affirm defendant\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n<judges id=\"b292-6\">Brickley, C.J., and Boyle, Riley, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-6\"> MCR 6.005(E) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Advice at Subsequent Proceedings. Even though a defendant has waived the assistance of a lawyer, the record of each subsequent proceeding (e.g., preliminary examination, arraignment, proceedings leading to possible revocation of youthful trainee status, hearings, trial or sentencing) must affirmatively show that the court advised the defendant of the right to a lawyer\u2019s assistance (at public expense if the defendant is indigent) and that the defendant waived that right. Before the court begins such proceedings,</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">(1) the defendant must reaffirm that a lawyer\u2019s assistance is not wanted; or</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">(2) if the defendant requests a lawyer and is financially unable to retain one, the court must appoint one; or</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">(3) if the defendant wants to retain a lawyer and has the financial ability to do so, the court must allow the defendant a reasonable opportunity to retain one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b284-11\"> This issue has never before been squarely before this Court. In <em>People v Dennany, </em>445 Mich 412, 416; 519 NW2d 128 (1994), this Court considered \u201cthe requisite judicial inquiry to be made before a criminal defendant who affirmatively seeks to proceed in propria persona may be permitted to waive his correlative right to counsel and represent himself.\u2019\u2019 Upon finding that the waiver had not been properly made, the Court held that \u201cWhere there is error but it is not one of complete omission of the court rule and <em>Anderson </em>requirements, reversal is not necessarily required. . . . Whether a particular departure justifies reversal \u2018will depend on the nature of the noncompliance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>p 439.

The trial court must make the defendant aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation. The defendant\u2019s competence is a pertinent consideration in making this determination. 3) The trial judge must determine that the defendant\u2019s acting as his own counsel will not disrupt, unduly inconvenience and burden the court and the administration of the court\u2019s business. <em>People v Anderson, </em>n 2 <em>supra, </em>pp 367-368.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b290-8\"> <em>People v Grant, supra, </em>adopted the three-step analysis set forth in <em>United States v Olano, </em>507 US 725, 732-734; 113 S Ct 1770; 123 L Ed 2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-9\">The first limitation on appellate authority under Rule 52(b) [plain, unpreserved error] is that there indeed be an \u201cerror.\u201d Deviation from a legal rule is \u201cerror\u201d unless the rule has been waived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-10\">* ** *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-11\">The second limitation on appellate authority under Rule 52(b) is that the error be \u201cplain.\u201d \u201cPlain\u201d is synonymous with \u201cclear\u201d or, equivalently, \u201cobvious.\u201d . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-12\">The third and final limitation on appellate authority ... is that the plain error \u201caffec[t] substantia] rights.\u201d This is the same language employed in Rule 52(a), and <em>in most cases it means that the error must have been prejudicial: It must have affected the outcome of the . . . proceedings. </em>[Emphasis added; citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">The first two elements have been met, so we only need address the third.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b292-7\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AhZ\"><em>{dissenting). </em>Where the issue is whether the accused waived his constitutional right to counsel, the burden is necessarily on the people, who assert that his conviction should be affirmed, to show that he duly waived his right to counsel. A defendant no more has a burden to object to the inadequacy of the judge\u2019s inquiry at a proceeding at which it is asserted that he waived his right to counsel, than he has a burden, at arraignment or at trial, to object to a failure to inform him of his right to, or to provide him with, counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">While the constitution may not require that a defendant who has waived his right to counsel be again informed of his right to counsel before sentencing, the court rule adopted by this Court imposes such a requirement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The purpose of the rule is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>again provide the defendant with an opportunity to request counsel even though he waived counsel at trial. The court rule recognizes that a defendant who, having represented himself at a trial that resulted in his conviction, might be more amenable to accepting counsel at the sentencing phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">A defendant who is not learned in the law is not likely to know that the judge, who is educated in the law, has failed to comply with the court rule in that he failed to inform the defendant once again of his right to the assistance of counsel. The court rule requiring that such information be again provided is designed to educate the defendant that, although he waived his right to counsel for the trial, he may ask for the assistance of counsel at the sentencing, and that, if he does so, such assistance will be provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Because the obligation to provide the information is imposed on the judge, and, without knowing that such an obligation is imposed on the judge, the unrepresented defendant would have no basis for objecting to the failure to provide such information, it is amazing that the majority imposes on the defendant the burden of showing that he was prejudiced by the failure to provide such information.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The majority, although it states that <em>People v Grant, </em>445 Mich 535; 520 NW2d 123 (1994), provides the standard for determining whether the judge\u2019s failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>to comply with the court rule requires reversal, avoids applying the standard, holding that Lane did not allege on appeal that the judge\u2019s error in failing to inquire whether he wished to have counsel prejudiced him in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Because this is the first case announcing that a defendant who has a right to counsel has the burden of showing that he was prejudiced by the failure to provide counsel, the Court should provide an opportunity for further briefing on the question whether the defendant was prejudiced. I am confident that it has never occurred to anyone before today that the defendant must, on appeal, recite the many ways in which the absence of counsel may have prejudiced him in order to preserve the issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">I agree that the absence of counsel, even if it were not duly waived, does not require a new trial in every case. On the issue whether Lane was an habitual offender, the jury would assuredly have convicted him even if Clarence Darrow were to return to defend him.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">But at the sentencing phase, it is apparent that counsel may very well have been of assistance to Lane, and that the failure to comply with the court rule and to advise him of his right to counsel may have affected the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">The transcript of the sentencing hearing shows, I agree with the majority, that Lane was confused and ill-prepared. The judge erroneously sentenced Lane to three consecutive terms for his convictions of assault and of being an habitual offender, MCL 769.13; MSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>28.1085, later corrected by the Court of Appeals. We should remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"AGk\">The majority states that the \u201cprocedure for reviewing unpreserved, nonconstitutional plain error is set forth in <em>People v Grant, </em>445 Mich 535; 520 NW2d 123 (1994).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">In <em>Grant, </em>the \u201cdefendant failed to preserve the error for appellate review.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 537. Defendant Grant was represented by counsel when this failure to preserve error for appellate review occurred. In the instant case, Lane was not represented by counsel when the Anderson<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>/court rule<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> required colloquy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>between the trial judge and Lane did not occur. If there was, as I would hold, error in failing to comply with <em>Anderson </em>and the court rule, it was neither Lane nor the prosecutor who introduced the error, but rather the judge who failed to comply with his obligations under <em>Anderson </em>and the court rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Imposing on a defendant who is not represented by counsel the burden of preserving for appellate review the judge\u2019s failure to comply with <em>Anderson </em>and the court rule concerning the inquiry that must precede a waiver of the right to counsel, and, upon the failure of the judge to do so, to declare that on appellate review the defendant has the burden, because he failed to preserve the issue, of showing that what occurred could have been decisive of the outcome is to ensure that in almost every case the judge\u2019s failure to do his duty will be protected from scrutiny at the appellate level.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">In <em>Grant, supra, </em>p 553, the' Court said that the \u201cdefendant failed to establish the form of prejudice necessary to preserve an issue that was not raised before the trial court.\u201d Where the question is whether the defendant waived his right to counsel at a hearing whereat he was not represented by counsel, any failure or lapse in the record is often of constitutional dimensions, and, to the extent it only concerns compliance with the court rule, still requires the record to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>show that the defendant voluntarily and knowingly waived his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">In <em>Brewer v Williams, </em>430 US 387, 404; 97 S Ct 1232; 51 L Ed 2d 424 (1977), the United States Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">The District Court and the Court of Appeals were also correct in their understanding of the proper standard to be applied in determining the question of waiver as a matter of federal constitutional law \u2014 that it was incumbent upon the State to prove \u201can intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u201d <em>Johnson v Zerbst, </em>304 US [458] 464 [58 S Ct 1019; 82 L Ed 1461; 146 ALR 357 (1938)]. That standard has been reiterated in many cases. We have said that the right to counsel does not depend upon a request by the defendant, <em>Carnley v Cochran, </em>369 US 506, 513 [82 S Ct 884; 8 L Ed 2d 70 (1962)]; cf. <em>Miranda v Arizona </em>[384 US 436, 471; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966) ], and that courts indulge in every reasonable presumption against waiver, e.g., <em>Brookhart v Janis </em>[384 US 1, 4; 86 S Ct 1245; 16 L Ed 2d 314 (1966)]; <em>Glasser v United States, </em>315 US 60, 70 [62 S Ct 457; 86 L Ed 680 (1942)]. This strict standard applies equally to an alleged waiver of the right to counsel whether at trial or at a critical stage of pretrial proceedings. <em>Schneckloth v Bustamonte, </em>412 US 218, 238-240 [93 S Ct 2041; 36 L Ed 2d 854 (1973)]; <em>United States v Wade </em>[388 US 218, 237; 87 S Ct 1926; 18 L Ed 2d 1149 (1967)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">The obligation to create a record showing waiver of the right to counsel is imposed on the judge, not on the defendant. It is extraordinary that the majority would impose the burden of objecting to the inadequacy of the record on the unrepresented defendant either by requiring contemporaneous objection or by holding that the burden is on the defendant on appellate review to show that he was prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>I would remand for resentencing, at which time defendant shall be represented by counsel if he so desires.</p>\n<judges id=\"b298-5\">Cavanagh, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-9\"> <em>Brewer v </em>Williams, 430 US 387, 404; 97 S Ct 1232; 51 L Ed 2d 424 (1977), quoted in part II.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b292-10\"> The rule in effect at the time this case was tried provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-11\">Advice at Subsequent Proceedings. Even though a defendant has waived the assistance of a lawyer, the record of each subsequent proceeding (e.g., preliminary examination, arraignment, proceedings leading to possible revocation of youthful trainee status, hearings, trial or <em>sentencing) </em>must affirmatively show that the court advised the defendant of the right to a lawyer\u2019s assistance (at public expense if the defendant is indigent) and that the defendant waived that right. Before the court begins such proceedings,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-12\">(1) the defendant must reaffirm that a lawyer\u2019s assistance is not wanted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-P\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>(2) if the defendant requests a lawyer and is financially unable to retain one, the court must appoint one; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnN\">(3) if the defendant wants to retain a lawyer and has the financial ability to do so, the court must allow the defendant a reasonable opportunity to retain one. [MCR 6.005(E) (emphasis added). The rule was amended October 23, 1995, effective January 1, 1996.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b295-8\"> Ante, p 140.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b295-9\"> First, the request must be unequivocal. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">Second, once the defendant has unequivocally declared his desire to proceed pro se the trial court must determine whether defendant is asserting his right knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily. <em>Faretta </em>[v <em>California, </em>422 US 806, 885; 95 S Ct 2525; 45 L Ed 2d 562 (1975)]; <em>[People v Holcomb, </em>395 Mich 326, 337; 235 NW2d 343 (1975)]. The trial court must make the pro se defendant aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so that the record will establish that he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open. <em>Id. </em>Defendant\u2019s competence is a pertinent consideration in making this determination. <em>Westbrook v Arizona, </em>384 US 150; 86 S Ct 1320; 16 L Ed 2d 429 (1966). But his competence does not refer to legal skills, \u201c[f]or his technical legal knowledge, as such, was not relevant to an assessment of his knowing exercise of the right to defend himself.\u201d <em>Faretta, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">The third and final requirement is that the trial judge determine that the defendant\u2019s acting as his own counsel will not disrupt, unduly inconvenience and burden the court and the administration of the court\u2019s business. <em>[People v Anderson, </em>398 Mich 361, 367-368; 247 NW2d 857 (1976).]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b295-12\"> If the court determines that the defendant is financially unable to retain a lawyer, it must promptly appoint a lawyer and promptly notify the lawyer of the appointment.
