J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4z\">The question presented concerns statutory coordination of weekly worker\u2019s compensation benefits with a lump sum paid to the employee pursuant to his election for early withdrawal, in full liquidation of his interest, from a pension or retirement program established or maintained by his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-13\">The statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides that the employer\u2019s obligation to remit weekly worker\u2019s compensation payments shall be reduced by the proportion of payments, \u201cwith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>respect to the same time period\u201d as the worker\u2019s compensation payment, from a pension or retirement program represented by the employer\u2019s contributions to the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">We conclude, in <em>Corbett </em>and <em>Dane, </em>that, when a lump sum is withdrawn early from a pension or retirement program, the weekly worker\u2019s compensation payment shall be reduced by an amount that will amortize, in equal weekly payments, the proportion of the after-tax amount of the lump sum contributed by the employer over the employee\u2019s life expectancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">We conclude in <em>White </em>that, when a lump sum is withdrawn early from a pension or retirement program and rolled over into an IRA, the employer is not entitled to an offset or reduction in the weekly worker\u2019s compensation payment therefor before the earlier of withdrawal from the IRA or the time when payments from the pension or retirement program would have been made had there not been early withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">We further conclude in <em>White </em>that defendant, McLouth Steel Products, is not entitled to a reduction in the weekly worker\u2019s compensation payment in respect to amounts paid by the Pension Benefit Guarantee Coiporation on account of the pension obligation to the plaintiff employee of the predecessor corporation, McLouth Steel Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">We conclude still further in <em>White </em>that the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission did not err in affirming the magistrate\u2019s finding of mental disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">Section 354 of the statute provides that where the weekly worker\u2019s compensation payment is \u201cwith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>respect to the same time period\u201d for which payments from a pension or retirement program are made, the weekly compensation payments shall be reduced by a proportional amount, based on the ratio of the employer\u2019s contributions to the total contributions to the program, of the after-tax amount of the pension or retirement payments being received by the employee pursuant to the program.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Section 354 was added in 1981<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to address the perceived problem of a retired worker receiving, \u201credundantly,\u201d both worker\u2019s compensation payments and other payments also funded by the employer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>354, thus, provides that fifty percent of old-age<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and disability insurance payments under the Social Security Act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the proportion of pension,

Corbett, the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board affirmed the magistrate\u2019s decision to coordinate over a one-year period by reducing the weekly compensation payment by 1/52 of the amount of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>lump sum attributable to the employer\u2019s contributions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">In <em>Dane, </em>the WCAC affirmed the magistrate\u2019s decision to coordinate by reducing the weekly compensation payment by the amount the employee would have received if he had used the lump sum to purchase an annuity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>In <em>White, </em>the employee rolled over the lump sum into an investment retirement account in a tax-free exchange and contended that there should not be any reduction in the weekly worker\u2019s compensation payment because he did not retain the lump sum and further receipt of benefits will be deferred until he withdraws money from the IRA. The wcac did not address the issue of coordination. The Court of Appeals agreed with the defendant employer, McLouth Steel Products, that the lump-sum payment was subject to coordination, but did not address the manner in which this should be accomplished.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>in</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Coordination of weekly worker\u2019s compensation payments with weekly, monthly, or other periodic payments from a pension or retirement program does not appear to have presented difficult issues of coordination of the amount by which a weekly worker\u2019s compensation payment is to be reduced. The instant cases, however, concern coordination with a lump sum paid at the employee\u2019s election for early withdrawal from the program before \u201cnormal\u201d retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">The plaintiff employee in <em>Corbett </em>contends that the weekly worker\u2019s compensation payment due in the week in which the lump sum was \u201creceived\u201d should be reduced in its entirety, but not below zero, and that there should be no reduction whatsoever in succeeding weeks.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He argues that it is only in the week that the lump sum is actually received that any amount is <em>\u201creceived </em>or being <em>received </em>by the employee\u201d pursuant to the pension or retirement program (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>The defendant employer in <em>Dane-, </em>and <em>White </em>contends that coordination should be accomplished by eliminating all weekly worker\u2019s compensation payments entirely until the sum of all weekly compensation payments so eliminated aggregate the amount of the lump sum withdrawn, whereupon the employer would be obliged to resume making weekly compensation payments.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">While the opening clauses of subsection 354(1) expressly refer to \u201cweekly or lump sum payments\u201d of worker\u2019s compensation benefits, there is no express reference to lump-sum payments of pension or retirement benefits. The Legislature was, however, aware of the possibility of \u201cearly or reduced pension or retirement benefits.\u201d Subsection 12 provides that an employee is not obliged to apply for early or reduced retirement benefits.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But it does not appear from this language whether the Legislature recognized the possibility of <em>lump-sum payment </em>of early or reduced pension or retirement benefits. In all events, the Legislature did not expressly provide for the manner of coordinating lump-sum payments on early withdrawal from a pension or retirement program.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Because the Legislature-provided no express guidance concerning statutory coordination of weekly worker\u2019s compensation benefits with a lump sum paid to the employee pursuant to his election of early withdrawal, we turn to a consideration of what would constitute the most appropriate construction of the statute. We approach this task in an effort to <em>\u201cdo, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>responsibly, fittingly, intelligently, with and within the given frame.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Worker\u2019s compensation benefits are social welfare wage-replacement benefits for workers whose injuries arise out of and in the course of their employment. Such benefits are normally paid weekly. The amount of the award is based on the injured worker\u2019s average weekly wage.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> These payments function as current wage replacement, and an award generally extends for the duration of the disability.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The statutory scheme includes an implicit assumption that the disability may continue over the employee\u2019s lifetime. In <em>Drouillard v Stroh Brewery Co, </em>449 Mich 293, 299; 563 NW2d 530 (1995), this Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">Worker\u2019s compensation is one unit in a loosely connected system of wage-loss protection that also includes unemployment compensation, social security old-age, disability, and survivors benefits, aid to families with dependent children, and general assistance. <em>Franks v White Pine Copper Div, </em>422 Mich 636, 654; 375 NW2d 715 (1985). Such wage-loss legislation is designed to restore to employees a portion of wages lost because of three major causes of wage loss: physical disability, unemployment, and old age. The crucial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>operative, fact is that of wage loss; the cause of the wage loss merely dictates the category of legislation applicable. See, generally, 4 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 97, p 18-9 (1995 Supp, p 106).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Retirement benefits are also elements of the compensation package, and employees work for years and sometimes an entire lifetime in partial consideration of anticipated retirement benefits. Retirement benefits are normally distributed monthly. Benefits are calculated and distributed in accordance with the retirement program and the retiree\u2019s life expectancy. Retirement plans generally provide for regular payments in a fixed amount to the retiree for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">We conclude, essentially agreeing with the plaintiff employee in <em>Dane </em>and the alternative contention of the employee in Corbett,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> that, where a lump sum is received on early withdrawal, weekly compensation payments should be reduced by an amount that will amortize,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> in equal weekly payments, the amount to be offset over the employee\u2019s life expectancy.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">We thus have also concluded, as has the Court of Appeals,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> that the Legislature did not intend to limit the reduction in the weekly compensation payment to only the week in which the lump sum is actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>\u201creceived.\u201d And we thus have also rejected the defendant employers\u2019 contention, at the other extreme, that the weekly compensation payment is to be eliminated entirely until the aggregate of the weekly compensation payments equals the lump sum withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">We are unpersuaded by the defendant employers\u2019 contention that we should disallow spreading the recoupment of the lump sum over the employees\u2019 life expectancy because defendant employers then may not recover the full amount of the offset as a result of either the employee recovering from his disability and returning to work or the employee\u2019s death.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">The defendant employers\u2019 argument ignores that \u00a7 354 provides that nothing in \u00a7 354 shall be \u201cconsidered to compel an employee to apply\u201d for \u201cearly or reduced pension or retirement benefits,\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>is only because of the fortuity of the employee electing early withdrawal that there is any employer claim under \u00a7 354 for early reduction, before normal retirement, of weekly worker\u2019s compensation payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">The paradigm case contemplated by the Legislature in addressing the \u201cretiree problem\u201d was weekly payments to a retired employee from a pension or retirement program funded by the employer redundant of weekly worker\u2019s compensation payments also funded by the employer.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Had the employees in the instant cases not elected early withdrawal, there would have been no amount to be offset before the employees\u2019 \u201cnormal\u201d retirement, at which time, if the pension or retirement benefit were payable over the employees\u2019 remaining lifetime, the offset would then for the first time become applicable to any weekly worker\u2019s compensation benefit then being payable. If the disabled employee had, before normal retirement, recovered from his disability, returned to work, or died, the employer would have been required to pay full worker\u2019s compensation benefits weekly until such recovery, return to work, or death without any reduction in respect to the accruing and potential pension and retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>The defendant employer in <em>Dane, </em>Stroh Brewery Company, contends that \u201cthere is only one method where the legislative objective would be attained with certainty in every case: that the after-tax amount of the pension be utilized as a future credit toward the employer\u2019s obligation to pay weekly benefits.\u201d The defendant employer in <em>White, </em>McLouth Steel Products, similarly argues.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The defendant employers, thus, would have this Court read into \u00a7 354 the concept set forth in subsection 827(5) of the act,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> concerning recoveries of damages from a third party. Subsection 827(5) provides that a third-party recovery shall first reimburse the employer for benefits previously paid under the act, and that the balance paid to the employee \u2014 much like the lump-sum early withdrawal from a pension or retirement program \u2014 \u201cshall be treated as an advance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>payment by the employer on account of any future payments of compensation benefits.\u201d The Legislature, thus, understands how to express the concept the defendant employers would have this Court read into the statute of treating an early lump-sum withdrawal as a future credit, cutting off all weekly payments of worker\u2019s compensation benefits until the amount of such future credit is exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">The concept of a future credit is inconsistent with the language of the statute, which contemplates offsetting against the weekly worker\u2019s compensation payment amounts \u201creceived or being received by the employee\u201d from the pension or retirement program \u201cwith respect to the same time period for which\u201d the weekly worker\u2019s compensation benefit is \u2022 payable. Clearly, the Legislature contemplated offsetting periodic payments from a pension or retirement program payable during \u201cnormal\u201d retirement of the employee, payments that would be \u201creceived\u201d by the employee \u201cwith respect to the same time period\u201d as the weekly worker\u2019s compensation payment. A lump-sum payment is not paid with respect to the same period as weekly worker\u2019s compensation benefits are paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Amortizing the lump-sum amount to be offset over the employee\u2019s life expectancy, parallels the offset of amounts received periodically from a pension and retirement program upon normal retirement, and will result in a periodic offset of the lump sum \u201cwith respect to the same time period\u201d as the weekly worker\u2019s compensation benefit is paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Similarly, we agree with the plaintiff employee in <em>White </em>that the defendant employer in that case is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>entitled to any offset or recoupment in respect to the lump sum withdrawn and immediately rolled over tax free into an IRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The defendant employer stresses that the lump sum was \u201creceived,\u201d the triggering event under the statute, and that \u00a7 354 does not provide for deferral of offset merely because the Internal Revenue Code permits a tax-free rollover into an IRA. This is the same literalism employed by the plaintiff employee in <em>Corbett, </em>who would limit the offset to the week in which the lump-sum payment is actually received, and which would deny an employer any offset because the lump-sum payment was not paid for any \u201ctime period,\u201d let alone \u201cwith respect to the same time period for which\u201d the weekly worker\u2019s compensation benefit is paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The early withdrawal in <em>White </em>was not made with the intention of using the proceeds for current needs or enjoyment. Early withdrawal protected the lump sum so withdrawn against the vicissitudes of the defendant McLouth Steel Products\u2019 business and the possible claims of other creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">In <em>Drouillard, supra </em>at 295, this Court held that this provision \u201cdoes not preclude coordination where an employee is required to accept early pension benefits.\u201d We did not address the question how benefits would be coordinated. On remand, the WCAC adopted coordination over the life expectancy of the retired worker.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Some of the Stroh employees rolled over a portion of the lump sum they were constrained to receive into an IRA account.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">It is asserted in <em>Corbett </em>that the plaintiff employee in that case acted without the advice of counsel, and without awareness that early withdrawal might reduce his worker\u2019s compensation benefit. Regardless of whether that is true, under the circumstance that the employee is under no obligation to reduce the employer\u2019s obligation to make weekly worker\u2019s compensation payments by electing early withdrawal, we see no reason why an employee who has elected early withdrawal should not, during the short sixty-day time for a tax-free rollover, be able to deny the employer the benefit of an offset in respect to the rolled over amount until such time as the employee would have been obliged to accept payment from the pension or retirement program had he not elected early withdrawal. This would, in almost every case, be far earlier than the calendar year in which the employee reaches seventy and one-half,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> when amounts deposited in an IRA must begin to be included in taxable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The defendant employer in <em>White </em>has set forth a parade of horribles that we have carefully examined and have concluded do not militate against the construction we have adopted. The reason why there are possible unresolved problems is simply because the Legislature did not expressly address the offset of lump-sum payments on early withdrawal, long before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>normal retirement, in the language employed by it in addressing the retiree problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">We note, however, that \u00a7 354 provides that an employee shall provide the employer with authority for release of information from the Social Security Administration.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In that spirit, the employee in <em>White </em>is obliged periodically, upon request of the employer, to furnish the employer with information showing whether there has been withdrawal from the ira, and to facilitate direct inquiry and verification by the employer of and from whoever is administering the IRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Our conclusion that such a tax-free rollover does not create any right in the defendant employer of offset or recoupment merely treats the employee in such a case in the same way as any other employee, entitled to worker\u2019s compensation benefits, who has a right to elect early withdrawal but chooses not to do so, in which event, under the express language of \u00a7 354, the employer is not entitled to any offset in respect to benefits that would be payable if the employee had elected early withdrawal.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">To be sure, the employee can subsequently opt for early and current use of the funds in an IRA, but, if he does so, the employer would henceforth be entitled to an offset the same as would occur whenever an employee who is injured defers, by declining early <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>withdrawal and later exercises rights of early withdrawal under a pension or retirement program.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">The construction that we adopt is consistent with the language of the statute, which provid\u00e9s for an offset \u201cof the <em>after-tax </em>amount of the pension or retirement payments received or being received by the employee . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) By reason of the tax-free aspect of a rollover into an ira, there is no taxable event and, hence, no tax or \u201cafter-tax amount\u201d that is \u201creceived or being received.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">There are two other issues in <em>White. </em>We now address defendant McLouth Steel Products\u2019 contention that it is entitled to a reduction in the weekly worker\u2019s compensation payment in respect to amounts paid by the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation on account of the pension obligation to the plaintiff employee of the predecessor corporation, McLouth Steel Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">McLouth Steel Products contends that for all practical purposes McLouth Steel Corporation was the same employer as McLouth Steel Products as exemplified by the \u2019 employee\u2019s rehiring by McLouth Steel Products on the same day his employment with McLouth Steel Corporation was terminated, and by the continuation of his seniority.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">We are unpersuaded. McLouth Steel Products is not the same employer as McLouth Steel Corporation, but a separate entity. Further, the retirement benefit was not received from McLouth Steel Corporation, but rather from Pension Guarantee Corporation, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>became obligated to make the payment following McLouth Steel Corporation\u2019s bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">vn</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">We turn to a consideration of defendant McLouth Steel Products\u2019 further contention in <em>White </em>that the wcac erred in affirming the magistrate\u2019s finding of mental disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">The magistrate found that White had proved by a preponderance of the evidence a mental disability arising out of and in the course of his employment. The wcac and the Court of Appeals affirmed.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">McLouth Steel contends that the magistrate, the wcac, and the Court of Appeals failed to follow this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gardner v Van Buren Public Schools, </em>445 Mich 23; 517 NW2d 1 (1994), where this Court construed, for the first time in the mental disability context, a 1980 amendment<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> of the worker\u2019s compensation act adding definitions<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and the limitation that mental disabilities are compensable only if \u201carising out of actual events of employment,\u201d and that mental disabilities and heart and cardiovascular conditions are only \u201ccompensable if contributed to or aggravated or accelerated by the employment in a significant manner.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>McLouth Steel asserts that the magistrate, the wcac, and the Court of Appeals erred in failing to consider White\u2019s predisposition to mental illness and his preexisting mental framework as a nonoccupational factor in determining whether the claimed mental disability was contributed to, aggravated, or accelerated by the employment in a significant manner. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">This Court, before <em>Gardner, </em>considered the 1980 amendment in the heart injury context, in <em>Farrington v Total Petroleum, </em>442 Mich 201, 216-217; 501 NW2d 76 (1993).

The Court said that \u201c[a]bsent an explicit legislative mandate, mental disabilities should not be treated differently,\u201d with the result that the inquiry is whether the claimant <em>\u201cregardless of preexisting conditions, </em>sustained an injury that arose out of and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>the course of employment.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 48-49.

However, by <em>focusing on the individual worker, as opposed to an average </em>worker, both the significant manner requirement and the actual events requirement also have substantial subjective elements. <em>[Id. </em>at 49-50 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">In conclusion, the Court, in <em>Gardner, </em>declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>It is, therefore, <em>irrelevant how a \u201creasonable\u201d person would react to the objectively established actual events. </em>The relevant inquiry, and the only inquiry presently required by worker\u2019s compensation law in this state, is: Did the actual events of employment occur, and do these bear a significant relationship to the mental disabilities? Reduced to its simplest form, the analysis is this: Given actual events and a particular claimant, with all the claimant\u2019s preexisting mental frailties, can the actual events objectively be said to have contributed to, aggravated, or accelerated the claimant\u2019s mental disability in a significant manner? <em>[Id. </em>at 50 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The magistrate found White to be a credible witness. White was informed by McLouth Steel in February, 1988, that his job as a storage foreman was being eliminated, and that he had the choice of being laid off or accepting a position as a masonry foreman.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">White was nervous about his responsibility as a masonry foreman for protecting the safety of his men because scaffolds and ladders were involved, and he knew nothing about such matters. He was depressed because he did not know his job. \u201cHe could not sleep at night, had diarrhea, and began to experience memory loss.\u201d Sometime after January 16, 1989, he was unable to work, and retired, but the symptoms continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">The magistrate further found that White\u2019s testimony was supported by the great weight of the credible medical testimony. An examining psychiatrist had diagnosed him as having a \u201cmajor affective disorder with depression. He also characterized plaintiff as an obsessive-compulsive personality and observed that he suffers from diarrhea and psychosocial stressors.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>The psychiatrist concluded that White was disabled and unable to return to his previous occupational duties.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The wcac, on remand from the Court of Appeals, following this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gardner, </em>declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">\u201cThe relevant inquiry, and the only inquiry presently required by workers\u2019 compensation law in this state, is: Did the actual events of employment occur, and do these bear a significant relationship to the mental disabilities?

Actual events occurred at the workplace; they were significant when compared to nonwork-related stressors; they can objectively be said to have contributed to, aggravated, or accelerated the claimant\u2019s mental disability in a significant manner. Furthermore, the Magistrate\u2019s conclusions of law need not be clarified or corrected. The Magistrate\u2019s decision awarding benefits is affirmed. [1994 Mich ACO 2680, 2683.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">McLouth Steel focuses on footnote seventeen of <em>Farrington </em>and the words \u201cprevious cardiac ailments or injuries, genetic predispositions,\u201d in contending that the magistrate, the wcac, and the Court of Appeals failed to accord sufficient consideration to White\u2019s predisposition to mental illness and his pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>existing mental framework \u2014 described as \u201can obsessive-compulsive personality\u201d type \u2014 rendering him unable to cope with ordinary changes or occurrences in bis work environment, as a nonoccupational factor in determining whether his claimed mental disability was contributed to, aggravated, or accelerated by the employment in a significant manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">We have already indicated that this Court ruled in <em>Gardner </em>that preexisting mental and physical frailties and conditions do not bar recovery. Footnote seventeen contemplated a comparison of a claimed heart injury with a prior cardiac ailment or injury and genetic predispositions. There is no evidence that White had psychiatric episodes before the disabling episode found by the magistrate to have arisen out of his employment. Nor is there evidence that he had a genetic predisposition to psychiatric episodes or injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The WCAC adverted to the correct passage in <em>Gardner </em>in directing its inquiry to the \u201cparticular claimant, with all of the claimant\u2019s preexisting mental frailties.\u201d The wcac\u2019s failure to identify, once again, and to restate what the magistrate had so clearly stated, recognizing White\u2019s underlying personality type, does not evidence a failure to consider the claimant\u2019s \u201cpreexisting mental frailties\u201d in deciding whether the work stimuli could objectively be said to have contributed to, aggravated, or accelerated the claimant\u2019s mental disability in a significant manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Finally, McLouth Steel complains that the magistrate, the wcac, and the Court of Appeals may have taken into consideration, as an actual event of employment, White\u2019s erroneous belief that he had lost his McLouth Steel pension, and his depression con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>ceming the changeover from McLouth Steel Corporation to McLouth Steel Products.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">McLouth Steel cites cases that hold that a mental injury arising from loss of employment cannot logically, arise out of and in the course of employment. But, assuming that the magistrate, the WCAC and the Court of Appeals relied on White\u2019s depression respecting the changeover, this case would not concern an actual loss of employment.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The question presented would then still be whether there was an actual event respecting the changeover.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">There clearly was, as a result of the downsizing of McLouth Steel, an actual event. White was constrained to accept a transfer from a job that he felt adequate in performing to one in which he felt inadequate. It was that actual event, the change in positions, from one in which he felt good about himself to one in which he did not, arising out of the downsizing, that was found to have resulted in mental disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The cases are remanded to the WCAC for further consideration consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b705-8\">Cavanagh, Boyle, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-14\"> MCL 418.354; MSA 17.237(354).

Its legal underpinning was the notion developed by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board, with some support from the judiciary . . ., that a retired worker, even one who had voluntarily retired and gone on a company-funded pension, could still be suffering from a loss of wage earning capacity. If the retiree could demonstrate that he or she had incurred a disability caused by pre-retirement job activity or working environment (a bad back from 30 years on the assembly line or a dust disease from 30 years in a foundry), the retiree was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation. It should be emphasized that in many of these cases the disability was undoubtedly genuine, at least in the physical impairment sense, and such an employee would unquestionably be eligible for medical benefits. The fighting issue was whether he was also entitled to recover for wage loss. <em>[Id. </em>at 60.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">In <em>Drouillard v Stroh Brewery Co, </em>449 Mich 293, ,299-301; 536 NW2d 530 (1995), this Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Because most social legislation in Michigan was implemented in unrelated fragments, failure to coordinate resulted in an accumulation of benefits. For example, before coordination, it was not unusual for an employee to collect both unemployment and worker\u2019s compensation benefits at the same time. However, if an employee undergoes a period of wage loss, it does not follow that he should receive multiple wage-loss benefits simultaneously.

Although I appreciate the difficulty in applying the language of \u00a7 354 to these cases, I do not believe that the majority is adequately faithful to the language and the intent of the statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, I do not agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Willis White\u2019s inability to work because of his affective disorder was \u201ccontributed to or aggravated or accelerated by the employment in a <em>significant </em>manner\u201d under MCL 418.301(2); MSA 17.237(301) (2). (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The statute provides that an \u201cemployer\u2019s obligation to pay or cause to be paid weekly [worker\u2019s compensation] benefits . . . [is] reduced\u201d by the after-tax amount of \u201cthe pension or retirement payments received,\u201d and this section is applicable for worker\u2019s compensation payments made during the \u201csame time period\u201d as when pension or retirement payments are received. See subsection 354(1) (d). There is only one method of coordination that fully comports with the language of the statute: coordinating the worker\u2019s compensation benefits for only that week in which the employee received the lump-sum pension payment. According to this interpretation, the employer would only reduce one week of worker\u2019s compensation payments. Although this interpretation fits the</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>plain meaning of the section, this Court should reject it because it would produce an absurd result by frustrating the undisputed purpose of the statute, i.e., to eliminate duplicate wage-loss payments while maintaining adequate wage-loss benefits for disabled workers. <em>Drouillard v Stroh Brewery Co, </em>449 Mich 293, 299-300; 536 NW2d 530 (1995).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Legislature could not have intended to coordinate a lump-sum pension payment with weekly payments of worker\u2019s compensation benefits, see <em>id. </em>at 298, 305, but simultaneously only intended to coordinate the double wage-loss income to that week in which the lump-sum pension payment was received. This would effectively nullify the purpose of the statute. Like the majority, I believe that we must avoid this understanding, despite the apparently clear language of the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Salas v Clements, </em>399 Mich 103, 109; 247 NW2d 889 (1976).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>After concluding that this approach was unworkable,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the majority adopts a life-expectancy approach because the \u201cLegislature contemplated offsetting periodic payments from a pension or retirement program payable during \u2018normal\u2019 retirement of the employee\u201d with respect to payments during the same period. <em>Ante </em>at 543. Although I agree that this was the expectation of the Legislature, I disagree that this allows the Court to adopt a life-expectancy approach where the statute does not establish, or refer to, a table to calculate an employee\u2019s life expectancy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Under the life-expectancy approach, the Court pretends that the employee is only receiving a small amount of his pension payment periodically, despite the fact that he has received the entire amount and may be spending it or may have placed it into another retirement account as a financial investment. Moreover, the employee who elects to receive his lump-sum pension payment while still relatively young will have only a tiny percentage of his pension payment coordinated with his worker\u2019s compensation payments. The facts of these cases illustrate this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Shawn Corbett was twenty-nine years old when he elected to cash out his pension fund to which his employer had contributed $10,975.93. According to defendant Plymouth Township\u2019s calculations of the life-expectancy approach that the majority has adopted, Plymouth Township only would be able to coordinate $4.63 a week of its $283.02 weekly payment of worker\u2019s compensation to Corbett. Thus, it would take <em>forty-two years </em>for Plymouth Township to fully coordinate the after-tax value of its pension payments.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Similarly, Dennis Dane was only thirty-five years old when he received his lump-sum pension payment of $29,505. According to Dane\u2019s own calculations of the life-expectancy approach, his weekly payment of $328.54 would be reduced by only $14 a week. Dane would have to remain disabled and continue to receive worker\u2019s compensation benefits for almost <em>thirty-seven years </em>before Stroh Brewery would recover the full amount of the after-tax value of $29,505. <em>Id. </em>As evidenced by these cases, the majority\u2019s approach would fail to substantially eliminate duplicate payments, by allowing the injured employee to receive almost his entire weekly worker\u2019s compensation payment, and, therefore, might discourage some disabled employees from returning to work, thereby frustrating one of the purposes of the statute. See <em>Drouillard, </em>449 Mich 300, n 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>In constructively distributing the lump-sum pension payments as periodic payments over the life expectancy of the employee, the majority\u2019s approach does allow for full coordination, but only on the basis of the erroneous assumption that a disabled worker will never return to work after his injury. The majority asserts that \u201c[t]he statutory scheme includes an implicit assumption that the disability may continue over the employee\u2019s lifetime.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 538. Yet, this assertion ignores the fact that the statute was designed to encourage some disabled workers to <em>return </em>to work, not to encourage them to remain idle while receiving double payments of wage-replacement benefits. See <em>Drouillard, </em>449 Mich 300, n 1. The Court\u2019s adoption of the life-expectancy approach, assuming that an employee may not be able to return to work, might be self-fulfilling by discouraging workers who might otherwise return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Once this Court refuses to apply the statute\u2019s plain language, it must attempt to further the legislative intent in the context of the statute\u2019s language and purposes. In examining the statute\u2019s language, \u00a7 354 has only provided a method for coordinating two different <em>periodic </em>payments, but is silent regarding the method for coordinating a lump sum with a periodic payment, despite the fact that the statute explicitly contemplates coordinating a lump-sum payment of worker\u2019s compensation with pension or retirement payments. See MCL 418.354(1); MSA 17.237(354)(1).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nevertheless, a lump-sum pension payment, under the statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>is still a wage-replacement benefit and is coordinated with weekly payments of worker\u2019s compensation. See <em>Drouillard, </em>449 Mich 293. Under \u00a7 354, as Edward Welch explains, \u201c[a]n employer\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation liability is reduced for virtually any other benefits the worker receives [e.g., pension] to the extent that the employer paid for the benefits.\u201d Welch, Worker\u2019s Compensation in Michigan: Law &amp; Practice (3d ed), Coordination of Benefits, \u00a7 18.14, p 18-18. Thus, for pension or retirement benefits under subsection 354(l)(d), there is a \u201creduction in worker\u2019s compensation benefits for any payment made from a pension retirement plan . . . .\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 18.16, p 18-19. This is the point of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">With this principle in mind, this Court would further the Legislature\u2019s intent by adopting the future-credit approach, by allowing the employer to coordinate its worker\u2019s compensation payments to its employee until the after-tax value of the employee\u2019s pension benefits has been exhausted, i.e., the employer may cease weekly worker\u2019s compensation payments until the pension payment has been fully coordinated. In this way, the statute fulfills the goal of eliminating double payments while still guaranteeing a wage-replacement benefit. Moreover, this approach may be applied to every case as a uniform rule and does not require this Court to rely on a mortality table not provided by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">In these cases, the employers, Plymouth ToYvnship, Stroh Brewery, and McLouth Steel Products, paid their respective employees the cash value of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>employee\u2019s pension benefits in a single lump sum: Corbett, $10,975.93; Dane, $29,505; and White, $13,039.94. At the same time, the employers were making a weekly payment for each employee\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation benefits: Corbett was receiving $283.02 a week; Dane, $328.54; and White, $409. In applying the future-credit method, one must first calculate the after-tax value of the lump-sum pension, payment and then divide that sum by the amount that the employer is paying weekly in worker\u2019s compensation benefits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This computation will yield the number of weeks that the employer may coordinate the full amount of the weekly worker\u2019s compensation benefits. On this basis, I would reverse the wcac\u2019s decision in <em>Corbett </em>to coordinate pension benefits over fifty-two weeks, and instead allow the employer to fully coordinate weekly payment of worker\u2019s compensation payments with the lump-sum pension payment. In <em>Dane, </em>I would reverse the wcac\u2019s decision to calculate the coordination on the basis of an annuity and instead allow Stroh Brewery to coordinate the entire weekly payment. Lastly, in <em>White, </em>I would remand to the WCAC, directing it to enter an order consistent with the future-credit approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Moreover, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s resolution of the rollover issue. The opinion dismisses the statute\u2019s language by labeling as \u201cliteralism\u201d defendant McLouth Steel Products\u2019 argument that under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>statute White has received his pension payment. <em>Ante </em>at 544. I think the better phrase would be <em>plain meaning. </em>Subsection 354(l)(d) provides that weekly worker\u2019s compensation benefits may be reduced by the \u201cafter-tax amount of the pension or retirement payments received\u201d by the employee and does not condition the coordination of pension benefits on whether the employee actually begins to use these funds or invests them in a plan in which he will only later receive payments. The majority does not claim that the application of the ordinary meaning of the statute\u2019s terms would create an absurd result. Hence, it is bound to apply the statute\u2019s plain meaning. See Salas, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">The majority attempts to justify its interpretation in the final paragraph of part v by noting the statute\u2019s use of the <em>\u201cafter-tax </em>amount,\u201d but fails to note that subsection 354(13) defines \u201cafter-tax amount\u201d as the amount remaining after subtracting the <em>estimated tax </em>the employee would pay on the benefit, not the actual tax the employee incurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">As used in this section, \u201cafter-tax amount\u201d means the gross amount of any benefit under subsection . . . (l)(d) . . . reduced by the prorated weekly amount which <em>would have been paid, </em>if any, under the federal insurance contributions act, 26 USC 3101 to 3126, state income tax and federal income tax, calculated on an annual basis using as the number of exemptions the disabled employee\u2019s dependents plus the employee, and without excess itemized deductions. <em>In determining the \u201cafter-tax amount\u201d the tables provided for in section 313(2) shall be used. </em>The gross amount of any benefit under subsection . . . (l)(d) . . . shall be presumed to be the same as the average weekly wage for purposes of the table. The applicable 80% of after-tax amount as provided in the table will be multiplied by 1.25 which will be conclusive for determining the \u201cafter-tax amount\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>benefits under subsection . . . (l)(d) . . . . [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">The majority, in order to give effect to its interpretation, also engrafts onto the statute a requirement that, upon the request of an employer, the employee furnish the employer with information regarding any withdrawal from the IRA, even though there is nothing in the statute regarding such a requirement. See <em>ante </em>at 546.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Rather than straining to find a justification for its interpretation, the majority should instead accept that the Legislature intended its words to have their ordinaiy meaning where that meaning does not produce perverse results.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The majority\u2019s interpretation also creates other practical questions, unanswered by the statute, regarding the determination of when an employee receives the money his employer contributed to his pension. After withdrawing money from an IRA, an employee may claim that he has not yet received the employer\u2019s contribution to the pension because (1) he may claim he is first drawing on funds from the interest the pension has accrued, or (2) because he may have separately paid money into his IRA and claim that he is only drawing on that money. The majority also does not explain what would happen if the IRA lost money because it was invested in an unwise ven<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>ture. Hence, because of this unwarranted interpretation, this Court may later have to address these questions and create solutions unguided by the statute. In other words, it will have to engage in further judicial legislation. Furthermore, the majority\u2019s interpretation ignores the fact that the employee may <em>immediately </em>enjoy the benefit of the employer\u2019s pension contribution that he places in the IRA investment by borrowing against the value of it as an asset.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">Instead of embarking on this unauthorized excursion into unchartered waters, I would merely apply the plain meaning of the statute and affirm the Court of Appeals decision that McLouth Steel Products should coordinate the lump sum that White received and, subsequently, rolled over into an IRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">With respect to the majority\u2019s conclusion that there was evidence to support the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission\u2019s decision to affirm the hearing referee\u2019s grant of benefits to White, I also dissent. I do not believe that White\u2019s affective disorder was \u201ccontributed to or aggravated or accelerated by the employment in a <em>significant </em>manner\u201d under MCL 418.301(2); MSA 17.237(301)(2), and I fear that the majority\u2019s application of the standard from <em>Gardner v Van Bur\u00e9n Public Schools, </em>445 Mich 23; 517 NW2d 1 (1994), has virtually eliminated the importance of the word \u201csignificant\u201d from the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">In <em>Gardner, supra </em>at 45, this Court required that under MCL 418.301(2); MSA 17.237(301)(2),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>employee demonstrate that his mental disability arose out of \u201cactual events\u201d and that there was a significant causal connection between those events and the employee\u2019s mental disability. As the majority notes, <em>ante </em>at 550, n 38, this Court in <em>Gardner, supra </em>at 47, articulated a totality-of-the-circumstances test for determining whether there was a significant factual causal connection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">Under the statutory standard, causation is determined by the factfinder. It is not determined by the honest, even if unfounded, perceptions of the claimant.

The WCAC noted that \u201cnothing unusual happened at work [on August 4, 1988,]\u201d but that White was unable to continue working because of the stress. <em>Id. </em>at 2681. White later returned to work, but, on January 16, 1989, the stress left him unable to work, despite the fact that \u201cthere were no unusual occurrences at work\u201d on that day either. <em>Id. </em>The WCAC noted that plaintiff had a preexisting condition, an \u201corganic brain syndrome,\u201d that apparently rendered him susceptible to mental disability from this kind of stress. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The majority relies on the analysis from <em>Gardner </em>in which this Court stated that even \u201cordinary\u201d events may be injurious to a predisposed employee and that an employer must take an employee as it finds him, with his preexisting mental frailties. <em>Ante </em>at 550-551. However, this analysis was focused on the prong of the <em>Gardner </em>test in which the employee must prove that the injury must arise out of \u201cactual events of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>employment, not unfounded perceptions thereof,\u201d and not the separate prong that the employee must establish that the actual events were significant in contributing to, aggravating, or accelerating the mental disability.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Admittedly, the Court appeared to expect this analysis to apply to either prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Nevertheless, this Court cannot expressly apply this analysis to the significant-manner requirement without effectively nullifying the importance of it as a separate prong and defeating the effort of the Legislature to introduce an objective element to the test when it rejected this Court\u2019s interpretation of the worker\u2019s compensation act in <em>Deziel v Difco Laboratories, Inc (After Remand), </em>403 Mich 1; 268 NW2d 1 (1978). See <em>Gardner, supra </em>at 39-42 (\u201cThe Legislative Reaction to <em>Deziel\u2019). </em>The standard in <em>Gardner, supra </em>at 27-28, requires that an employee establish (1) a mental disability, (2) arising out of actual events of employment, and (3) contributing to, aggravating, or accelerating the mental disability in a significant manner. Whenever an employee establishes a mental disability that arose out of actual employment events, he will easily be able to meet the third prong of proving that the events contributed to, aggravated, or accelerated the disability in a significant manner where ordinary events are the cause of the injury for the predisposed person. According to the combined analysis of the majority here and in <em>Gardner, </em>the employment event <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>need only be <em>the precipitating event </em>for the mental disability. The precipitating event is almost always subjectively significant to the mental disability if it caused the employee\u2019s injury to manifest. Thus, under my understanding of the majority\u2019s standard, the third prong has been effectively nullified.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Moreover, the test contains no important objective element. The only objective element prevents recovery for injuries that arise from hallucinations or delusions that occur during work when there has been no work-related event. In all other respects, the test is now virtually indistinguishable in practice from the subjective standard the Legislature wished to \u201csubstantive [ly]\u201d change. <em>Gardner, supra </em>at 42. Compare the current test as understood by this Court with the rejected <em>Deziel </em>test (as digested by this Court in <em>Peters v Michigan Bell Telephone Co, </em>423 Mich 594, 599; 377 NW2d 774 [1985]). The employee must establish the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">(1) the claimant was disabled;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-7\">(2) an injury in the form of a precipitating work-related event had occurred;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-8\">(3) using a subjective causal nexus standard, the employment had combined with some internal weakness or disease to produce the disability. [Citing <em>Deziel, supra </em>at 37.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">I fail to see the important substantive difference between this test and the current test.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">Instead of inviting a second legislative effort to correct our work, I would interpret the word \u201csignificant\u201d in the statute as requiring that the actual events at work be objectively traumatic, even if they would not be injurious to an ordinary person, requiring the employee to allege specific events rather than general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>assertions of anxiety. I cannot say that a person\u2019s employment contributed to, aggravated, or accelerated a mental disability in a <em>significant </em>way if the work-related event was only innocuous and benign, or, in other words, was an ordinaiy work event. This Court should interpret the statute to ensure that the injury was substantially contributed to, aggravated, or accelerated by actual work-related events and that the employment environment was not merely the occasion for which the mental disability could become manifest. See Gardner, <em>supra </em>at 65-66 (Riley, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In applying this test to White\u2019s case, I would reverse and order the wcac either to allow him an opportunity to allege specific work-related events that affected his mental disability in a significant way or enter an order denying him benefits under this claim. He has yet to bring specific allegations of any traumatic work-related events. I note, however, that particularly stressful circumstances of a specific incident at work could be objectively traumatic and sig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>nificantly contribute to, aggravate, or accelerate an employee\u2019s mental disability. I would reverse and remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b721-5\">Brickley, C.J., and Weaver, J., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-6\"> I do agree with part VI of the opinion that McLouth Steel Corporation, the predecessor corporation, is not the \u201csame employer\u201d under subsection 354(l)(d) as defendant McLouth Steel Products.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b707-5\"> As this Court noted, the Legislature wished to correct a system that \u201c \u2018discourag[ed] some disabled employees from returning to work\u2019 \u201d by providing \u201c \u2018wage-loss benefits from two, three, or four different programs providing a total wage \u201creplacement\u201d greater than the wages the employee earned while on the job . . . \u201d <em>Drouillard, supra </em>at 300, n 1, quoting Senate Legislative Analysis, SB 595 (January 7, 1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b707-8\"> The Court of Appeals drew the same conclusion in <em>Drouillard v Stroh Brewery Co, </em>199 Mich App 67, 70-71; 501 NW2d 229 (1993):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-9\">Drouillard contends that, in coordinating these benefits, the credit for the lump-sum pension payment may not be allocated to Stroh\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation liability for weeks other than the week in which the payout was actually received, i.e., in effect, that it should be coordinated only for the week it was received. We disagree. Rather, coordination of the entire amount is required by \u00a7 354(l)(d); to accomplish the reduction in an employer\u2019s obligation as required by that section, coordination must be allowed to continue in order to cover the full after-tax amount of the pension being received.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b707-10\"> \u201c[W]e must keep in mind the fundamental rule of statutory construction that departure from the literal construction of a statute is justified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>when such construction would produce an absurd and uryust result and would be clearly inconsistent with the purposes and policies of the act in question.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b708-9\"> The majority states that in seeking to uncover \u201cthe most appropriate construction of the statute,\u201d this Court need not <em>\u201cfind\" </em>the Legislature\u2019s intent, but instead attempts \u201c \u2018to <em>do, </em>responsibly, fittingly, intelligently, with and within the given frame.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 538, n 16. In other words, the majority is attempting to rewrite the statute.

A successful claim should require proof of specific incidents and not merely general conclusions of stress, anxiety, or exertion over a period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">I recognize that I offered these arguments in the context of analyzing the actual-events prong in <em>Gardner. </em>However, in light of the <em>Gardner </em>Court\u2019s interpretation of this prong, I believe it appropriate to interpret the significant-manner-requirement prong as containing a significant objective element.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
