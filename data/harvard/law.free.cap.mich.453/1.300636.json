There is no dispute that the waiver was voluntary. The question presented is whether the waiver was \u201cknowing and intelligent.\u201d We conclude that the state has fulfilled its burden of proving that defendant sufficiently understood the warnings given to him and that his subsequent waiver was valid. Thus, we would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Defendant Willie Cheatham and codefendant Joseph Stringer were jointly tried on first-degree murder<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and felony-firearm<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> charges. The two defendants had separate juries who heard different evidence and reached different outcomes. Stringer was acquitted on the murder charge, but convicted of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony; defendant was convicted of the lesser crime of second-degree murder<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and felony-firearm. Among the critical pieces of evidence heard by defendant\u2019s jury, but not by Stringer\u2019s jury, was defendant\u2019s statement admitting his presence at the murder scene and acknowledging that he threw a gun into an alleyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The charges stem from a murder in the City of Detroit on October 26, 1991. About 9:30 P.M., the police were summoned to a house where they discovered the decedent, Dewone Ridley, lying on the floor with three gunshot wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>A short distance away from the house where Ridley was discovered, the police were investigating an automobile accident in which a car had run into a building. The police found Stringer slumped over the steering wheel of the car, unconscious, with bullet wounds of the chest and leg, and with a .45 caliber pistol near his feet. Further down the block from the accident, the police observed defendant with blood on his head and inquired whether he had been in the car. Defendant responded that he had, and the police, after sending him to the hospital, took him into custody. During a patdown search, five empty .38 caliber shells were found in defendant\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">While in custody, defendant gave two slightly different statements to the police. After being advised of and waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights, defendant in his first statement said that Stringer had offered to give him a ride home and he accepted the offer. On the way, Stringer stopped at a house and got out of the car; defendant stayed in the car. While waiting in the car, defendant heard a door being kicked in, which was quickly followed by the sound of gunshots. Shortly thereafter, Stringer returned to the car with blood on his leg and a .45 caliber gun in his hand. Defendant stated that he did not have a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">In his second statement, again after being properly informed of and waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights, defendant repeated that Stringer was giving him a ride home and had stopped at a house on the way. Stringer got out of the car with a .45 caliber pistol in his hand and headed toward the house. Defendant then heard a door being kicked in and shots being fired. Contrary to his previous statement, defendant in this statement claimed to have gotten out of the car at this point and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>walked onto the porch of the house. As he was standing on the porch, defendant saw Stringer shoot Ridley three times. Defendant returned to the car, and a few seconds later Stringer, with blood on his leg, got into the car and drove toward the hospital. Before reaching the hospital, Stringer lost control and the car hit a building. Defendant struck his head on the windshield during the accident, but was able to get out of the car and throw the .38 caliber revolver he was carrying into an alley. Defendant said that he threw his gun into the alley because he had been arrested before with a gun and was afraid that he would have to go back to jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Before trial, defendant sought to have both statements suppressed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the suppression hearing, Dr. Steven Miller, a forensic psychologist, testified that he had examined defendant. Defendant had a history of being in special education classes and had dropped out of school in the ninth grade. Defendant had told Miller that he had no prior contact with the police and that he could not read or write. On the basis of several psychological tests, Miller concluded that defendant has an IQ of sixty-two and that he did not believe defendant was competent to waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">At the suppression hearing, defendant testified that at the time he gave his statements he did not know what it meant to be \u201csilent,\u201d or what the word \u201cattorney\u201d meant. Defendant did agree, however, that he knew he did not have to tell the police anything, that he wanted to tell the police what happened, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>officers had informed him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and that he told the officers he understood his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The police officer who questioned defendant the second time, Sergeant Arlie Lovier, testified that he did not have any problems communicating with defendant and that it appeared defendant understood what he was saying. Lovier stated that, after learning defendant was unable to read, he read defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights. After reading each right, he asked defendant to place his initials next to the right if he understood what the right meant. Defendant initialed each right and signed the statement at the end, agreeing that he had been informed of and understood his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">At the conclusion of the suppression hearing, the trial judge concluded that there was no coercion on the part of the police and that defendant had not been forthright with Miller when he claimed he had no previous contact with law enforcement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial judge further found that defendant\u2019s confession was wholly voluntary and that the only issue was whether defendant understood his rights. Although noting that defendant was intellectually limited and could not read, the judge concluded that his understanding of the <em>Miranda </em>rights was sufficient for a valid waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals disagreed with the trial judge\u2019s determination regarding defendant\u2019s cognitive abilities. The Court, citing <em>People v Garwood, </em>205 Mich App 553; 517 NW2d 843 (1994), found that, regardless of the lack of coercive police conduct, defendant did not have the intellectual ability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>understand his rights and thus his waiver was invalid and his confession should have been suppressed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The prosecutor sought leave to appeal, and we granted the application on October 10, 1995. 450 Mich 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">The Fifth Amendment<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the United States Constitution guarantees that the government cannot compel a defendant in a criminal case to testify against himself.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This protection has been applied to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Malloy v Hogan, </em>378 US 1; 84 S Ct 1489; 12 L Ed 2d 653 (1964). In addition, art 1, \u00a7 17 of the Michigan Constitution affords defendants a corresponding state constitutional right to be free from compelled self-incrimination.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>The wording of the Michigan Constitution granting protection from compelled self-incrimination is identical to the Fifth Amendment protection. Recently, this Court examined the relationship between the Fifth Amendment and art 1, \u00a7 17 in <em>People v Wright, </em>441 Mich 140; 490 NW2d 351 (1992), but could not reach a consensus regarding that relationship. We do not face the issue that separated the Court in <em>Wright, </em>and there is no need in this case to construe the protection against self-incrimination found in the Michigan Constitution differently from the identical federal guarantee.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On the facts of this case, if defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to be free from compelled self-incrimination was not violated, neither was a corresponding right under art 1, \u00a7 17 of the Michigan Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">In <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966), the United States Supreme Court created a set of prophylactic safeguards to insure protection of the Fifth Amendment right to be free from compelled self-incrimination during custodial interrogation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The stated goal of <em>Miranda </em>is to protect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>against the inherently coercive nature of custodial interrogation. <em>Id. </em>at 467.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\"><em>Miranda </em>protects defendants against governmental coercion leading them to surrender rights protected by the Fifth Amendment; it goes no further than that. <em>[Colorado v Connelly, </em>479 US 157, 170; 107 S Ct 515; 93 L Ed 2d 473 (1986).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">In an attempt to dissipate the coercion found to be inherent in custodial interrogation, thus protecting a defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right, the <em>Miranda </em>Court created the familiar litany:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">To summarize, we hold that when an individual is taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom by the authorities in any significant way and is subjected to questioning, . . . [h]e must be warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to questioning if he so desires. <em>[Id. </em>at 478-479.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">The United States Supreme Court, both in <em>Miranda </em>and in its progeny, has repeatedly stated that the warnings delineated in <em>Miranda </em>are not constitutionally mandated. In <em>Miranda, </em>the Court acknowledged that the warnings it created were not constitutionally required when it invited the Congress or the states to create alternatives<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> for protecting the Fifth Amendment guarantee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>It is impossible for us to foresee the potential alternatives for protecting the privilege which might be devised by Congress or the States in the exercise of their creative rule-making capacities. Therefore we cannot say that the Constitution necessarily requires adherence to any particular solution for the inherent compulsions of the interrogation process as it is presently conducted. Our decision in no way creates a constitutional straightjacket which will handicap sound efforts at reform, nor is it intended to have this effect. <em>[Id. </em>at 467.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Decisions by the Supreme Court after <em>Miranda </em>explicitly reinforce that \u201c[t]he . . . <em>Miranda </em>warnings . . . are \u2018not themselves rights protected by the Constitution but [are] instead measures to insure that the [suspect\u2019s] right against compulsory self-incrimination [is] protected.\u2019 \u201d <em>New York v Quarles, </em>467 US 649, 654; 104 S Ct 2626; 81 L Ed 2d 550 (1984), quoting <em>Michigan v Tucker, </em>417 US 433, 444; 94 S Ct 2357; 41 L Ed 2d 182 (1974). See also <em>Oregon v Elstad, </em>470 US 298, 306; 105 S Ct 1285; 84 L Ed 2d 222 (1985); <em>Moran v Burbine, </em>475 US 412, 426; 106 S Ct 1135; 89 L Ed 2d 410 (1986). Although a suspect who is questioned while in custody must be informed of the right to remain silent and the right to have an attorney present during interrogation, these rights are not created in the Fifth Amendment. Rather, the holding of <em>Miranda </em>is the doctrinal foundation of a claim that a confession is not admissible if it is a product of the inherent coercion the Court found present in custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>in</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">To admit a confession in its case in chief, the state bears the burden of proving that the confession was voluntarily given by the defendant, thereby fulfilling the due process guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Connelly, supra. </em>In addition, if the confession was the result of custodial interrogation, the state must prove that the police properly informed the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and obtained a valid waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The <em>Miranda </em>Court did not foreclose the possibility that, after the police administered the warnings and advice set forth in the opinion, a suspect might choose, for whatever reason, to forgo the benefits provided in the <em>Miranda </em>litany. The Court chose to apply the well-established standard for waiver of constitutional rights set forth in <em>Johnson v Zerbst, </em>304 US 458, 464; 58 S Ct 1019; 82 L Ed 1461 (1938), to in-custody interrogation. In establishing a stringent waiver requirement, the Court determined that in order for the police to show that a suspect had elected to abandon the protections <em>Miranda </em>affords, there must be evidence of a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>As noted in <em>Miranda, </em>clarified in <em>Moran, supra, </em>and reaffirmed in <em>Colorado v Spring, </em>479 US 564, 573; 107 S Ct 851; 93 L Ed 2d 954 (1987), whether a \u201cwaiver is coerced \u2018has two distinct dimensions.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">First, the relinquishment of the right must have been voluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception. Second, the waiver must have been made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it. Only if the \u201ctotality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation\u201d reveal both an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension may a court properly conclude that the <em>Miranda </em>rights have been waived. <em>[Moran, supra </em>at 421.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">As explained more fully in <em>Moran, </em>a waiver is valid as a matter of law if the suspect\u2019s \u201cdecision not to rely on his rights was uncoerced, that he at all times knew he could stand mute and request a lawyer, and that he was aware of the State\u2019s intention to use his statements to secure a conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">In <em>Edwards v Arizona, </em>451 US 477, 478; 101 S Ct 1880; 68 L Ed 2d 378 (1981), the defendant was arrested on January 19, 1976, and read his <em>Miranda </em>rights. After being informed of his rights, the defendant stated that he understood his rights and wanted to make a statement. Midway through the questioning, however, the defendant invoked his right to counsel and questioning ceased. The next morning, the police returned to ask the defendant more questions and a guard at the jail told him \u201che had\u201d to talk with the officers. The defendant was again advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and he agreed to make a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Before trial, the defendant moved to suppress his statement, contending that, after he had invoked his right to counsel, the police could not return to question him at a later time. The trial court refused to suppress the statement, concluding that the waiver was voluntary, and the defendant was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">On appeal, the Arizona Supreme Court found a valid waiver solely on the basis that the waiver was voluntary. The United States Supreme Court rejected this analysis, concluding that the waiver also had to be knowing and intelligent under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d and that the failure to establish that the waiver was knowing and intelligent rendered the Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s decision infirm.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 482-483.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">In <em>Connelly, supra, </em>the Court addressed whether a confession caused by mental illness was an involuntary confession for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment due process analysis. The Court concluded that, absent police coercion, a defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>mental state alone can never render a confession involuntary. <em>Id. </em>at 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The defendant in <em>Connelly </em>approached a Denver police officer and stated that he had murdered someone. The officer immediately informed the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, which the defendant stated he understood and wanted to waive. Another officer arrived on the scene and also informed the defendant of his rights; again, the defendant claimed to understand his rights, but still wanted to talk about the murder. The defendant then gave a detailed description of the murder to the police and pointed out where the murder had taken place. The defendant was placed in custody and held overnight. The following morning the defendant appeared visibly disoriented, gave confusing answers, and stated that \u201cvoices\u201d had told him to come to Denver to confess. The defendant was sent to a state hospital, where he was found incompetent to stand trial for a period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">When the defendant regained competency and was scheduled for trial, defense counsel filed a motion to suppress the defendant\u2019s statement, alleging that the confession was involuntary because it was not the result of a free and rational choice. The trial court suppressed the confession, and the Colorado Supreme Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision. The prosecutor appealed to the United States Supreme Court, and the lower court decision was reversed. The Supreme Court concluded that the police had not engaged in any coercive behavior, that absent coercion a confession could not be involuntary, and that a deficiency in the defendant that is not exploited by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>the police cannot vitiate the voluntariness of the confession. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">[W]hile mental condition is surely relevant to an individual\u2019s susceptibility to police coercion, mere examination of the confessant\u2019s state of mind can never conclude the due process inquiry. <em>[Id. </em>at 165.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The focus in <em>Connelly </em>was solely on police action and how that related to any weakness in the defendant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">Absent police conduct causally related to the confession, there is simply no basis for concluding that any state actor has deprived a criminal defendant of due process of law. <em>[Id. </em>at 164.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-9\"><em>Connelly </em>clearly eliminated any subjective inquiry with regard to the voluntary prong of the waiver inquiry. Importantly, for purposes of the present inquiry, the Court also stated that the standard for determining whether a waiver is voluntary for <em>Miranda </em>purposes is the same standard for assessing whether a confession is voluntary under the Fourteenth Amendment due process inquiry.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">There is obviously no reason to require more in the way of a \u201cvoluntariness\u201d inquiry in the <em>Miranda </em>waiver context than in the Fourteenth Amendment confession context. <em>[Id. </em>at 169-170.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">The prosecutor argues that the logic of examining police behavior and requiring more than a subjectively focused inquiry seems equally applicable to the knowing and intelligent prong of the <em>Miranda </em>inquiry. However, slightly more than one month after <em>Connelly, </em>the Supreme Court released <em>Spring, </em>and in dicta cited the test from <em>Moran. </em>Contrary to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>strong language the Court used in <em>Connelly </em>to establish that improper police behavior is necessary to render a confession involuntary, the test articulated in <em>Moran </em>and quoted in <em>Spring </em>appears to focus only on the knowledge of the accused irrespective of improper police behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">In some respects, it is questionable whether the focus of the Court in <em>Spring </em>was a subjective examination of the suspect\u2019s state of mind or whether, consistent with <em>Connelly, </em>police behavior must play some role in determining whether a suspect knowingly and intelligently waived the <em>Miranda </em>protections. After citing the language of <em>Moran, </em>the Court in <em>Spring </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV\">The <em>Miranda </em>warnings ensure that a waiver of these rights is knowing and intelligent by requiring that the suspect be fully <em>advised </em>of this constitutional privilege including the critical advice that whatever he chooses to say may be used as evidence against him. <em>[Id. </em>at 574 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">A reasonable interpretation of this language could lead to the conclusion that police need only inform a suspect of his rights in order for a subsequent waiver to be knowing and intelligent. Additionally, the entire discussion in <em>Spring </em>regarding whether the defendant made a knowing and intelligent waiver of his rights is dicta because the Supreme Court subsequently stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">In this case there is no allegation that Spring failed to understand the basic privilege guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment. Nor is there any allegation that he misunderstood the consequences of speaking freely to the law enforcement officials. <em>[Id. </em>at 575.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>However, given the incongruity between the clear language and logic of <em>Connelly </em>and the dicta in <em>Spring, </em>courts have been left to question whether the knowing and intelligent prong of the waiver analysis is a wholly subjective inquiry that focuses only on the suspect\u2019s post hoc claims regarding the warnings. On the basis of <em>Connelly, </em>the prosecutor argues that a wholly subjective inquiry into whether a waiver was knowing and intelligent, without reference to any misconduct on the part of the police, would fail for the same reason that police misconduct is necessary to establish that a waiver was not voluntary. If <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>stated goal is to eliminate the inherently coercive nature of station-house interrogation, then there is no justification for excluding voluntary statements given during custodial interrogation after the police have apprised the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and the defendant appears to understand those rights. Excluding otherwise validly obtained confessions on the basis that the defendant subjectively did not understand his rights, although there were no signs indicating any degree of confusion, creates the same problems the Court identified in <em>Connelly.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Requiring courts to exclude a confession when the defendant later claims he misunderstood his rights would impose \u201ca far-reaching requirement that courts must divine a defendant\u2019s motivation for speaking or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>acting as he did even though there be no claim that governmental conduct coerced his decision.\u201d <em>Connelly, supra </em>at 165-166. Moreover, the focus on police behavior conforms with the goal of a prophylactic exclusionary rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">The deterrent purpose of the exclusionary rule necessarily assumes that the police have engaged in willful, or at the very least negligent, conduct which has deprived the defendant of some right. By refusing to admit evidence gained as a result of such conduct, the courts hope to instill in those particular investigating officers, or in their future counterparts, a greater degree of care toward the rights of an accused. Where the official action was pursued in complete good faith, however, the deterrence rationale loses much of its force. <em>[Michigan v Tucker, supra </em>at 447.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The prosecutor argued that, as in <em>Connelly, </em>suppressing defendant\u2019s statements in this case would serve no deterrent \u201cpurpose in enforcing constitutional guarantees.\u201d <em>Connelly, supra </em>at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\"><em>Miranda, </em>if nothing else, has the \u201cvirtue of informing police and prosecutors with specificity . . . what they may do in conducting custodial interrogation, and of informing courts under what circumstances statements obtained during such interrogation are admissible.\u201d <em>Fare v Michael C, </em>442 US 707, 718; 99 S Ct 2560; 61 L Ed 2d 197 (1979). This virtue is lost when confessions are suppressed in situations where the police properly administer the warnings required by <em>Miranda </em>and by all external indications obtain a valid waiver. The United States Supreme Court has recognized that in certain situations, the benefits afforded by <em>Miranda </em>are outweighed by the detrimental consequences of excluding evidence obtained in violation of those protections. <em>New York v Quarles </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>(public safety exception). Excluding confessions where all objective indications illustrate that the defendant understands the warnings and elects to waive them would seem to be one of those situations. If the police inform the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and there is no evidence that the police knew or should have known that the defendant did not comprehend those rights, the rationale of <em>Miranda </em>would seem to dictate that any statements voluntarily made after that point should be admissible.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In these circumstances, suppressing a confession serves no purpose. There is nothing more the police could do, nor is there any objectionable police behavior.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Suppressing an otherwise valid confession on the basis of the defendant\u2019s belated contention that he really did not understand the rights he was forgoing forces the Court to make \u201csweeping inquiries into the state of mind of a criminal defendant who has con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>fessed, inquiries quite divorced from any coercion brought to bear on the defendant by the State.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Connelly, supra </em>at 167. However, we are not persuaded that the Supreme Court has clearly foreclosed that inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The federal circuits that have acknowledged the conflict between the language in <em>Spring </em>and the logic of <em>Connelly </em>have uniformly concluded that, although perhaps inconsistent, the knowing and voluntary prong of the waiver inquiry seems to ignore police action and focus solely on the suspect\u2019s understanding. See <em>United States v Bradshaw, </em>290 US App DC 129, 133; 935 F2d 295 (1991); <em>Derrick v Peterson, </em>924 F2d 813 (CA 9, 1990); <em>Miller v Dugger, </em>838 F2d 1530 (CA 11, 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">In <em>Derrick v Peterson, </em>Derrick, a sixteen year old, was taken into custody as a suspect in the murder of his parents. After the police informed Derrick of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, he stated \u201cthat he understood his rights, that he had been advised of them numerous times . . . and was quite well aware of what that procedure was and his right to counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 816. After waiving his rights, Derrick proceeded to confess to murdering his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Before trial, Derrick\u2019s counsel filed a motion to suppress his confession. At the suppression hearing, two psychologists testified that Derrick had an IQ between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>sixty-two and seventy-four, and that, while Derrick probably could understand the words of the warning, there was serious doubt regarding whether he could understand the ramifications of giving a statement. Both psychologists also stated that defendant\u2019s previous arrests made a \u201csubstantial difference\u201d in Derrick\u2019s ability to understand his rights. <em>Id. </em>The trial judge, who presided at the hearing, concluded that Derrick\u2019s statement was voluntary and that he knew what his rights were. Derrick was tried, and a jury subsequently convicted him of first-degree manslaughter and murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">On appeal, Derrick again raised the admissibility of his confession, contending both that his waiver was involuntary and that it was not knowingly and intelligently made. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit first concluded that there was no police coercion involved and that the defendant\u2019s statement was voluntary. In addressing Derrick\u2019s claim that his waiver was not knowing and voluntary, the court examined the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Connelly </em>and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">While <em>Connelly </em>clearly holds that the \u201cvoluntariness\u201d inquiry in the <em>Miranda </em>waiver context is equivalent to the voluntariness inquiry under the fourteenth amendment, it is not as clear whether an inspection of the \u201cknowing\u201d and \u201cintelligent\u201d prong of the <em>Miranda </em>waiver analysis is likewise rendered unnecessary by a conclusion that a confession is voluntary under the fourteenth amendment. [924 F2d 820.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">After noting the Supreme Court\u2019s citation in <em>Spring </em>of the waiver standard articulated in <em>Moran, </em>the court concluded that, \u201calthough a determination of voluntariness under the fourteenth amendment forecloses a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>similar inquiry in the <em>Miranda </em>waiver context, we must conduct a separate review of whether Derrick knowingly and intelligently waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Derrick </em>court readily acknowledged, however, that such a result \u201cas a matter of logic\u201d is unsatisfactory. <em>Id. </em>The court observed that if examination of the confessant\u2019s mind alone never can establish a due process violation, it is anomalous that a waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights can be invalidated solely on the basis of the confessant\u2019s claim that he did not understand these warnings. The court found such a reading illogical in that impermissible state action is required pursuant to the voluntary prong, but is apparently irrelevant with respect to the knowing and intelligent prong.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The court eventually concluded, however, that until the United States Supreme Court eliminates this tension, the bifurcated inquiry must continue. After examining the defendant\u2019s mental abilities and the facts surrounding the confession, the court held that Derrick knowingly and intelligently waived his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Similarly, in <em>Bradshaw, supra, </em>the defendant robbed a bank and was arrested a few blocks away when a red dye packet that was included in the sack with the money exploded. After the police took the defendant into custody, he was properly informed, both in writing and orally, of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>After asking a few questions about his rights, the defendant stated that he understood the rights <em>Miranda </em>afforded him and he signed, the waiver form. He then gave a statement admitting that he had robbed the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">Before trial, the defendant moved to suppress his confession, arguing that his history of mental illness and intoxication at the time of his arrest made it impossible for him to knowingly and intelligently waive his rights. The trial court concluded that a waiver is only invalid if there is some form of police coercion. Finding no coercion, the confession was not suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">At trial, the defendant was convicted as charged. On appeal, he continued to argue that his confession was invalid because he did not have the mental capacity to knowingly and intelligently waive his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia extensively reviewed the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Connelly </em>and noted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">To be sure, some of the reasoning in the section of <em>Connelly </em>dealing with the due process voluntariness standard could be applicable to our case as well. The Court, for example, observed that evidence should not be excluded unless suppression would deter future constitutional violations, see [479 US 166], Since the police may not know whether an individual does not or cannot understand <em>Miranda </em>warnings (the government claims here that the police were not aware of Bradshaw\u2019s illness), an argument could be made that in those circumstances, deterrence is inapposite. <em>[Bradshaw, supra </em>at 133.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>After identifying the potential applicability of the logic in <em>Connelly, </em>however, the <em>Bradshaw </em>court concluded that the language in <em>Spring, </em>reiterating that a waiver must be both voluntary and knowing, prohibited extending the <em>Connelly </em>analysis to the knowing and intelligent prong of the waiver inquiry. Thus, the court concluded that to be valid, a waiver must be voluntary and knowing and intelligent. Because the trial court had not made any findings regarding whether the defendant understood his rights, the case was remanded to the trial court to make that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">On the basis of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Spring, </em>the federal circuit courts have unanimously rejected the prosecutor\u2019s position that <em>Connelly </em>limited the entire waiver analysis \u2014 both the voluntary and knowing and intelligent prongs \u2014 to a wholly objective inquiry that focuses only on police behavior. The Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Spring </em>seems to assume, with no reference to <em>Connelly, </em>that the focus of the knowing and intelligent prong of the waiver analysis rests solely on the suspect\u2019s understanding. Thus, like the federal circuit courts that have examined this question after <em>Connelly, </em>we too must conclude that, until the United States Supreme Court clarifies the apparent inconsistency between the voluntary and knowing and intelligent prongs of the waiver analysis, a subjective inquiry into the suspect\u2019s level of understanding is required and must be assessed under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d irrespective of police behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">Proceeding on the premise that a \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d waiver is required in situations where the confession is wholly voluntary, and there is no evidence of impermissible police conduct, we agree with the trial judge that defendant sufficiently understood his rights and that he could and did provide a valid waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Whether a suspect has validly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights depends in each case on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation. <em>North Carolina v Butler, </em>441 US 369; 99 S Ct 1755; 60 L Ed 2d 286 (1979); <em>Fare, supra </em>at 725. The totality of the circumstances approach</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">permits \u2014 indeed, it mandates \u2014 inquiry into all the circumstances surrounding the interrogation. This includes evaluation of the [suspect\u2019s] age, experience, education, background, and intelligence, and into whether he has the capacity to understand the warnings given him, the nature of his Fifth Amendment rights, and the consequences of waiving those rights. <em>[Id,.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">The burden is on the state to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the suspect properly waived his rights. <em>Connelly, supra </em>at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Defendant does not contend that his confession was involuntary, and his testimony at the suppression hearing clearly indicates a lack of coercion surrounding his confession. At the hearing, defendant stated that he wanted to tell the police what happened and that he did tell them.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Defense counsel further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>reinforced that he was \u201cnot claiming that it was an involuntary statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Given that defendant\u2019s confession was voluntary, the critical inquiry in this case is the degree of understanding the accused must possess in order to provide a knowing and intelligent waiver of the rights <em>Miranda </em>affords. To knowingly waive <em>Miranda </em>rights, a suspect need not understand the ramifications and consequences of choosing to waive or exercise the rights that the police have properly explained to him.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\"><em>[Miranda] </em>requires that the accused be advised of his rights so that he may make a rational decision, not necessarily the best one or one that would be reached only after long and painstaking deliberation. Indeed, it may be argued forcefully that a choice by a defendant to forego the presence of counsel at a police interrogation is almost invariably an unintelligent course of action. It is not in the sense of shrewdness that <em>Miranda </em>speaks of \u201cintelligent\u201d waiver but rather in the tenor that the individual must know of his available options before deciding what he thinks best suits his particular situation. <em>[Collins v Brierly, </em>492 F2d 735, 738-739 (CA 3, 1974).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Lack of foresight is insufficient to render an otherwise proper waiver invalid. See <em>Spring, supra </em>at 574; <em>Elstad, supra </em>at 316.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">[T]he test is not whether [the defendant] made an intelligent decision in the sense that it was wise or smart to admit his participation in the crime, but whether his decision was made with the full understanding that he need say nothing at all and that he might then consult with a lawyer if he so desired. <em>[United States v Hall, </em>396 F2d 841, 846 (CA 4, 1968).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">To establish a valid waiver, the state must present evidence sufficient to demonstrate that the accused understood that he did not have to speak, that he had the right to the presence of counsel, and that the state could use what he said in a later trial against him. <em>Moran, supra </em>at 423. \u201cThat is the meaning of intelligent waiver; that and no more.\u201d <em>Harris v Riddle, </em>551 F2d 936, 939 (CA 4, 1977).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">An appellate court must give deference to the trial court\u2019s findings at a suppression hearing. <em>People v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number><em>Burrell, </em>417 Mich 439, 448; 339 NW2d 403 (1983). Although engaging in de novo review of the entire record, see <em>People v Walker (On Rehearing), </em>374 Mich 331, 338; 132 NW2d 87 (1965), this Court will not disturb a trial court\u2019s factual findings regarding a knowing and intelligent waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights \u201cunless that ruling is found to be clearly erroneous.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>Burrell, supra </em>at 448. Credibility is crucial in determining a defendant\u2019s level of comprehension, and the trial judge is in the best position to make this assessment. After a thorough and independent review of the record, we conclude that the trial judge correctly determined that defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Defendant\u2019s expert witness testified that defendant knew he did not have to talk and could remain silent, the first element of a knowing and intelligent waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights under <em>Moran. </em>The trial court clearly disbelieved defendant\u2019s testimony and the record supports that conclusion. It is undisputed that the police officers who questioned defendant administered the required warnings, sought to insure that he understood each warning by inquiring after each warning whether he understood what the warning meant, and obtained an express written waiver before questioning him.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Defendant was informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights at least twice. Because he indicated that he could not read, a second officer was brought into the room to verify that the first officer read each of the rights to defendant. After each right, defendant was asked whether he understood that particular right and answered that he did. He was then asked to place his initials in front of that right, which he did. An officer testified that defendant did not ask any questions about any rights, nor did the officers have any trouble communicating with him. As noted in <em>Derrick, </em>\u201c[the] written waiver in particular is strong evidence that the waiver was valid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 824. Defendant provided appropriate answers in response to the officer\u2019s questions, and \u201c[t]here is no evidence that, at the time the warnings were given and during the subsequent questioning, Defendant manifested expressly or by implication from [his] words and actions any lack of comprehension of what was said to [him] or of what was occurring.\u201d <em>United States v Marenghi, </em>896 F Supp 207, 219 (D Me, 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The psychologist who testified for defendant both at the suppression hearing and at trial, Dr. Steven Miller, concluded that defendant knew he did not have to talk and could be quiet.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Defendant, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>professed that he did not remember being advised of his rights and that he only understood that he did not have to talk to the police after Dr. Miller explained that to him. On cross-examination the prosecutor asked defendant if he knew \u201cwhat it means when somebody tells you that you do not have to answer any questions put to you?\u201d Defendant first answered \u201cno,\u201d but when questioned further, stated that he knew the prosecutor was currently questioning him and that he \u201cmight know\u201d what a question is.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> When asked whether he knew what an attorney was from watching television, defendant answered that he only watched \u201ctv now and then,\u201d and that, although he had seen \u201cshows where they had court on television,\u201d he did not know which persons on those shows were attorneys.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Considered in its entirety, the record clearly indicates that defendant was able to engage in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>a calculated attempt to testify about what he thought would benefit him at the suppression hearing: that he told the officers he could not read; that he could not remember whether he had been advised of his rights, both on this occasion and at the time of his previous arrest; and to deny that he understood any of the rights that were read to him. The waiver form indicates that defendant provided appropriate background information, including names and addresses of family members, phone numbers, date of birth, height, and weight. Finally, defendant answered in excess of one hundred questions put to him by his counsel and the prosecutor at the suppression hearing without ever indicating that he did not understand what was being asked.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Despite the fact that Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Miller testified that he believed defendant was not competent to waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> \u201c[w]aiver and defendant\u2019s competence to waive rights are legal, not psychological, concepts, and the judge, not an expert witness, is the ultimate decision maker on these issues.\u201d <em>State v Cleary, </em>161 Vt 403, 406; 641 A2d 102 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Although defendant claims not to have known what an attorney was, he knew he had a right to have a lawyer present. Pursuant to <em>Oregon v Elstad, supra, </em>a defendant need not know what services an attorney can provide, but merely that he has a right to the presence of a lawyer before making a statement. The purpose of appointing counsel is not to insure that the defendant\u2019s choice regarding waiver is wise, but to help dissipate coercion the United States Supreme Court has found present in custodial interrogation. See Grano, Confessions, Truth &amp; the Law (Ann Arbor: The University Press, 1993), p 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The record also indicates that defendant knew the police intended to use his statement against him, the third element of a knowing and intelligent waiver under <em>Moran. </em>First, defendant had been arrested previously for carrying a concealed weapon, a fact he chose not to tell the police in his first statement and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>that he never told Dr. Miller during their discussion.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Second, he knew enough to dispose of his gun immediately after the car accident. Third, he deliberately chose not to tell the police that he had thrown the gun in the alley before his arrest because he did not want to go back to jail. This behavior illustrates that defendant knew the police could use any information he provided to his detriment and further supports the trial court\u2019s disbelief of defendant\u2019s testimony. His actions also indicate he had learned from his previous interaction with the police. As noted by the North Carolina Supreme Court, a defendant\u2019s previous experience with the police is \u201can important consideration in determining whether an inculpatory statement was made voluntarily and understandingly.\u201d <em>State v Fincher, </em>309 NC 1, 20; 305 SE2d 685 (1983). Although other courts have found that past interaction with the police, in and of itself, may have little bearing on the validity of a waiver,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> if a defendant deliberately tailors his response to earlier actions with the police, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the defendant understood his relationship with the police. It is not necessary for a defendant to know how the police could use his statement, simply that what he told them might help place him in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Dr. Miller\u2019s evaluation indicated defendant had an IQ of sixty-two, which placed him at the low end of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>mild mental retardation.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> A defendant\u2019s IQ, however, is only one factor in the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d a court must consider in assessing whether a defendant has the requisite level of comprehension.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Low mental ability in and of itself is insufficient to establish that a defendant did not understand his rights. See <em>Dunkins v </em>Thigpen, 854 F2d 394, 399-400 (CA 11, 1988); <em>Cleary, supra. </em>\u201c[N]o single factor, such as IQ, is necessarily determinative in deciding whether a person was capable of knowingly and intelligently waiving . . . the constitutional rights embraced in the <em>Miranda </em>rubric.\u201d <em>Fairchild v Lockhart, </em>744 F Supp 1429, 1453 (ED Ark, 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">An individual's IQ score is not dispositive in deciding whether an individual is mentally retarded, but only one element of a three-part inquiry. The generally accepted test for determining mental retardation is stated in the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (dsm-n)-.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>The essential feature of Mental Retardation is significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning (Criterion a) that is accompanied by significant limitations in adaptive functioning in at least two of the following skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social/interpersonal skills, use of community resources, self-direction, functional academic skills, work, leisure, health, and safety (Criterion b). The onset must occur before age 18 years (Criterion c). <em>[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders </em>(4th ed) (Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Ass\u2019n, 1994), p 39.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">The first two criteria require further explanation.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> An individual who has an IQ of less than seventy is typically classified as having significantly subaverage intellectual functioning. <em>Id. </em>Alluring as it is to grasp onto a quantifiable value when assessing a concept as amorphous as intelligence, and assuming that intelligence can be quantifiably measured, it is important to note that an IQ of seventy represents only a ninety-five percent certainty that an individual\u2019s IQ falls between sixty-five and seventy-five.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>An individual\u2019s IQ should not be viewed as an exact number, but rather, as \u201cone value within a probable band of IQs.\u201d Grossman, <em>Classification in Mental Retardation </em>(Washington, DC: American Association on Mental Deficiency, 1983), p 24. Moreover, unlike interval scales involving equal units where the distance between each point on the scale is the same \u2014 the difference between five and ten is equal to the difference between ten and fifteen \u2014 the same cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>said for IQ values.

Actually, IQ is no more than a convenient numerical scale used to categorize degrees of mental aptitude. While certain categories at the lower end of the IQ scale have been assigned the classification of \u201cretarded,\u201d the scores themselves say little about a person\u2019s skills and aptitudes. [Mickenberg, <em>Competency to stand trial and the mentally retarded defendant: The need for a multi-disciplinary solution to a multi-disciplinary problem, </em>17 Cal W L R 365, 390 (1981).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">By definition, an IQ below seventy alone is not sufficient to establish that an individual is mentally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>retarded.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> An individual must \u201cshow significant deficit in <em>both </em>measured intelligence and adaptive behavior . . . .\u201d Grossman, <em>supra </em>at 207. In the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders </em>(DSM-rv), the American Psychiatric Association notes: \u201cMental Retardation would not be diagnosed in an individual with an IQ lower than 70 if there are no significant deficits or impairments in adaptive functioning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40. Adaptive functioning</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">refers to how effectively individuals cope with common life demands and how well they meet the standards of personal independence expected of someone in their particular age group, sociocultural background, and community setting. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Typically, impairments in adaptive functioning are the only outwardly noticeable indicia that an individual may be mentally retarded, not a low IQ. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The record in this case does not indicate that defendant presents any impairment in adaptive functioning that would indicate defendant may be mentally retarded. First, his answers to the questions initiated by the police were responsive and appropriate. Second, Dr. Miller made the following observations in his report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-8\">Grooming and hygiene were good. Facial egressions were normal and he spoke in a logical and coherent man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>ner. Mood and affect were appropriate and congruent with the circumstances of the interview albeit constricted with indications of depression. He was oriented to person, place and personal relationship to reality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Aside from a somewhat below average iq, the record does not indicate defendant presented any impairments in adaptive functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Once an individual is determined to have some level of mental retardation \u2014 i.e., an iq below seventy, significant limitations in adaptive functioning in at least two areas, and onset before age eighteen \u2014 the degree of mental retardation is further defined. Depending on the level of mental impairment, the individual is classified as either mildly, moderately, severely, or profoundly retarded. <em>Dsm-n, </em>supra at 40.

During their adult years, they usually achieve social and vocational skills adequate for minimum self-support, but may need supervision, guidance, and assistance, especially when under unusual social or economic stress.

Although ultimately \u201creject[ing] the prosecutor\u2019s position that <em>Connelly </em>limited the entire waiver analysis \u2014 both the voluntary and knowing and intelligent prongs \u2014 to a wholly objective inquiry that focuses only on police behavior,\u201d <em>ante, </em>p 26, the lead opinion relies on selective citations of federal circuit court opinions to posit an alleged \u201cinconsistency\u201d between <em>Connelly </em>and <em>Spring. </em>In fact, this inconsistency does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">In <em>Miller v Dugger, </em>838 F2d 1530, 1535 (CA 11, 1988), the court stated: \u201cIt is now clear, however, that the requirements of <em>Miranda's </em>prophylactic rules can diverge significantly from the force of the prohibition in the due process clause itself against the introduction of involuntary statements.\u201d This divergence is clear, of course, because <em>Miranda </em>is the case in which the \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d prong of a waiver analysis was enunciated. \u201cThe prohibition against the introduction of involuntary statements long predates <em>Miranda, </em>and <em>Miranda </em>was not the first case in which the Supreme Court imposed rules on state courts to protect against the use of involuntary confessions.\u201d 838 F2d 1535. <em>Miranda </em>explained that effectuation of a suspect\u2019s right to \u201cbe warned that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney\u201d may be waived \u201cprovided the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.\u201d 384 US 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit noted that \u201cthe Supreme Court in <em>Connelly </em>explained that \u2018voluntariness\u2019 in the context of a <em>Miranda </em>waiver means the same thing as \u2018voluntariness\u2019 in the due process context, i.e., freedom from official coercion .... The Supreme Court has stated explicitly, however, that a valid waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights must not only be voluntary; it must also be <em>intelligently </em>made.\u201d 838 F2d 1538 (emphasis in original). The Eleventh Circuit relied on a pr<em>e-Connelly </em>case, <em>Edwards v Arizona, </em>451 US 477; 101 S Ct 1880; 68 L Ed 2d 378 (1981), as evidence of the irrefutably distinct prongs of a waiver inquiry: \u201cThe Supreme Court could not have stated more clearly that an uncounselled statement must be both voluntary and made after a knowing and intelligent waiver of the <em>Miranda </em>rights to be admissible.\u201d 838 F2d 1538 (citing <em>Edwards, </em>451 US 483-484). The court ended its discussion of <em>Connelly </em>as follows: \u201cWe do not read the <em>Connelly </em>decision as demonstrating an intent by the Supreme Court to eliminate this distinction between voluntariness and knowing waivers.\u201d 838 F2d 1539. \u201cThe question of whether Connelly had <em>intelligently </em>waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights was not presented to the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">In <em>Derrick v Peterson, </em>924 F2d 813, 820 (CA 9, 1990), the court, in a poorly reasoned opinion, selectively cited <em>Connelly:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>While <em>Connelly </em>clearly holds that the \u201cvoluntariness\u201d inquiry in the <em>Miranda </em>waiver context is equivalent to the voluntariness inquiry under the fourteenth amendment, it is not as clear whether an inspection of the \u201cknowing\u201d and \u201cintelligent\u201d prong of the <em>Miranda </em>waiver analysis is likewise rendered unnecessary by a conclusion that a confession is voluntary under the fourteenth amendment. That is the burden of our next inquiry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The <em>Derrick </em>court then finally acknowledged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">Whatever doubt remained after <em>Connelly </em>concerning the distinct nature of the knowing and intelligent prong of the waiver inquiry was removed by the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Colorado v Spring . . . </em>later that same term.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">Thus, in light of <em>Spring, </em>it is clear that, although a determination of voluntariness under the fourteenth amendment forecloses a similar inquiry in the <em>Miranda </em>waiver context, we must conduct a separate review of whether Derrick knowingly and intelligently waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>[Id. ]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">And in <em>United States v Bradshaw, </em>290 US App DC 129, 134; 935 F2d 295, 302 (1991), yet another federal appellate court acknowledged the irrefutable distinctness of the two prongs of a <em>Miranda </em>waiver analysis: \u201cBut any doubts we might have concerning <em>Connelly\u2019s </em>reach dissipate in light of the Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Colorado v Spring . . . </em>.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cWe agree with the Ninth Circuit that this statement dispels any notion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>that a <em>Miranda </em>waiver must be caused by police misconduct to be deemed non-knowing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Derrick v Peterson </em>and <em>Miller v </em>Dugger).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">An attentive reading of <em>Connelly </em>shows that the Court was concerned solely with the voluntariness prong of a <em>Miranda </em>waiver. Keeping in mind that fact, and the fact that <em>Connelly </em>was decided after <em>Fare v Michael C, </em>442 US 707; 99 S Ct 2560; 61 L Ed 2d 197 (1979), <em>Edwards v Arizona, </em>and <em>Moran v Burbine, supra </em>(among others, all of which unequivocally posit the discrete nature of the voluntariness inquiry from the knowing and intelligent inquiry), creating an \u201capparent inconsistency between the voluntary and knowing and intelligent prongs of the waiver analysis,\u201d <em>ante, </em>p 26, is an indefensible position. And more importantly, even if there were an arguable inconsistency or tension between the analysis of the voluntariness prong and the analysis of the knowing and intelligent prong, we would still be obligated to apply the unambiguous dictate of <em>Colorado v Spring, </em>which \u201cdispels any notion that a <em>Miranda </em>waiver must be caused by police misconduct to be deemed non-knowing.\u201d <em>Bradshaw, supra </em>at 134. However, I can find no such inconsistency or tension.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Before discussing the self-imposed confusion evidenced by portions of the <em>Derrick </em>and <em>Bradshaw </em>opinions,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I would point out that it is logically inconsistent to even attempt to apply the notion of police coercion to an inquiry of what a suspect understood. \u201cCoerce\u201d means \u201cto force; compel; to effect by force.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary. </em>It is obvious, then, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>that \u201ccoerced\u201d is an antonym of \u201cvoluntary\u201d (and, of course, a synonym of \u201cinvoluntary\u201d). The relevance of coercion to a voluntariness inquiry is obvious and unmistakable. However, the concept of coercion or compulsion bears no relation, logically or otherwise, to a suspect\u2019s level of comprehension of the rights at issue. But, having said that, let us go on to examine the \u201clogic\u201d that led the <em>Derrick </em>and <em>Bradshaw </em>panels to see tension where none exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">The lead opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">In addressing Derrick\u2019s claim that his waiver was not knowing and voluntary, the court examined the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Connelly </em>and stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">\u201cWhile <em>Connelly </em>clearly holds that the \u2018voluntariness\u2019 inquiry in the <em>Miranda </em>waiver context is equivalent to the voluntariness inquiry under the fourteenth amendment, it is not as clear whether an inspection of the \u2018knowing\u2019 and \u2018intelligent\u2019 prong of the <em>Miranda </em>waiver analysis is likewise rendered unnecessary by a conclusion that a confession is voluntary under the fourteenth amendment.\u201d [924 F2d 820.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">After noting the Supreme Court\u2019s citation in <em>Spring </em>of the waiver standard articulated in <em>Moran, </em>the court concluded that, \u201calthough a determination of voluntariness under the fourteenth amendment forecloses a similar inquiry in the <em>Miranda </em>waiver context, we must conduct a separate review of whether Derrick knowingly and intelligently waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d <em>Id. [Ante, </em>pp 23-24.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">In fact, after quoting the excerpt from <em>Spring </em>\u2014 an excerpt that itself relies on quotations from the pre-<em>Connelly </em>opinions in <em>Moran v Burbine </em>and <em>Fare v Michael </em>C \u2014 what the <em>Derrick </em>court actually said was: \u201c <em>Thus, in light of </em>Spring, <em>it is clear that, </em>although a determination of voluntariness under the fourteenth amendment forecloses a similar inquiry in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number><em>Miranda </em>waiver context, we must conduct a separate review of whether Derrick knowingly and intelligently waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d 924 F2d 820 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The lead opinion also states: \u201cThe <em>Derrick </em>court readily acknowledged, however, that such a result \u2018as a matter of logic\u2019 is unsatisfactory.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 24. \u201c[R]eadily acknowledged\u201d is a risibly self-indulgent characterization; rather, the <em>Derrick </em>court gratuitously and, I suggest, erroneously theorized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">As a matter of logic this result is somewhat unsatisfactory. On the one hand, <em>Connelly </em>emphasizes that \u201cmere examination of the confessant\u2019s state of mind can never conclude the due process inquiry.\u201d 479 US 165 .... Yet, in the <em>Miranda </em>context, the Court allows a waiver to be invalidated based only upon the confessant\u2019s state of mind- \u2014 i.e. based only upon whether the waiver is knowing and intelligent. See <em>Spring, </em>479 US 573 .... Thus, the Court requires that there be improper state action under the fourteenth amendment before a confession can be suppressed, but requires no such state action in the <em>Miranda </em>context, even though the constitutional provision underlying the <em>Miranda </em>warning- \u2014 the fifth amendment \u2014 is applied to the states through that same fourteenth amendment .... See <em>Malloy v Hogan, </em>378 US 1, 8; 84 S Ct 1489; 12 L Ed 2d 653 (1964) (incorporating fifth amendment\u2019s self-incrimination clause). [924 F2d 820-821.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The error in this analysis results from the court\u2019s fallacious assumption of a complete unity between the determinative factors of the <em>pre-Miranda </em>Fourteenth Amendment due process analysis (which was con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>cerned solely with coercive police conduct that affected the voluntariness of a suspect\u2019s confession)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the <em>post-Miranda </em>waiver analysis (which requires analysis of two distinct prongs, only one of which\u2014 i.e., voluntariness \u2014 is logically, or in any other respect, related to coercive police practices). The <em>Derrick </em>court appears confused when it says that \u201cthe [Supreme] Court requires that there be improper state action under the Fourteenth Amendment before a confession can be suppressed, but requires no such state action in the <em>Miranda </em>context . . . .\u201d 924 F2d 821. In <em>Connelly, </em>wherein the Supreme Court reviewed the holding of the Colorado Supreme Court that Connelly\u2019s confession was involuntary under both the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause and <em>Miranda, </em>the Court held that \u201ccoercive police activity is a necessary predicate to the finding that a confession is not \u2018voluntary\u2019 within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of th\u00e9 Fourteenth Amendment,\u201d 479 US 167, and that \u201c[t]here is obviously no reason to require more in the way of a \u2018voluntariness\u2019 inquiry in the <em>Miranda </em>waiver context than in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Fourteenth Amendment confession context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 169-170. Unmistakably, then, coercive police conduct is as necessary to a finding of involuntariness under <em>Miranda </em>as it is under the substantive protection of the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause. It is only with respect to the completely distinct \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d prong of a <em>Miranda </em>waiver analysis\u2014 a prong never considered under the <em>pre-Miranda </em>due process analysis \u2014 that coercive police conduct is not required, either by logic or by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">That brings me to the final aspect of the <em>Derrick </em>court\u2019s fabrication of a logical inconsistency: the notion that <em>Miranda </em>should be no more protective of a suspect\u2019s rights than is the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause because that clause is the vehicle by which the protections of the Fifth Amendment are applicable to the states. <em>Derrick, </em>924 F2d 821. The refutation of that assertion is not difficult.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Before the Fifth Amendment was incorporated into the Fourteenth, the only substantive protection afforded by the Fourteenth Amendment was the prohibition against coercive police conduct that rendered a suspect\u2019s confession (or other statement) involuntary and therefore inadmissible. But ever since <em>Miranda, </em>the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which was incoiporated into the Fourteenth Amendment in <em>Malloy v Hogan, supra, </em>has been understood to require that a suspect\u2019s decision to waive his Fifth Amendment rights be both \u201cvoluntary\u201d and \u201cknowing and intelligent.\u201d As should be obvious, then, the substantive content of, and the substantive protections afforded by, the Fourteenth Amendment are greater after incorporation than they were before.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">The lead opinion also mischaracterizes the relevant case law with regard to the specific issue of police conduct. It acknowledges that coercive police conduct is not a prerequisite for finding a <em>Miranda </em>waiver invalid under the knowing and intelligent prong, and therefore concludes that the knowing and intelligent prong requires a purely \u201csubjective inquiry.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 26. This is not completely accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Both prongs must be analyzed under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation,\u201d and therefore any relevant police conduct <em>would be </em>equally applicable. The only clear-cut difference is that coercive police conduct is a sine qua non for a judicial finding of involuntariness; coercive conduct is only relevant to the concept of voluntariness. There is no requirement for evidence of police conduct of any particular sort to find a waiver invalid under the knowing and intelligent prong, but any police conduct that could have an effect on a suspect\u2019s requisite level of comprehension must be factored into the analysis. This, too, was clear before <em>Connelly </em>and <em>Spring.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">In <em>Moran v Burbine, </em>the defendant argued that his \u201cconfessions must be suppressed because the police\u2019s failure to inform him of the attorney\u2019s telephone call deprived him of information essential to his ability to knowingly waive his Fifth Amendment rights.\u201d 475 US 421. In finding that the police\u2019s failure to inform the defendant of an attorney\u2019s attempt to contact him did not affect the defendant\u2019s \u201cfull awareness and comprehension of all the information <em>Miranda </em>requires the police to convey,\u201d the Supreme Court stated: \u201cGranting that the \u2018deliberate or reckless\u2019 withholding of information is objectionable as a matter of ethics, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>such conduct is only relevant to the constitutional validity of a waiver if it deprives a defendant of knowledge essential to his ability to understand the nature of his rights and the consequences of abandoning them.\u201d <em>Id., </em>pp 423-424. And although <em>Miranda </em>originally required that suspects be given the specific warnings enunciated in that opinion, the Supreme Court has since held that the standard <em>Miranda </em>warnings are not constitutionally required. The initial judicial focus under the knowing and intelligent prong in such cases, therefore, is what information was (or was not) conveyed to the suspect, and how that information affected the suspect\u2019s comprehension of the guarantees of the Fifth Amendment. See <em>Oregon v Elstad, </em>470 US 298; 105 S Ct 1285; 84 L Ed 2d 222 (1985); <em>New York v Quarles, </em>467 US 649; 104 S Ct 2626; 81 L Ed 2d 550 (1984); <em>Michigan v Tucker, </em>417 US 433; 94 S Ct 2357; 41 L Ed 2d 182 (1974). Though the ultimate focus for purposes of the knowing and intelligent prong remains on the level of the suspect\u2019s comprehension, it is clear that police conduct can be relevant, except, of course, coercive police conduct, which is logically and lexically unrelated to analysis of a suspect\u2019s comprehension.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The lead opinion also attempts to link the analyses of <em>Connelly </em>and <em>Spring </em>by focusing on the exclusionary rule. As a threshold matter, I would point out that any discussion of the exclusionary rule is unrelated to the actual case before us, and therefore mere dicta. The judgment in this case is that defendant\u2019s waiver was valid; obviously, then, the issue of exclusion is in no way implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>The lead opinion relies on the following excerpt from <em>Bradshaw:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-4\">\u201cTo be sure, some of the reasoning in the section of <em>Connelly </em>dealing with the due process voluntariness standard could be applicable to our case as well. The Court, for example, observed that evidence should not be excluded unless suppression would deter future constitutional violations, <em>see </em>[479 US 166], Since the police may not know whether an individual does not or cannot understand <em>Miranda </em>warnings (the government claims here that the police were not aware of Bradshaw\u2019s illness), an argument could be made that in those circumstances, deterrence is inapposite.\u201d <em>[Ante, </em>p 25 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Bradshaw, </em>290 US App DC 133; 935 F2d 299).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">First of all, this excerpt immediately follows the <em>Bradshaw </em>court\u2019s explicit acknowledgment of its understanding that police coercion is not and cannot be the focus of judicial inquiry under the knowing and intelligent prong. That by itself evidences the improbity of the lead opinion\u2019s reading of that case. But even more important is the obvious fact that deterrence of coercive police conduct is by definition inapposite to whether a <em>Miranda </em>waiver was invalid because it was not knowing and intelligent; this is a mere truism. However, if a suspect\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>waiver was not knowing and intelligent because of police conduct that \u201cdeprive [d] a defendant of knowledge essential to his ability to understand the nature of his rights and the consequences of abandoning them,\u201d <em>Moran v Burbine, </em>475 US 424, then deterrence would be directly apposite. And the most important fact in this regard is that deterrence is not the overarching consideration: the protection and vindication of constitutional rights is.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">In sum, then, I join only the following parts of the lead opinion: I; iv(a), (b), (c) (except for the two references to the elements of a knowing and intelligent waiver \u201cunder <em>Moran\" ante, </em>pp 30, 34; the relevant case in this regard is <em>Spring, </em>not <em>Moran), </em>(e); and v.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b197-6\"> <em>Colorado v Connelly, </em>479 US 157; 107 S Ct 515; 93 L Ed 2d 473 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b199-9\"> The District of Columbia Circuit quoted the same excerpt from <em>Spring </em>as did the Ninth Circuit in <em>Derrick, </em>an excerpt in which the United States Supreme Court clearly demonstrated, by quoting from <em>Moran v Burbine </em>and <em>Fare v Michael C, </em>442 US 707; 99 S Ct 2560; 61 L Ed 2d 197 (1979), that it was not enunciating for the first time the two distinct dimensions of a <em>Miranda </em>waiver.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b200-7\"> Actually, as I subsequently discuss, the confusion was engendered by the <em>Derrick </em>court; the <em>Bradshaw </em>court uncritically parroted the <em>Derrick </em>court\u2019s confusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b202-8\"> And in eventually conceding that the bifurcated inquiry is mandated by binding United States Supreme Court case law, the <em>Derrick </em>court expressly acknowledged \u201cthat we are <em>obligated </em>to bifurcate the <em>Miranda </em>waiver analysis . . . .\u201d 924 F2d 821 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b203-5\"> In <em>Connelly, </em>the Supreme Court explained that \u201ccoercive government misconduct was the catalyst for this Court\u2019s seminal confession case, <em>Brown v Mississippi, </em>297 US 278 [56 S Ct 461; 80 L Ed 682] (1936).\u201d 479 US 163.

However, I am deeply troubled by the possibility that the decision we reach today could be interpreted as endorsing the standard <em>Miranda </em>litany as sufficient when securing a waiver from individuals with impaired or \u201cbelow normal\u201d mental abilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The court in <em>United States v Yunis, </em>273 US App DC 290; 859 F2d 953 (1988), effectively explained the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>\u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d requirement in the context of a non-English-speaking defendant. In holding that the Arabic translation of the warnings was sufficient to apprise the suspect of his rights, the court emphasized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">as the <em>Miranda </em>decision itself suggests, <em>the focus must be on the plain meaning of the required warnings. </em>A defendant must comprehend, for example, that he really does not have to speak; he must recognize that anything he says actually will be used by the state against him. <em>[Id. </em>at 301-302 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">I agree that the focus of inquiry must be on the plain meaning of the warnings and emphasize that the warnings must be <em>plain. </em>The validity of a waiver does not depend on a verbatim recitation of the <em>Miranda </em>litany, but rather depends on an actual understanding on the part of the individual of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and the consequences of waiving them. <em>Colorado v Spring, </em>479 US 564; 107 S Ct 851; 93 L Ed 2d 954 (1987). While it is true that an officer can never definitively ascertain that an individual has actual understanding, the officer must use caution and engage in a good-faith effort when obtaining a waiver to assess the suspect\u2019s level of understanding. The officer must make an effort to ensure that the consequences of making an in-custody statement to the police are clearly understood.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-8\"> <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b209-7\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjZ\">(dissenting). I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals for the reasons stated in its unpublished opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>The Court of Appeals said that it was left with the definite and firm conviction that the trial court made a mistake in finding<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that Cheatham had knowingly waived his <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rights, and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">The testimony at the suppression hearing overwhelmingly indicated that defendant did not have the intellectual ability to understand his rights. When asked at the hearing about his educational background, defendant did not respond by identifying which schools he had attended or what grade he had achieved. He simply stated that he could not read. When asked a question of any complexify, defendant\u2019s answers were unresponsive. Defendant testified that he did not understand the rights when they were read to him, although he indicated to the police officer otherwise. In addition, the uncontradicted testimony of the psychologist was that defendant had an IQ of 62, was mentally retarded and functionally illiterate. The psychologist testified that defendant would not have been able to understand the <em>Miranda </em>rights and that he could not competently waive them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">The police officers\u2019 testimony that defendant seemed to understand the <em>Miranda </em>rights is not enough, in the face of the psychologist\u2019s testimony to the contrary and defendant\u2019s demonstrated inability to understand complex questions, to support the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant understood and knowingly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. We conclude that the trial court erred in finding that defendant understood his rights and in failing to suppress defendant\u2019s statement at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">The admission of defendant\u2019s statement cannot be harmless error. Although defendant did not admit to shooting the victim, defendant acknowledged that he was present at the murder scene and further acknowledged that after the shooting he threw a .38 revolver into an alley. Evidence was introduced at trial that a bullet from that .38 revolver was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>found at the murder scene and spent shell casings from the same gun were found in his pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">Plaintiff argues that because there was no evidence of police coercion, defendant\u2019s statement was voluntary and there was no basis on which to suppress it, citing <em>Colorado v Connelly, </em>479 US 157; 107 S Ct 515; 93 L Ed 2d 473 (1986). Plaintiff fails to appreciate the distinction between whether the waiver of defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights was voluntary, an issue which cannot be resolved in defendant\u2019s favor absent some police coercion, <em>Colorado v Connelly, supra, </em>and <em>whether the otherwise voluntary waiver was knowing and intelligent. [People v Garwood, </em>205 Mich App 553, 555; 517 NW2d 843 (1994).] A waiver which was not knowing and intelligent warrants suppression of. the statement independent of any coercive police conduct. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">In <em>Colorado v Connelly, supra </em>at 167, cited by the Court of Appeals, the United States Supreme Court repeatedly referred to the \u201cvoluntariness\u201d prong of the standard for determining whether <em>Miranda </em>rights were waived, but did not mention the \u201cknowing\u201d prong. Later in the same term, the Court, in <em>Colorado v Spring, </em>479 US 564, 573; 107 S Ct 851; 93 L Ed 2d 954 (1987), recognized that both prongs of the analysis were applicable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">\u201cFirst the relinquishment of the right must have been voluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception. Second, the waiver must have been made with a full awareness both of the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it. Only if the \u2018totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation\u2019 reveal both an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension may a court properly conclude that the <em>Miranda </em>rights have been waived.\u201d [Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>The Court went on in <em>Spring </em>to note that the confession in that case was voluntary, citing <em>Connelly, </em>before discussing whether the waiver of the \u201cFifth Amendment privilege was knowingly and intelligently made . . . <em>.\"Id. </em>at 574. The Court\u2019s analysis implies that a person who could not know could not waive his rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">In this case there is no allegation that Spring failed to understand the basic privilege guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment. Nor is there any allegation that he misunderstood the consequences of speaking freely to the law enforcement officials. In sum, we think that the trial court was indisputably correct in finding that Spring\u2019s waiver was made knowingly and intelligently within the meaning of <em>Miranda.
