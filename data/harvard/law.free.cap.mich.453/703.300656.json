We hold that under subsection 301(3) of the act, an employee does not suffer an injury that occurred in the course of his employment while traveling to work, when he was injured on a public street, not maintained by the employer, as he was walking from a private parking lot to the worksite. In the instant case, plaintiff drove to a parking lot provided by General Motors, traveled to a private parking lot, and then was injured while walking across a public street from the private parking lot on her way to the General Motors plant. We vacate the Court of Appeals decision to reverse the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>grant of worker\u2019s compensation benefits and remand to the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission to enable it to determine whether the injury occurred in the course of her employment consistent with the standards articulated in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">PACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">The parties stipulated the facts of the case. Because the parties dispute what reasonable inferences may be drawn from the stipulation, we provide the full text of the stipulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-8\">Elizabeth A. Simkins is an employee of the Fisher Body Flint Plant of General Motors Corporation. She worked on the first shift, which started at 6:18 A.M.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-9\">At some time before 6:00 a.m. on September 4, 1984, Mrs. Simkins drove her car to the Fisher Body Flint Plant and parked on the Fisher Body premises North parking lot. She exited her car and, after an unknown period, got into the car of a fellow employee, Perry Mitra. They drove onto Saginaw Street, a public street bordering the east side of the Fisher Plant, headed south to Hemphill and turned right, or west, onto Hemphill. Hemphill is a public street bordering the Fisher Plant on the south side. It has four lanes, two each for west and east bound traffic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-10\">Mr. Mitra drove his car into a privately owned parking lot on the south side of Hemphill and parked. He and Mrs. Simkins alighted and, after paying the parking attendant, started across Hemphill to the Plant Gate at Post 11. The lot in which Mr. Mitra parked was located almost directly across the street from the Plant Gate and about in the middle of the block.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-11\">At about 5:58 A.M., twenty minutes before her shift was to start, Mrs. Simkins was struck by an automobile driven by Tonya D. Anderson. At the moment that she was struck, Mrs. Simkins was going north across Hemphill and was in the east bound inside lane near the double yellow center line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>Mrs. Simkins has been unable to perform her job since September 4, 1984.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The parties agree that this Court must rely on this stipulation alone in order to resolve whether plaintiffs injury arose out of and in the course of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">On August 21, 1985, plaintiff, through her guardian Thomas Simkins, filed an amended petition seeking worker\u2019s compensation under \u00a7 301 of the WDCA against defendants General Motors and the Second Injury Fund.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is no dispute that plaintiff suffered severe, permanent injuries, including a closed-head injury, that resulted in weakness in her arms and legs. She cannot walk without the aid of a walker or wheelchair. In an opinion dated April 11, 1986, the hearing referee concluded that plaintiff was eligible for worker\u2019s compensation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-7\">[Plaintiff] had entered the \u201cpremises\u201d [of General Motors] when she entered the company-owned parking lot. The mere fact that she was given a ride to a closer, non-company lot, did not remove her from the scope of her employment. The injury sustained when crossing the street to the plant gate is compensable.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Apy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>On May 7, 1987, General Motors filed an appeal of the decision with the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board. Plaintiff\u2019s no-fault insurance carrier, Valley Forge Insurance Company, moved to intervene as a plaintiff on July 19, 1988, alleging that it had paid more than $400,050 in medical and health care expenses on plaintiff\u2019s behalf. It sought reimbursements from General Motors for these costs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">In an opinion filed on June 26, 1991, the wcab, in a two-to-one decision, affirmed the referee\u2019s ruling to award plaintiff worker\u2019s compensation benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-6\">We find that plaintiffs slight deviation in her route from one parking lot controlled by defendant to another not controlled by defendant, but directly across the street from the plant entrance, kept plaintiff within the zone, environment, and hazards of her employment. [1991 WCABO 1399, 1412. ][<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>The dissent concluded otherwise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-5\">I find that defendant\u2019s provision for an on-premises parking lot which was not shown by plaintiff to deny any reasonable safe access to its plant, with her leaving those premises to park in an undesignated private lot and to cross a street not shown to be under defendant\u2019s control or the protection against street traffic presumably provided by defendant\u2019s parking lot, placed plaintiff beyond the \u201czone, environment and hazards\u201d of defendant\u2019s premises, thus depriving her of the presumption afforded by Section 30[1](3) of the Act. <em>[Id. </em>at 1409.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">General Motors appealed in the Court of Appeals, which denied leave.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On September 9, 1992, this Court denied General Motors application for leave.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On reconsideration, this Court remanded the case to the Court of Appeals as on leave granted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">On remand, the Court of Appeals reversed the wcab and ruled that plaintiff was not eligible for worker\u2019s compensation. The Court reasoned that previous Michigan cases only allow compensation for employees injured while traveling to work from a parking area maintained by the employer, not from a private parking area. 208 Mich App 453, 457; 528 NW2d- 775 (1995). The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-8\">In this case, there was no employer connection with plaintiff\u2019s accident. She was injured while crossing a public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>street from a private parking lot and was not yet on the employer\u2019s premises. We recognize that, had she been injured while crossing from the parking lot that the employer did provide, she would be entitled to compensation benefits under the case law, but, as Justice Levin recognized in a concurring opinion \u201ca line must be drawn at some point.\u201d <em>McClure v General Motors Corp (On Rehearing), </em>408 Mich 191, 226; 289 NW2d 631 (1980). The decisions we have analyzed draw the line at some employer connection other than the mere fact that the employee was traveling to work but had not arrived yet on the employer\u2019s premises. <em>[Id. </em>at 458-459.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Plaintiff filed an application for leave, which this Court granted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">Under the worker\u2019s compensation act,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-10\">[a]n employee, who receives a personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment by an employer who is subject to this act at the time of the injury, shall be paid compensation as provided in this act. [MCL 418.301(1); MSA 17.237(301)(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">It is well settled that an employee who seeks worker\u2019s compensation must show by competent evidence not only the fact of an injury, but also that the injury occurred in connection with his employment, arising out of and in the course of that employment. <em>Hills v Blair, </em>182 Mich 20, 26; 148 NW 243 (1914). As remedial legislation, this Court construes the act liberally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>to grant rather than deny benefits. <em>Bower v Whitehall Leather Co, </em>412 Mich 172, 191; 312 NW2d 640 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The primary purpose of the worker\u2019s compensation act is to provide benefits to the victims of work-related injuries by allocating the burden of these payments to the employer, and, therefore, ultimately, to consumers.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> An employee who suffers an injury arising out of and in the course of his employment will be eligible for compensation regardless of whether the employer was at fault.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In return, the employer is immunized from tort liability because the worker\u2019s compensation act, under MCL 418.131(1); MSA 17.237(131)(l),[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] provides that this compensation is the exclusive remedy for a personal injury, except for an injury resulting from an intentional tort. <em>Travis v Dreis &amp; Krump Mfg Co, </em>453 Mich 149, 161; 551 NW2d 132 (1996) (Boyle, J., lead opinion).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Court of Appeals described, the act\u2019s purpose is to \u201c \u2018provide . . . not only for employees a remedy which is both expeditious and independent of proof of fault, but also for employers a liability which is limited and determinate.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"As9\">As a general rule, an employee who is injured while going to or coming from work cannot recover worker\u2019s compensation. <em>Bush v Parmenter, Forsythe, Rude &amp; Dethmers, </em>413 Mich 444, 451; 320 NW2d 858 (1982). The statute\u2019s going-and-coming provision furnishes an exception to the general rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-6\">An employee going to or from his or her work, while on the premises where the employee\u2019s work is to be performed, and within a reasonable time before and after his or her working hours, is presumed to be in the course of his or her employment. Notwithstanding this presumption, an injury incurred in the pursuit of an activity the major purpose of which is social or recreational is not covered under this act. Any cause of action brought for such an injury is not subject to section 131. [MCL 418.301(3); MSA 17.237(301)(3).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">This exception only creates a presumption that the injury was \u201cin the course of [the employee\u2019s] employment,\u201d not that it \u201caros[e] out of\u201d his employment under subsection 301(1).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We, therefore, will only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>examine whether plaintiff\u2019s injury occurred in the course of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Despite the apparent clarity of the statute requiring that the injury occur \u201con the premises where the employee\u2019s work is to be performed,\u201d this Court has traditionally construed this phrase in a way that would allow recovery under the appropriate circumstances even where the injury occurred on property that was not owned, leased, or maintained by the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">The first sentence of the going-and-coming provision was first enacted in 1954<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to ensure that the worker\u2019s compensation act would provide protections for an employee for a \u201creasonable time and space for the employee to approach and leave the locality or zone of his work.\u201d <em>Dyer v Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co, </em>350 Mich 92, 95; 85 NW2d 152 (1957) (Black, J., plurality opinion).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In other words, an employee\u2019s course of employment is not limited to the performance of the very job itself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>\u201cThe employment is not limited by the exact time when the workman reaches the scene of his labor and begins it, nor when he ceases, but includes a reasonable time, space, and opportunity before and after, while he is at or near his place of employment. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-6\">\u201cThe protection of the law extends to a reasonable time and space for the employee to leave the locality or zone of his work and while he is in proximity, approaching or leaving his place of employment by the only means of access thereto.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 96-97, quoting <em>Brink v JW Wells Lumber Co, </em>229 Mich 35, 37-38; 201 NW 222 (1924).][<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">The substance and wording of the subsection\u2019s first sentence were taken from <em>Brink, supra, </em>and, by adopting its language, the Legislature intended to restore the state of the law as interpreted by the Court in <em>Brink. Dyer, supra </em>at 95-96 (Black, J.). The Legislature wished to remedy the situation from <em>Daniel v Murray Corp of America, </em>326 Mich 1, 3; 39 NW2d 229 (1949), in which this Court had denied relief to an employee who suffered an injury in the employer\u2019s parking lot because he was no longer actually performing his job but rather was leaving for the day.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Freiborg v Chrysler Corp, </em>350 Mich 104, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>107; 85 NW2d 145 (1957) (Dethmers, C.J., lead opinion).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See also <em>Dyer, supra </em>at 96.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-3\">Following <em>Freiborg </em>and <em>Dyer, </em>this Court, in <em>Lasiewicki v Tasco Products Co, </em>372 Mich 125, 131; 125 NW2d 479 (1963), examined a case in which an employee slipped and fell when she was leaving for lunch while she was walking on the unpaved portion of a public right of way, which was used by employees for parking cars near the plant worksite. This Court applied the going-and-coming provision under 1948 CL 412.1, the predecessor of subsections 301(1), (3), and explained that an employee need not strictly be on the employer\u2019s \u201cpremises\u201d in order to be presumed to be in the course of his employment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-4\">\u201cOne of the tests sometimes applied is whether the workman is still on the premises of his employer. This, while often a helpful consideration, is by no means conclusive. A workman might be on the premises of another than his employer, or in a public place, and yet be so close to the scene of his labor, <em>within its zone, environments, and hazards, </em>as to be in effect at the place and under the protection of the act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-5\">\u201cIt is not a sufficient test that the workman should be on the premises of the employer; but it may be sufficient that he is in such a state of proximity as may be treated as a reasonable margin in point of space.\u201d <em>[Lasiewicki, supra </em>at 131, quoting <em>Hills, supra </em>at 27-28 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">From this reasoning, in <em>Lasiewicki, supra </em>at 127, 129-131, this Court held that the employee could recover, even though the parking area was a public right of way, because the parking area was \u201cused and maintained\u201d by her employer and therefore she was on the \u201cpremises of [the] employer [ ] within the meaning of the statute . . . <em>.\u2019\u2019Id. </em>at 131. In this way, the Court expanded the meaning of \u201cpremises\u201d under the statute to include more than merely the employer\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">In 1980, the Legislature enacted several reforms of the worker\u2019s compensation act under 1980 PA 357, including an amendment of subsection 301(3), previously subsection 301(2), by adding its second and third sentences prohibiting recovery under worker\u2019s compensation for an injury that occurs during the pursuit of a recreational activity in order to eliminate certain \u201cabuses\u201d in the law. Senate Analysis Section, SB 1044, adopted as 1980 PA 357, January 7, 1981. Through these 1980 amendments, the Legislature intended to narrow and restrict the eligibility qualifications for injured workers under worker\u2019s compensation. <em>Dean v Chrysler Corp, 434 </em>Mich 655, 667; 455 NW2d 699 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">Nevertheless, relying on the phrase \u201czone, environments, and hazards\u201d quoted in <em>Lasiewicki, </em>the Court of Appeals has ruled that an employee may recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>for an injury that occurred on property not owned, leased, or maintained by the employer if the employee was traveling to or from work.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In other cases, however, the Court of Appeals has been unwilling to allow recovery for an employee who is injured while traveling to or from work when that injury did not occur on property owned, leased, or maintained by the employer.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Plaintiff argues that this Court\u2019s most recent examination of a worker\u2019s injury that occurred while the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>employee was traveling away from work is not relevant, <em>McClure v General Motors Corp (On Rehearing), supra, </em>overruling 402 Mich 392; 262 NW2d 829 (1978), because in <em>McClure </em>the injured employee was leaving during his <em>lunch period </em>on personal business. The employee was walking across a public street to a restaurant when he was struck and injured by an automobile.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> On rehearing, this Court overruled its first decision and affirmed the wcab\u2019s decision to deny the employee relief under the worker\u2019s compensation act. <em>Id. </em>at 209 (Ryan, J., plurality opinion) and 231 (Levin, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">In writing for the plurality, Justice Ryan did not apply the going-and-coming provision of \u00a7 301, but rather distinguished <em>Howard v Detroit, </em>377 Mich 102; 139 NW2d 677 (1966),<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> which had served as the basis for the holding in the first <em>McClure </em>decision. Justice Ryan reasoned that, unlike <em>Howard, McClure </em>did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>involve \u201can employer-directed deviation\u201d from a normal schedule and that \u201cthe Legislature has not yet seen fit to provide compensation for injuries suffered by workers during off-premises lunch-hour activity of a purely personal character.\u201d McClure, <em>supra </em>at 207. Yet, in concluding that <em>Howard </em>did not apply, the plurality opinion is silent about whether the going-and-coming provision governs the case\u2019s resolution.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">In his concurrence, Justice LEVIN specifically did not rely on the going-and-coming provision to resolve the question. See <em>id. </em>at 218, n 18. Rather, he noted that there is an argument that an employee could recover for a lunchtime motor vehicle accident for an \u201coff-premises injur[y]\u201d under the logic of <em>Haller v </em>Lansing, 195 Mich 753, 761; 162 NW 335 (1917).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number><em>McClure, supra </em>at 226. Nevertheless, he concluded that there should not be recovery because of the allocation of the costs envisioned by the Legislature in creating the no-fault act:<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-6\">A decision in favor of coverage for such injuries, then, would cause \u00a7 3109(1)[<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>] of the no-fault act to work a reallocation of the cost of insurance reparations for lunchtime motor vehicle accidents, one probably not anticipated by the Legislature when \u00a7 3109 was enacted. This Court should not disturb the allocation of the burden of providing such reparations struck by the Legislature when it enacted the no-fault act. <em>[Id. </em>at 229.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Even though this Court did not examine <em>McClure </em>as a case governed by the going-and-coming provision of subsection 301(3), the plain language of the statute indicates that it applies because when an employee returns from lunch or leaves for it, he is \u201cgoing to or from his or her work . . . .\u201d There is no requirement that he must be going to work at the beginning of his work day or leaving from work at the end of the work day. Moreover, this Court has applied the going-and-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>coming provision in the other two seminal lunchtime injury cases relevant for this appeal.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Furthermore, Professor Larson, a recognized authority in this area, expressly includes the subject of injuries that occur during lunchtime in his section on \u201cgoing to and from work.\u201d See 1 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 15, p 4-3. He argues that there is no analytical difference between the character of (1) an employee\u2019s travel to work before he begins his day or from work after he finishes his day, and (2) his travel to work after lunch or when he leaves from work before lunch. See \u00a7 15.12(b), pp 4-17 to 4-21, \u00a7 15.51, p 4-157.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Thus, the Court\u2019s resolution of <em>McClure </em>is relevant for this case because the going-and-coming provision governs the resolution of lunchtime travel cases. With these principles in mind, we now review the Court of Appeals resolution of the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-3\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">In holding that plaintiff did not suffer an injury that was compensable under worker\u2019s compensation, the Court of Appeals examined Michigan case law on the \u201cgoing to work\u201d parking lot cases and concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>an employee may recover only where there is \u201cat least some slight employer connection to the employee\u2019s injury . . . <em>Simkins, supra </em>at 457. It distilled these two principles from the Court of Appeals case law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-6\">Cases allowing compensation for employees injured while going to work involved travel from a parking area owned, leased, or maintained by the employer. . . [<footnotemark>31</footnotemark>] Compensation has been denied, however, when the injury occurred off the employer\u2019s premises, including private parking areas . . . ,[<footnotemark>32</footnotemark>] <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">This analysis accords with Professor Larson\u2019s examination of state case law for the United States for an injury that occurs between an employer\u2019s parking lot and the employer\u2019s worksite:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-8\">[M]ost courts, but by no means all, hold that an injury in a public street or other off-premises place between the plant and the parking lot is in the course of employment, being on a <em>necessary </em>route between the two portions of the premises. <em>But if the parking lot is a purely private one, the principle of passage between two parts of the premises is not available, and an employee crossimg a public street to get to the parking lot is not protected. </em>[1 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 15.14(b), pp 4-60 to 4-70 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">This analysis is also consistent with the result in <em>McClure </em>(the employee was injured while crossing a public street when he was traveling from work to a restaurant).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>We adopt the standard articulated by the Court of Appeals and hold that, when an employee is going to work or coming from work, an injury that occurs on property not owned, leased, or maintained by his employer is in the course of employment only if the employee is traveling in a reasonably direct route<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> between the parking area owned, leased, or maintained by the employer and the worksite itself, unless the injury falls into one of the recognized exceptions.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In such circumstances, the place of the injury, although not on property owned, leased, or maintained by the employer, is deemed to be on the employer\u2019s \u201cpremises\u201d for the purposes of the statute. See <em>Lasiewicki, supra </em>at 131 (property maintained, but not owned or leased, by an employer is the employer\u2019s \u201cpremises\u201d under the statute).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> However, we hold that there is no recovery for an employee who is injured on a public street or other property not owned, leased, or maintained by the employer while traveling to or from a nonemployer parking lot because this injury is not in the course of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>This rule conforms to the original purpose underlying the going-and-coming provision, i.e., to protect employees while they were still on the employer\u2019s premises but no longer actually performing their jobs. See <em>Freiborg, supra </em>at 107 (Dethmers, C.J.). We recognize that the statute does not, according to the past rulings of this Court, strictly require that the employee be on the employer\u2019s property, but merely requires that the employee be \u201c \u2018at or <em>near </em>his place of employment.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Consequently, the rule allows recovery for injuries that occur on property not owned, leased, or maintained by the employer, but limits the principle to a situation in which the employer has some control or responsibility over the area.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The employer has some control or responsibility over an area when it anticipates that employees will travel between the worksite and the parking lot it provided, because it has implicitly created or designed a path for its employees. This distinction does not introduce the question of fault in determining whether an injured employee is eligible for recovery under the statute, e.g., by requiring implicitly that the employer\u2019s negligence be the cause of the injury. Rather, for injuries that occur on property not owned, leased, or maintained by the employer, the rule requires that the injury be during the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>employment, i.e., that the injury be work related, by ensuring that there is a more substantial relationship between the injury and the injured person\u2019s employment beyond the mere fact that the employee was traveling to or from work.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-3\">The Court of Appeals noted that this analysis may conflict with <em>Fischer v Lincoln Tool &amp; Die Co, </em>37 Mich App 198; 194 NW2d 476 (1971), but this case has been previously questioned. See <em>Tedford v Stouffer\u2019s Northland Inn, </em>106 Mich App 493, 501-502; 308 NW2d 254 (1981), citing 1 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 15.12, p 4-10. We do not address the validity of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">In the instant case, the Court of Appeals reversed the wcab and denied plaintiff worker\u2019s compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Plaintiff argues that the Court of Appeals decision cannot be reconciled with the earlier Court of Appeals decision to reverse the wcab\u2019s denial of grant in <em>Smith v Greenville Products Co, </em>185 Mich App 512; 462 NW2d 789 (1990). In <em>Smith, </em>an employee was struck by a car on a public street while walking from the employer-provided parking lot to his worksite. The Court noted that the employee could recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>worker\u2019s compensation even though there was \u201canother route to defendant\u2019s plant which would not require him to cross the street . . . <em>Id. </em>at 516. Under the rule articulated by this opinion, this is the proper result because the employee was traveling to work from his employer\u2019s parking lot to the worksite. Although there was at least one other route available to him,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals concluded that the plaintiff was not engaged \u201cin an activity of a personal character when he was crossing the street\u201d to travel to his worksite. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the plaintiff was presumably traveling in a reasonably direct path for an employee to take to go to work.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">In the instant case, Simkins originally drove to a parking lot maintained by General Motors, left this lot, and traveled to a private lot with a coemployee before she traveled to her worksite. The stipulation is silent regarding her reason for traveling to this private lot, and the stipulation also does not explain whether this was a reasonably direct route from the employer-provided lot to her worksite. Rather than resolve these factual questions on appeal, we remand this matter to the WCAC for further proceedings. We also direct the commission to provide the parties a full opportunity to present additional facts regarding these issues to ensure a proper resolution of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b877-3\">We conclude that under the going-and-coming provision of \u00a7 301 of the worker\u2019s compensation act, an employee is injured in the course of his employment while traveling to or from work when either (1) the injury occurred on property owned, leased, or maintained by the employer, or (2) the injury occurred while the employee was traveling on a reasonably direct path between the worksite and an employee parking lot owned, leased, or maintained by the employer. This framework is consistent with the way this Court has interpreted the going-and-coming provision, fulfills the statute\u2019s purposes, generally fits Michigan case law, and reflects the general rule articulated by Professor Larson. We vacate the Court of Appeals decision reversing the wcab\u2019s decision to uphold the hearing referee\u2019s grant of worker\u2019s compensation benefits and remand to the wcac for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b877-4\">Brickley, C.J., and Levin, Cavanagh, Boyle, and Mat,lett, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b857-8\"> The Second Injury Fund is a state insurance fund created by the Legislature under MCL 418.501 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.237(501) <em>et seq., </em>financed by annual assessments on insurance carriers and self-insured employers. <em>McAvoy v H B Sherman Co, </em>401 Mich 419, 450; 258 NW2d 414 (1977).

The <em>Fischer </em>Court awarded worker\u2019s compensation benefits to an employee, who was injured while walking to work after parking her car on a public street. The <em>Fischer </em>Court considered the street to be part of the employer\u2019s \u201cpremises,\u201d as defined by the worker\u2019s compensation statute, because the employer failed to provide parking and therefore, expected its employees to park on the public street. <em>Id. </em>at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">This determination by the Court of Appeals was appropriately and persuasively criticized in <em>Tedford v Stouffer\u2019s Northland Inn, </em>106 Mich App 493, 501-502; 308 NW2d 254 (1981), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-8\">The implicit trend in this manner of decision making is a steady dilution of legislative limitations on compensation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>The Supreme Court has specifically disapproved of such judicial \u201creform\u201d of the compensation act. <em>[McClure v General Motors Corp (On Rehearing), </em>408 Mich 191, 204; 289 NW2d 631 (1980).] While the statutory coming-and-going rule does not directly limit coverage to on-premise injuries ... it must be remembered that the rule is an exception to the basic requirement that compensable injuries arise out of and in the course of the employment. <em>[Id. </em>at 502 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-3\"><em>Fischer </em>is an unnecessary expansion of the statutory coming-and-going rule of the worker\u2019s compensation act because it extends liability to situations that the employer has neither created nor controls. <em>Id. </em>at 502, citing 1 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 15.12, p 4-10.
