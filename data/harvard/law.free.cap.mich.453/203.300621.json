We hold that MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096 does not impinge on this Court\u2019s authority to determine practice and procedure and does not require a literal definition of miscarriage of justice. On direct review, the reviewing court is not to apply the standard for preserved constitutional error of harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>People v Anderson (After Remand), </em>446 Mich 392; 521 NW2d 538 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">The statute is consistent with the view of the Court in <em>Kotteakos v United States, </em>328 US 750; 66 S Ct 1239; 90 L Ed 1557 (1946). Under our statute, as under federal law, a reviewing court is not to find nonconstitutional preserved error harmless simply because it concludes the jury reached the right result. Disregarding errors that do not affect substantial rights, the reviewing court is to examine the record as a whole and the actual prejudicial effect of the error on the factfinder in the case at hand. <em>People v Lee, </em>434 Mich 59; 450 NW2d 883 (1990). Where the error asserted is the erroneous admission of evidence, the court engages in a comparative analysis of the likely effect of the error in light of the other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Because in this case the Court of Appeals correctly found overwhelming evidence of guilt, it does not affirmatively appear that there has been a miscarriage of justice. <em>People v Straight, </em>430 Mich 418; 424 NW2d 257 (1988). Given that the evidence of guilt was overwhelming, it is unnecessary to reach the question of the level of confidence the reviewing court must have in the harmlessness of preserved error. The government has briefed only the <em>Kotteakos </em>standard, and the defendant has briefed only the <em>Chapman </em>standard. <em>Chapman v California, </em>386 US 18; 87 S Ct 824; 17 L Ed 2d 705 (1967). While the highly probable standard may represent the appropriate test for the reasons discussed below, on an issue of such overriding importance to the jurisprudence of the state, formal adoption of this standard should not be undertaken without further assistance from the bench and bar.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">On the date the events giving rise to this case took place, defendant, Raul Mateo, was living with Elva Lulgjurflj and their three children. Jose Cantu, Lulgjurflj\u2019s brother and the victim in this case, was temporarily living with them at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Cantu testified that he and defendant got into an argument in the early morning hours on January 12, 1990. Cantu had apparently made a comment regarding whether defendant was going to move out of the house and defendant took offense. After a brief verbal exchange, defendant left the room and returned with a pistol, placed it against Cantu\u2019s head, and threatened to \u201cblow [his] brains out.\u201d Cantu managed to knock the pistol from defendant\u2019s hand and pushed him out of the room. Defendant soon returned with a knife in each hand and repeatedly slashed Cantu in the head and arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Cantu managed to escape and ran to a nearby gas station. Maria Cantu, Jose Cantu\u2019s mother, testified that her son called her, told her that Mateo had cut him, that she picked him up from the gas station and took him back to her home and then to the hospital. The fact that the victim was cut was also supported by the hospital records. Two police officers also testified without objection that Cantu\u2019s sister had identified Mateo as the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Defendant was charged with assault with intent to murder,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> felonious assault,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and as a second felony offender.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>At trial, defendant presented an alibi through Crystal Blair, a former girlfriend, who testified that defendant was with her during the time the attack took place. Defendant did not testify. The prosecutor cross-examined Blair about certain phone conversations Blair had with another former girlfriend of defendant, Jennifer Brecht. Blair denied having conversations about defendant with Brecht. The prosecutor then called Brecht who, over objection, testified that Blair had called her and warned her that defendant was \u201cvery violent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Defendant was convicted as charged. Defendant appealed, alleging that Brecht\u2019s testimony was improper rebuttal on a collateral issue. The Court of Appeals agreed. In spite of the error, however, the Court went on to conclude that the evidence against defendant was \u201coverwhelming\u201d and that any error in admitting Brecht\u2019s testimony \u201cwas harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Defendant, in propria persona, filed a delayed application for leave to appeal with this Court. The application was initially held in abeyance for <em>People v Dunn, </em>446 Mich 409; 521 NW2d 255 (1994). Following release of that case, we granted leave, limited to \u201c(1) whether the trial court erred in permitting witness Brecht to testify as a rebuttal witness, (2) what is the appropriate standard for determining when nonconstitutional error in admitting evidence is reversible, and (3) whether any error in the admission of the testimony of witness Brecht was error requiring reversal.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>We agree with the Court of Appeals that, in these circumstances, extrinsic evidence of defendant\u2019s assaultive behavior was error. While the nature of Blair\u2019s relationship with the defendant was relevant to her credibility, and she had testified on direct examination that their relationship was good, it is unclear how any assaultive behavior in that relationship bore on Blair\u2019s credibility. <em>People v Figgures, </em>451 Mich 390; 547 NW2d 673 (1996). The prosecutor does not argue that Blair\u2019s testimony was prompted by fear of the defendant, but, rather, contends that the testimony was directed to revealing facts of favoritism toward the defendant. <em>United States v Abel, </em>469 US 45, 52; 105 S Ct 465; 83 L Ed 2d 450 (1984). While the scope of rebuttal is within the trial court\u2019s discretion, we find that extrinsic evidence of defendant\u2019s assaultive behavior was error. 1 McCormick, Evidence (4th ed), \u00a7 40, p 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Finding preserved nonconstitutional error, we now discuss the proper standard for assessing the effect of the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">The legislative framework for appellate resolution of this question has guided appellate review in criminal cases for almost fifty years. It is consistent with the Court\u2019s authority to regulate practice and procedure. Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 5.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>We are not required to decide whether our harmless error statute is a legislative attempt to supplant the Court\u2019s authority.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Correct construction of the statute does not dictate a literal reading of the term \u201cmiscarriage of justice.\u201d The legislative history of the former federal statute, 28 USC 391, adopted in the same time frame as the Michigan statute, indicates that review is to be rendered \u201c \u2018without presuming that any error which may appear had been of necessity prejudicial to the complaining party.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v Lane, </em>474 US 438, 458; 106 S Ct 725; 88 L Ed 2d 814 (1986), quoting HR Rep No. 913. This reflects the view of Secretary of War Taft that \u201c \u2018[n]o judgment of the court below should be reversed except for an error which the court, after hearing [sic] the entire evidence, can affirmatively say would have led [the jury] to a different verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Likewise, our statute should not be construed to require actual innocence, but, rather, it should be viewed as a legislative directive to presume the validity of verdicts and to reverse only with respect to those errors that affirmatively appear to undermine the reliability of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Given that there is no inherent conflict between the statute and the standard we create today for appellate review, we should (1) affirm that reversal is not required unless an error is harmful, and (2) clarify which of the conflicting standards used in past decisions by our state courts is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">In Michigan, the harmless-error rule is primarily embodied in statute,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> with additional statements of the doctrine in our court rule<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and evidentiary rule.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d language in our statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>as well as the date of enactment,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> supports the conclusion that it was part of a general movement in state courts to adopt the approach of the English Judicature Act, rejecting reversals for technical errors. 3 LaFave &amp; Israel, Criminal Procedure, \u00a7 26.6(a), pp 257-258. The Judicature Act provided that the Court of Appeals was not to order a new trial on the basis of \u201cthe improper admission or rejection of evidence\u201d or a misdirection of the jury \u201cunless . . . some substantial wrong or <em>miscarriage </em>has thereby been occasioned.\u201d Traynor, The Riddle of Harmless Error (Ohio State Univ Press, 1970), p 10 and-n 22 (emphasis added). As Professors LaFave and Israel point out, \u201cAmerican appellate courts recognized that the newly adopted harmless error legislation, . . . had a different frame of reference as to different types of rights.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 258. With regard to error of the type covered by the English Judicature Act, the American legislation remained concerned with whether the error had resulted in a \u201cmiscarriage of justice,\u201d <em>id., </em>e.g., whether an error had a sufficient bearing on the whole trial proceeding to require reversal. The intent of the miscarriage-of-justice standard used in such harmless-error legislation to encompass the English approach is evidenced by legislative directive to examine the entire record. <em>Id., </em>p 259. Thus, the Legislature\u2019s directive to examine the entire record to find whether it \u201caffirmatively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>appear[s] that ... a miscarriage of justice\u201d has occurred supports the conclusion that, for the evidentiary error here alleged, reversal should be predicated by evaluating the error against the remaining evidence. \u201cIt was in the tradition of testing an evidentiary error against the remaining evidence (both for effect and relevance) that an examination of the full record was most likely to be needed.\u201d LaFave &amp; Israel, p 259. Thus, as further noted (and as reflected in numerous cases decided under our statute):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">As for some types of error, such as the erroneous admission or exclusion of evidence, overwhelming evidence of guilt will ordinarily lead to the conclusion that the error was harmless. It would take evidence of an extraordinary quality to conclude that its erroneous admission or exclusion may have contributed to the verdict where the government had before the jury other evidence that could clearly and positively establish guilt. <em>[Id., </em>\u00a7 26.6(b), p 269.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The statute and court rules employ different articulations of what constitutes a harmful error \u2014 \u201cmiscarriage of justice,\u201d \u201cinconsistent with substantial justice,\u201d \u201caffecting substantial rights.\u201d Each conveys, however, a need for a determination of prejudice.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-7\">[T]he rule always in effect in Michigan, both before and after enactment of the mentioned statutes and unaffected thereby, has been and is that the question of reversal is controlled by determination of whether the error was prejudicial. <em>[People v Nichols, </em>341 Mich 311, 332; 67 NW2d 230 (1954).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Any reliance on earlier cases for the proposition that the statutory test is whether the defendant was actually guilty, see <em>Soltar v Anderson, </em>340 Mich 242, 244; 65 NW2d 777 (1954); <em>People v Bigge, </em>288 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>417, 421; 285 NW 5 (1939), is incorrect. We have since recognized, in accord with the precedent of all sister states and federal courts, LaFave &amp; Israel, \u00a7 26.6, p 258, that the statute and rules are merely \u201cdifferent articulations of the same idea: appellate courts should not reverse a conviction unless the error was prejudicial.\u201d <em>People v Robinson, </em>386 Mich 551, 562; 194 NW2d 709 (1972).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Simply stated, and employed in both federal rule and case law and state statute and court rule, reversal is only required if the error was prejudicial. That inquiry focuses on the nature of the error and assesses its effect in light of the weight and strength of the untainted evidence. See, e.g., <em>People v Peterson, </em>450 Mich 349, 377-378; 537 NW2d 857 (1995), amended 450 Mich 1212 (1995); <em>People v Straight, supra </em>at 427; <em>People v Young (After Remand), </em>425 Mich 470, 505; 391 NW2d 270 (1986); see also, e.g., <em>Kotteakos, supra </em>at 764-765; <em>Lane, supra </em>at 455-460 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The view that preserved nonconstitutional error should be reviewed under the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard is incompatible with the history and purpose of the statute and court rules. As noted above and explained in Kotteakos, <em>swpra </em>at 759-760, the harmless-error statute analyzed in that case,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> as well as state laws such as those enacted and currently in force in Michigan, were aimed at curbing \u201cthe general course of appellate review in American criminal causes\u201d to reverse decisions because of the occurrence of inconsequential, technical errors. <em>Id. </em>at 759. The purpose of these statutes was stated in <em>Kotteakos:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">To substitute judgment for automatic application of rules; to preserve review as a check upon arbitrary action and essential unfairness in trials, but at the same time to make the process perform that function without giving men fairly convicted the multiplicity of loopholes which any highly rigid and minutely detailed scheme of errors, especially in relation to procedure, will engender and reflect in a printed record. <em>[Id. </em>at 760.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The triumph of judgment over technicality described above and incorporated in our own statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>provides no basis for raising the bar of confidence in the harmlessness of an error to \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The fundamental protections of individual liberties embodied in constitutional rights are not at issue when the error is not of constitutional dimension.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The United States Supreme Court in <em>Chapman, supra </em>at 24, expressly limited its holding to federal constitutional errors, and the federal courts have continued to maintain a distinction in the standard of review of constitutional and nonconstitutional errors. <em>United States v Pirovolos, </em>844 F2d 415, 425 (CA 7, 1988). Justice Cavanagh fails to provide a persuasive reason for requiring this Court to proceed on a different course.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Courts have historically and correctly employed the miscarriage of justice standard by evaluating the nature of the error in light of the entire record. See, e.g., <em>Peterson, supra </em>at 377-379 (holding that errors did not affect the jury\u2019s decision to convict, and thus did not result in a miscarriage of justice); <em>People v Pickens, </em>446 Mich 298, 334; 521 NW2d 797 (1994) (holding that error did not prejudice the defendant under the statutory miscarriage-of-justice standard); <em>Straight, supra </em>at 427 (applying the harmless-error statute, and finding proper direction in its inquiry from <em>Kotteakos, </em>the Court held that it could not \u201csafely conclude\u201d that the erroneously admitted evidence did not have a substantial influence on the jury\u2019s result); <em>Young, supra </em>at 505 (holding that error in admission of evidence was not harmless, quoting from <em>Kotteakos </em>for a statement of proper appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>inquiry); <em>People v Wilcox, </em>303 Mich 287, 296; 6 NW2d 518 (1942) (in affirming the defendant\u2019s conviction, the Court disposed of \u201csome slight errors\u201d alleged by the defendant, concluding that \u201ceven if there is any merit to them, they could not have affected the result or resulted in a miscarriage of justice\u201d); <em>People v Lahnala, </em>193 Mich 144, 163; 159 NW 352 (1916) (Ostrander, J.) (reversing and granting a new trial for prejudicial error, and concluding that \u201c[i]n my opinion, that is, and must always be, a miscarriage of justice\u201d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">There remains an issue of the level of assurance an appellate court on direct review must have that a preserved, nonconstitutional error was not prejudicial and thus harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">The <em>Kotteakos </em>test, as articulated by the prosecutor, does not definitively settle on this question.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Thus, as previously noted, federal courts have variously adopted tests described as a highly probable, more probable than not, and a reasonable likelihood that the error affected substantial rights. See n 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">After rejecting the rigid <em>Chapman </em>test,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> former Chief Justice Traynor\u2019s book on harmless error discusses two possible tests. The first test assesses whether it is <em>highly probable </em>that the challenged evidence did not contribute to the verdict.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The second test asks whether it is <em>more probable than not, </em>i.e., a preponderance of the evidence, that the error did not affect the verdict.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">After analyzing the above tests, Chief Justice Tray-nor argues that the highly probable test is most appropriate.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">The nebulous test of reasonableness is unlikely to foster uniformity either in the application of standards, should there be any, or in the pragmatic exercise of discretion. Discretion is at least under better control within tests that focus on the degree of probability as more probable than not, highly probable, or almost certain. I should welcome a test of high probability for harmlessness. Given an error that affected a substantial right, the judgment below is suspect. Unless the appellate court believes it highly probable that the error did not affect the judgment, it should reverse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">Any test less stringent entails too great a risk of affirming a judgment that was influenced by an error. Moreover, a less stringent test may fail to deter an appellate judge from focusing his inquiry on the correctness of the result and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>then holding an error harmless whenever he equated the result with his own predilections.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">There are objections also to the two tests that are more stringent than that of <em>high probability. </em>If the test were the mere presence of error, appellate courts could reverse, as many did in the nineteenth century, for any error, no matter how trivial. The end result was public disaffection with the judicial process. Almost as stringent is a test that would require reversal unless the court was <em>almost certain </em>that the error did not affect the judgment. [Traynor, The Riddle of Harmless Error, <em>supra, </em>pp 34-35.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">While Justice Traynor suggests that the highly probable test strikes the appropriate balance between protecting both the public and defendants\u2019 interests in fair trials, the prosecutor has not briefed or argued the question of the level of assurance that a proper construction of <em>Kotteakos </em>requires, and the defendant has briefed and argued only that the level of assurance should be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Given the absence of such input, it is unwise for this Court to unilaterally adopt a definitive standard. Further, it is unnecessary to do so. The Court of Appeals properly concluded that the evidence against the defendant was overwhelming.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> By definition, the error was harmless under any standard other than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number><em>Chapman </em>standard rejected here as unwarranted for nonconstitutional error.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">In summary, (1) MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096 is not a legislative usurpation of this Court\u2019s authority and miscarriage of justice must affirmatively appear on review of nonconstitutional preserved error. (2) Those courts analyzing preserved error in terms of their view regarding whether the defendant is guilty have been wrong. The defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial by jury requires that preserved error be reviewed in terms of its effect on the factfinder. (3) Those courts analyzing nonconstitutional error for harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt have proceeded in error. (4) Those courts denying relief because the preserved error had only slight or negligible influence on the verdict have proceeded correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Defendant\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b371-7\">Brickley, C.J., and Riley, Mallett, and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-6\"> The separate opinion observes that <em>\u201cKotteakos </em>contains its own level of confidence and assurance tests, namely, the question is whether the error had \u2018substantial influence\u2019 on the trier of fact . . . <em>Post </em>at 259. Despite this observation, and explicit language urging this Court to \u201cadopt wholeheartedly the approach of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Kotteakos,\u201d post </em>at 242, the author claims to adopt the highly probable test, but never applies that test in reaching the ultimate conclusion that Mateo was denied constitutionally effective assistance of counsel. To the contrary, in analyzing the facts of this case, the separate opinion states that it is \u201c[ajpplying the <em>Kotteakos </em>standard,\u201d <em>post </em>at 264, to determine whether the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">The separate opinion never establishes the relationship between the <em>Kotteakos </em>standard and the highly probable standard. If the two standards are the same, there would seem to be no need to adopt the highly probable test. If the standards are different, the analysis in the application section of the separate opinion sheds no light on how they differ. Thus, the separate opinion itself illustrates the wisdom of further argument regarding whether <em>Kotteakos </em>contains its own level of confidence, whether another level of assurance is appropriate, and how various formulations of <em>Kotteakos </em>would be applied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b358-8\"> MCL 750.83; MSA 28.278.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b358-9\"> MCL 750.82; MSA 28.277.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b358-10\"><em> </em>MCL 769.10; MSA 28.1082.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b359-7\"> Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued February 17, 1993 (Docket No. 134528), slip op at 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b359-8\"> 448 Mich 868 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b360-8\"> Moreover, if MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096 is not controlling on this Court for harmless error review, what about the language of MCL 768.29; MSA 28.1052 (duty of a judge at trial) or MCL 722.28; MSA 25.312(8) (standard of appellate review in child custody cases)?

Numerous other examples could be cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b361-5\"> It is argued that a harmless error rule is procedural. As Judge Traynor observes, the Morgan classification of rules of law as substance or procedure are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">\u201cThe rules which determine the legal relations between the parties when all the facts are known or assumed are rules of substance.\u201d [Quoting Morgan, <em>Rules of evidence: Substantive or procedural? </em>10 Vand L R 467-468 (1957).] Within these terms, a harmless-error rule could hardly be deemed procedural. . . . Far from being procedural, a harmless-error rule is of a piece with substantive rules, for it too is a mandate to the judge, at this stage the appellate judge, calling for the last word on the legal effect of the findings.

First, is the error so offensive to the maintenance of a sound judicial process that it never can be regarded as harmless? See <em>People v Bigge, </em>288 Mich 417, 421 [285 NW 5] (1939); <em>People v Berry, </em>10 Mich App 469, 474 [157 NW2d 310] (1968); <em>People v Mosley, </em>338 Mich 559, 566 [61 NW2d 785] (1953). See also <em>Chapman v California, </em>386 US 18, 23, 24 (87 S Ct 824; 17 L Ed 2d 705 [1967]), rehearing denied 386 US 987 (87 S Ct 1283; 18 L Ed 2d 241) [(1967)]. Second, if not so basic, can we declare a belief that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt? See <em>People v Liggett, </em>378 Mich 706, 716, 717 [148 NW2d 784] (1967); <em>Chapman v California, supra.\u201d [Robinson, </em>386 Mich 562-563.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">This Court later unanimously applied the <em>Robinson </em>standard in a case with strong similarities to the instant case. <em>People v Belenor, </em>408 Mich 244, 247; 289 NW2d 719 (1980). The <em>Belenor </em>Court held that error, like that which occurred here, was to be judged under the <em>Robinson </em>harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard. <em>Id. </em>at 247. The Court did not engage in any discussion of whether this improper impeachment evidence was nonconstitutional error or constitutional error (perhaps as prosecutorial misconduct or as a violation of the right to a fair trial). Again, the <em>Belenor </em>Court must be presumed to have been aware of the distinction between nonconstitutional error and constitutional error and have concluded that the <em>Robinson </em>harmless error standard applied to all error that was amenable to harmless error analysis. See also <em>People v Howe, </em>392 Mich 670, 678; 221 NW2d 350 (1974) (jury request to reread testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Even if we were writing on a clean slate today, I would adopt a uniform harmless error standard for all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>errors that are subject to harmless error analysis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The line between evidentiary error and constitutional error is rarely clear. One prominent example is the case law involving the statement against penal interest exception to the hearsay rule. MRE 804(b)(3). That particular \u201cevidentiary\u201d rule\u2019s outer parameters are directly determined by the constitutional ramifications. For instance, if the statement is used to <em>inculpate </em>the accused, the defendant\u2019s constitutional right of confrontation is implicated. <em>People v </em>Poole, 444 Mich 151; 506 NW2d 505 (1993). In contrast, if the statement is used to <em>exculpate </em>the accused, the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to present a defense is implicated. <em>Chambers v Mississippi, </em>410 US 284; 93 S Ct 1038; 35 L Ed 2d 297 (1973). When the issue is whether a hearsay statement should be admitted under MRE 804(b)(3), the <em>constitutional </em>concerns are <em>inseparable </em>from the determination whether the trial court erred in its <em>evidentiary </em>ruling. <em>People v Barrera, </em>451 Mich 261, 279; 547 NW2d 280 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Additionally, by holding today that there is a difference between nonconstitutional error and constitutional error, this Court is opening the doors to increasing litigation, by adding yet another issue to an appellate court\u2019s analysis. This Court today telegraphs that there must be a significant difference between the harmless error standards for constitutional error and for nonconstitutional error and that the difference between the two standards will be <em>outcome-determinative </em>\u2014 for if the difference is <em>not </em>outcome-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>determinative, then this Court has no need today to distinguish a separate standard. After today, if the Court of Appeals applies the wrong standard, and my colleagues have yet to agree on the right standard, a remand, if not reversal, <em>by definition, </em>will be required because the <em>difference </em>between the standards is outcome-determinative. Likewise, if the defense counsel erroneously argues that the error falls within the wrong category, there will be an additional, and <em>meritorious, </em>claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. My colleagues have failed to explain persuasively why this nebulous maze is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Moreover, I believe that the adoption of a \u201clesser\u201d standard with respect to nonconstitutional error implicitly threatens constitutional rights. I believe that for those errors that are amenable to harmless error analysis, the harmless error standard should remain: the nontainted evidence was so overwhelming and the error was so <em>relatively </em>insignificant, that the appellate court is led to the conclusion that the actual jury would have convicted <em>regardless </em>of the error because there is no reasonable possibility that the error could have contributed to the verdict. In other words, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The most basic justification commanding this uniform standard is that the constitution requires that <em>every </em>factual element of guilt be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 US 358, 364; 90 S Ct 1068; 25 L Ed 2d 368 (1970). In sharp contrast, under my colleagues\u2019 views, something short of proven beyond a reasonable doubt will be sufficient. This inherently translates into an appellate court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>impermissibly directing a verdict for the prosecution, violating the defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Starting with that axiom, I note that I am not the first to believe that a uniform standard must be applied, and I quote below the persuasive reasoning of two courts that have adopted such a standard, expressly rejecting the federal approach. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court stated in <em>Commonwealth v </em>Story, 476 Pa 391, 406-409; 383 A2d 155 (1978):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">Several considerations persuade us that the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard is the proper standard to apply in determining the harmlessness of <em>any </em>criminal trial error. First, this standard is commensurate with the standard of proof in criminal trials \u2014 that an accused cannot be convicted unless the trier of fact is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty as charged. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 US 358; 90 S Ct 1068; 25 L Ed 2d 368 (1970). In order to maintain the integrity of this standard, appellate courts should utilize a comparable standard in determining whether an error was harmless. Professor Saltzburg has observed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">\u201cIt would make little sense to adopt the <em>Winship </em>standard, which is designed to prevent criminal convictions if there is even a reasonable doubt in the minds of jurors as to the guilt of the person charged, and then on appeal to emasculate that evidentiary standard when the trial court has violated evidentiary rules which might have influenced the jury by creating the requisite doubt. . . . [Cjonvictions must be reversed where the appellate court cannot arrive at a conclusion about the impact of an error on the jury verdict with the same degree of certainty demanded at trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">Saltzburg, <em>The harm of harmless error, </em>59 Va L Rev 988, 992 (1973).12</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-9\">Second, there are sound reasons for applying the same standard for determining harmless error whether the error violates state or federal law. State rules often implicate constitutional values, and the violation of a state rule may rise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>to the level of a federal constitutional violation. The protection of constitutional rights, as well as the development of a coherent doctrine of harmless error, militate in favor of the application of the same standard for constitutional and non-constitutional errors. Because it may be unclear whether a well established state rule is also constitutionally mandated, separate harmless error standards might prove to be unworkable. Moreover, a more relaxed harmless error standard for errors perceived as violations of state rules, but which might also be violations of the federal Constitution, would leave constitutional values inadequately protected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">Third, it is irrelevant whether an error is constitutional or non-constitutional in determining whether the error is prejudicial to the accused. Constitutional errors are not inherently more injurious to an accused than errors under state law. There is no reason why a state court should apply a stricter harmless error standard to federal constitutional rules than to state rules, especially since the purpose of most state rules is to assure a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">Finally, there is the danger that a lenient harmless error rule may denigrate the interests and policies which both constitutional and non-constitutional rules promote. We are convinced that the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard reaches the proper balance of competing considerations implicated in the harmless error rule. . . . We believe that the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard reaches the most reasonable balance between the consideration of judicial economy and the important policies which underlie constitutional and non-constitutional rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">Having articulated the proper standard of proof in determining whether an error is harmless, we must now address the proper definition of harmlessness, for any theory of harmless error must include both the standard of the degree to which an appellate court must be convinced that an error is harmless and the definition of harmlessness. We adopt the standard that an error cannot be held harmless unless the appellate court determines that the error could not have contributed to the verdict. Whenever there is a \u201c \u2018reasonable possibility\u2019 \u201d that an error \u201c \u2018might have contributed to the conviction,\u2019 \u201d the error is not harmless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>12 Accord, <em>Commonwealth v Davis, </em>452 Pa 171, 177; 305 A2d 715, 719 (1973) (citations omitted):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">\u201cThis reasonable doubt standard reflects a fundamental belief that once . . . error has been established, it is far worse to conclude incorrectly that the error was harmless than it is to conclude incorrectly that the error was reversible.\u201d_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">[Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Similarly, the Maryland Court of Appeals explained in <em>Dorsey v State, </em>276 Md 638, 657-658; 350 A2d 665 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">As we see it, there is no sound reason for drawing a distinction between the treatment of those errors which are of constitutional dimension and those other evidentiary, or procedural, errors which may have been committed during a trial. Although the Amendments to the United States Constitution are commonly considered a source of fair judicial procedure, other nonconstitutional evidentiary and procedural rules, signifying state policy with respect to judicial fairness, are often a defendant\u2019s primary source of protection. An evidentiary or procedural error in a trial is bound, in some fashion, to affect the delicately balanced, decisional process. The abnegation of a particular rule upon which the defense intended to rely may often inflict more damage than initially apparent; a meritorious line of defense may be abandoned as a result; an important witness may not be called; strategies are often forsaken. The future course of the trial inevitably must be changed to accommodate the rulings made. It is the impact of the erroneous ruling upon the defendant\u2019s trial and the effect it has upon the decisional process which is of primary concern, not whether the error is labelled as constitutional or nonconstitutional. Invariably, a number of constitutional rights, be they of federal or state origin, are inexorably intertwined with state rules of evidence and procedure. Regardless of the generic nature of the error, we believe that upon appellate review, a uniform test should be applied in all criminal cases to determine the effect the error may have had on the verdict. [Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Later, the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">We think it worthwhile to repeat here the caveat set forth in <em>Younie v State </em>[272 Md 233, 248; 322 A2d 211 (1974)], that the harmless error rule \u201chas been and should be carefully circumscribed for the reasons given in <em>People v Jablonski, </em>38 Mich App 33, 39; 195 NW2d 777, 780 (1972), where it is said that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">\u2018Continued expansion of the harmless error rule will merely encourage prosecutors to attempt to get such testimony in, since they know that, if they have a strong case, such testimony will not be considered to be reversible error, yet if they have a weak case, they will use such testimony to buttress the case to gain a conviction and then hope that the issue is not raised on appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Dorsey, </em>276 Md 661.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">For all these reasons, I would maintain the <em>Robinson </em>course in Michigan of using a uniform harmless error standard for preserved errors that are subject to harmless error analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Although Justice Boyle declines to adopt a standard, and consequently the remainder of her opinion is dicta, she does hint at her view of what that standard should and should not be.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">I do not disagree with Justice Boyle that where a reviewing court affirmatively<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> finds that a preserved, nontechnical error did not prejudice the defendant it should not reverse. Nor do I disagree that where a reviewing court affirmatively finds that such error did prejudice the defendant it must reverse. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Justice Boyle and I disagree with respect to the cases that fall in between those two extremes.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The issue then becomes, on which side should the reviewing court land. In those cases where the reviewing court is not sure whether the error was harmful or harmless, I believe that the constitutional guarantees to the defendant leave the reviewing court no choice but to err on the side of caution and reverse. In contrast, Justice Boyle seems to suggest that the reviewing court may affirm a conviction even if it cannot affirmatively say that the error was harmless. This is not correct. The question always must be whether an error was <em>harmless.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The reviewing court should start its analysis from the premise that a preserved error <em>requires </em>reversal <em>unless </em>it finds under the requisite level of confidence that the error was harmless. It should not start from the premise that reversal is <em>not </em>required <em>unless </em>it finds that such error was harmful. Justice Boyle\u2019s statements suggest that, when in doubt, the reviewing court should side with the prosecutor. This is a misreading of the harmless error standard advocated by Justice Traynor to which Justice Boyle alludes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">I believe that a test for <em>harmful </em>error violates the constitutional guarantees to the defendant of having guilt proven beyond a reasonable doubt and of having a fair trial.

Accordingly, I would reverse the conviction. However, even under a \u201clesser\u201d standard, I believe that the error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The separate opinion states that if \u201cthe whole record\u201d consisted of the testimony of the victim Jose Cantu, the defense witness Crystal Blair, and the improper rebuttal testimony of Jennifer Brecht, it would hold that the error required reversal. <em>Post </em>at 264. However, by adding in the hearsay statement of the victim\u2019s sister Elva Lulgjurflj, the separate opinion finds that the error becomes harmless. I cannot agree with this latter conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Cantu testified that he had been staying temporarily with Lulgjurflj. Defendant Mateo was also living there, as well as Lulgjurflj\u2019s and Mateo\u2019s three children. At around 12:15 A.M. on the night of the assault, Cantu brought home a friend, Darrell Wilder, to play cards. Cantu alleged that after playing cards for up to three hours, he heard Mateo arrive home. Cantu then asked his friend to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Cantu testified that (while he was brushing his teeth in a bathroom) Mateo instigated an exchange with him about when he would be moving out. Mateo then retrieved a small silver gun from a nearby bedroom and threatened Cantu by placing the gun next to his chin. Cantu then slapped the gun out of Mateo\u2019s hand, and it landed under the sink or on the floor. (Police officers recovered the gun from the sink.) Cantu testified that he pushed Mateo out of the bathroom and closed the door. Mateo quickly returned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>with a steak knife in each hand and proceeded to knock the door down. Cantu sustained several cuts in the ensuing attack until he was able to escape out the front door of the house and run down the street to a gas station.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Mateo\u2019s defense was alibi, presenting the testimony of Blair who stated that Mateo was with her at the time of the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">My colleagues properly find sufficient evidence that Cantu was assaulted by someone. However, I cannot agree with the separate opinion that the straw that tips the scales in favor of the prosecution can be the hearsay statement of Lulgjurflj. Even if a reviewing court <em>can </em>properly consider unobjected-to hearsay statements \u2014 and I emphasize that this issue of first impression was neither briefed nor argued by the parties in this case \u2014 a hearsay statement that fails to fit within an exclusion or exception to the hearsay rule remains hearsay. It is inherently unreliable evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Moreover, on the facts in this case, the statement is especially unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Foremost, we should note that the officers did not attempt to retrieve fingerprints from the gun. They recovered it from the sink, although Cantu testified that it fell under the sink or on the floor. More importantly, the officers did not conduct a thorough search of the scene and never recovered any bloody knives- \u2014 -and, in fact, probably never entered the kitchen, where the last part of the assault allegedly occurred, even though it was only about ten feet from the bathroom. In sum, there was no physical evidence to identify Mateo as the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Additionally, the officers did not write down Lulgjurflj\u2019s statement, even though it was customary to do so. Their only notes with respect to her statement were that she confirmed Cantu\u2019s story. Their express testimony is informative.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Officer Wendy Keelty testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\"><em>Q. </em>And who did [Cantu] say did this to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-9\"><em>A. </em>He said- \u2014 he stated his sister\u2019s boyfriend, Raul.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-10\"><em>Q. </em>And did the sister confirm that also?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-11\"><em>A. </em>Yes, she did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">Officer Eulalio Reyes testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-13\"><em>Q. </em>And did you also see his sister, by the name of Alva [sic], at the mother\u2019s home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-15\"><em>A. </em>Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-16\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-17\"><em>Q. </em>And did she tell you who did this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATk\"><em>A. </em>Yes, she did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-18\"><em>Q. </em>And who did she say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-19\"><em>A. </em>Raul Mateo.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>On redirect Officer Reyes further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-4\"><em>Q. </em>And what did you put in your police report in regards to his sister?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\"><em>A. </em>That she stated the same as the victim and that she was the girlfriend of the responsible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\"><em>Q. </em>So you put two things, that she stated the same thing as the victim did about the incident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\"><em>A. </em>Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\"><em>Q. </em>And that she was the girlfriend of Raul Mateo?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\"><em>A. </em>Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-10\"><em>Q. </em>And those are the only two things you put in the report, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-11\"><em>A. </em>Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">Further, the detective in charge of the case, Santiago Serna, testified that Lulgjurflj refused to cooperate in the investigation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-13\"><em>Q. </em>Did you also attempt to contact his sister, Alva?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-14\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-15\"><em>Q. </em>And did you want her to make a statement, a written statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-16\"><em>A. </em>I wanted to meet with her.

She did not want to cooperate with me at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-17\">I could not get her to talk to me about anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-18\"><em>Q. </em>Now at that time were you aware that she had children by the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-19\"><em>A. </em>Yes, I was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-20\"><em>Q. </em>Now how many times did you serve a subpoena on Alva?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-21\"><em>A. </em>Yesterday . . . was the fourth time that I served the subpoena. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-22\"><em>Q. </em>Did she ever appear in court pursuant to any of the subpoenas that you\u2019ve served upon her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-a\"><em>A. </em>No, she has not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Moreover, the separate opinion fails to note that Cantu himself testified that Lulgjurflj could not have seen the stabbing during the assault because she was shut in another room. Most importantly, the trial judge, who was listening firsthand to the parties involved, did not believe that Lulgjurflj\u2019s testimony would assist the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\"><em>The Court: </em>Certainly. And you think she would testify for the People . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\"><em>[The </em>Prosecutor]: If she was here . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\"><em>The Court: </em>It doesn\u2019t sound like it from what the detective said. And [after] all of your investigation, she refuses to come in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Lulgjurflj was the mother of three of Mateo\u2019s children. The trial testimony revealed that he had other girlfriends during their time together. Lulgjurflj\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony clearly indicated that this was no secret. If Cantu had a motive to lie, as implicitly recognized by the separate opinion, I believe that Lulgjurflj may have had an even stronger motive to lie. Perhaps Lulgjurflj was angry with Mateo on the night in question and had a retaliatory motive in identifying him as the assailant. Or perhaps, Lulgjurflj did not see the assault at all and out of loyalty to her brother merely repeated what her brother had related to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">Nevertheless, the reliability of Lulgjurflj\u2019s statement was not tested through cross-examination. Further, in light of the fact that it was not reduced to written form, there is a likely possibility that at the time of the trial the officers did not completely remember her statement, which had been spoken to them six months earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>The bottom line is that this particularly unreliable hearsay statement cannot and should not be the outcome-determinative fact in this case. I believe that the separate opinion is focusing on an incorrect premise. There was not overwhelming evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. The only evidence identifying the <em>defendant </em>as the assailant was Cantu\u2019s testimony and the police officers\u2019 testimonies restating Cantu\u2019s and his sister\u2019s statements. In contrast, the defendant presented his alibi witness. If the sister\u2019s statement was cumulative or merely derivative of Cantu\u2019s statement, a jury confronted with two opposing versions of the events at issue would obviously be swayed by improper and highly prejudicial rebuttal testimony that both painted the alibi witness as a liar and painted Mateo\u2019s character as one prone to assaultive violence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Absent eyewitness <em>testimony </em>from a third party or corroborating physical evidence of identity, this Court cannot, under any standard, say that the erroneously admitted testimony did not affect the jury\u2019s decision and influence the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In sum, I would reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Levin, J. <em>(separate </em>opinion).

I would do so in the exercise of the Court\u2019s authority under the constitution, which confers the \u201cjudicial power of the state\u201d on \u201cone court of justice\u201d headed by this Court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and which confers on this Court \u201cappellate jurisdiction as provided by rules of the supreme court,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and which provides that \u201c[t]he supreme court shall by general rules establish, modify, amend and simplify the practice and procedure in all courts of this state.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">I agree with the majority that the standard on review for nonconstitutional error is not whether the error is harmless \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d I further agree that the harmlessness of preserved error should be \u201creviewed in terms of its effect on the factfinder,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that a reviewing court should engage \u201cin a comparative analysis of the likely effect of the error in light of the other evidence,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that the judgment entered by the trial court should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>affirmed if the \u201cerror had only slight or negligible influence on the verdict . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Although the majority speaks of error that is harmful<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as well as error that is harmless, it is clear, I think, that the majority and I are in agreement that if the error affects a substantial right of a defendant in a criminal case, and was prejudicial to the defendant and affected the verdict, that the error was harmful and hence not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">As I read the majority opinion,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">\u2022 \u201caffirmatively appears\u201d means what the reviewing court has found from an examination of the whole record;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">\u2022 there has been \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d if the error affects a substantial right of the defendant, and was prejudicial or harmful to the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">\u2022 The reviewing court should find that the error is prejudicial or harmful to the defendant unless it can state that it affirmatively appears from an examination of the whole record that the error did not affect the factfinder\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>I would, reaching the level of confidence or assurance question, hold that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">\u2022 While the harmless error inquiry for preserved constitutional error is whether the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, that is not the inquiry when the issue is whether preserved nonconstitutional error is harmless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">\u2022 The core concept is whether the defendant was prejudiced.

But if one cannot say, with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error, it is impossible to conclude that substantial rights were not affected. The inquiry cannot be merely whether there was enough to support the result, apart from the phase affected by the error. It is rather, even so, whether the error itself had substantial influence. If so, or if one is left in grave doubt, the conviction cannot stand. <em>[Id., </em>pp 764-765 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">It appears that the alternative expressions of the level of confidence or assurance an appellate court on direct review must have before declaring that a preserved nonconstitutional error was not prejudicial and, thus, harmless, are the \u201csubstantial influenceTgrave doubt\u201d standard set forth in <em>Kotteakos </em>itself, and the alternatives suggested by Justice Traynor of \u201chighly probable,\u201d adopted in most United States Courts of Appeals, or \u201cmore probable than not,\u201d not regularly employed in any circuit, the vague \u201cfair assurance\u201d test and the \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d test, adverted to in footnote 19 of the majority opinion, set forth in <em>United States v Hawkins, </em>905 F2d 1489, 1493 (CA 11, 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">This Court is adequately informed concerning the alternatives, and the briefing in this case is more than adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Further, the bench and bar have been awaiting a definitive statement from this Court since <em>People v Anderson (After Remand), </em>446 Mich 392, 407, n 39; 521 NW2d 538 (1994), was decided with the following observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Accordingly, we save for another day, after full briefing and argument, the distinction between, and the enunciation of, the constitutional harmless error test and Michigan\u2019s nonconstitutional harmless error test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">On the same day that <em>Anderson </em>was decided, this Court decided <em>People v Dunn, </em>446 Mich 409; 521 NW2d 255 (1994), where this Court concluded that the admission of tainted evidence was not harmless, but did so without reference to this Court\u2019s harmless error jurisprudence in deference to the decision reflected in <em>Anderson </em>to save until another day, after full briefing and argument, the elucidation of the standard for reviewing preserved nonconstitutional error. Also on the same day that <em>Anderson </em>and <em>Dunn </em>were decided, this Court decided <em>People v Stanaway, </em>446 Mich 643; 521 NW2d 557 (1994), where, in a separate opinion, a colleague observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">Despite guidance from both our court rules and statute, this Court has yet to fully examine the relevant considerations for nonconstitutional harmless error and certainly has failed to set forth a clear and concise nonconstitutional harmless-error test. Instead, this Court has generally chosen to rely on the harmless-error statute and court rules for the limited guidance provided therein in making this determination. <em>People v Travis, </em>443 Mich 668, 686; 505 NW2d 563 (1993). From a plain reading of these rules, however, the vague concept of injustice certainly does not provide any meaningful help to appellate courts in reviewing nonconstitutional error. <em>[Id., </em>pp 697-698 (Riley, J., concurring).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Lastly, Mateo\u2019s application for leave to appeal was held in abeyance pending this Court\u2019s decision in <em>People v Dunn, </em>which, for reasons already stated, did not decide the appropriate standard for determining when preserved nonconstitutional error requires reversal. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>granting leave to appeal in this case, we asked the parties to brief \u201cwhat is the appropriate standard for determining when nonconstitutional error in admitting evidence is reversible.\u201d See n 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">I would, therefore, complete the task, and decide the level of assurance or confidence question under the circumstances that the alternative possible tests have been considered and discussed in countless cases, the Court is fully informed, both from our own experiences in reviewing literally hundreds, if not thousands, of cases where the harmless error issue permeates the disposition at the Court of Appeals level and at this level, and the more than adequate briefing and independent research as reflected in the majority discussion of Justice Traynor\u2019s work on harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">vn</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">As stated in the concurring opinion in <em>Stanaway, </em>\u201cthe vague concept of injustice certainly does not provide any meaningful help to appellate courts in reviewing nonconstitutional error.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Nothing is gained, and much lost, by preserving the reformulated \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">There can be little doubt that it is ultimately this Court\u2019s responsibility, and not that of the Legislature, to determine whether it is consistent with the concept of appellate <em>judicial </em>review, and the proper exercise of the <em>judicial </em>power, and the concept of a fair trial embodied in the Due Process Clause, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>ignore events at a trial that taint a conviction or encourage practices that debilitate or undermine the high standards one expects to be observed and enforced in a court of justice.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Continued verbalization of miscarriage of justice as a test is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s reaffirmation today that a reviewing court may not affirm a conviction \u201csimply because it concludes the jury reached the right result.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The impropriety of continuing the miscarriage of justice formula then becomes clearer upon consideration of this Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>People v Grant, </em>445 Mich 535; 520 NW2d 123 (1994), where, following the lead of the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States v Olano, </em>507 US 725; 113 S Ct 1770; 123 L Ed 2d 508 (1993), this Court recognized that even where the defendant fails to preserve nonconstitutional error, an appellate court may reverse for \u201cplain forfeited error\u201d even though, as stated in <em>Olano, </em>there has not been a miscarriage of justice in the sense that the defendant is actually guilty, if the error \u201cseriously affects\u201d the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">vm</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Applying<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> the <em>Kotteakos </em>standard, applicable to nonconstitutional error, as elaborated in <em>Brecht </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>O\u2019Neal, </em>I turn to a consideration, on de novo review of the whole record, whether the error in admitting Brecht\u2019s testimony was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">I agree with Mateo, contrary to a statement of the Court of Appeals, that the evidence against him was not \u201coverwhelming.\u201d While there was possibly overwhelming evidence that Cantu had been assaulted by someone,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> no one other than Cantu testified that Mateo was the assailant. Cantu clearly was an interested witness, and therefore his credibility could be questioned. Mateo did not testify, but, as a matter of law, that cannot be weighed in evaluating the harmlessness of the error in admitting Jennifer Brecht\u2019s testimony that Blair had warned Brecht that Mateo was \u201cvery violent,\u201d thereby impeaching Blair \u2014 who had testified that Mateo was with her when the assault was claimed to have taken place \u2014 and who had denied having conversations with Brecht about Mateo.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">If that were the whole record, I would be at least in grave doubt whether the error had substantial and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict. There would only be Cantu\u2019s testimony identifying Mateo as the assailant, and Blair\u2019s alibi testimony that Mateo was with her at the time of the assault. Brecht\u2019s testimony impeaching Blair\u2019s testimony and indicating that Mateo was at times a violent womanizer, might very well then have swayed the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Additionally, however, there was the testimony of two police officers that Cantu\u2019s sister, Elva Lulgjurflj, had confirmed, at the scene of, and shortly after, the alleged assault, that Mateo was the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The officers\u2019 testimony was hearsay, but Mateo\u2019s lawyer failed to object. Cantu\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony that he identified Mateo as his assailant shortly after the incident, might have been admissible, although hearsay, as an excited utterance or some other basis. But, Mateo\u2019s lawyer\u2019s failure to object leaves the record silent in that regard. Courts disagree concerning the weight to accord hearsay admitted without objection. The majority view is that hearsay admitted without objection has probative value.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">On the same premise that the harmless-error analysis for preserved error differs from that where the error has not been preserved,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> an appellate court undertaking review for harmlessness should consider, as part of the whole record, unobjected to hearsay\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>in this case, the hearsay statements identifying Mateo as the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">To be sure, the inquiry in assessing the harmlessness of error is whether the error may have swayed the jury, not the quantity or quality of the other evidence. Nevertheless, in deciding whether the error may have swayed the jury, the reviewing court must consider the whole record, not for the purpose of itself making a judgment concerning the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, but rather for the purpose of determining whether the jury might have been swayed by the erroneously admitted testimony.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Cantu\u2019s testimony identifying Mateo as the assailant, together with the hearsay corroboration, was opposed by Blair\u2019s testimony that Mateo was with her at the time of the assault. It is questionable whether any juror\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the opposing testimony was swayed by Brecht\u2019s assertion that Blair had, contrary to her denial, conversed with Brecht concerning Mateo disparagingly.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">There is a further consideration, however. The concept of harmless error has become part of the equation for the purpose of determining whether there is error at all, as in the assessment of whether a defendant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. In <em>People v </em>Pickens, 446 Mich 298; 521 NW2d 797 (1994), this Court, again following the lead of the United States Supreme Court, adopted the approach set forth in <em>Strickland v Washington, </em>466 US 668; 104 S Ct 2052; 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984), which imposes on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>the defendant the burden of showing that, absent counsel\u2019s errors, the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt. This Court said that \u201cunder Michigan law, counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance must be found to have been prejudicial in order to reverse an otherwise valid conviction.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Grant </em>and <em>Pickens </em>considered whether the unpreserved error in <em>Grant </em>and the error of counsel in <em>Pickens, </em>might have been outcome-determinative.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Clearly, the error would be outcome-determinative if the reviewing court would be in \u201cgrave doubt\u201d or be unable to declare that it is \u201chighly probable\u201d that the error did not affect the verdict, but for error of counsel that permitted inadmissible evidence to become part of the record that may have influenced or swayed the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">No possible trial strategy could have justified Mateo\u2019s lawyer\u2019s failure to have objected to the inadmissible hearsay. His failure to do so fell below an objective standard of reasonableness in the representation of persons accused of crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that the error was not harmless, and would remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"A3q\">The majority asserts that the evidence of Mateo\u2019s guilt is \u201coverwhelming.\u201d The mantra \u201coverwhelming\u201d ignores the imperative of considering not only evidence tending to establish guilt, but also the evidence tending to refute the evidence of guilt. The Court of Appeals and this Court, on review of the whole record, were and are required to assess not only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Cantu\u2019s testimony, but also Crystal Blair\u2019s alibi testimony tending to show that Mateo could not have been the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"ADy\">I would reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-9\"> My colleagues imply that the <em>Robinson </em>Court did not understand the significance of citing <em>Chapman v California, </em>386 US 18; 87 S Ct 824; 17 L Ed 2d 705 (1967), when it defined its harmless error standard. I disagree. In <em>Robinson, </em>there were two primary categories of alleged errors: (1) the admission of an involuntary confession, and (2) evidentiary errors, which were the equivalent of improper bad-acts evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 556. The Court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction on the basis of the admission of the involuntary confession, without engaging in <em>any </em>harmless error analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 559.

The law requires that witnesses be present at trial, take an oath of truthfulness and be subject to cross-examination so that their credibility may be properly evaluated. The admission of hearsay evidence is disfavored because it is difficult, if not impossible, for the trier of fact to assess the reliability of hearsay statements or of the hearsay declarant. The trier of fact is unable to view and evaluate the demeanor and manner of the declarant while making the hearsay statement. The hearsay statement has not been vouched and thus the declarant may not have felt the \u201cspecial obligation to tell the truth\u201d that results from the taking of an oath.

We note, however, Justice Brennan\u2019s observation in <em>United States v Lane, </em>n 33 <em>supra, </em>p 465, that the United States Supreme Court, and, I would add immodestly, this Court, is ordinarily manifestly ill-equipped to undertake harmless-error analysis without the benefit of prior harmless-error analysis by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"AD8\"> Cantu testified that he was assaulted with a gun and a knife. As the Court of Appeals observed, Cantu was treated at a hospital for multiple lacerations, and a hand gun was recovered from the bathroom where he claimed the assault took place.
