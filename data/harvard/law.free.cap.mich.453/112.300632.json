Lawrence was injured while working for Prompt Answering/DeBonte Electric. Her injury prevented her from continuing her employment with Prompt, but did not prevent her from continuing her dual employment at Plainfield Drive-In where, at the time of the injury, she had part-time seasonal employment in the sedentary job of selling movie tickets.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">The questions presented are whether</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-11\">\u2022 the wages Lawrence earned at Plainfield were properly included by the magistrate and the wcab in computing Lawrence\u2019s \u201caverage weekly wage\u201d for the purpose of determining the benefits payable to her;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>\u2022 Lawrence may have lost the earning capacity represented by the wages she earned at Plainfield although she continued to be there employed immediately after she was injured at Prompt; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">\u2022 the Second Injury Fund may be subject to liability for a portion of the benefits payable to Lawrence in respect to the wages at Prompt even if it is determined that Lawrence retains earning capacity in respect to her wages at Plainfield.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">We agree with the Court of Appeals,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, and the referee \u2014 who all ruled that the 1980 amendments<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of \u00a7\u00a7 371<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 372<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> providing that the average weekly wage means the weekly wage earned by the worker at the time of injury \u201cin all employment,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> mean both the wages earned in the employment (at Prompt) in which the worker was disabled and in an employment (at Plain-field) in which she was not disabled \u2014 that the WCAB properly included the wages Lawrence earned in all employments in computing her average weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Neither the magistrate nor the WCAB made findings concerning Lawrence\u2019s ability to earn the wages she received from Plainfield. We conclude that whether she lost her entire \u201cearning capacity\u201d remains a question of fact for the magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>The wcab found that the Second Injury Fund would be liable for a portion of the benefits paid to Lawrence, even if that portion is being paid to replace wages lost from the employment at Prompt in which she was injured. We disagree, and conclude that <em>in such a case </em>the Second Injury Fund is not subject to liability for the payment of any benefits replacing the wages Lawrence earned during her employment, at Prompt, in which she was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The wcab found that Lawrence was partially disabled by June 15, 1985, from her employment with Prompt as a result of a knee injury,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and entered an open award of benefits until the further order of the wcab. The wcab ordered that, in computing the weekly compensation benefit, Lawrence\u2019s average weekly wage was to be determined by including both wages from her employment with Prompt, which she could not continue because of her disability, and wages from her employment with Plainfield, which she had been able to continue. The order provided that Prompt could take credit, pursuant to the formula contained in subsection 361(1) of the act,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>weekly benefits for any wages Lawrence had \u201cactually been able to earn\u201d after June 15, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The wcab order further provided that the Second Injury Fund must reimburse Prompt for a share of the benefits proportionate to the ratio Lawrence\u2019s preinjury wages at Plainfield bear to her total average weekly wage, unless Lawrence\u2019s earnings from Prompt comprised more than eighty percent of her combined earnings from Prompt and Plainfield, in which event the Second Injury Fund would not be required to provide any reimbursement to Prompt.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">This Court granted the application of the Second Injury Fund for leave to appeal. Lawrence had responded to the application with a motion to dismiss as moot. The order granting leave to appeal states that the motion \u201cremains pending. The parties are directed to include mootness in the issues to be briefed.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Lawrence contends that the issues are moot, and the appeal should be dismissed because the sole issue presented is whether the Second Injury Fund is required to reimburse Prompt under the circumstance that Lawrence was able, after injury, to continue working for Plainfield. Lawrence asserts that computing Lawrence\u2019s average weekly wage by including her earnings from Plainfield, in the manner required by the WCAB, results in Prompt\u2019s share being eighty-three percent, with the further result that Prompt is required to pay the entire benefit and the Second Injury Fund nothing. Subsection 372(1) (see n 9 for text) provides that if the employment that caused the personal injury provided more than eighty percent of the injured employee\u2019s average weekly wages at the time of the injury, the employer is liable for all the weekly benefits. Lawrence points out that Prompt has not appeared in this Court, and asserts that Prompt does not seek reimbursement from the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The Second Injury Fund contends that the issue may not be moot, and that it may, under the Court of Appeals opinion, have reimbursement liability to Prompt. It further contends that even if an issue is moot, this Court may address the issue if it is of pub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>lie significance and is likely to recur, yet may evade judicial review, citing <em>In re Midland Publishing Co, Inc, </em>420 Mich 148, 151-152, n 2; 362 NW2d 580 (1984), and <em>Pearson v Macomb Co Election Comm, </em>199 Mich App 170, 171; 500 NW2d 746 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">This Court has decided to address this appeal on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">The Second Injury Fund states that the issue is the validity of imposing reimbursement liability on the fund pursuant to \u00a7 372 \u201cfor any portion of plaintiffs weekly workers\u2019 compensation benefit given her disability from the job [with Prompt] in which she was injured but not from her concurrent employment\u201d with Plainfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">The fund acknowledges that Lawrence has been found to be disabled, but argues that her \u201cdisability has been finally determined to extend only to her employment by Prompt, and not to her concurrent employment.\u201d It asserts that Lawrence has suffered no wage loss from her concurrent employment, and therefore \u201cPrompt\u2019s obligation to pay weekly benefits is based solely upon [Lawrence\u2019s] wage loss, from Prompt.\u201d It argues that a worker is entitled to benefits only where there has been a loss of wage-earning capacity, citing statutory definitions of \u201cdisability\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Sobotka v Chrysler Corp (After Remand), </em>447 Mich 1; 523 NW2d 454 (1994), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>and <em>Michales v Morton Salt Co, </em>450 Mich 479; 538 NW2d 11 (1995), discussing \u201cdisability\u201d and \u201cwage loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The fund further contends that the purpose of the 1980 amendments was solely to address the inequity of the result of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Buehler v Univ of Michigan, </em>277 Mich 648; 270 NW 171 (1936), in which a worker was injured while working a part-time job and was disabled thereby from both the part-time job and a full-time job, and yet was held to be entitled to benefits only on the basis of her earnings from the part-time job. The fund asserts that the Legislature did not intend that the 1980 amendments would apply except where, as in <em>Buehler, </em>the worker was disabled from all dual employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The parties agree that Lawrence was disabled \u2014 that she suffered a work-related injury in the course of her employment that resulted in some loss of wage-earning capacity. The parties also agree that Lawrence was not disabled from her employment at Plainfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\u201cDisability\u201d and \u201cwage earning capacity,\u201d as those terms are used in the act, are interrelated but different concepts. A worker is not entitled to benefits unless he is \u201cdisabled.\u201d \u201cWage earning capacity,\u201d in addition to other possible applications, plays a specific role in determining the amount of benefits in a partial disability case.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Because Lawrence retained some ability to work, Lawrence was properly determined by the magistrate and the WCAB to be partially disabled. The amount of her benefits is, accordingly, to be determined under \u00a7 361. Pursuant to \u00a7 361, Lawrence is entitled to her preinjury \u201caverage weekly wage\u201d less the wages she is \u201cable to earn\u201d after the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The \u201caverage weekly wage\u201d is to be determined under subsection 371(2) of the WDCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">As used in this act, \u201caverage weekly wage\u201d means the weekly wage earned by the employee at the time of the employee\u2019s injury in all employment, inclusive of overtime, premium pay, and cost of living adjustment, and exclusive of any fringe or other benefits which continue during the disability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">As the fund contends, this section was amended in 1980 to overrule the result in <em>Buehler </em>by providing in subsection 371(2), that the \u201c \u2018average weekly wage\u2019 means the weekly wage earned by the employee at the time of the employee\u2019s injury <em>in all employ</em>ment.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Neither the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d nor judicial decisions concerning what constitutes \u201cwage loss\u201d are pertinent in determining the \u201caverage weekly wage\u201d once it is determined, as it was here, that the worker is disabled. When disability has been determined, the computation of the average weekly wage is statutorily prescribed in \u00a7 371 and does not involve a further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>determination or redetermination of the extent of the worker\u2019s disability in dual employment. In enacting that the \u201caverage weekly wage\u201d means weekly wages earned by the worker at the time of his injury \u201cin <em>all </em>employment,\u201d the Legislature did not distinguish between dual employment in which the worker was injured or disabled and dual employment in which he was not injured or disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The WCAB was therefore correct in concluding that Lawrence\u2019s wages from both Prompt and Plainfield should be included in her \u201caverage weekly wage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The second phase of the calculation of benefits for a partially disabled worker requires a determination of the wages that Lawrence was \u201cable to earn\u201d after the injury. This Court has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">[W]age earning capacity ... is a complex of fact issues which are concerned with the nature of the work performed and the continuing availability of work of that kind, and the nature and extent of the disability and the wages earned. <em>[Pulley v Detroit Engineering &amp; Machine Co, </em>378 Mich 418, 423; 145 NW2d 40 (1966); <em>Sobotka v Chrysler Corp (After Remand), </em>447 Mich 1, 22; 523 NW2d 454 (1994).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">The fund and the author of the dissenting opinion would make wages actually earned following the injury the sole determinant of earning capacity. This Court has rejected this approach:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-10\">[I]f the bare elements of proof of what the employee was paid were construed as establishing his \u201cearning capacity\u201d the whole purpose of the act would be vitiated. <em>[Pulley </em>at 423.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Wages alone can overvalue an employee\u2019s worth in the labor market if they are temporary and inflated, or undervalue it if he is employed at work below his skill level. The full severity of an injury may not reveal itself immediately after it occurs, or an employee may struggle along with the injury before determining it is impossible to go on.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Potential ability to work, if uncoupled with an actual opportunity to exploit that potential, leaves the employee unable to earn wages. In this case, the range of activities Lawrence is physically able to perform has been severely limited. Only a small fraction of available jobs will be as suitable for her as was her sedentary work at Plainfield. Thus, although Lawrence, immediately after the injury, actually continued to earn wages at her part-time summer job at Plain-field, it does not follow that she was \u201cable to earn\u201d replacement wages, as that term is used in the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">While Lawrence continued to be employed during the summer of 1985 in her part-time sedentary job, her injury incapacitated her from other employment requiring walking, standing, and bending. Lawrence\u2019s job with Plainfield was a part-time summer job which, in all events, came to an end two years later when this drive-in, like most drive-ins, closed permanently. The record indicates that Lawrence was diligent in seeking other employment, with the result that Prompt was entitled to substantial credits for wages earned by her in such other employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">The purpose of the 1980 amendment was to assure that a disabled worker who, like Lawrence, had been engaged in dual employment before the injury, would be entitled, as set forth in \u00a7 361, to benefits equal to eighty percent of the difference between her after-tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>average weekly wage from dual employment before the personal injury and the after-tax average weekly wage that she is \u201cable to earn\u201d after the personal injuiy.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The WCAB order returned this case to the magistrate to determine the wages Lawrence \u201chas <em>actually </em>been able to earn\u201d since the injury. Although Prompt would be entitled, pursuant to \u00a7 361, to a reduction of its liability for any wages Lawrence actually earned, the WCAB order does not require the magistrate to determine whether Lawrence retains any residual earning capacity, which also would reduce the amount of the award, but not Prompt\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">In sum, the wages Lawrence is \u201cable to earn\u201d is a question of fact, to be resolved by the magistrate after considering the full range of factors set forth above. The amount of wages Lawrence is able to earn is neither constrained nor controlled by the wages she actually earned following the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">The final issue is the apportionment of liability for benefits. Apportionment in a dual employment situation is controlled by subsection 372(l)(b), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">If the employment which caused the personal injury or death provided 80% or less of the employee\u2019s average weekly wage at the time of the personal injury or death, the insurer or self-insurer is liable for that portion of the employee\u2019s weekly benefits as bears the same ratio to his or her total weekly benefits as the average weekly wage from the employment which caused the personal injury or death bears to his or her total weekly wages. The second injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>fund is separately but dependently liable for the remainder of the weekly benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The parties agree that Prompt is required to pay the entire amount of the award if the portion of her average weekly wage resulting from her employment with Prompt is more than eighty percent of the average weekly wage computed by including Lawrence\u2019s wages from both employments.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The wcab appears to have construed \u00a7 372 to mean that the Second Injury Fund should bear some portion of the liability for benefits payable to Lawrence, even if the magistrate determines that she has not lost any earning capacity in respect to the wages received from Plainfield:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">Calculation of the Fund\u2019s obligation to reimburse Prompt Answering requires the calculation of the employer\u2019s percentage and the Fund is \u201cseparately but dependently liable for the remainder.\u201d The numerator of the ratio is \u201cthe average weekly wage from the employment which caused the personal injury\u201d .... The denominator is plaintiff\u2019s \u201ctotal weekly wages\u201d which is to be determined according to [\u00a7 371], as we have set forth above. This ratio is the employer\u2019s percentage and the remainder (or, mathematically, 1 minus the employer\u2019s percentage) is the Fund\u2019s percentage. [Wcab op, p 19.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">This construction of the act exposes the fund to liability for benefits being paid solely to compensate Lawrence for the incapacity to earn the wages paid by Prompt.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">The legislative history of subsection 372(l)(b) is clear that the Second Injury Fund is liable only if the employee experiences wage loss from employment other than that in which the injury occurs, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>employment contributed more than one-fifth of the employee\u2019s average weekly wage.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Section 371 was enacted to include \u201call employments\u201d in an effort to remedy the perceived injustice of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Buehler. </em>At the same time, the Legislature amended \u00a7 372 to apportion liability between the injury-employer and the Second Injury Fund. Such apportionment places responsibility on the injury-employer for the wages that were lost while the worker was in its employ, yet protects that employer from loss for hiring a worker with concurrent employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The approach stated by the WCAB threatens to distort the balance struck by the Legislature. Because the WCAB formula would apportion liability between Prompt and the fund in proportion to the wages paid by Prompt and Plainfield before the injury, without regard .to whether Lawrence lost earning capacity in respect to wages received from Plainfield, the WCAB potentially released Prompt from the full burden of compensation that the Legislature intended that it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>and it alone, should bear. Accordingly, if the magistrate determines that Lawrence did not lose her capacity to earn the wages she earned at Plainfield, Prompt and Prompt alone must bear the full responsibility for paying benefits and compensating Lawrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">We construe \u00a7 372 to require the employer under whom the injury occurred to pay the portion of the benefits equal to the ratio that the wages paid by the injury-employer for which benefits are payable bears to the total wages for which benefits are payable. Thus, the fund is only subject to liability for benefits in respect to the wage-earning capacity lost at the concurrent employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The Second Injury Fund\u2019s responsibility will arise only if Prompt\u2019s contribution to the average weekly wage, computed by including the wages from both employments, is determined to have been less than eighty percent. In that case, Prompt will be solely responsible for shouldering the burden of the benefits attributable to its share of the wages for which Lawrence is receiving benefits, but is entitled to reimbursement from the fund for any additional benefits, because, in the language of the statute, \u201cthe Second Injury Fund is separately but dependently liable for the remainder of the weekly benefits.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded to the magistrate.</p>\n<judges id=\"b278-8\">Brickley, C.J., and Cavanagh, J., concurred with Leven, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-8\"> 204 Mich App 498; 516 NW2d 114 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b266-9\"> 1980 PA 857.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b266-10\"> MCL 418.371; MSA 17.237(371).

Section 372 is simply not triggered if there is nothing to apportion.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">However, I dissent because I believe that it is not necessary to remand this case. The magistrate found that the plaintiff\u2019s injury rendered her compensably disabled from one employment but not compensably disabled from her concurrent employment. The magistrate correctly concluded that plaintiff was partially disabled because she retained a wage-earning capacity in work suitable to her qualifications and training. Further, the wcab agreed with these findings and conclusion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I believe that the majority\u2019s decision to remand is functionally equivalent to a reversal of the finding of partial disability because it ignores both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>magistrate\u2019s and the wcab\u2019s findings that the plaintiff retained a wage-earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The magistrate already explored the \u201ccomplex of fact issues\u201d that informs the analysis of \u201cwage earning capacity.\u201d The majority\u2019s attempt to cleave the concept of \u201cwage earning capacity\u201d from the concept of \u201cdisability,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 120-121, undermines the legislature\u2019s unmistakable intent to define compensability by a marriage of those very concepts: \u201c \u2018disability\u2019 means a limitation of an employee\u2019s wage earning capacity in work suitable to his or her qualifications and training resulting from a personal injury or work related disease.\u201d MCL 418.301(4); MSA 17.237(301)(4). See <em>Michales v Morton Salt Co, </em>450 Mich 479, 490; 538 NW2d 1 (1995). While it is true and very regrettable that this plaintiff\u2019s activities are \u201cseverely limited,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 124, this fact does not force reconsideration of the magistrate\u2019s conclusion that this plaintiff retained a wage-earning capacity at sedentary employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Furthermore, including wages from \u201call employment\u201d in the definition of average weekly wage under \u00a7 371(1) did not change the basic definition of compensable disability. The addition of \u201call employment\u201d in 1982 was intended to address the inequity of prior case law, as discussed by the majority opinion. <em>Ante </em>at 123. Prior case law did not consider wages earned at a second job even when the injury affected the employee\u2019s wage-earning capacity at the second job.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>The addition of the \u201call employment\u201d resolved that <em>very specific </em>problem.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">In this case, the magistrate found that the plaintiff is not compensably disabled from sedentary employment. In other words, she retains a wage-earning capacity in work suitable to her qualifications and training: she is still fully able to earn wages at a similar sedentary job. It is also clear that the subsequent loss of the sedentary job was unrelated to plaintiffs compensable disability. It is fundamentally inconsistent with Michigan\u2019s wage-loss system to compensate an employee when the subsequent loss of a second job is in no way related to her compensable disability and when she retains a wage-earning capacity for other work comparable to the second job.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Whether the eventual closing of the drive-in was inevitable is not relevant to the determination of the employee\u2019s earning capacity and, further, it is not the purpose of the Michigan Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act to serve as another form of unemployment insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the decision of the magistrate as modified by the wcab and to the <em>extent </em>that it is consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b281-8\">Riley, J., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b280-7\"> See, e.g., <em>Buehler v Univ of Michigan, </em>277 Mich 648; 270 NW 171 (1936).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b281-9\"> The legislative analysis makes clear that the \u201caverage weekly wage will be calculated as the weekly wage earned by the employee in <em>all </em>employments at the time of the injury and will include overtime pay, premium pay, and cost-of-living adjustments but will not include fringe or other benefits which continue to be received by the employee during a disability.\u201d Senate Analysis Section, SB 1044 (Second Analysis), January 7, 1981. The list of exclusions does not address the status of earnings from concurrent employment not affected by the disability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
