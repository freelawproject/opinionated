Vaughn (Jill), filed a complaint against third-party respondent, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois (Blue Cross), for its failure to comply with the Income Withholding for Support Act (the Withholding Act) (750 ILCS 28/1 et seq. (West 2006)). Pursuant to section 2 \u2014 619 of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/2 \u2014 \u2022619(a)(9) (West 2006)), the trial court involuntarily dismissed Jill\u2019s complaint because it found that Jill failed to prove that Blue Cross knowingly violated the Withholding Act. On appeal, Jill contends that: (1) because Blue Cross remits payments to a sole proprietorship, it is a \u201cpayor\u201d under the statute and is required to comply with the income withholding notice it received; (2) the complaint was improperly dismissed because the arguments and affidavits submitted by Blue Cross do not constitute a basis for dismissal on a section 2 \u2014 619 motion; and (3) Blue Cross is subject to mandatory penalties for its failure to comply with the Withholding Act. For the following reasons, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p> <p id=\"b848-4\" pgmap=\"848\">BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b848-5\" pgmap=\"848\">On April 24, 2008, a uniform order of support was entered in the underlying dissolution of marriage action requiring petitioner, Dr. Ronald G. Vaughn (Ronald), to pay Jill unallocated family support and medical insurance premiums for the couple\u2019s minor children. Ronald operates a chiropractic business under the name of Vaughn Chiropractic and Athletic Performance Center (Vaughn Center). Ronald is a Blue Cross preferred provider and is listed under the Blue Cross provider finder as \u201cDr. Ronald G. Vaughn.\u201d Blue Cross pays a portion of the medical expenses incurred by its insureds to the provider groups or individual providers who provide covered services. On a weekly basis, Blue Cross remits payments for the services Ronald provides to its insureds via an electronic funds transfer account that was established in 2006.</p> <p id=\"b848-6\" pgmap=\"848(45) 849(98)\">On May 1, 2008, pursuant to the Withholding Act, Jill sent Blue Cross an income withholding notice that required Blue Cross to withhold and pay over the unallocated support payments that Ronald owes Jill. Blue Cross responded to the withholding notice by stating, in part: \u201cPlease be aware we do not become involved in personal cases and are not allowed to set up this type of convenience for the provider.\u201d Jill sent Blue Cross another withholding notice, a copy of the order of support, and a copy of the relevant portion of the Withholding Act. She also informed Blue Cross that she would pursue the Withholding Act\u2019s statutory penalties if Blue Cross continued to disregard its duty to comply with the withholding notice. Blue Cross again responded that it was \u201cnot allowed to set up this type of convenience for the provider.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b849-3\" pgmap=\"849\">On September 29, 2008, Jill filed a complaint to enforce statutory penalties against Blue Cross for its failure to comply with the Withholding Act. In response, Blue Cross filed a section 2 \u2014 619 motion for involuntary dismissal. Blue Cross moved to dismiss Jill\u2019s complaint because it alleged that it did not pay income to Ronald. Alternatively, Blue Cross moved to dismiss Jill\u2019s complaint because it alleged that it did not knowingly violate the Withholding Act. Blue Cross further elaborated that although it received withholding notices that required it to withhold and pay over the income it paid to Ronald, it had \u201cno reason to believe [that] it should withhold and remit\u201d the income that it paid to Vaughn Center. Blue Cross attached an affidavit and exhibits to its motion which showed that Blue Cross made its fund transfers payable to Vaughn Center for Ronald\u2019s treatment of Blue Cross\u2019s insureds.</p> <p id=\"b849-4\" pgmap=\"849\">Jill responded to Blue Cross\u2019s motion by submitting an affidavit from Ronald. In his affidavit, Ronald stated that he operates Vaughn Center as a sole proprietorship and that Vaughn Center is a pseudonym under which he does business. Ronald also stated that Blue Cross transmits the payments directed to Vaughn Center into his personal checking account.</p> <p id=\"b849-5\" pgmap=\"849\">On February 20, 2009, the trial court granted Blue Cross\u2019s section 2 \u2014 619 motion for involuntary dismissal. The trial court\u2019s order does not clearly identify the basis on which it granted Blue Cross\u2019s section 2 \u2014 619 motion. However, the trial court stated at the conclusion of the hearing on the section 2 \u2014 619 motion that it found that Jill \u201cfailed to show that the respondent, [sic] Blue Cross-Blue Shield, knowingly failed to comply with\u201d the Withholding Act. Moreover, the trial court pointed out that Blue Cross\u2019s exhibits showed that Blue Cross 'wrote checks to Vaughn Center, and Jill did not present credible evidence that Blue Cross \u201chad knowledge that the funds that they were transferring were going to an individual who was [a] child support obligor.\u201d Jill then filed a motion to reconsider, and the motion was denied. This appeal follows.</p> <p id=\"b850-2\" pgmap=\"850\">ANALYSIS</p> <p id=\"b850-3\" pgmap=\"850\">I. Interpretation of the Word \u201cIndividual\u201d in the Withholding Act\u2019s Definition of \u201cIncome\u201d</p> <p id=\"b850-4\" pgmap=\"850\">As an initial matter, the parties disagree on whether Blue Cross is subject to the Withholding Act. Although it is not clear from the record, because the trial court addressed whether Blue Cross knowingly violated the Withholding Act, it presumably first found that Blue Cross is Ronald\u2019s payor and thus subject to the Withholding Act\u2019s requirements. However, because a determination of whether the word \u201cindividual\u201d in the Withholding Act includes a sole proprietorship is a question of law, our standard of review is de novo, and we do not give the trial court\u2019s interpretation any deference. See Ryan v. Board of Trustees of the General Assembly Retirement System, 236 Ill. 2d 315, 319, 924 N.E.2d 970, 973 (2010).</p> <p id=\"b850-5\" pgmap=\"850\"> Courts should enforce an unambiguous statute as it is written. E.g., Ryan, 236 Ill. 2d at 319, 924 N.E.2d at 973. The Withholding Act requires a payor, upon receipt of an income withholding notice, to deduct support payments from the income that the payor pays to an obligor. 750 ILCS 28/35(a) (West 2006). The payor must then transmit the withheld amount to the State Disbursement Unit within seven business days after the date that the amount would have been paid to the obligor. 750 ILCS 28/35(a) (West 2006). Ronald is undisputedly an obligor. However, the parties dispute whether Blue Cross is Ronald\u2019s payor.</p> <p id=\"b850-6\" pgmap=\"850(204) 851(60)\"> The Withholding Act defines a \u201cpayor\u201d as \u201cany payor of income to an obligor.\u201d 750 ILCS 28/15(g) (West 2006). Thus, in order for Blue Cross to be a \u201cpayor,\u201d it must pay Ronald \u201cincome.\u201d The Withholding Act defines \u201cincome,\u201d in pertinent part, as \u201cany form of periodic payment to an individual, regardless of source.\u201d 750 ILCS 28/15(d) (West 2006). Blue Cross argues that it does not pay Ronald income because it pays Vaughn Center. Blue Cross further contends that Vaughn Center is not an \u201cindividual\u201d under the Withholding Act\u2019s definitions of \u201cincome\u201d and \u201cobligor.\u201d However, the affidavit submitted by Ronald establishes that Ronald is a sole proprietor and Vaughn Center is a legal nonentity. \u201c[A] sole proprietorship has no legal identity separate from that of the individual who owns it.\u201d Vernon v. Schuster, 179 Ill. 2d 338, 347, 688 N.E.2d 1172, 1176-77 (1997). Moreover, even if a sole proprietor does business under a fictitious name, the sole proprietor has not created a separate legal entity. Vernon, 179 Ill. 2d at 347-48, 688 N.E.2d at 1176-77. Thus, the word \u201cindividual\u201d in the Withholding Act\u2019s definition of \u201cincome\u201d includes a sole proprietorship. See Shively v. Belleville Township High School District No. 201, 329 Ill. App. 3d 1156, 1165-66, 769 N.E.2d 1062, 1070 (2002) (interpreting \u201cindividuals\u201d in the School Code\u2019s professional services exemption (105 ILCS 5/10 \u2014 20.21(a)(i) (West 2006)) to refer \u201cto the ones performing the service, not the ones with whom the contract is made\u201d because, if \u201cindividuals\u201d referred to the latter, sole proprietorships, but not corporations, would fall under the exemption).</p> <p id=\"b851-4\" pgmap=\"851\"> Blue Cross also argues that the income it pays to Vaughn Center belongs to its insureds, not Ronald, and if it complied with the income withholding notice it could be sued by its payee (Vaughn Center) and/or its insureds. This argument has no merit. First, the income Blue Cross pays to Vaughn Center does not belong to its insureds. It is payment made to Ronald for covered services he has provided to Blue Cross\u2019s insureds. Second, if Blue Cross complied with the withholding notice, it would be paying the same amount of income for the same services but would merely be sending a portion of that income to the State Disbursement Unit. If an employer receives a withholding notice and withholds a portion of an employee\u2019s salary, that employee cannot claim that he was not paid his full salary just because some of it was withheld pursuant to a court order. As for Blue Cross\u2019s insureds, there is no reason that they would even be aware that a portion of the money paid to Ronald was sent to the State Disbursement Unit. An explanation of benefits statement sent to an insured would simply show the amount covered and the amount paid to the provider. Consequently, because Blue Cross pays Vaughn Center income, it was required to comply with the withholding notice that it received from Jill.</p> <p id=\"b851-5\" pgmap=\"851\">II. The Section 2 \u2014 619 Motion</p> <p id=\"b851-6\" pgmap=\"851\">Next, Jill argues that the trial court improperly dismissed her complaint against Blue Cross pursuant to Blue Cross\u2019s section 2 \u2014 619 motion. Although it is not entirely clear, the trial court essentially read Blue Cross\u2019s motion to involuntarily dismiss Jill\u2019s complaint as arguing that even if Blue Cross was paying Ronald, it did not knowingly violate the statute because it did not know that it was paying Ronald.</p> <p id=\"b851-7\" pgmap=\"851(88) 852(41)\">\u201cA motion for involuntary dismissal under section 2 \u2014 619 admits the legal sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s claim but asserts \u2018affirmative matter\u2019 outside of the pleading that defeats the claim.\u201d Czarobski v. Lata, 227 Ill. 2d 364, 369, 882 N.E.2d 536, 539 (2008). \u201cThe phrase \u2018affirmative matter\u2019 encompasses any defense other than a negation of the essential allegations of the plaintiffs cause of action.\u201d Kedzie &amp; 103rd Currency Exchange, Inc. v. Hodge, 156 Ill. 2d 112, 115, 619 N.E.2d 732, 735 (1993). However, \u201cwhere the affirmative matter is merely evidence upon which defendant expects to contest an ultimate fact stated in the complaint, section 2 \u2014 619(a)(9) should not be used.\u201d A.F.P. Enterprises, Inc. v. Crescent Pork, Inc., 243 Ill. App. 3d 905, 912, 611 N.E.2d 619, 624 (1993).</p> <p id=\"b852-3\" pgmap=\"852\">The trial court must resolve any factual disputes in a complaint that is brought against a payor under the Withholding Act. 750 ILCS 28/50(a) (West 2006). On a section 2 \u2014 619 motion, when there is no right to a jury trial in the action, \u201cthe court may, in its discretion, decide questions of fact upon the hearing of the motion.\u201d Crescent Pork, Inc., 243 Ill. App. 3d at 913, 611 N.E.2d at 624; 735 ILCS 5/2\u2014 619(c) (West 2006). However, in deciding the motion\u2019s merits, \u201ca trial court cannot determine disputed factual issues solely upon affidavits and counteraffidavits. If the affidavits present disputed facts, the parties must be afforded the opportunity to have an evidentiary hearing.\u201d Crescent Pork, Inc., 243 Ill. App. 3d at 913, 611 N.E.2d at 624; 735 ILCS 5/2 \u2014 619(c) (West 2006). Alternatively, the trial court \u201cmay deny the motion without prejudice to the right to raise the subject matter of the motion by answer.\u201d Etten v. Lane, 138 Ill. App. 3d 439, 443, 485 N.E.2d 1177, 1180 (1985). When the trial court chooses to decide the disputed factual matter that was presented in conflicting affidavits on the section 2 \u2014 619 motion, and holds an evidentiary hearing to do so, \u201cour duty on appeal is to review not only the law, but also the facts, and to reverse the circuit court\u2019s order if it is clearly against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d Etten, 138 Ill. App. 3d at 443, 485 N.E.2d at 1180. However, if the trial court dismisses the cause of action on the pleadings and affidavits, as was the case here, our duty on appeal is to determine \u201cwhether there is a genuine issue of material fact and whether the defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d 4 Ill. L. &amp; Prac. Civil Practice Before Trial \u00a741.9 (2d ed. 2009); In re Marriage of Musa, 103 Ill. App. 3d 189, 193, 430 N.E.2d 727, 730 (1982).</p> <p id=\"b852-4\" pgmap=\"852\">At the conclusion of the arguments of counsel on the motion to involuntarily dismiss, the trial court stated that it found that \u201cpetitioner [sic] has failed to show that the respondent, [sic] Blue Cross-Blue Shield, knowingly failed to comply with\u201d the Withholding Act. Further elaborating on its ruling, the trial court pointed out that Blue Cross\u2019s exhibits showed that Blue Cross wrote checks to Vaughn Center, and Jill did not present credible evidence that Blue Cross \u201chad knowledge that the funds that they were transferring were going to an individual who was [a] child support obligor.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b852-5\" pgmap=\"852(31) 853(82)\"> Blue Cross submitted an affidavit stating that it made payments to Vaughn Center. Jill then submitted an affidavit from Ronald stating that the payments from Blue Cross were directly deposited into Ronald\u2019s personal checking account. We agree with Jill that if this dispute had been properly before it, and if this fact was material, the trial court should not have granted a section 2 \u2014 619 motion where the counteraffidavits raised a factual dispute and no evidentiary hearing was held to resolve this dispute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, Blue Cross\u2019s argument that it did not knowingly violate the Withholding Act cannot properly be raised in a section 2 \u2014 619 motion for two separate reasons.</p> <p id=\"b853-4\" pgmap=\"853\">First, even if Blue Cross did not knowingly violate the Withholding Act, an unknowing violation is not an affirmative matter but merely a negation of an essential element of Jill\u2019s cause of action against Blue Cross under the Withholding Act. See 750 ILCS 28/35(a) (West 2006); Hodge, 156 Ill. 2d at 115, 619 N.E.2d at 735. Thus, Blue Cross\u2019s alleged unknowing violation of the Withholding Act could not be the basis of its section 2 \u2014 619 motion for involuntary dismissal. See Hodge, 156 Ill. 2d at 115, 619 N.E.2d at 735.</p> <p id=\"b853-5\" pgmap=\"853\">Second, as a matter of law, the argument that Blue Cross did not knowingly violate the Withholding Act because it did not know that it was paying Ronald is not a valid defense to this action. See 750 ILCS 28/35(a) (West 2006). The Withholding Act imposes a penalty on a payor \u201c[i]f the payor knowingly fails to withhold the amount designated in the income withholding notice or to pay any amount withheld to the State Disbursement Unit.\u201d 750 ILCS 28/35(a) (West 2006). However, \u201cknowingly\u201d refers to a payor\u2019s omissions that occur after the payor receives a withholding notice and presumably recognizes that it pays income to the individual. 750 ILCS 28/35(a) (West 2006); compare Thomas v. Diener, 351 Ill. App. 3d 645, 656, 814 N.E.2d 187, 196 (2004) (holding that an employer who was \u201ccognizant\u201d of forwarding the child support payments within the required time period but for two \u201cinnocent\u201d oversights, did not knowingly violate the Act), with In re Marriage of Miller, 227 Ill. 2d 185, 202, 879 N.E.2d 292, 302 (2007); In re Marriage of Gulla, 382 Ill. App. 3d 498, 503, 888 N.E.2d 585, 589 (2008) (holding that employers knowingly violated the Act where they essentially disregarded the withholding notices that they received).</p> <p id=\"b853-6\" pgmap=\"853(70) 854(245)\">In other words, the Withholding Act\u2019s penalty provision assumes that a withholding notice is served on an actual payor and that the payor realizes that it pays income to the individual designated in the notice. See Dunahee v. Chenoa Welding &amp; Fabrication, Inc., 273 Ill. App. 3d 201, 208, 652 N.E.2d 438, 444 (1995) (stating that a prior version of the Withholding Act\u2019s legislative history indicates that the Withholding Act\u2019s penalty applies \u201conly where the employer knew it was withholding a child support payment from\u201d the obligee (emphasis in original)). Thus, the Withholding Act assumes that a payor realizes whom it is paying, and its penalty provision simply addresses whether a payor should be penalized if the payor recklessly or negligently does not then withhold the designated amount or pay over the withheld amount. See 750 ILCS 28/35(a) (West 2006); Thomas, 351 Ill. App. 3d at 656, 814 N.E.2d at 196. Therefore, even if a payor does not realize that its payee is in fact the obligor named in the notice, that fact would not provide a valid defense that would exempt it from the Withholding Act\u2019s penalty provision. See 750 ILCS 28/35(a) (West 2006); see also Burrs v. Burrs, 66 Ohio App. 3d 628, 632, 585 N.E.2d 918, 920 (1991) (holding that the words \u201cknowing\u201d and \u201cknowingly\u201d in a statutory provision that imposed liability on employers if they knowingly failed to notify a child support enforcement agency of any lump-sum payment made to an employee did not allow an employer to defend on the basis of its lack of knowledge of a lump-sum payment it made to its own employee). In sum, \u201cknowingly\u201d does not refer to knowledge of a payee\u2019s existence or identity, or whether the notice recipient believes it is a \u201cpayor\u201d as defined in the Withholding Act. \u201cKnowingly\u201d refers to a knowing failure to comply with the withholding notice.</p> <p id=\"b854-4\" pgmap=\"854\">Blue Cross received a withholding notice that was properly completed and sent according to the Withholding Act\u2019s provisions. However, instead of complying with the notice or filing a declaratory judgment action to challenge its identification as a payor in the underlying case, Blue Cross sent a response to Jill in which it stated that it is \u201cnot allowed to set up this type of convenience for the provider.\u201d This is analogous to the employers in Miller, 227 Ill. 2d at 202, 879 N.E.2d at 302, and Gulla, 382 Ill. App. 3d at 503, 888 N.E.2d at 589, who disregarded the withholding notices they received. Blue Cross cannot avoid the Withholding Act by merely stating that it is not allowed to offer a \u201cconvenience\u201d to a provider when it is required by statute to do so and has received proper notice. Thus, because whether Blue Cross knew it was paying the obligor is not a valid defense to this action, the trial court erroneously granted Blue Cross\u2019s motion to dismiss. Finally, we note that the statutory penalty for a knowing violation of the Withholding Act is mandatory, not discretionary. See Miller, 227 Ill. 2d 185, 879 N.E.2d 292 (reversing the appellate court for remanding the case to the trial court to determine a less severe penalty).</p> <p id=\"b854-5\" pgmap=\"854\">CONCLUSION</p> <p id=\"b854-6\" pgmap=\"854(23) 855(50)\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Blue Cross is a payor and is subject to the Withholding Act. Moreover, because an unknowing violation is not an affirmative matter and because \u201cknowingly\u201d in the statute does not refer to whether or not Blue Cross knew it was a payor, the trial court erred in granting Blue Cross\u2019s section 2 \u2014 619 motion. We remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p> <p id=\"b855-5\" pgmap=\"855\">Reversed and remanded.</p> <p id=\"b855-6\" pgmap=\"855\">NEVILLE, J., concurs.</p> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b848-7\" pgmap=\"848\"> The Withholding Act provides that an obligee may bring a civil action against the payor to collect the Withholding Act\u2019s penalty. 750 ILCS 28/35(a) (West 2006). Thus, since Jill joined this civil action with her dissolution of marriage proceeding, Jill is properly referred to as a third-party petitioner, and Blue Cross is properly referred to as a third-party respondent.
