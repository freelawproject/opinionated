Specifically, we must determine whether an established political party must file a resolution pursuant to that section in order to fill a vacancy in nomination when no candidate appeared on the primary ballot for that party and no write-in candidate was nominated.</p> <p id=\"b1097-4\" pgmap=\"1097\">The petitioner, Whitney Wisnasky-Bettorf, was nominated by the Republican Party for the office of board of review member following the general primary elections where no Republican Party candidate\u2019s name was printed on the ballot and no candidate was nominated as a write-in for that office. An objection was made by Peggy Pierce (the objector) to the timeliness of the petitioner\u2019s candidacy. The St. Clair County Electoral Board (the board) sustained that objection and removed the petitioner\u2019s name from the ballot for the general election to be held on November 2, 2010, and the St. Clair County circuit court upheld the board\u2019s decision. The petitioner moved for and was granted an expedited appeal. On August 12, 2010, we entered an order affirming the circuit court in this matter and stated that our opinion would follow.</p> <p id=\"b1097-5\" pgmap=\"1097\">BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b1097-6\" pgmap=\"1097\">On February 2, 2010, the three established political parties in Illinois \u2014 the Republican Party, the Green Party, and the Democratic Party \u2014 held general primary elections to determine candidates for the general election to be held on November 2, 2010. No candidate\u2019s name was printed on the Republican Party ballot in St. Clair County for the office of board of review member, and no candidate was nominated as a write-in for that office. Accordingly, on March 25, 2010, the St. Clair County central committee of the Republican Party (the committee) held a meeting at which it passed a motion designating the petitioner as the appointee for candidacy for the office of board of review member. On April 1, 2010, the committee filed a \u201cresolution/certificate of appointment\u201d with the county clerk of St. Clair County, indicating that the executive committee of the Republican Party in St. Clair County had voted to nominate the petitioner for the office of board of review member as required by section 7 \u2014 61 or section 8 \u2014 17 of the Code (10 ILCS 5/8 \u2014 17 (West 2008)).</p> <p id=\"b1097-7\" pgmap=\"1097(96) 1098(29)\">On April 26, 2010, the objector filed a verified objector\u2019s petition and a memorandum in support thereof, requesting that the petitioner\u2019s name not appear on the ballot for election to the office of board of review member because the resolution was not filed within three days as required by section 7 \u2014 61. On April 30, 2010, the board convened to pass upon the objector\u2019s petition. On May 3, 2010, the board entered an order, dated April 30, 2010, allowing the objection and ordering the petitioner\u2019s name removed from the ballot for the general election to be held on November 2, 2010. The petitioner sought timely judicial review, and following a hearing, the circuit court affirmed the decision of the board. This timely appeal followed.</p> <p id=\"b1098-3\" pgmap=\"1098\">ANALYSIS</p> <p id=\"b1098-4\" pgmap=\"1098\">We begin by addressing the pending motions filed with this court. The objector filed a motion to strike and the petitioner filed a motion for sanctions. On July 21, 2010, we entered an order taking those motions with the case. We now deny both motions as moot, finding that all the facts necessary to our disposition are contained within the common law record that the objector concedes was properly filed. On July 22, 2010, the petitioner filed a motion to file affidavits as exhibits to petitioner\u2019s response to respondent\u2019s motion to strike. On July 23, 2010, the petitioner filed a motion for leave to file a reply to respondent\u2019s response to motion for sanctions, along with a reply to the objector\u2019s motion for sanctions. We now grant those motions.</p> <p id=\"b1098-5\" pgmap=\"1098\">We now turn to our review of the board\u2019s decision. Factual findings made by an electoral board will not be disturbed unless they are against the manifest weight of the evidence. Girot v. Keith, 212 Ill. 2d 372, 378-79 (2004). We are not bound, however, by the board\u2019s interpretation of a statute. King v. Justice Party, 284 Ill. App. 3d 886, 888 (1996). Statutory interpretation is a matter of law subject to de novo review. Lockhart v. Cook County Officers Electoral Board, 328 Ill. App. 3d 838, 841 (2002).</p> <p id=\"b1098-6\" pgmap=\"1098\">\u201cThe primary rule of statutory interpretation, to which all other rules are subordinate, is that a court should ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature.\u201d Bonaguro v. County Officers Electoral Board, 158 Ill. 2d 391, 397 (1994). \u201cThe legislative intent should be sought primarily from the language used in the statute.\u201d Bonaguro, 158 Ill. 2d at 397. \u201cAlso, the statute should be evaluated as a whole; each provision should be construed in connection with every other section.\u201d Bonaguro, 158 Ill. 2d at 397. \u201cStatutes should be construed, if possible, so that no term is rendered superfluous or meaningless.\u201d Bonaguro, 158 Ill. 2d at 397.</p> <p id=\"b1098-7\" pgmap=\"1098\">Section 7 \u2014 61 of the Election Code was amended effective January 1, 2010.

Madison County Electoral Board, 334 Ill. App. 3d 756 (2002), this court, albeit in dicta, addressed circumstances very similar to the case at hand. In Forcade-Osborn, the petitioner was slated by the Republican Party to fill a vacancy for the office of county treasurer in Madison County when no one was nominated in the March primary to serve as the Republican Party candidate. The Madison County Republican central committee formed a nominating committee to select a person to fill the vacancy in nomination, and on May 13, 2002, the nominating committee met and selected the petitioner to fill the vacancy in nomination. On May 20, 2002, the petitioner filed her certificate of nomination, statement of candidacy, statement of economic interests, and loyalty oath. On May 24, 2002, however, the Democratic Party candidate for county treasurer filed an objection to the petitioner\u2019s nominating papers on the grounds that they were not properly and timely filed. The Madison County electoral board struck the petitioner\u2019s name from the election ballot, finding that section 7 \u2014 61 required the nominating committee to have filed or mailed the certification of nomination within three days of its May 13, 2002, meeting. The circuit court of Madison County upheld the board\u2019s rulings, and the petitioner appealed.</p> <p id=\"b1101-4\" pgmap=\"1101\">On appeal, the court dismissed the petitioner\u2019s appeal for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction but noted in dicta that even if it did have jurisdiction, \u201cthe result would be no different, in that the determination of the [b]oard would have to be affirmed on the merits.\u201d Forcade-Osborn, 334 Ill. App. 3d at 759. The court, in interpreting section 7 \u2014 61, found that the statute clearly imposed \u201ca deadline for the transmission of a certification of nomination by the nominating authorities to the certifying officer.\u201d Forcade-Osborn, 334 Ill. App. 3d at 759. The court found that deadline to be May 13, 2002, three days from the date the action was taken to fill the vacancy in nomination. Forcade-Osborn, 334 Ill. App. 3d at 759. \u201cHaving failed to meet the deadline, [the] petitioner lost the right to have her name placed on the election ballot as a candidate for the office of county treasurer.\u201d Forcade-Osborn, 334 Ill. App. 3d at 759.</p> <p id=\"b1101-5\" pgmap=\"1101\">Public Act 96 \u2014 809 and Public Act 96 \u2014 848 became effective January 1, 2010, in which the legislature amended section 7 \u2014 61 of the Code. The amendments are illustrated as follows, with the deleted provisions struck out and the added provisions in italics:</p> <blockquote id=\"b1102-3\" pgmap=\"1102\">\u201cIf the name of no established political party candidate was printed on the consolidated primary ballot for a particular office and if no person was nominated as a write-in candidate for such office, a vacancy in nomination shall be created which may be filled in accordance with the requirements of this [s]ection. If the name of no established political party candidate was printed on the general primary ballot for a particular office and if no person was nominated as a write-in candidate for such office, a vacancy in nomination shall be [created which may be filled in accordance with the requirements-of thi3 [s-J-ectfo-n-; If the name of-no established-political party candidate was-print-cd on -the general primary ballot for a particular office- and -if no person was nominated-as a write-in candidate for-such office, a vacancy in nomination- shall be created, but-no- candidate of the party for the offiee-shall-be list-cd on the ballot at the general-elect-ion unless such vacancy is filled in accordance with the requirements of this [s]ection within 60 days after t-he-date-of the-general primary] filled only by a person designated by the appropriate committee of the political party and only if that designated person files nominating petitions with the number of signatures required for an established party candidate for that office within 75 days after the day of the general primary. The circulation period for those petitions begins on the day the appropriate committee designates that person. The person shall file his or her nominating petitions, statements of candidacy, notice of appointment by the appropriate committee, and receipt of filing his or her statement of economic interests together. These documents shall be filed at the same location as provided in [ejection 7 \u2014 12. The electoral boards having jurisdiction under [sjection 10 \u2014 9 to hear and pass upon objections to nominating petitions also shall hear and pass upon objections to nomination petitions filed by candidates under this paragraph.\u201d 10 ILCS 5/7 \u2014 61 (West Supp. 2009).</blockquote> <p id=\"b1102-4\" pgmap=\"1102\">At issue here is whether by amending section 7 \u2014 61 of the Code, the legislature intended to remove the other requirements of section 7 \u2014 61, i.e., the resolution and three-day filing requirements. We fail to see that intention.</p> <p id=\"b1102-5\" pgmap=\"1102(88) 1103(157)\"> It seems clear that by making the amendments it made, the legislature intended to require a candidate who was not on the ballot and was not a write-in candidate to get \u201cgrassroots\u201d support to become a candidate for the general election. The amendments did not change, however, the requirements of the political party, only the requirements of the candidate. Moreover, the legislature did not remove or change the requirements of the first sentence of the paragraph amended: \u201cIf the name of no established political party candidate was printed on the consolidated primary ballot for a particular office and if no person was nominated as a write-in candidate for such office, a vacancy in nomination shall be created which may be filled in accordance with the requirements of this Section.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 10 ILCS 5/7 \u2014 61 (West Supp. 2009). We have interpreted this provision in the past as requiring a petitioner who was not on the ballot at the primary and who was not written in to comply with all of the provisions in section 7 \u2014 61, specifically, the requirement that the resolution filling the vacancy be transmitted to the certifying officer or board within three days of the action by which the vacancy was filled. See Forcade-Osborn, 334 Ill. App. 3d at 759; 10 ILCS 5/7 \u2014 61 (West 2008). Indeed, if no resolution was required, it begs the question of why the committee filed it at all, albeit late.</p> <p id=\"b1103-4\" pgmap=\"1103\">Moreover, other decisions of our court have construed the situation at hand \u2014 \u201cIf the name of no established political party candidate was printed on the consolidated primary ballot for a particular office and if no person was nominated as a write-in candidate for such office ***\u201d (10 ILCS 5/7 \u2014 61 (West 2008)) \u2014 as requiring compliance with the resolution requirements of section 7 \u2014 61. In re Objection of McSparin, 352 Ill. App. 3d 352, 357-58 (2004) (finding that the provision of section 7 \u2014 61 of the Code requiring a resolution to specify the date upon which an individual was selected to fill a vacancy in nomination to be mandatory); Siegel v. Lake County Officers Electoral Board, 385 Ill. App. 3d 452, 459 (2008) (holding that \u201cthe resolution must include on its face the date the nominee was selected to fill a vacancy in nomination\u201d). Presumably, the legislature was aware of these decisions when it amended the statute and did not expressly remove the resolution and three-day filing requirements. See People v. De La Paz, 204 Ill. 2d 426, 433 (2003) (\u201c \u2018 \u201cWhere statutes are enacted after judicial opinions are published, it must be presumed that the legislature acted with knowledge of the prevailing case law\u201d \u2019 \u201d), quoting Burrell v. Southern Truss, 176 Ill. 2d 171, 176 (1997), quoting People v. Hickman, 163 Ill. 2d 250, 262 (1994). Had it intended such a result, it could have simply deleted the language stating, \u201ca vacancy in nomination shall be created which may be filled in accordance with the requirements of this fsjection\u201d (emphasis added) (10 ILCS 5/7 \u2014 61 (West Supp. 2009)). It did not and we refuse to render that provision meaningless.</p> <p id=\"b1103-5\" pgmap=\"1103(65) 1104(328)\">The dissent parses the statute into separate paragraphs, contending that certain paragraphs only apply to certain scenarios. We note that section 7 \u2014 61 is a single section in a comprehensive election code consisting of all unnumbered paragraphs. If the legislature had intended to divide the statute into separate sections, it certainly could have done so. Nevertheless, the dissent contends that the third unnumbered paragraph does not apply to the situation at hand because \u201csection 7 \u2014 61 *** contemplates two distinct types of vacancies in nomination that may occur, and it provides the means for filling the vacancies in each situation.\u201d 403 Ill. App. 3d at 1092. While we agree with the dissent that section 7 \u2014 61 does contemplate two distinct types of vacancies, i.e., (1) the type of vacancy defined in the eighth unnumbered paragraph \u2014 \u201cA vacancy in nomination occurs when a candidate who has been nominated under the provisions of this [ajrticle 7 dies before the election (whether death occurs prior to, on[,] or after the day of the primary) [ ] or declines the nomination; provided that nominations may become vacant for other reasons,\u201d and (2) the type of vacancy set forth in the ninth unnumbered paragraph \u2014 \u201cIf the name of no established political party candidate was printed on the consolidated primary ballot for a particular office and if no person was nominated as a write-in candidate for such office, a vacancy in nomination shall be created which may be filled in accordance with the requirements of this [sjection,\u201d we do not agree that the provisions set forth before the ninth unnumbered paragraph do not apply to the type of vacancy set forth in that paragraph. 10 ILCS 5/7 \u2014 61 (West Supp. 2009). The statute clearly states that the vacancy \u201cmay be filled in accordance with the requirements of this [sjection,\u201d meaning all of section 7 \u2014 61. 10 ILCS 5/7 \u2014 61 (West Supp. 2009). That is how we have construed this provision in the past, the legislature did not remove or alter this provision when it amended the statute, and it is further supported by the first sentence of the third unnumbered paragraph which refers to \u201c[a]ny vacancy in nomination under the provisions of this [ajrticle,\u201d not any unnumbered subparagraph. (Emphasis added.) 10 ILCS 5/7 \u2014 61 (West Supp. 2009).</p> <p id=\"b1104-3\" pgmap=\"1104\">While we find no ambiguity in section 7 \u2014 61, we find further support for our interpretation in the Illinois House debates. See County of Du Page v. Illinois Labor Relations Board, 231 Ill. 2d 593, 604 (2008). Having reviewed the Illinois House debates regarding the amendments to section 7 \u2014 61, we have found no indication that the legislature intended to remove the resolution and three-day filing requirements. Nor, as the dissent contends, was there anything in the legislative debates that supports a \u201cSituation A\u201d or \u201cSituation B\u201d scenario. Representative Fortner, the House sponsor of the bill, described the purpose of the bill as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b1104-4\" pgmap=\"1104(61) 1105(55)\">\u201cHouse Bill 723 would change the process by which we fill vacancies for the general Primary. So, this would cover the case where you have a... a Primary where a major Party failed to have a candidate qualify for the Primary ballot. Current law provides that the Party can fill that vacancy up to 60 days after, and the only change this Bill would make is to say that if they wish to so fill it, that person must still get signatures just like the Party would have had to get to qualify a candidate before the Primary.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 96th Ill. Gen. Assem., House Proceedings, April 2, 2009, at 6 (statements of Representative Fortner).</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b1105-4\" pgmap=\"1105\">\u201cThe way this Bill would do it, the Party chairs, the ones who would currently do the slating, they can still do that slating. They would identify who their candidate is. Then that candidate would proceed to get signatures.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 96th Ill. Gen. Assem., House Proceedings, April 2, 2009, at 15 (statements of Representative Fortner).</blockquote> <p id=\"b1105-5\" pgmap=\"1105\">While the dissent contends that the words \u201cnotice of appointment\u201d substitute for the filing of a resolution, that is mere conjecture. Absolutely nothing in the legislative debates or the language of the statute either before or after its amendment suggests this was the intent of the legislature. There is nothing, as suggested by the dissent, \u201cmisguided\u201d about this interpretation of the statute. If the legislature, which we are not, wanted to remove the resolution and three-day filing requirements, it could have easily done so. It did not. Thus, it seems clear that the legislature contemplated that a political party would still be required to first file a resolution naming its candidate, and then that candidate would be required to file petitions.</p> <p id=\"b1105-6\" pgmap=\"1105\">We find that a resolution filling the vacancy in this case had to be sent by United States mail or personal delivery to the certifying officer or board within three days of the action filling the vacancy. Since this was not done, the petitioner\u2019s purported nomination could not withstand a properly filed objection.</p> <p id=\"b1105-7\" pgmap=\"1105\"> The petitioner next contends that the objector\u2019s objection was not filed in a timely manner because it was not filed until April 26, 2010. The petitioner argues that any objection to any resolution filed under section 7 \u2014 61 was required to be filed \u201cwithin 5 business days\u201d after the last day for filing the applicable resolution, which according to the petitioner would have been April 5, 2010, five business days from March 29, 2010, the date the objector contends was the deadline for the committee to file the resolution.</p> <p id=\"b1105-8\" pgmap=\"1105\">Section 7 \u2014 61 of the Code provides as follows: \u201cThe provisions of [sjection 10 \u2014 8 through 10 \u2014 10.1 relating to objections to certificates of nomination and nomination papers, hearings on objections, and judicial review[ ] shall apply to and govern objections to resolutions for filling a vacancy in nomination.\u201d 10 ILCS 5/7 \u2014 61 (West Supp. 2009). Section 10 \u2014 8 provides in relevant part as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b1105-9\" pgmap=\"1105(19) 1106(53)\">\u201cCertificates of nomination and nomination papers, and petitions to submit public questions to a referendum, being filed as required by this Code, and being in apparent conformity with the provisions of this Act, shall be deemed to be valid unless objection thereto is duly made in writing within 5 business days after the last day for filing the certificate of nomination or nomination papers or petition for a public question ***[.]</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b1106-3\" pgmap=\"1106\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b1106-4\" pgmap=\"1106\">The provisions of this [sjection and of [elections 10 \u2014 9, 10 \u2014 10[,] and 10 \u2014 10.1 shall also apply to and govern objections to petitions for nomination filed under [a]rticle 7 or [a]rticle 8 ***.\u201d 10 ILCS 5/10 \u2014 8 (West 2008).</blockquote> <p id=\"b1106-5\" pgmap=\"1106\">Section 7 \u2014 61 further provides in relevant part as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b1106-6\" pgmap=\"1106\">\u201cIf the name of no established political party candidate was printed on the general primary ballot for a particular office and if no person was nominated as a write-in candidate for such office, a vacancy in nomination shall be filled only by a person designated by the appropriate committee of the political party and only if that designated person files nominating petitions with the number of signatures required for an established party candidate for that office within 75 days after the day of the general primary.\u201d 10 ILCS 5/7 \u2014 61 (West Supp. 2009).</blockquote> <p id=\"b1106-7\" pgmap=\"1106\">Here, the general primary was held on February 2, 2010. Thus, under section 7 \u2014 61 the last day the petitioner could have filed her nomination papers was Monday, April 19, 2010, 76 days after the general primary, since the seventy-fifth day fell on a Sunday. 10 ILCS 5/7 \u2014 61 (West Supp. 2009). Therefore, pursuant to section 10 \u2014 8, the objector had until Monday, April 26, 2010, to file her objection, seven days after the last day for filing nomination papers, since the fifth and sixth days fell on a Saturday and Sunday, respectively. 10 ILCS 5/10 \u2014 8 (West 2008); see Thomas v. Powell, 289 Ill. App. 3d 143, 147 (1997) (finding that the board and the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction when the objection was not filed within five days after the last day for filing nomination papers). In this case, the objection was filed on April 26, 2010, \u201cwithin 5 business days after the last day for filing\u201d (10 ILCS 5/10 \u2014 8 (West 2008)). Accordingly, the board and the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction, and this argument fails.</p> <p id=\"b1106-8\" pgmap=\"1106\">CONCLUSION</p> <p id=\"b1106-9\" pgmap=\"1106\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the orders of the circuit court of St. Clair County and the board.</p> <p id=\"b1106-10\" pgmap=\"1106\">Affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b1106-11\" pgmap=\"1106\">STEWART, J., concurs.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b1107-3\" pgmap=\"1107\">JUSTICE SPOMER,</author> <p id=\"ACF\" pgmap=\"1107\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b1107-4\" pgmap=\"1107\">I respectfully dissent. For the reasons that follow, I would reverse the decisions of the circuit court and the board and remand with directions that the petitioner\u2019s name be placed on the ballot for the November 2, 2010, general election.</p> <p id=\"b1107-5\" pgmap=\"1107\">I cannot agree with the majority that the General Assembly, when amending section 7 \u2014 61 of the Code, intended to require the filing of a resolution to fill a vacancy in nomination in a case such as this one, as opposed to one created after a primary election resulting in a certified nominee. To the contrary, the amended portion of section 7 \u2014 61 sets forth a separate and distinct procedure for situations such as we have here and specifically substitutes a \u201cnotice of appointment\u201d for the filing of a resolution.</p> <p id=\"b1107-6\" pgmap=\"1107\">In support of her contention that a resolution was required, the objector relies upon paragraph three of section 7 \u2014 61 of the Code, which states as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b1107-7\" pgmap=\"1107\">\u201cAny vacancy in nomination under the provisions of this Article 7 occurring on or after the primary and prior to certification of candidates by the certifying board or officer! 1 must be filled prior to the date of certification. Any vacancy in nomination occurring after certification but prior to 15 days before the general election shall be filled within 8 days after the event creating the vacancy. The resolution filling the vacancy shall be sent by U.S. mail or personal delivery to the certifying officer or board within 3 days of the action by which the vacancy was filled; provided, if such resolution is sent by mail and the U.S. postmark on the envelope containing such resolution is dated prior to the expiration of such 3[-]day limit, the resolution shall be deemed filed within such 3[-]day limit. Failure to so transmit the resolution within the time specified in this Section shall authorize the certifying officer or board to certify the original candidate. Vacancies shall be filled by the officers of a local municipal or township political party as specified in subsection (h) of Section 7 \u2014 8, other than a statewide political party, that is established only within a municipality or township and the managing committee (or legislative committee in case of a candidate for State Senator or representative committee in the case of a candidate for State Representative in the General Assembly or State central committee in the case of a candidate for statewide office, including but not limited to the office of United States Senator) of the respective political party for the territorial area in which such vacancy occurs.\u201d 10 ILCS 5/7 \u2014 61 (West Supp. 2009).</blockquote> <p id=\"b1107-8\" pgmap=\"1107(35) 1108(308)\">To determine whether paragraph three is in fact applicable to the present case, we must construe the statute as written by the General Assembly. I agree with the majority that a statute must be evaluated as a whole, with each provision construed in connection with every other section, and so that no term is rendered superfluous or meaningless. See 403 Ill. App. 3d at 1082, quoting Bonaguro v. County Officers Electoral Board, 158 Ill. 2d 391, 397 (1994). However, unlike the majority, I conclude that when paragraph three is read in light of the other provisions of section 7 \u2014 61, it is clear that the section as a whole contemplates two distinct types of vacancies in nomination that may occur, and it provides the means for filling the vacancies in each situation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Paragraph eight of the section states, \u201cA vacancy in nomination occurs when a candidate who has been nominated under the provisions of this Article 7 dies before the election *** or declines the nomination; provided that nominations may become vacant for other reasons.\u201d 10 ILCS 5/7 \u2014 61 (West Supp. 2009). It is in the above-described situation, which for ease of discussion I shall deem \u201cSituation A,\u201d that paragraphs three and four apply, for each paragraph clearly and unequivocally references the \u201coriginal\u201d candidate or nominee. 10 ILCS 5/7 \u2014 61 (West Supp. 2009). This is supported by the fact that paragraph three provides, \u201cFailure to so transmit the resolution within the time specified in this Section shall authorize the certifying officer or board to certify the original candidate.\u201d 10 ILCS 5/7 \u2014 61 (West Supp. 2009). Thus, paragraph three clearly contemplates the situation where there was an original candidate and that person either dies before the election or declines the nomination. It does not, and by definition could not, apply to a situation where there was no \u201coriginal candidate,\u201d a fact the majority plainly and inexplicably fails to address. In that situation, which exists in the case at bar, only paragraph nine applies.</p> <p id=\"b1108-4\" pgmap=\"1108(110) 1109(186)\">Paragraph nine, which was amended by Public Act 96 \u2014 809 and Public Act 96 \u2014 848 and became effective in its present form on January 1, 2010, states, \u201cIf the name of no established political party candidate was printed on the consolidated primary ballot for a particular office and if no person was nominated as a write-in candidate for such office, a vacancy in nomination shall be created which may be filled in accordance with the requirements of this Section.\u201d 10 ILCS 5/7 \u2014 61 (West Supp. 2009). In that situation, which I shall deem \u201cSituation B,\u201d paragraph nine provides that the vacancy in nomination may be filled only when the following three conditions are met: (1) the person to fill the vacancy in nomination has been \u201cdesignated by the appropriate committee of the political party\u201d in question, (2) the designated person obtains nominating petitions with the number of signatures required for an established party candidate for that office, with the circulation period to begin \u201con the day the appropriate committee designates that person,\u201d and (3) the designated person has filed, together, the following required documents, within 75 days after the day of the general primary: \u201chis or her nominating petitions, statements of candidacy, notice of appointment by the appropriate committee, and receipt of filing his or her statement of economic interests.\u201d 10 ILCS 5/7 \u2014 61 (West Supp. 2009). Paragraph nine does not require the filing of a resolution in Situation B; indeed, paragraph nine never uses the word \u201cresolution\u201d at all. In a situation such as this one, where the General Assembly has clearly and unequivocally stated what documents must be filed, I decline to read into that statement an additional, unlisted requirement found in an entirely unrelated paragraph.</p> <p id=\"b1109-3\" pgmap=\"1109\">This is further supported by the amendments the legislature made to paragraph nine of section 7 \u2014 61. Previously, that section provided as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b1109-4\" pgmap=\"1109\">\u201cIf the name of no established political party candidate was printed on the general primary ballot for a particular office and if no person was nominated as a write-in candidate for such office, a vacancy in nomination shall be created, but no candidate of the party for the office shall be listed on the ballot at the general election unless such vacancy is filled in accordance with the requirements of this Section within 60 days after the date of the general primary.\u201d 10 ILCS 5/7 \u2014 61 (West 2008).</blockquote> <p id=\"b1109-5\" pgmap=\"1109\">That section now, however, sets forth more specifically the requirements the candidate must complete. See 10 ILCS 5/7 \u2014 61 (West Supp. 2009). In the situation where there is no original candidate on the ballot and no write-in, the candidate must now show \u201cgrassroots\u201d support by complying with the requirements in paragraph nine that were not previously included in paragraph nine prior to the amendment. To hold otherwise would be clearly against the legislative intent in making this amendment and against this state\u2019s position in favor of ballot access for candidates running for public office. See Hossfeld v. Illinois State Board of Elections, 398 Ill. App. 3d 737, 743 (2010), appeal allowed, 236 Ill. 2d 504 (2010); In re Objection of McSparin, 352 Ill. App. 3d 352, 357 (2004); Zerante v. Bloom Township Electoral Board, 287 Ill. App. 3d 976, 980 (1997).</p> <p id=\"b1109-6\" pgmap=\"1109(20) 1110(312)\">A second glaring problem with the majority\u2019s misguided attempt to graft the content of paragraph three into the requirements of paragraph nine is that when setting out the requirement that a resolution pursuant to that paragraph be filed within three days of the action taken to fill the vacancy, paragraph three specifically refers to the resolution as a \u201cresolution filling the vacancy.\u201d 10 ILCS 5/7 \u2014 61 (West Supp. 2009). In Situation A, to which paragraph three applies, that would be true: the resolution would in fact fill the vacancy. In Situation B, however, the vacancy is not filled by the resolution, even under the scenario put forward by the majority: by the plain language of paragraph nine, the vacancy is filled when the three conditions described above are met. This contradiction, which renders the phrase \u201cresolution filling the vacancy\u201d in paragraph three superfluous, meaningless, and in fact contradictory when applied to paragraph nine, is left unexplained by the majority. Indeed, the resolution requirement itself is superfluous and meaningless when applied to Situation B, because, as noted above, Situation B requires the \u201cgrassroots\u201d work of collecting petition signatures. It defies logic that in a situation where the candidate has already received from the committee a notice of appointment and has gone on to collect signatures, the committee would also be required to file a resolution. What, one might rightfully ask, would be the point of that resolution? To the extent an argument could be made that the filing of the resolution somehow provided \u201cnotice\u201d to the public of the committee\u2019s selection, that notice would provide no protection to the public, as it would not prevent others from circulating petitions as well. Only the notice of appointment, which is clearly and unequivocally required by paragraph nine to be filed, would provide that protection and prevent unauthorized petitioners from appearing on the ballot, which is probably why it, and not the resolution, is required by the amended Code.</p> <p id=\"b1110-4\" pgmap=\"1110(138) 1111(24)\">In the case at bar, it was clearly Situation B, not Situation A, that occurred: as related above, at the February 2, 2010, general primary election, no candidate\u2019s name was printed on the Republican Party ballot in St. Clair County for the office of board of review member, and no candidate was nominated as a write-in for that office. Accordingly, on March 25, 2010, the committee held a meeting at which it passed a motion designating the petitioner as the appointee for candidacy for the office of board of review member. Although on April 1, 2010, the committee filed a \u201cresolution/certificate of appointment\u201d with the clerk, stating that the committee had designated the petitioner as its appointee, there was no requirement that such a resolution be filed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, an objection to the timeliness of the resolution does not provide a legal basis by which to challenge the petitioner\u2019s candidacy, and the decisions of the circuit court and the board should be reversed.</p> <p id=\"b1111-4\" pgmap=\"1111\">The majority relies upon judicial dictum found in this court\u2019s decision in Forcade-Osborn v. Madison County Electoral Board, 334 Ill. App. 3d 756, 759 (2002). However, Forcade-Osborn was decided prior to the amendment of paragraph nine, and whatever persuasiveness our dicta might have once had is now eviscerated. Moreover, neither Forcade-Osborn nor any other of the preamendment cases upon which the majority relies dealt with the issue of whether a resolution was required in a situation such as this one, and I question the relevance of any of the cases cited by the majority to the issue at hand. However, although not controlling, two recent decisions from the Illinois State Board of Elections do address the exact issue before us, and both decisions support my position rather than the position taken by the majority. Jenkins, Ill. St. Officers Electoral Bd. No. 10SOEBGE 500 (June 7, 2010); Marquardt, Ill. St. Officers Electoral Bd. No. 10SOEBGE 101 (June 9, 2010).</p> <p id=\"b1111-5\" pgmap=\"1111\">Finally, although the majority finds \u201cno indication\u201d in the legislative debates that the General Assembly \u201cintended to remove the resolution and three-day filing requirements\u201d (403 Ill. App. 3d at 1088), I would note that there is also no indication that the General Assembly intended to apply the paragraph three requirements to paragraph nine. In fact, the issue did not arise in the debates, and the substance of the debates revolved around the number of signatures required. No other requirements were debated. Representative Fortner\u2019s comments, quoted by the majority (403 Ill. App. 3d at 1088-89), must be considered, if at all, in their proper context.</p> <p id=\"b1111-6\" pgmap=\"1111\">For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b1108-5\" pgmap=\"1108\"> Paragraph seven of the section contemplates a third type of vacancy in nomination: one that occurs \u201c15 days or less\u201d before the election; however, paragraph seven states that in those situations, the vacancy in nomination shall not be filled and \u201cthe certification of the original candidate shall stand,\u201d a situation clearly not relevant to the case at bar. 10 ILCS 5/7 \u2014 61 (West Supp. 2009).</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"2\"> <p id=\"b1110-5\" pgmap=\"1110(28) 1111(39)\"> The majority wonders why, if no resolution was required, the committee filed one. 403 Ill. App. 3d at 1087. The answer, I suspect, is that the committee was acting out of an abundance of caution, which is not surprising given the General Assembly\u2019s dubious record when it comes to providing candidates and the voting public with an election code that is simple, straightforward, and user-friendly.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
