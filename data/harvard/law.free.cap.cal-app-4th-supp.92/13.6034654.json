In this appeal it is conceded that there was a posted, prima facie limit, that radar established defendant was traveling in excess of 65 miles per hour; and that the officer cited appellant for exceeding the maximum speed law, but did not cite him for exceeding the lower, posted, prima facie limit,  Appellant\u2019s position is that if there is a speed trap as to a posted limit, it is unlawful to enforce even the maximum speed limit. This appeal turns on the definition of \u201cspeed trap\u201d contained in section 40802 of the Vehicle Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-9\">Stripped of the phrases which explain or expand on subjects not in issue here, the relevant portion of the statute in question reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-10\">\u201c(a) A \u2018speed trap\u2019 is either of the following: [1Q . . . HD</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-11\">\u201c(2) A particular section of a highway with a prima facie speed limit. . . under . . . Section 22352, or . . . under Section 22354, 22357, 22358, or 22358.3, if that prima facie speed limit is not justified . . . , and enforcement of <em>the speed limit </em>involves the use of radar . . .\u201d (Veh. Code, \u00a7 40802, subd. (a), italic added.) (The full text of the section is set forth in the appendix, <em>post.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1287-12\">The question we must answer is whether the emphasized \u201cspeed limit\u201d means <em>any </em>speed limit for which the citation was issued, or rather, only those speed limits referenced in the antecedent portion of Vehicle Code, section 40802, subdivision (a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-13\">Appellant relies upon the persuasive effect of <em>People </em>v. <em>Studley </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 461], a case with the same significant facts as this matter on appeal and in square agreement in its decision. In <em>Studley, </em>the court relied upon the legislative intent found in the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 16\">*Supp. 16</page-number>legislative scheme regarding radar and found the radar evidence inadmissible: \u201c[A]fter a close reading of the statutes in question, we find the Legislature\u2019s antipathy toward any radar-based prosecution of any speed law violation in any posted zone, where the prima facie speed limit is not justified by proof of a timely engineering survey, is absolute and unequivocal.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. Supp. 3, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">On the other hand, the People rely on the persuasive effect of the precisely contrary interpretation of the speed trap laws as set forth in <em>People v. DiFiore </em>(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d Supp. 26 [243 Cal.Rptr. 359]. <em>DiFiore </em>reasoned: \u201cA person who drives in excess of the maximum lawful speed has not been subjected to a \u2018speed trap\u2019 even if his speed has been detected by radar on a posted road unless the officer relies on the posted or prima facie speed limit.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. Supp. 29.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">Faced with these contrary interpretations of Vehicle Code section 40802, this court engages in its own analysis of the statute, and follows the guidelines for construction and interpretation of a statute as explained in <em>J.A. Jones Construction Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1568, 1575-1576 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 206]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-6\">\u201cThe extent to which the intent behind a law is to override the actual words of that law is one of those eternal questions that will always be around to challenge lawyers and jurists. Suffice to say we are obviously not going to resolve it now. What we <em>can </em>do, however, is ascertain a few basic principles applicable to the case at hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-7\">\u201cWe start with the two statutes bearing directly on the interpretation of statutes, sections 1858 and 1859 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Section 1858 is a simple declaration. \u2018In the construction of a statute or instrument, the office of the Judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, <em>not to insert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted </em>. . . .\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-8\">\u201cBut the court\u2019s task is a little more complex than just sticking to the text. Section 1859 directs the court to a consideration of the intent of the Legislature <em>if possible. </em>\u2018In the construction of a statute the intention of the Legislature, and in the construction of the instrument the intention of the parties, is to be pursued, if possible . . . .\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-9\">\u201cThe two statutes could easily collide were it not for those two words \u2018if possible\u2019 in section 1859. By putting those escape words in the \u2018intent\u2019 statute rather than the \u2018text\u2019 statute, it appears that, when push comes to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 17\">*Supp. 17</page-number>shove, inescapably plain text should prevail. (Or, to be precise, plain text will prevail most of the time\u2014there are a few exceptions, mentioned in passing below, for scrivener\u2019s errors, absurd results, and results at odds with the <em>unmistakable </em>or <em>clear </em>intent of the Legislature.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-5\">\u201cSo courts should start, . . . , with the actual language of the statute, and if the text is clear as applied to a given case, and it does not fall into any of the exceptions, stop there. [Citation.] As Oliver Wendell Holmes said, \u2018we do not inquire what the legislature meant; we ask only what the statute means.\u2019 [Citation.] If there is any \u2018modem trend\u2019 in this area, it is more and more to emphasize the actual words of the statute.\u201d (Italics in original, fn. omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1289-6\">Examining the language of the section in question, we find \u201cspeed limit,\u201d as that term is used with reference to enforcement, is not modified by \u201cprima facie.\u201d From this, appellant argues the section is ambiguous and, thus, consideration of legislative intent is necessary. However, such an interpretation would require us to read the statute as if it contained the all-inclusive, indefinite article \u201ca,\u201d i.e., \u201cenforcement of a speed limit.\u201d Notably, the Legislature chose the definite article <em>\u201cthe\u201d </em>not the indefinite, and so, the statute reads, \u201cenforcement of <em>the </em>speed limit.\u201d (Veh. Code, \u00a7 40802, subd. (a)(2), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-7\">Within the sentence under consideration, there is but one reference to \u201cspeed limit\u201d to which the definite article may refer. The reference is to a subset of speed limits; namely, prima facie speed limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-8\">The literal meaning being clear, although the analysis arcane, no reference to a general purpose of the Legislature is required. \u201cIn summary: If an officer testifies only that he clocked a defendant on radar at a specified speed in excess of [the maximum speed limit], no \u2018speed trap\u2019 is involved, and the anti-speed-trap laws do not apply. If, however, that officer relies on a prima facie or posted speed limit, that officer is incompetent as a witness and any evidence concerning the vehicle\u2019s speed is inadmissible unless an adequate survey is introduced.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>DiFiore, supra, </em>197 Cal.App.3d at pp. Supp. 29-30, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 18\">*Supp. 18</page-number>Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">Vehicle Code section 40802.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-5\">(a) A \u201cspeed trap\u201d is either of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1290-6\">(1) A particular section of a highway measured as to distance and with boundaries marked, designated, or otherwise determined in order that the speed of a vehicle may be calculated by securing the time it takes the vehicle to travel the known distance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1290-7\">(2) A particular section of a highway with a prima facie speed limit that is provided by this code or by local ordinance under subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 22352, or established under Section 22354, 22357, 22358, or 22358.3, if that prima facie speed limit is not justified by an engineering and traffic survey conducted within five years prior to the date of the alleged violation, and enforcement of the speed limit involves the use of radar or any other electronic device that measures the speed of moving objects.
