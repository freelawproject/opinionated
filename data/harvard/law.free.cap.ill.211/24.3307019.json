Russell P. Goodwin, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-5\" pgmap=\"25\">This was a bill in chancery filed in the superior court of Cook county by the appellee, a resident and tax-payer of the city of Chicago, against the city of Chicago, its mayor and certain other officers of said city, to enjoin said city from constructing by day labor a portion of section D of the Lawrence avenue main conduit for intercepting sewers. The city and its officers, who were made defendants to said bill, filed an answer thereto, and upon a hearing upon bill and answer a decree was entered granting an injunction restraining the city of Chicago and its officers from constructing said work otherwise than by a contract or contracts let, after advertising and receiving bids therefor, to the lowest responsible bidder or bidders. An appeal was prosecuted from said decree by the appellants to the Appellate Court for the First District, where the same was affirmed, and a further appeal has been prosecuted to this court.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-6\" pgmap=\"25(141) 26(336)\">It appears from the bill and answer that the city council of the city of Chicago, prior to May 2,1898, passed, an ordinance for the construction in said city of section D of the Lawrence avenue main conduit for intercepting sewers; that on said*second day of May a contract was entered into between the city of Chicago and John W. Farley and John Green, doing business under the name of Farley &amp; Green, for the construction of said work. The contract provided that the work should be commenced on or before May 3, 1898, and should progress thereafter uninterruptedly, unless otherwise ordered by the commissioner of public works, and should be completed on or before September 1, 1899. The time of the commencement, rate of progress and time of completion of the improvement were made essential conditions of the contract. The contract provided that everything pertaining to the work should be in every particular satisfactory to the commissioner of public works, and that the work should be done in accordance with certain plans and specifications which were made a part of the contract. It was provided, among other things, by the contract that the work should be prosecuted with such force as the commissioner of public works should deem adequate to its completion within the time specified, and if at any time the contractors should refuse or neglect to prosecute the work with a force sufficient, in the opinion of the said commissioner, for its completion within a specified time, or if, in any event, the contractor should fail to proceed with the work in accordance with the requirements and conditions of the contract, the city, by its commissioner of public works, should have the right and authority to take the work out of the contractor\u2019s hands and to employ other workmen to complete the unfinished work, and to deduct the expenses thereof from any money that might be due the contractors on account of the work or to re-let the same to other parties. Farley &amp; Green entered into bond in the sum of $239,000 with the American Surety Company of New York as surety, conditioned for the faithful performance by Farley &amp; Green of their contract with the city for the construction of the improvement. The conduit was to be 12,817 feet in length, 3905 feet of which in Lawrence avenue, and extending from Lake Michigan to Beacon street, was to be what is known as an \u201copen cut,\u201d and the remainder was to be tunnel work. Farley &amp; Green proceeded with the work until they had completed the 3905 feet of open cut and 694 feet of the tunnel, making in all 4599 feet, and then abandoned the work and refused to perform their contract, leaving 8218 feet of the tunnel work uncompleted.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-4\" pgmap=\"26(18) 27(283)\">October 21, 1901, the city council passed an order, whereby, after reciting the default of Farley &amp; Green, the commissioner of public works was directed to advertise for bids for the completion of the work provided for by the Farley &amp; Green contract. The commissioner of public works advertised for bids as directed by the order, and in response to the advertisement received the following bids: Griffiths &amp; McDermott, $81.25 per foot; Joseph Hanreddy, $68 per foot; Fitz Simons &amp; Connell, $75 per foot; Nash Bros., $71.90 per foot. November 8, 1901, the commissioner of public works sent a written communication to the city council, stating that he had advertised for bids in accordance with the order of October 21, 1901, and transmitted the bids received by him to the city council. He also stated in said communication that the estimates made by the department of public works on said work was $66 per foot actual cost, not taking into consideration any unforeseen delays that might occur in the completion of the work, and that, taking everything into consideration, the department estimated the work could be done for $70 per foot, and stated if said work was done by day labor it would progress rapidly, and all chances of extras, on account of unforeseen delays or other conditions, would be eliminated, and suggested, before the city council recommended any award of a contract for the completion of the work, that the policy of doing said work by day labor be thoroughly investigated. After the receipt of said communication from the commissioner of public works, the city council, on December 16, 1901, passed an ordinance, the material parts of which are as follows: \u201cBe it ordained by the city council of the city of Chicago:</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-5\" pgmap=\"27(67) 28(176)\">\u201cSec. 1.

The section of the statute above quoted not only provides that all contracts for the making of any public improvement to be paid for, in whole or in part, by a special assessment, where the expense thereof shall exceed $500, shall be let to the lowest responsible bidder after advertising for bids, but it also provides that \u201cany work or other public improvement, when the expense thereof shall exceed $500, shall be let to the lowest responsible bidder\u201d after advertising for bids, clearly showing that the legislature had in mind a public work or improvement which might be paid for by a fund derived from a source other than that of a special assessment, as well as an improvement which was to be paid for by a special assessment. The language used is so clear and specific as not to admit of construction. The fact that section 50 is found in article 9 of the City and Village act, which article is given the sub-title \u201cSpecial assessment for local improvements,\u201d is unimportant. The provision is general, and the language, \u201cany work or other public improvement,\u201d must be held to include all work or other public improvement, whether the same is to be paid for from funds raised by special assessment, general taxation or other public funds, as in this case from the water fund.</p> <p id=\"b31-5\" pgmap=\"31(45) 32(123)\">It is next contended, that even though it be conceded that if a contract for a public improvement be let by the city it must be to the lowest responsible bidder after advertising for bids, still, it is said, the city had a discretion whether it would complete the work by contract or do the work by day labor, and if it determined to do the work by day labor no public letting was necessary. The language of the section is, \u201cany work or other public improvement, when the expense thereof shall exceed $500, shall be let to the lowest responsible bidder.\u201d No discretion is thereby conferred upon the city or any of its officers as to whether the work or improvement shall be constructed under contract or by day labor, but it is clear if the work or other public improvement will exceed in cost the sum of $500 it must be let to the lowest responsible bidder after advertising for bids.</p> <p id=\"b32-5\" pgmap=\"32(246) 33(119)\">It is further contended that said section 50 should not be held to apply to unfinished work, where a valid contract had been let and the contractor had abandoned the work. We find no authority for reading into said section an exception to the effect that where a valid contract has been let after advertising for bids, and the contractor has abandoned the work, the city may complete the work by day labor, where the cost of the unfinished work will exceed the sum of $500. The authorities relied upon by the appellants to sustain their position we are of the opinion are not in point. They are cases where the improvement had been completed and accepted by the municipality and an action had been brought against the city for the value thereof) or they arose under statutory provisions which were different from the provisions of the statute in force in this State. To hold that the statute does not apply to an unfinished public improvement after the work has been abandoned by the contractor would be to permit contracts for public improvements to be let to irresponsible parties, which, when abandoned after some portion of the work had been done, would open wide the door to fraud and destroy competition, and enable city officials to do indirectly what in express terms they are prohibited from doing by the statute. The \u2022 object of the statute is to require the municipalities of this State to advertise for bids upon, any work or other public improvement which they propose to construct, and to let the same to the lowest responsible bidder. The statute is in general terms and applies to all public improvements where the costs exceed $500, and the fact that a contract for the improvement had once been let and the work abandoned before completion, if the cost of completing the same will exceed the sum of $500, does not authorize the municipality to complete the improvement by day labor, but a contract for its completion must be let to the lowest responsible bidder after an advertisement for bids. To hold otherwise would be to nullify the statute.</p> <p id=\"b33-4\" pgmap=\"33\">It is further contended that section 50 is repealed by \u201cAn act concerning local improvements,\u201d approved June 14, 1897. In disposing- of this question the Appellate Court used the following language, with which we agree: \u201cThe act of 1897 is not a revision of the whole subject of the act of 1872, nor is it intended as a substitute for that act; neither is it a revision of the whole subject of -article 9 of the act of 1872. The act of 1897, as admitted by appellants\u2019 counsel, relates exclusively to local improvements, or such as enhance the value of property adjacent to them, while the language of section 50, article 9, of the act of 1872, \u2018any work or other public improvement, \u2019 includes work and improvements not merely local, but such that the benefits thereof are diffused throughout the municipality. Repeals by implication are not favored, and it cannot reasonably be said that a statute relating exclusively to local improvements can, by implication, repeal a provision in a former statute including work and improvements not local.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b33-5\" pgmap=\"33(47) 34(239)\">It is also urged that to give said section 50 the construction contended for by appellee would be to so far embarrass the municipalities of this State in making public improvements, when such municipalities are indebted above the five per cent constitutional limit, as to render said section 50 unconstitutional and void. Said section provides that a contract for any work or other public improvement, upon a two-thirds vote of all the aldermen or trustees, may be entered into by the proper officer of a city or village without advertising for bids and without the approval of the mayor or president of the board of trustees. This proviso was doubtless passed to enable cities and villages to make contracts for public improvements without advertising for bids and without the approval of the mayor or president of the board of trustees in cases of emergency, and the powers therein contained are broad enough to authorize them to pay for the improvement as the work progresses, which fact entirely removes the objection urged by the appellants to the constitutionality of said section 50. The fact that the emergency might not be of so serious a character as to induce the requisite number of aldermen or trustees to vote to authorize a contract to be made for a public improvement without advertising for bids or without the approval of the mayor or president of the board of trustees, and to pay for the improvement as the work progressed, would be no sufficient reason to authorize the courts to hold that such municipalities had the power to make contracts not only not authorized by the statute, but by the express provisions of the statute prohibited.</p> <p id=\"b34-5\" pgmap=\"34\">From an examination of the questions here presented for determination the conclusion has been reached that the ordinance of December 16, 1901, authorizing the work of completing said improvement to be done by day labor, was passed by the city council without authority of law and that said ordinance is void, and that the injunction restraining the city and its officers from proceeding to complete the work under the terms of said void ordinance was properly granted by the superior court.</p> <p id=\"b34-6\" pgmap=\"34\">The judgment of the Appellate Court will therefore be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"AqU\" pgmap=\"34\">_ Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
