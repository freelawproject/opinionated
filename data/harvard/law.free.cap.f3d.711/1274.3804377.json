Posters suit is brought pursuant to the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3131 <em>et seq., </em>which provides a subcontractor who has supplied labor or materials on federal government construction projects, but has not been paid, with the right to sue the surety that provided the primary contractor with the statutorily required payment bond. The Miller Act requires that such suits be brought \u201cin the name of the United States for the use of the person bringing the action.\u201d 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3133(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">Travelers argues that Postel\u2019s appeal, which was not filed until fifty-five days after the district court\u2019s order, is untimely and must therefore, be dismissed. Postel responds, however, that when a lawsuit is brought in the name of the United States as required by the Miller Act, it had sixty days in which to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">In a civil case, a notice of appeal generally \u201cmust be filed with the district clerk within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). The time allowed is extended to sixty days when one of the parties is the United States or its officer or agency. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B). Because \u201cthe taking of an appeal within the prescribed time is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 \u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 209, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007), we cannot entertain Postel\u2019s appeal unless the United States is a party to this litigation within the meaning of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-8\">Postel relies on <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v. United States for the Benefit of Kenyon, </em>204 U.S. 349, 27 S.Ct. 381, 51 L.Ed. 516 (1907), which it argues established that the United States is a real party in interest for purposes of determining the deadline to file a notice of appeal. In <em>Kenyon, </em>the Court considered whether the United States was the plaintiff in an action brought pursuant to the Heard Act, the predecessor act to the Miller Act, for purposes of establishing jurisdiction in federal court, but not for determining the time for filing a notice of appeal. 204 U.S. at 354, 27 S.Ct. 381. The Court concluded that the United States was not \u201cmerely a nominal or formal party,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 356, 27 S.Ct. 381, and that an action under the Heard Act \u201cmay fairly be regarded as one by the United States itself to enforce the specific obligation of the contractor to make prompt payment for labor and materials,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 357, 27 S.Ct. 381. In reaching its conclusion, the Court explained that the statutorily required bond \u201cis not simply one to secure the faithful performance by the contractor of the duties he owes directly to the government in relation to the specific work undertaken by him,\u201d but that it also contained a \u201cspecial stipulation with the United States that the contractor shall promptly make payments to all persons supplying labor and materials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Court concluded that this payment provision of the bond \u201cran to the United States, and was therefore enforceable by suit in its name.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-9\">Although the Court in <em>Kenyon </em>concluded that the United States is a real party in interest for purposes of federal court jurisdiction under the Heard Act, we are not persuaded that it supports the conclusion that the United States is a party in an action brought under the Miller Act for purposes of determining the deadline for filing a notice of appeal. We have previously explained that the Miller Act made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>changes to the original Heard Act, specifically with regard to the contractor\u2019s obligation to post a bond. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v. Hendry Corp., </em>391 F.2d 13, 19 (5th Cir.1968).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the Heard Act, the contractor was required to post only <em>one </em>bond, \u201cwhich was to protect both the Government and the suppliers of labor and materials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the Miller Act amended the statute to require the contractor to post <em>two </em>bonds, \u201cone protection [sic] the government against failure to perform, the other protecting the subcontractor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, whereas the one bond required under the Heard Act secured not only the contractor\u2019s performance obligation to the government but also contained \u201cthe specific, special obligation directly to the United States that the contractor\u201d would make payments to the subcontractor for labor and supplies, <em>Kenyon, </em>204 U.S. at 357, 27 S.Ct. 381, under the Miller Act, \u201c[t]he government, being safeguarded by the performance bond, had no direct interest on the payment bond.\u201d <em>Hendry, </em>391 F.2d at 19. Accordingly, the Court\u2019s rationale in <em>Kenyon </em>for concluding that the government is a real party in interest to a subcontractor\u2019s claim for payment under the Heard Act is inapplicable to a claim brought against the payment bond under the Miller Act, and thus, does not resolve the jurisdictional question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">Although the Miller Act requires a subcontractor to bring suit \u201cin the name of the United States for the use of the person bringing the action,\u201d 40 U.S.C. 3133(b)(3)(A), this requirement does nothing more than make the United States a nominal party, which by itself is insufficient for party status under Rule 4(a)(1)(B). In <em>United States ex rel. Eisenstein v. New York, New York, </em>556 U.S. 928, 129 S.Ct. 2230, 173 L.Ed.2d 1255 (2009), the Supreme Court considered whether the United States was a party to a <em>qui tam </em>action under the False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d) for purposes of the sixty-day filing deadline for a notice of appeal. The Court concluded that where the United States did not formally intervene in a <em>qui tam </em>action under the FCA, it was not a party for purposes of the sixty-day notice of appeal deadline, even though the FCA required the action to be brought in the name of the United States. <em>Eisenstein, </em>556 U.S. at 935,129 S.Ct. 2230. The Court explained that \u201c[a] person or entity can be named in the caption of a complaint without necessarily becoming a party to the action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court reasoned that \u201cCongress\u2019 choice of the term \u2018party\u2019 in Rule 4(a)(1)(B) and \u00a7 2107(b), and not the distinctive phrase, \u2018real party in interest,\u2019 indicates that the 60-day time limit applies only when the United States is an actual \u2018party\u2019 in <em>qui tam </em>actions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-9\">The Court\u2019s decision in <em>Eisenstein </em>persuades us that the United States is not a party under Rule 4(a)(1)(B) for purposes of Postel\u2019s Miller Act claim. Miller Act claims, which must be brought in the name of the United States, are not unlike <em>qui tam </em>actions brought under the FCA in which the United States has chosen not to intervene. Neither requires the United States to be an actual party to the litigation. Because Postel does not argue that the United States has any involvement in this case, but instead relies solely on the statutory requirement that it bring its Miller Act claim in the name of the United States, we conclude that it was required to file its notice of appeal within thirty days under Rule 4(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>Accordingly, we hereby grant Travelers\u2019 motion to dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Bowles, </em>551 U.S. at 209, 127 S.Ct. 2360 (holding that the time for filing a notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional).</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">.
