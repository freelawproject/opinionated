Perez seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus and the denial of his motion to alter or amend judgment: a motion filed pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-6\">Perez\u2019s section 2254 petition challenged a state prison disciplinary proceeding which resulted in Perez\u2019s being punished with 15 days of disciplinary confinement, losing 30 days of \u201cgain time,\u201d and being unable to earn \u201cgain time\u201d for 4 months. The district court denied Perez\u2019s habeas petition and denied him a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-7\">Perez then filed a timely Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment, which the district court denied. Perez filed a notice of appeal and a motion to proceed IFP on appeal. The district court denied Perez\u2019s IFP motion. But the district court did not construe Perez\u2019s notice of appeal as an application for a COA and did not otherwise rule on a COA for Perez\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-8\">Because the denial of a Rule 59(e) motion constitutes a \u201cfinal order\u201d in a state habeas proceeding, we conclude that a COA is required before this appeal may proceed. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (requiring a COA for appeals from the \u201cfinal order\u201d in a state habeas proceeding); see also <em>Jackson v. Albany Appeal Bureau Unit, </em>442 F.3d 51, 54 (2d Cir.2006) (requiring a COA to appeal the denial of a Rule 59(e) motion); <em>Williams v. Thaler, </em>602 F.3d 291, 300 (5th Cir.2010) (same); <em>United States v. Lambros, </em>404 F.3d 1034, 1036 (8th Cir.2005) (same); <em>Williams v. Woodford, </em>384 F.3d 567, 585 n. 4 (9th Cir.2005) (same); <em>cf. Gonzalez v. Sec\u2019y for the Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>366 F.3d 1253, 1263-64 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc) </em>(concluding that the denial of a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion constitutes a \u201cfinal order\u201d under section 2253(c)(1) and, thus, requires a COA).</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-10\">Both district court judges and circuit court judges can issue COAs. See <em>Edwards v. United States, </em>114 F.3d 1083, 1084 (11th Cir.1997). We generally require the district court to rule on the propriety of a COA before we address a request for a COA in this Court. <em>See id. </em>And we remand this case on a limited basis to allow the district court to grant or deny a COA for the denial of the Rule 59(e) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-11\">Perez\u2019s motion for leave to proceed on appeal IFP is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE to renew upon the district court\u2019s ruling on a COA.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
