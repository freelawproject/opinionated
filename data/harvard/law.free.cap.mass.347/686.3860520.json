L. c. 176, \u00a7 45. The commissioner\u2019s demurrer asserts that the Superior Court lacks jurisdiction. The case has been reported without decision by a judge of the Superior Court upon the pleadings and a statement of agreed facts constituting a case stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Association was organized in 1905 under R. L. c. 119 as a fraternal beneficiary corporation. It became subject to \u00a7 12<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of that chapter. By St. 1925, c. 96, Association was authorized to. pay \u2018 \u2018 death or funeral benefits not exceeding one thousand dollars, and disability benefits not exceeding twenty-five dollars weekly, <em>any provision of law or of its charter to the contrary notwithstanding\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). Statute 1925, c. 96, was amended by St. 1960, c. 128, so as to substitute the words \u201cfifteen hundred\u201d for \u201cone thousand\u201d and \u201cthirty-five\u201d for \u201ctwenty-five.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">General Laws c. 176, \u00a7 46,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> carried forward the provisions of R. L. c. 119, \u00a7 12, but the section was not embodied in G. L. c. 176 as revised by St. 1958, c. 540, \u00a7 1. Section 2 of c. 540 provided that any society (\u201cas defined in\u201d G. L. c. 176, as in effect immediately prior to the effective date of c. 540) \u201cwhich is transacting business on\u201d December 31, 1958, under the authority of c. 176, \u00a7\u00a7 45 to 46D (as theretofore in effect), \u201cmay exercise all the rights, powers and privileges prescribed for such society under\u201d c. 176 \u201cas in effect immediately preceding the effective date\u201d of c. 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">. By a letter from the Division of Insurance dated October 5, 1961, Association was informed of \u201ca definite decision\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>of the division\u2019s assistant attorney that Association was subject to Gr. L. c. 176, \u00a7 45.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is not argued by the commissioner that Association does not limit its membership as provided in Gr. L. c. 176, \u00a7 4. On the contrary the commissioner says that Association is a corporation within the class described by the words immediately following point [A] of \u00a7 45 (fn. 3) and that the italicized words (immediately following point [C] in \u00a7 45, fn. 3) apply only to the second class of organizations described in \u00a7 45 (see words immediately following point [B] of \u00a7 45 as quoted in fn. 3). Association contends that the words, \u201cany provision of law or of its charter to the contrary notwithstanding,\u201d found in the special acts relating to it (St. 1925, c. 96, and St. 1960, c. 128) have the consequence of leaving Association subject to \u00a7 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The matter appears to be of significance now by reason of St. 1961, c. 155,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which gives to the commissioner certain powers, with respect to corporations doing business under Gr. L. c. 176, \u00a7 45, as in effect prior to the effective date of St. 1958, c. 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">1. We think that St. 1925, c. 96, and St. 1960, c. 128, merely authorized Association to pay increased benefits. We interpret the words, \u201cany provision of law or of its charter to the contrary notwithstanding\u201d as having application only to the specific increased authority granted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>these two special statutes. It would take more explicit language to lead us to give any broader effect to the quoted words (probably inserted out of excess of caution to make sure that no other statutory provision would prevent payment of the increased benefits). We perceive no basis in the 1925 or the 1960 statutes for any contention that these words operated to keep Association subject to c. 176, \u00a7 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">2. This bill for declaratory relief comes within the principle declared in <em>Madden </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn. </em>333 Mass. 734, 736-737. See <em>St. Luke\u2019s Hosp. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>320 Mass. 467, 470-471. It is a sensible and proper method of obtaining judicial interpretation of the applicability of somewhat confusing statutes. It is clear that there exists genuine controversy concerning an issue of law between a corporation and a State agency, growing out of conflicting opinions of counsel. The State is not in any sense a party to the controversy or required to be one. See <em>Franklin Fair Assn. Inc. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>ante, 110, 113. The case of <em>Executive Air Serv. Inc. </em>v. <em>Division of Fisheries &amp; Game, </em>342 Mass. 356, 357-358, has no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">General Laws c. 30A does not preclude granting declaratory relief. The division has given at most only an advisory ruling. See c. 30A, \u00a7 8. There has been no adjudicatory proceeding. No exclusive statutory remedy precludes declaratory relief concerning this controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">3. A final decree is to be entered overruling the commissioner\u2019s demurrer and declaring (1) that Association is subject to G. L. c. 176, \u00a7 45, as in effect immediately prior to the effective date of St. 1958, c. 540, and (2) that Association is not relieved of any otherwise applicable statutory regulation by the Division of Insurance by reason of St. 1925, e. 96, as amended by St. 1960, c. 128, or the words therein contained, viz. \u201cany provision of law or of its charter to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-8\"> Section 12 read, \u201cA fraternal beneficiary corporation, \u2014 or an association which, limits its membership to a particular order, class or fraternity, or to the employees of . . . the commonwealth . . . \u2014 any one of which pays a death or funeral benefit not exceeding two hundred dollars, or disability benefits not exceeding ten dollars a week, or both, and which is not conducted as a business enterprise or for profit, may transact in this commonwealth such business, without otherwise conforming to the provisions of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b731-9\"> Section 46, as amended by St. 1955, c. 108, \u00a7 2, read in part, \u201cA domestic society which limits its membership as provided in section four . . . which pays a death or funeral benefit limited to not more than two hundred dollars, disability benefits not exceeding ten dollars a week, or any or all of such benefits . . . and which embraces therein only persons of the same occupation) may transact business in the commonwealth without conforming to the provisions of this chapter except this section and\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 29, 30, 36, 47, 47A, and 49 (none of which seem relevant to the present discussion), or to the provisions of c. 175, subject to a proviso not here relevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b732-6\"> Section 45, as amended by St. 1955, c. 108, \u00a7 1, read in part, <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>\u2018 </em>[A] Domes-_ tic fraternal benefit corporations governed by direct vote of their members and limiting their membership as provided in section four and [B] domestic fraternal benefit corporations limiting their membership to the permanent employees of . . . the commonwealth . . .
