It was alleged that the collision involved property damage of more than $200; that the petitioner, one of the drivers involved in the collision, had made his report to the registrar under G. L. e. 90, \u00a7 26; that the registrar had been requested to permit the petitioner to inspect the other driver\u2019s report, and that one Capasso, chief accountant in charge of the registrar\u2019s files, had refused to allow such inspection. Attached to the petition is a copy of the registrar\u2019s prescribed form for such a report. The petitioner appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-13\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 26 (as amended through St. 1956, c. 225), reads, \u201cEvery person operating a motor vehicle which is in any manner involved in an accident in which any person is killed or injured therein, or in which there is dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>age in excess of two hundred dollars to any one vehicle or other property, shall forthwith report in writing to the registrar on a form approved by him. The registrar may revoke or suspend the license of any person violating this section.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The question for decision is whether a report filed under \u00a7 26 is a public record under G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and therefore open to inspection by reason of Gr. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 (as amended through St. 1948, c. 550, \u00a75).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">In 1922, the then Attorney General expressed the opinion (6 Op. Atty. Gen. p. 548) that a report under \u00a7 26, as it then read, was not open to public inspection under c. 66, \u00a7 10. He relied upon <em>Round </em>v. <em>Police Commr. for the City of Boston, </em>197 Mass. 218, 220-221, which held that weekly reports of pawnbrokers to the licensing board were not public records, under a statute which this court regarded as requiring (p. 220) the reports \u201cfor the . . . use of the licensing board, and not to be placed on file for the information of the public.\u201d In <em>Gerry </em>v. <em>Worcester Consol. St. Ry. </em>248 Mass. 559, 567, a similar result was reached with respect to reports of accidents to the Industrial Accident Board, made under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 19 (prior to its amendment by St. 1935, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>c. 339, and later amendments). Section 19 contained a provision that copies of such reports \u201cand statistics and data compiled therefrom shall be kept available by . . . [the division of industrial accidents] and shall be furnished on request to the department of labor and industries for its own use.\u201d The court pointed out (p. 567) the absence of any \u201cprovision . . . giving the right to the public to inspect the reports,\u201d and held that the reports were required \u201cfor the purpose of aiding . . . [the Industrial Accident B]oard in its administrative duties\u201d and were not public records.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Doubtless, reports under c. 90, \u00a7 26, are useful in the administration of the registry and assist in the compilation of statistics (see <em>Brest </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>270 Mass. 7, 17), but we see nothing in \u00a7 26 limiting the use of the reports to these purposes. Reports under \u00a7 26 conceivably also would have usefulness to the general public (see <em>Stowe </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>289 Mass. 577, 582; <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>DiPaolo, </em>313 Mass. 492, 493-494) as well-as to the registrar\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Section 26 requires a \u201creport in writing to the registrar on a form approved by him.\u201d This in effect is a requirement that the reports be received by the registrar, presumably to be retained at least as statistical information. Although the Legislature has not said affirmatively that these reports must be kept in the files, it must have been intended that they be preserved by the registrar at least long enough to enable the reporting driver to establish, at all relevant times, that he has complied with \u00a7 26, so that his operator\u2019s license will not be revoked for noncompliance with the section. Although \u00a7 26 might well have been more explicit in this respect, we construe \u00a7 26 as requiring the registrar to receive the reports for filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">In <em>Direct-Mail Serv. Inc. </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>296 Mass. 353, 355-357, this court considered the right of the public to inspect the registrar\u2019s records of motor vehicle registrations. Reference was there made to Gr. L. c. 90, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 30,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as prescribing the keeping of these registration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>records. In <em>Finnegan </em>v. <em>Checker Taxi Co. </em>300 Mass. 62, 70-71, this court held that registry \u201cpapers containing the operating record\u201d of the operator of a vehicle involved in an accident were not admissible in evidence \u201con the matter of the operator\u2019s unfitness.\u201d In discussing the records of the suspension and reissue of that operator\u2019s license, the court said (p. 70), \u201cThe statute requires that the registrar shall keep certain specified records.\u201d It then referred to c. 90, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 30, and 341. A similar statement was made in <em>Canney </em>v. <em>Carrier, </em>333 Mass. 382, 383, with reference to a letter to the registrar from a plaintiff in a tort action concerning the ownership of a motor vehicle, \u201creceived back\u201d with certain interlined notations. The opinion said, \u201cThe letter with the interlineations obviously was not among the records which the registrar is required by statute to keep,\u201d referring to \u00a7\u00a7 2, 30, and 341,</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">We think that these decisions are not conclusive of this case where reports under \u00a7 26 are viewed as public records, not because any entry upon them is required to be made by law (see c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, fn. 2) but because they are reports which the registrar \u201cis required to receive for filing. \u2019 \u2019 There is, of course, no specific provision in \u00a7 26 that these reports shall be open to inspection. Compare the provision found in \u00a7 27 (see fn. 1). The omission of such a provision from \u00a7 26, and also the omission from \u00a7 30 (see fn. 4) of such a provision made clearly applicable to reports under \u00a7 26, do not seem to us of controlling significance in the absence of indication that the inclusion of the explicit language in \u00a7 27, and the omission of such language from \u00a7 26 and from \u00a7 30 with reference to reports under \u00a7 26, was more than an inadvertence.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>It is argued that to treat these reports as public records may result in inconvenience and expense in the registrar\u2019s office. If this proves to be the case, the Legislature has power to grant relief, as, for example, by providing for destruction of the reports after a stated period of time, or by limiting their availability for inspection. Indeed, it would appear that the Legislature has already done so to some extent in connection with the documents referred to in \u00a7 30 (see fn. 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The conclusion which we reach is supported by considerations of public policy and by the circumstance that the report required by \u00a7 26 would have limited usefulness if not open to public inspection. Such a report frequently might be important to the persons concerned in an accident in investigations and preparation for litigation. There are substantial reasons for making these reports available to all such persons and to public authorities on a nondiscriminatory basis, If the Legislature had intended a contrary result, we would expect to find in \u00a7 26 an explicit provision to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">In the opinion of a majority of the court, a case under Gr. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10, as amended, for relief by mandamus was stated in the petition. The order sustaining the demurrer must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b653-6\"> See also Gh L. c. 90, \u00a7 27 (as amended through St. 1953, e. 570, \u00a7 3), which reads in part, <em>\u201cA </em>full record shall be kept by every court of every ease in which a person is charged with a violation of any statute . . . relating to the operation ... of motor vehicles . . . and an abstract of such record shall be sent forthwith by the court to the registrar.
