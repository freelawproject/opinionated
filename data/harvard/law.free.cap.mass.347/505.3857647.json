On November 29, 1957, they commenced a strike after the union and the Telegram had failed to make a new collective bargaining agreement. The Telegram continued publication, replaced the strikers, and by February 15, 1958, was again in normal production. Its general manager testified that there was no prospect that the strikers would be rehired, although it appeared that they were available for work.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">During the period, February 14, 1958, to April 3, 1958, various strikers filed claims for unemployment benefits. The director allowed benefits beginning with the week of February 16, 1958. The Telegram sought review. See G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7\u00a7 39, 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">On August 28, 1958, the board of review affirmed the director\u2019s decision. It rejected any contention that the striking employees left their employment without cause attributable to the employing unit \u201cbecause the employees, among the demands presented to management, demanded objectives that were illegal under both Massachusetts and Federal laws,\u201d and held that c. 151A did not give to the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>\u201cjurisdiction to go into the merits of labor disputes for the purpose of placing the blame ... in order to determine whether . . . the employees are entitled to benefits.\u201d The board also took the view that the striking employees did not become \u201cemployees of the union\u201d (and thus cease to be \u201cin unemployment\u201d) merely because they received strike benefits from the treasurer of the international union from a special fund to which the employees had contributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">The Telegram sought review (see c. 151A, \u00a7 42, as amended through St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a7 12) of the board\u2019s decision in the District Court. The judge remanded the case to the board of review (see Gr. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 [8]) to \u201cdetermine whether . . . the strike involved an unlawful labor dispute.\u201d The board of review, after a further hearing, reaffirmed its original determination. The judge thereupon examined \u201cthe evidence, and guided by . . . <em>International Typographical Union </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Bd. </em>365 U. S. 705<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>. . . [ruled] that the strike was ... \u2018an unlawful labor dispute.\u2019 \u201d Purporting to act on the authority of <em>Howard Bros. Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>333 Mass. 244, the judge reversed the board\u2019s decision. The claimants and the director appealed. The judge has filed a very full report to this court. Two principal issues are presented: (1) Is the board required by Gr. L. c. 151A and the precedent of the <em>Howard Bros. Mfg. Co. </em>case to determine whether the claimants\u2019 strike was a violation of the National Labor Relations Act? (2) Did the receipt of strike benefits disqualify the claimants for employment security benefits?</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">1. The first issue depends largely upon the provisions of Gr. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25, pertinent provisions of which appear in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 25 prohibited the payment of unemployment benefits to a claimant in any week in which the claimant\u2019s unemployment was found to be \u201cdue to a stoppage of work which exists because of a labor dispute at the . . . establishment\u201d where the claimant was last employed (subject to exceptions not here relevant). The claimants, accordingly, do not argue that they were entitled to unemployment benefits while they were on strike prior to the termination of the \u201cstoppage of work.\u201d See <em>Adomaitis </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>334 Mass. 520, 522-525. Instead the claimants suggest that they did not terminate their employment by striking and that (see <em>Mengel </em>v. <em>Justices of the Superior Court, </em>313 Mass. 238, 242) they remained employees until they were replaced and \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>substantially normal production\u201d was resumed about February 15, 1958. Then, they say, the \u201cstoppage of work\u201d came to an end, and they became entitled to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The Telegram, on the other hand, takes the position that the claimants left their work \u201cwithout good cause attributable to the [Telegram as] employing unit\u201d and that they are prevented by Gr. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25 (e) (1), see fn. 2, <em>supra, </em>from receiving the benefits sought. The Telegram relies principally on the <em>Howard Bros. Mfg. Co. </em>case. There employees had gone on strike in violation of the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement which provided (p. 246) that \u201cthere shall be no suspension of work on account of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>such difference,\u201d if differences should arise between the employer and the union, and that, in the absence of settlement procedures, the dispute should be referred to the United States Conciliation Service, \u201cwhose decision shall be final and binding on both parties. \u2019 \u2019 Because the Howard company found it necessary to curtail production, conferences were held. The employees preferred that the management put into operation whichever of three curtailment plans it chose. When management made a choice, all the employees met on a Saturday and agreed not to report for work on the following Monday under the proposed curtailment plan. On the following Thursday, the company notified the employees who failed to report for work that they were removed from the payroll. After reciting the provisions of \u00a7 25 (e), this court said (pp. 247-248), \u201cAll of the claimants voluntarily left their work by striking in violation of their contract. They could have continued to work on the reduced schedule. If this was unsatisfactory . . . they could have sought arbitration .... Or they might have become entitled to benefits for partial unemployment under \u00a7 29 (b) . . .. Since the' claimants left their work while substantial work . . . remained . . . and in violation of their contract, they left \u2018without good cause attributable to the employing unit . . ..\u2019 No wrongful conduct on the part of the employing unit is shown.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Because it has now been established (after review, see fn. 1, by the Supreme Court of the United States) that the strike against the Telegram was unlawful, the Telegram argues that the present case falls within the principle of the <em>Howard Bros. Mfg. Co. </em>case, which was decided before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>enactment of St. 1958, c. 677 (see fn. 2, <em>supra). </em>The director and the claimants reply in effect (1) that the <em>Howard Bros. Mfg. Co. </em>case is distinguishable because that case involved a breach of a contract not to strike, whereas in the present case there was no contract at all, and (2) that c. 151A does not require the board to determine as a condition precedent to paying benefits to permanently displaced strikers that the strike was not unlawful as in violation of the National Labor Relations Act. Such an interpretation of the statute, it is said, would involve the board, in the case of an employer subject to the National Labor Relations Act, in adjudicating the same issues which Congress has committed to the National Labor Relations Board. Consequently, regardless of whether the preemption doctrine (see <em>Garner </em>v. <em>Teamsters, Chauffeurs &amp; Helpers Local Union No. 776 [A.F.L.], </em>346 U. S. 485, 490-491) is strictly applicable, much the same risk of confusing and conflicting Federal and State adjudications would exist which the preemption doctrine was intended to avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Certainly, the present case does not involve any violation of a \u201cno strike\u201d contract clause, as a matter of State law, as did the <em>Howard Bros. Mfg. Co. </em>case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We have here a case where the alleged unlawfulness of the strike rests, not upon breach of contract, but upon the circumstance that an evenly divided Supreme Court of the United States, without discussion, has upheld a decision of the Court of Appeals that a \u201cstrike to obtain the \u2018foreman clause\u2019 \u201d was not permissible. The Court of Appeals (278 F. 2d 6, 11-12) upheld the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s view that \u201cby in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>sisting upon this clause the [u]nions refused to bargain in good faith and that by striking in support of their insistence upon the clause the [u]nions had undertaken to restrain or coerce the employers in the selection of their representatives ... in violation of \u00a7 8 (b) (1) (B) of the [National Labor Relations] Act.\u201d The court concluded (p. 12) that there were also violations of \u00a7 8 (b) (2) and of \u00a7 8 (b) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">The Telegram argues that there must be imported into c. 151 A, \u00a725 (e) (1), the language of Gr. L. c. 149, \u00a7 200 (e), as amended through St. 1950, c. 452, \u00a7 2, defining the term \u201cunlawful labor dispute\u201d as including any controversy arising out of a demand that an employer commit an \u201cunfair labor practice ... in violation of . . . the National Labor Relations Act.\u201d Although the definition of \u201clabor dispute\u201d in Gr. L. c. 149, \u00a7 200 (c), as amended through St. 1950, c. 452, \u00a7 2, comports generally with the ordinary understanding of that term, we are not persuaded that there is incorporated in c. 151A, \u00a7 25 (e) (1), by reference the more technical definition of the term \u201cunlawful labor dispute\u201d found in c. 149, \u00a7 20C (e). Not only is this latter term found in another chapter of the General Laws, enacted for another purpose, but also serious practical difficulties would be encountered in using that technical definition under c. 151A, \u00a725 (e) (1), in determining whether an employee had \u201cleft his work . . . without good cause attributable to the employing unit.\u201d It in effect would require the board of review in each case where a striker had been permanently displaced to decide whether the strike grew out of an unfair labor practice (or other violation) under the National Labor Relations Act by the former employee or his union. Not only might an extended period he consumed in resolving that question (see fn. 1, supra) but also, if the board of review reached a result different from that reached by the National Labor Relations Board and the Federal courts, confusion would be likely.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">We find in c. 151A no sufficient indication that there has been imposed upon the review board any such difficult judgment in a field which remains the subject of Federal statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>tory change and decisional development. Chapter 151A was designed (see \u00a7 74, as amended through St. 1949, c. 290) \u201cto lighten the burden which now falls on the unemployed worker and his family. \u2019 \u2019 Delays incident to such a determination might defeat this purpose. An intention to impose such delays upon claimants and to place upon the review board the burden of such difficult judgments is not to be inferred in the absence of much more explicit language than we find in c. 151A, \u00a7 25 (e) (1). We hold that the principle of the <em>Howard Bros. Mfg. Co. </em>decision does not apply to a case where the asserted impropriety of the strike rests only upon the determination whether an unfair labor practice, or other violation of the National Labor Eelations Act, gave rise to the strike.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus the result<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> reached by the board of review is correct. Under the <em>Howard Bros. Mfg. Co. </em>case, however, \u00a7 25 (e) (1) would have presented a question for the board\u2019s decision, if the strike had involved a contract violation of the type there considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">2. The Telegram also contends that the claimants are disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits because of their receipt of strike benefits from their international union. The president of the local union testified that his occupation was \u2018\u2018 striker, \u2019 \u2019 that each claimant received payment from the treasurer of the international union equal to sixty per cent of his prevailing wage in the case of a mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>ried striker and to forty per cent of that wage in the case of an unmarried claimant. In return for the payment, claimants, other than \u201c [tjhose who are sick or on actual reserve duty\u201d or similarly unavailable, \u201cmust be [union] members in good standing . . . and . . . willing to do their share of the strike duty.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">To be eligible for unemployment benefits under c. 151A, \u00a7\u00a7 24, 29, as amended, a claimant must be unemployed or \u201cin . . . unemployment.\u201d A person is in \u201ctotal unemployment in any week in which he performs no wage-earning services whatever, and for which he receives no remuneration, and in which, though capable of and available for work, he is unable to obtain any suitable work. ...\u201d See \u00a7 1 (r) (2), as amended through St. 1949, c. 476. \u201cRemuneration\u201d is defined, see \u00a7 1 (r) (3), as amended by St. 1957, c. 632, as \u201cany consideration, whether paid directly or indirectly, . . . received by an individual (1) from his employing unit for services rendered to such employing unit, (2) as net earnings from self-employment . . .. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The review board, in its first decision, concluded that the \u201cevidence does not support a finding that the claimants failed to meet the requirements of\u201d c. 151A, \u00a7 29 (a), and \u00a7 1 (r) (2) and (3). The trial judge did not pass upon this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Substantial evidence supported the review board\u2019s conclusion. A strike benefit fund is in a sense an insurance arrangement. As in the case of some other types of insurance (cf. <em>Imperiali </em>v. <em>Pica, </em>338 Mass. 494, 497), the union member is required to cooperate with the union in carrying out its strike objectives, in aid of which strike benefits are paid. This seems more a condition of receiving the benefits than an employment. The strike benefits are not remunera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>tian paid for services rendered in the sense in which the word \u201cremuneration\u201d is ordinarily used. We adopt the view, taken by those courts which have considered the question, that strike benefits are not remuneration and that the claimants are not barred from receiving unemployment benefits by their receipt of strike benefits. See <em>Capra </em>v. <em>Carpenter Paper Co. </em>258 Minn. 456, 465 (\u201cNor can it be said that the [strike benefit] payments they received were \u2018wages\u2019 as that term is used in the act. They were paid from funds to which they had <em>contributed.\u201d); Radice </em>v. <em>Department of Labor &amp; Indus. </em>4 N. J. Super. 364, 367-368. See also <em>Inter-Island Resorts, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Akahane, </em>46 Hawaii, 140,153-155. <em>Milne Chair Co. </em>v. <em>Hake, </em>190 Tenn. 395, 404-405.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">3.

S. 941. Prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, the National Labor Relations Board (123 N.L.R.B. 806) and the United States Court of Appeals (278 F. 2d 6, 11-12, 1st Cir.) had determined the strike to be illegal. The Supreme Court (p. 707) affirmed the First Circuit decision, by an evenly divided court, on the question whether the claimants could lawfully strike to require inclusion in a collective bargaining agreement of a requirement that foremen be union members and hire other employees. The decision of the Supreme Court was announced on April 17, 1961. That of the Court of Appeals was made on May 10, 1960. The first hearing before the board of review- was on May 21, 1958; the second on May 13, 1960.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b552-6\"> Section 25 (as amended through St. 1956, c. 719, \u00a7 4) reads in part: \u201cNo waiting period shall be allowed and no benefits shall be paid to an individual under this chapter for \u2014... (b) Any week with respect to which the director finds that his unemployment is due to a <em>stoppage of work which exists because of a labor dispute </em>at the . . . establishment ... at which he was last employed . . .
