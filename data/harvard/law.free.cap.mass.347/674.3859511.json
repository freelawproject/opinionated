L, c. 249, \u00a7 5. On July 30,1963, a judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>of the Superior Court ordered the writ to issue and the petitioner was reinstated. On September 18, 1963, the judge ordered further that McKenna be reinstated as of December 11,1962, and be paid his salary by \u201cthe respondent\u201d at the rate of $15.65 a day from the date of discharge to that of his return to work, for a total of $2,566.60. From this latter order the respondents appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The petitioner, a veteran, who had been a special attendant at Cushing Hospital for more than three years, was discharged by letter as of December 11,1962, for dereliction of duty. Because he was not given a copy of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 43, 45, and 46A, or a hearing before the appointing authority, the judge ruled the discharge to have been in violation of G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 9A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The petitioner was reinstated as of July 27, 1963. In proper circumstances a petitioner can recover back salary incident to a writ of mandamus ordering reinstatement to employment. <em>Chartrand </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, ante, </em>470, 476-477. At the trial, however, McKenna admitted on cross-examination that he had made no effort to procure any employment following his discharge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For that reason, the respondents contend, he cannot recover for loss of salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">\u201cWhere one is under contract for personal service, and is discharged, it becomes his duty to dispose of his time in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>a reasonable way, so as to obtain as large compensation as possible, and to use honest, earnest and intelligent efforts to this end. He cannot voluntarily remain idle and expect to recover the compensation stipulated in the contract from the other party.\u201d <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Royal Worcester Corset Co. </em>200 Mass. 1, 6. <em>Hussey </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>217 Mass. 100, 105. See <em>Osadchuk </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>251 Mass. 540, <em>545; Levine </em>v. <em>Lawrence &amp; Co. Inc. </em>305 Mass. 210, 211-212; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>General Cleaning Co. Inc. </em>345 Mass. 62, 65; Restatement: Contracts, \u00a7 336; Williston, Contracts (Rev. ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 1358-1360.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">A succinct statement applicable to the status of the employee who has been discharged has been made in Corbin, Contracts, \u00a7 1039: \u201cIt is not infrequently said that it is the \u2018duty\u2019 of the injured party to mitigate his damages so far as that can be done by reasonable effort on his part. Since there is no judicial penalty, however, for his failure to make this effort, it is not desirable to say that he is under a \u2018duty.-\u2019' His recovery against the defendant will be exactly the same whether he makes the effort and mitigates his loss, or not; but if he fails to make the reasonable effort, with the result that his injury is greater than it would otherwise have been, he cannot recover judgment for the amount of this avoidable and unnecessary increase. The law does not penalize his inaction; it merely does nothing to compensate him for the loss that he helped to cause by not avoiding it.\u201d See the concurring opinion of Chief Judge Cardozo in <em>McClelland </em>v. <em>Climax Hosiery Mills, </em>252 N. Y. 347, 354, 358-359.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The rule requiring reasonable efforts to secure other similar work has been applied to a veteran employed by the city of Boston as a laborer. <em>Ransom </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>192 Mass. 299, 307, <em>8. C. </em>196 Mass. 248, 252-253. A statute and civil service rules analogous to the present G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 9A, gave preferential treatment to Ransom as a veteran.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">- Whatever right the petitioner has to lost salary arises Under the 1949 amendment (St. 1949, c. 176) which made G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 5, read in material part: \u201cIf the petitioner prevails, his damages, including any salary or wages to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>which the petitioner may be entitled, shall be assessed . . ..\u201d See <em>Chartrand </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, ante, </em>470, 476-477. We see nothing in these words to indicate an intended change in the rule of mitigation applied to a public employee in the <em>Ransom </em>v. <em>Boston </em>cases. See <em>Edgar H. Wood Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Skene, ante, </em>351, 363. And since the petitioner is not the holder of a public office (see <em>Ransom </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>192 Mass. 299, 306-307; <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Tillinghast, </em>203 Mass. 539, 543-545; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oliver, </em>342 Mass. 82, 84), he may not have the benefit of a doctrine applied in a number of other jurisdictions which allows persons wrongfully deprived of public offices to recover their full salaries without deduction of earnings during the period of wrongful deprivation. <em>Bullis </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>235 Ill. 472, 480. <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Portland, </em>79 Maine, 484, 492. <em>Fitzsimmons </em>v. <em>Brooklyn, </em>102 N. Y. 536, 537-539. See 150 A. L. R. 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Our cases have indicated, however, that the employer has the burden of proof on the issue of mitigation of damages. <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Royal Worcester Corset Co. </em>200 Mass. 1, 6-8. <em>Osadchuk </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>251 Mass. 540, 544-545. <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Lawrence &amp; Co. Inc. </em>305 Mass. 210, 211-212. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>General Cleaning Co. Inc. </em>345 Mass. 62, 65. The overwhelming weight of authority elsewhere places that burden upon the employer. 134 A. L. R. 242. Williston, Contracts (Bey. ed.) \u00a7 1360. Corbin, Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 1039, 1041. We adopt that rule. McKenna is entitled to recover his back salary less what he did in fact earn following his discharge or in the exercise of proper diligence might have earned in another employment. While the respondents showed that McKenna made no effort to secure other employment, they failed to show what he could have earned in other similar work. He, therefore, is entitled to recover from the Commonwealth the sum of $2,566.60. As so modified the order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b719-8\"> \u201cA veteran, as defined in . . . [G.
