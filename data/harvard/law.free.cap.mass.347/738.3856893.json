L. c. 231A that the town has an exclusive right to use the waters and watershed of the Segreganset River for its public water supply system and that an alleged taking of the waters of the Segreganset be declared null and void. In another suit the plaintiff asked that the defendant be restrained from \u201cany further action in execution\u201d of the alleged taking.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The cases were referred to a master. The defendant appeals from interlocutory decrees which denied the defendant\u2019s motion to recommit, overruled exceptions to the master\u2019s report, and confirmed the report, and from a final decree substantially granting the declaratory relief requested by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">We summarize the master\u2019s report. The Segreganset River flows through Dighton, where it empties into the Taunton River. Since 1927 the plaintiff, located south of Dighton on the westerly bank of the Taunton, has utilized the Segreganset watershed for its public water supply. In 1926 and 1927 the plaintiff acquired by purchase and by eminent domain 200 acres of land along the banks of the Segreganset in Dighton. In 1927 the plaintiff <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>constructed a water system piping water from a well field in Dighton located in the watershed of the Segreganset.\u201d This system soon proved inadequate. In 1945 \u201c [the plaintiff\u2019s] demand for water had equalled its maximum supply.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since 1951 the plaintiff has been compelled to supplement its water sources by purchasing water from nearby communities. Except on a few occasions when the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>caused the Dighton well field to be flooded in times of drought, the plaintiff \u201chas never used the surface waters as such of the Segreganset or any of its tributaries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The plaintiff \u201chas acute need for additional water supplies.\u201d In 1961, at a special meeting, it voted to initiate several steps toward enlarging its water supply by diverting the waters of the Segreganset to an off-stream reservoir. These steps include the undertaldng of an engineering survey, the selection and surveying of land for a reservoir site, the appropriation of money for purposes of acquiring land and constructing an enlarged system, and the authorization of the plaintiff\u2019s treasurer to is'sue bonds in order to raise additional money for these purposes. However, \u201c [n]o formal order of taking of the reservoir land has been made or recorded nor has any purchase thereof been made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Also in 1961 the plaintiff authorized its selectmen and water commissioners to purchase land belonging to the Montaup Electric Company (Montaup). Pursuant to this authorization, the plaintiff entered into an agreement with Montaup \u201cto purchase some sixty acres of land in Dighton at the lowest riparian locus to the Segreganset River.\u201d Under the agreement Montaup retained several interests in the property to be conveyed; the deed was executed on September 23, 1962, \u201cin conformance with the earlier agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">The defendant was established in 1950 by an act of the General Court, St. 1950, c. 359. In February, 1961, pursuant to a vote at its annual meeting, the defendant hired an engineering company \u201cto explore for additional ground water supplies in . . . Dighton.\u201d A well site was found which was \u201ccapable of yielding safely a little over 200,000 gallons per day\u201d; the defendant had \u201choped to find a well site yielding almost twice that amount.\u201d In the fall of 1961, aware of the plaintiff\u2019s intention to build the reservoir, the defendant hired another engineering company which prepared a plan utilizing \u201cthe surface waters of the Segreganset for Dighton\u2019s water supply.\u201d Schematic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>drawings of the plan were given qualified approval by the Massachusetts Department of Health on August 29, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">On August 30, 1962, the defendant\u2019s commissioners held what they declared to be an \u201cemergency meeting,\u201d though \u201cno actual emergency existed; . . . one purpose for the promptness . . . was to adopt and record an order taking the waters of the Segreganset, before . . . [the plaintiff] could obtain and record a deed from Montaup . . . and before a restraining order freezing the status quo could be obtained.\u201d At the meeting the defendant\u2019s commissioners signed an \u201corder of taking,\u201d pursuant to which the defendant purported to appropriate \u201call of the waters of the Seg-reganset River and its tributaries within the [t]own of Dighton not already . . . being appropriated and used for the purposes of a public water supply.\u201d On August 31, 1962, the \u201corder of taking\u201d was recorded in Bristol County Northern District registry of deeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">The defendant states in its brief: \u201cIt is freely conceded that the [t]own of Somerset has been using considerable amounts of water derived from the watershed of the Segre-ganset River, by drilling wells and pumping the water out of the ground.\u201d Unquestionably any use of the Segregan-set by the town for a water system is a public use. <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Forbes, </em>161 Mass. 302, 308. <em>Rockport </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>174 Mass. 385, 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">By St. 1950, c. 359, \u00a7 2, the defendant was authorized to \u201ctake by eminent domain ... or acquire by lease, purchase or otherwise, and hold, the waters, or any portion thereof, of any . . . stream . . . within the town of Digh-ton <em>not already appropriated and used for the purposes of a public water supply\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). The issue before us is whether pursuant to this legislation the defendant was authorized on August 30, 1962, to take the waters of the Segreganset River.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">We reject the defendant\u2019s contention to the effect that it has a right under St. 1950, c. 359, \u00a7 2, to appropriate the waters of the Segreganset \u201cunless it has been <em>in specie </em>appropriated <em>and </em>physically used for the purpose of a public water supply\u201d (emphasis partially supplied). It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>doubtful that the word <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>appropriated, \u2019 \u2019 as used in the statute, refers only to property to which title has formally been taken. It may well refer to property which another party has been given legislative authority to acquire and hold. See <em>McCombs </em>v. <em>Dallas County, </em>136 S. W. 2d 975, 981 (Tex. Civ. App.); <em>McSorley </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>2 Wash. 638, 649-650. It may also refer to property which is used by a body politic even though not formally taken. See <em>El Paso County Water Improvement Dist. No. 1 </em>v. <em>El Paso, </em>133 F. Supp. 894, 910 (W. D. Texas); <em>Modesto Properties Co. </em>v. <em>State Water Rights Bd. </em>179 Cal. App. 2d 856, 860; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Potosi, </em>317 S. W. 2d 623, 629 (Mo. App.). If the word \u201cappropriated,\u201d as used in St. 1950, c. 359, \u00a7 2, means \u201cpermitted by legislative authority to be taken in eminent domain or otherwise acquired,\u201d it is clear that the waters of the Segreganset have been appropriated to the use of the plaintiff since 1926 and thus could not be taken by the defendant. See St. 1926, c. 339, \u00a7 2, authorizing the plaintiff to \u201ctake by eminent domain ... or acquire by purchase or otherwise, and hold . . . the waters of [the] Segreganset river.\u201d If \u201cappropriated\u201d in St. 1950, c. 359, \u00a7 2, means no more than \u201cused,\u201d we are of opinion that the master\u2019s finding of use by the plaintiff, <em>supra, </em>is sufficient to nullify any right which the defendant may otherwise have had to take the waters of the Segreganset.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">It is well established in this Commonwealth that where property is devoted to a public use, it \u201ccannot be diverted to another inconsistent public use without plain legislation to that end.\u201d <em>Byfield </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>247 Mass. 46, 57. <em>Higginson </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Sch. House Commrs. of Boston, </em>212 Mass. 583, 591. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Turnpike Authy. </em>346 Mass. 250, 254. This is a salutary rule which fairly protects the interests of public bodies which may have expended resources for the improvement of property in reliance on a continued right to use that property. It promotes fiscal and social stability. We interpret St. 1950, c. 359, \u00a7 2, in the light of this rule. So interpreted, the language of the statute should be read to mean \u2018 \u2018 appropriated <em>or </em>used for the purposes of a public water supply.\u201d There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>is ample precedent for construing the word \u201cand\u201d disjunctively in order to further a recognized legislative purpose. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>105 Mass. 185, 186-187. <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>County of Hampden, </em>204 Mass. 494, 505. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fisk, </em>3 Wall. 445, 447. <em>Collins Granite Co. </em>v. <em>Devereux, </em>72 Maine, 422, 425. <em>People ex rel. Municipal Gas Co. of Albany </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>138 N. Y. 151, 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">On the basis of the foregoing interpretation of St. 1950, c. 359, \u00a7 2, it is clear that regardless of the meaning assigned to the word \u201cappropriated,\u201d if the plaintiff has \u201cused\u201d the waters of the Segreganset River for its public water supply, the defendant\u2019s purported talcing on August 30, 1962, is null and void. The defendant argues at length that the plaintiff\u2019s use of the watershed and occasional use of the surface waters do not permit the conclusion that the waters of the Segreganset were \u201cused for ... a public water supply\u201d within the meaning of St. 1950, c. 359, \u00a7 2. In its brief the defendant cites no cases or authorities in support of this argument. We are unable to accept the defendant\u2019s reasoning. \u201cA brook or river, so far as concerns surface indications, is inseparably connected with its watershed and owes the volume of current to its area.\u201d <em>Stratton </em>v. <em>Mount Hermon Boys\u2019 Sch. </em>216 Mass. 83, 86. The final decree correctly stated \u201c [t]hat [the plaintiff] in the development and operation of its public water supply system has used the waters of the Segreganset River and its watershed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">In their briefs the parties present arguments pertaining to several other matters, including the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s rights as the lowest riparian holder, but our interpretation of St. 1950, c. 359, \u00a7 2, obviates the need to discuss these issues. We perceive no point in enumerating the exceptions to the master\u2019s report. Those which merit discussion have been dealt with in this opinion. In the suit to restrain the defendant from further action in execution of the taking, the defendant\u2019s appeal is dismissed. In the suit for declaratory relief the interlocutory and final decrees are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-8\"> The defendant appealed from a final decree dismissing the bill in that suit, but none of the arguments made by either party is pertinent thereto. The dismissal was with the plaintiff\u2019s consent. The defendant lacks standing to appeal from this decree. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>209 Mass. 388, 394. Unless otherwise noted, all further references in this opinion will be to the suit for declaratory relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b783-9\">In 1945, approximately 87% of the plaintiff\u2019s water was derived, from the well field in Dighton.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
