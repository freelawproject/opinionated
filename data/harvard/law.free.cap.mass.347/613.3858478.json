A master\u2019s report was confirmed by an interlocutory decree from which GE appealed. Both AT and GE appealed from a final decree which awarded to AT $128,734 plus interest and costs, but denied injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">At some time after 1957, the Air Force undertook the 477L project to establish installations in North America for detecting and determining the direction and yield of nuclear detonations. This was to be done by methods including the use of electromagnetic (EM) sensors.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">In 1960, Dresser Industries (Dresser) discussed the program with the Air Force, and in February, 1961, Dresser and GE agreed in writing to submit a \u201cteam proposal\u201d to the Air Force. GE was to have \u201cprime responsibility of the overall contract. \u2019 \u2019 Dresser was to have * <em>\u2018 </em>responsibility for the sensory system area and participation in the overall system engineering ... as a subcontractor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">GE established within its Defense Systems Department, a group, charged with presenting the proposal, under one Hynes, an engineer, as program manager, and one Carp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Hynes had engineering and financial control and \u201cwas responsible for success of all [its] aspects . . . and . . . for seeing . . . that the purchasing department was doing its job on the program. He had no actual authority to enter into contracts \u2019 \u2019 for supplies or services. This was \u2018<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a function of the purchasing department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">AT and its predecessor corporations had considerable experience in the detection of EM radiation. Dr. Hillger and Dr. Clapp of its staff were experts in electronics research and design. On April 21, 1961, AT discussed the 477L project with the Air Force and learned of eight companies which had done some preliminary work. AT wrote to all but one of these expressing willingness to contribute toward any proposal which the addressee might submit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">On May 23, 1961 (following a telephone call from Hynes to one Cunningham, contract representative of AT), Dr. Hillger and Dr. Clapp met in Syracuse with Carp and scientific representatives of GrE.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dr. Hillger outlined the system which AT proposed for the EM sensor portion of the 477L project. GrE\u2019s representatives indicated interest. It then was agreed that Dr. Clapp would do more research to demonstrate the accuracy of the AT approach. Carp stated that if AT could satisfy the Air Force accuracy requirements, GrE would be interested in having AT join in submitting a proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">A further meeting was held on June 7,1961. At Hynes\u2019s suggestion Cunningham was present. Carp furnished to Dr. Clapp \u201ca detailed outline of the GrE proposal\u201d and \u201casked him to cover a portion of the section entitled elec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>tromagnetic sensory subsystem. \u2019 \u2019 Carp also described how best to present the data to the Air Force. Hynes and Cunningham separately discussed \u201chow AT was going to fit into the program on the sensor end. This was all subject to what the Air Force might want.\u201d Hynes stated that Dresser \u201cwas part of the team, and . . . that if Dr. Clapp and Carp had a satisfactory meeting, AT would be a team member, subject to Air Force approval.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Later that day Hynes and Cunningham talked with the scientists. At some stage Carp said they were \u201call set.\u201d Cunningham asked how \u201cthe two companies could get together ... \u2018on a team membership basis.\u2019 . . . Hynes then wrote out a proposed course of action, and . . . Cunningham copied it verbatim. This provided that AT was to submit a proposal to GrE . . . justifying the scientific basis for use of the ... [EM] sensor; to assist in the preparation [and presentation] of the . . . proposal . . . and, in response to . . . [a] request for quotation [RFQ] . . . from GrE for the design, development, and fabrication of a prototype system, to prepare a technical proposal for overall EM sensory equipment and support requirements . . . and cost quotations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">On June 26, Carp visited Dr. Clapp. Dr. Hillger and other AT employees were present. They reviewed the work Dr. Clapp had done since the June 7 meeting. Carp said \u201cthat it looked as if AT would get the results GrE was looking for\u201d but that Air Force accuracy requirements still had not been met. Methods of achieving greater accuracy were discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">During June and July, Dr. Clapp did further research.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Carp was also collecting data. During this period AT representatives continued (see fn. 1) to confer with, and to submit proposals to, other companies.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>By August 11, 1961, GE had AT\u2019s technical proposal. Hynes had asked Cunningham for information about AT personnel, especially those associated with a contract between AT and Defense Atomic Support Agency (DASA) awarded on July 15. On August 9, AT sent a letter of interest to GE setting forth the qualifications of AT and its personnel and stating that AT \u201cwill serve as a member of the . . . [GE] team in the preparation of the planned proposal . . . and in the accomplishment of the work required.\u201d GE then submitted to the Air Force its letter of interest, which contained references to GE\u2019s \u201cindustry team, including Dresser.\u201d The letter pointed out that GE\u2019s capability had been \u201caugmented by . . . such team members as . . . Dresser . . . (specializing in seismic sensors) \u201d and AT (specializing in EM sensors).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The Air Force then sent to thirty-six companies, including GE, a request for a proposal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> GE promptly sent RFQs to its potential vendors. Hynes mentioned AT and Dresser to GE\u2019s purchasing department as competent in the sensor field. A printed form of cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) subcontract was sent to AT with the BFQ.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">On September 26, Hynes showed Cunningham GE\u2019s letter of interest, and \u201cCunningham called attention to the apparent inconsistency between the listing of AT as a second tier subcontractor [fn. 5] . . . and the description of AT as a team member elsewhere in the document. Hynes said, \u2018Forget it. That is a mistake,\u2019 and told Cunningham that AT was shown as a team member ... on the cover of the proposal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>On October 5, GE submitted a proposal to the Air Force bearing on its covers the names of GE, AT, Dresser, and two other companies. The biographies of AT\u2019s personnel were identical with those attached to GE\u2019s letter of interest. The EM sensor was shown as an item which GE proposed to buy rather than to manufacture and the only potential source given was AT.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Dr. Clapp and Dr. Hillger participated in an oral presentation of the GE proposal to the Air Force on October 18. One Air Force written question concerning the EM sensor was answered by Dr. Clapp for GE. During the presentation references were made to the DASA contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Early in November, GE was selected as prime contractor by the Air Force, provided a suitable contract could be negotiated. This selection was not on the basis of GE\u2019s proposal (which was not completely acceptable technically) but rather on a statement of its expected performance. After two months of negotiations a contract became effective February 5, 1962. The specifications were not formally approved until June, 1962, and these \u201cdiffered drastically in . . . technical respects from the system originally proposed by GE.\u201d Hynes told Cunningham at the time of the award, \u201c [Y]ou people had ... a lot to do with our getting it. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">On November 28, after failing to find Hynes and Carp in Syracuse, Dr. Hillger and Ekstrom, manager of AT\u2019s contract department (see fn. 2),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> talked with some GE procurement people about possible subcontract terms. Dr. Hillger stated \u201cthat AT considered itself a team member and ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>pected a subcontract for the EM sensor.\u201d The GE people said that GE could not give AT a subcontract until GE obtained the prime contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Late in December, Cunningham of AT learned that Dresser<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> had theretofore submitted a quotation on the EM sensor. He called Carp at GE and inquired why Dresser had bid on this. \u201cCarp said that he didn\u2019t know . . . that he didn\u2019t see how anyone but AT could do the EM sensor and justify it to the Air Force.\u201d He was, however, critical of some of AT\u2019s prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">On January 2, one Taplow of GE\u2019s procurement unit \u201ctold Dr. Hillger that Dresser had been asked . . . for a proposal on the entire sensory system, and that it would be appropriate for AT to quote to Dresser on the EM portion. \u201d Dr. Hillger replied that<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> AT expected a sole source procurement from GE on the EM sensor, and that there was no reason for AT to submit a bid to Dresser.\u201d This was the first use by AT or GE of the words \u201csole source procurement.\u201d Taplow stated \u201cthat he regarded this as a competitive situation.\u201d That day, Dr. Hillger restated his \u201cposition to . . . Hynes and asked for his understanding. Hynes replied that GE was then negotiating with the Air Force and that it was . . . [GE\u2019s] intention . . . that AT would receive a sole source procurement for the EM sensor. He outlined the necessary steps: (1) that definite specifications must be approved by the Air Force, (2) that AT must be approved as a sole source contractor by the . . . Air Force,\u201d and (3) that the GE purchasing department would issue a purchase order to AT.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">On January 5, 1962, representatives of Dresser asked Cunningham of AT for information concerning the EM sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>sor aspect of the G-E proposal, so that Dresser could reply to G-E\u2019s BFQ of December 20, and asked also if AT would quote to Dresser. Cunningham said \u201cthat AT would have to seek legal advice, that they were quoting to G-E. \u2019 \u2019 There was \u201cno evidence that G-E . . . prior to . . . [the] suit informed AT ... of the letter agreement with Dresser\u201d of February, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Dr. Hillger and Cunningham conferred on January 8 with G-E\u2019s procurement people, including one Becker, manager of materials. Cunningham \u201cstated that Dresser receiving the complete sensor package was at odds with AT\u2019s understanding with G-E, which was that AT was to receive the EM sensor part as its reward for its participation ... as a member of the GE team.\u201d He said that AT felt \u201cthat G-E had picked their brains and was now trying to get rid of them. \u2019 \u2019 Becker said that this was a <em>\u2018 </em>\u2018fouled-up procurement ... he knew of no agreement between G-E and AT; that so far as he knew the procurement should be handled competitively . . . that they should talk to . . . Hynes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Hynes met that evening with Dr. Hillger and Cunningham in \u201ca stormy session.\u201d Hynes said that \u201cit was his prerogative to \u2019 \u2019 ask Dresser to bid on the EM sensor. Cunningham said that AT would not provide Dresser with a quotation and that \u201cAT was entitled to a sole source award, since this was a joint venture. Hynes denied this and said that AT was an associate member, not a team member.\u201d Cunningham and Hynes had not previously discussed what \u201cteam member\u201d meant and Cunningham was not sure what \u201cjoint venture\u201d meant. Hynes said \u201cthat AT would be taken care of if it didn\u2019t create a fuss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">The Air Force contract made the EM sensor of considerably increased importance. The prime contract was on a cost-plus-incentive-fee (CPIF) basis, with a \u201ctarget cost\u201d of $1,709,755 and a \u201ctarget fee\u201d of $95,000, rather than the CPFF basis proposed by GE. G-E stood to receive additional compensation if it reduced costs by more than $47,500 below the target cost but might lose as much as $170,975 if costs exceeded the target cost. Accordingly, it became nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>essary for GrE to \u201cbe careful with respect to\u201d costs. AT did not appear \u201cas the sole source for the EM components.\u201d The contract did not state whether the \u201csource\u201d of the EM components was both to design and to manufacture the items. Any subcontract would require Air Force approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">On February 14, Hynes told Cunningham \u201cthat the Air Force had imposed a tough contract on GrE.\u201d He \u201csaid that AT was not going to do the prototype, that GrE was going to do it and that he had already spent $57,000 of his overhead on equipment\u201d for this. On February 19, the GrE people stated \u201cthat GrE could spend its money as it saw fit,\u201d that AT had not \u201cput a proprietary stamp on\u201d its information \u201cand had no letter of agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">On February 26, GrE sent BFQs for the EM sensor to three companies, including AT, in accordance with purchasing procedures approved by the Air Force.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Quotations were sought on a firm fixed price basis for three EM sensors to be delivered in three months after the receipt of a purchase order. AT\u2019s quotation on March 19 (because on a fixed price basis), included a figure for profit of ten per cent of total estimated direct and indirect cost rather than seven per cent as in the earlier CPFF quotation. All bids received were rejected because they were not good enough (an engineering decision) and because the costs appeared to exceed what GrE could afford under its prime contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">On May 31, GrE sent out to AT and four other companies another BFQ on the EM sensor. It gave the bidder opportunity to bid on the yield component of the EM sensor. Bids were to be on a fixed price basis for manufacture or for both design and manufacture. The BFQ listed the accompanying drawings as proprietary data of GrE. Its form indicated that most design effort on the EM sensor had been accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>The master\u2019s general findings, based upon his subsidiary findings, may be summarized: (1) The information furnished by AT to GE was not a \u2018 \u2018 trade secret. \u2019 \u2019 Similar information was furnished to GE\u2019s competitors. GE owed AT no duty based on this information (apart from any joint venture obligation based on agreement between AT and GE). (2) Any agreement between GE and AT was reached at the meeting on June 7, 1961. Then it was agreed that AT would be a \u201cteam member,\u201d participating in GE\u2019s \u201cproposal . . . and, subject to Air Force approval ... in the program if . . . [GE] should be awarded a prime contract.\u201d (3) Hynes, who had authority to bind GE so far as AT was concerned, designated what AT was to do toward the general objective. (4) GE and AT understood by the term \u201cteam membership,\u201d which GE selected, that, if AT followed Hynes\u2019s instructions and if GE received a prime contract, AT would receive a subcontract covering design and manufacture of both the EM yield and direction components, subject to Air Force approval.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The subcontract provisions would be governed by the terms of the prime contract, by ASPE, and by fair negotiations between AT and GE. \u201cUse of the word \u2018team\u2019 was more than a sales pitch . . . [and] was intended to mean more to AT than opportunity to bid.\u201d GE should be held to its ordinary meaning. (5) GE\u2019s actions after June 7, 1961, until February 19,1962, so far as known to AT, were consistent with the arrangement outlined above, especially Hynes\u2019s confirmation on January 2,1962, \u201cthat AT would receive a sole source procurement for the EM sensor.\u201d (6) AT\u2019s fully disclosed dealings with other companies (see fn. 1) were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>inconsistent with. AT\u2019s obligation to GE. (7) AT carried out its undertaking, and it \u201cis inferable that . . . [AT\u2019s] work played a significant role in GE obtaining the award.\u201d GE did not perform its undertaking. It \u201cmade no effort after its formal proposal to obtain Air Force approval of AT as a sole source\u201d for the EM sensor. GE rejected all bids on the BFQ of February 26, 1962, instead of proceeding to negotiate in good faith with AT for a subcontract. Giving AT an opportunity to bid, without more, did not fulfill GE\u2019s obligation to AT. (8) GE\u2019s development of a prototype and the \u201cMay 31 RFQ which permitted quotations on manufacture alone as well as upon manufacture and design,\u201d represented a \u201cdeliberate violation\u201d of GE\u2019s undertaking. Although up to November 28, 1961, GE intended to fulfill its agreement, by the spring of 1962, GE had decided to prepare its own design for the EM sensor (using AT\u2019s information among other aids) and to compete with AT for its manufacture. (9) AT\u2019s proposal of March 19, 1962, taken with that of September 11, 1961, provides adequate basis for assessing damages for breach of the agreement to award a subcontract. Any uncertainty about these figures, because they do not result from \u2018 \u2018 a negotiated subcontract . . . arises from\u201d GE\u2019s failure to perform its agreement \u201cto negotiate a subcontract.\u201d (10) There is no basis for determining damages for breach of any agreement to award a subcontract for quantity production or for determining the fair value of AT\u2019s services on a quantum meruit basis. (11) AT is entitled to recover $128,734. This is based upon allowing AT a price seven per cent above what AT would have received from GE in reimbursement of its estimated costs, less AT\u2019s savings through not having to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">1. We may draw our own conclusions from the master\u2019s very complete subsidiary findings. <em>Samia </em>v. <em>Central Oil Co. </em>339 Mass. 101,122.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">2. A request for a proposal does not constitute a contract. See <em>Cronin </em>v. <em>National Shawmut Bank, </em>306 Mass. 202, 210. Here, however, there was more than such a re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>quest. GE sought AT\u2019s aid in obtaining and carrying out a prime contract for this largely unspecified, untested nuclear detection system. Success depended upon (a) satisfactory research, design and combination of the known scientific materials into a workable end product; (b) proof of that product\u2019s effectiveness and accuracy; and (e) the capacity of the GE team to meet the probably changing ideas of the Air Force. Against this background, the talk between Hynes and Cunningham on June 7, 1961, and GE\u2019s and AT\u2019s subsequent conduct<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> must be appraised. The parties might have been more precise in their arrangements but the ill defined character of the project made precision difficult.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The use of the term \u201cteam member\u201d leads us to infer that the parties intended a contractual association in some form of joint undertaking.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The master regarded this essentially as a joint venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The subsidiary facts do not indicate that GE and AT intended that the prime contract was to be a joint venture within that indefinite term\u2019s ordinary usage. See Bogert, Trusts and Trustees (2d ed.) \u00a7 488; Williston, Contracts (3d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 318-318C; Rowley, Partnership (2d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 52.1-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>52.62, esp. \u00a7\u00a7 52.3, 52.8-52.14, 52.21-52.22, 52.25, 52.29. AT was to be only a subcontractor. There was to be no such sharing in the profits of the prime contract, no such joint interest in particular assets, and no such joint control of performance as would ordinarily exist in a joint venture in the usual sense. See <em>Cardullo </em>v. <em>Landau, </em>329 Mass. 5, 8; <em>Samuel </em>v. <em>Bastress, </em>267 N. Y. 279, 283; <em>Steinbeck </em>v. <em>Gerosa, </em>4 N. Y. 2d 302, 317-318; <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Henkind, </em>56 N. Y. S. 2d 846, 849-850 (Supr. Ct.); <em>Hasday </em>v. <em>Barocas, </em>10 Misc. 2d (N. Y.) 22, 26-29 (Supr. Ct.).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">There was, however, a more limited joint undertaking by GrE and AT, as team members, to obtain the prime contract for GrE, with the expectation that AT would obtain benefits as a subcontractor. In this undertaking certain aspects of the usual joint venture did not appear.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Nevertheless, both GrE and AT made substantial contributions to the team effort in time and expenditure and risked the value of their preliminary work. Even if the arrangement did not constitute a typical joint venture<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> GrE (as controlling captain of the team) may be held to its contractual responsibility to AT as a team member.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The arrangements of June, 1961, as interpreted by the parties\u2019 actions indicate to us a contract for a joint under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>taking with the characteristics which the master found to exist. See fn. 11, <em>supra. </em>We agree with the master that \u2018 \u2018 team membership was intended to mean more to AT than opportunity to bid in the program,\u2019\u2019 and that (at least by implication) GE undertook that, if it \u201creceived a prime contract . . . AT [subject to Air Force approval] would receive ... a subcontract\u201d for the EM sensor, which (whether on a CPFF or a fixed price basis) would give to AT reasonable opportunity to recover its costs plus a fair profit. We conclude also that GE, by failing to press for AT\u2019s continuing participation in the program and by competing for the EM sensor work, committed total breaches of its duties to AT. As a consequence AT was deprived of a valuable opportunity for a part in the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">3. GE argues that its obligation to AT was at most to negotiate a subcontract and that such an obligation is too uncertain to be enforceable. A purported contract which is no more than an agreement to agree in the future on essential terms, or one which does not adequately specify essential terms, ordinarily will be unenforceable. See <em>Geo. W. Wilcox, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shell E. Petroleum Prod. Inc. </em>283 Mass. 383, 390; <em>Caggiano </em>v. <em>Marchegiano, </em>327 Mass. 574, 579; <em>Jacoby </em>v. <em>Koufman, </em>344 Mass. 761, 762; <em>St. Regis Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Hubbs &amp; Hastings Paper Co. </em>235 N. Y. 30, 36; <em>Sun Printing &amp; Publishing Assn. </em>v. <em>Remington Paper &amp; Power Co. Inc. </em>235 N. Y. 338, 345-347; <em>Ansorge </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>244 N. Y. 395, 398. See also Williston, Contracts (3d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 37-42, 45-49; Corbin, Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 95-102.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It is apparent that the detailed terms of AT\u2019s subcontract were never determined beyond the expectation that the subcontract would cover the EM sensor and enable AT to recover its costs and a reasonable profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Whatever uncertainty may have existed about the subcontract does not preclude recovery by AT. What AT lost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>by GE\u2019s breaches of contract was a business opportunity. See e.g. <em>Spitz </em>v. <em>Lesser, </em>302 N.

The problem is to determine the value of that opportunity to which AT was entitled as a contract right, even if AT\u2019s lost profits cannot be ascertained. A reasonable approximation will suffice. See <em>Agoos Leather Cos. Inc. </em>v. <em>American &amp; Foreign Ins. Co. </em>342 Mass. 603, 608; <em>White </em>v. <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co., ante, </em>367, 382.

Corp. </em>v. <em>Jet Spray Cooler, Inc. </em>344 Mass. 632, 635-636. Particularly is this so where the difficulties in determining damages arise in large part from GE\u2019s own failure to negotiate with AT in accordance with the joint undertaking. See <em>Spitz </em>v. <em>Lesser, </em>302 N. Y. 490, 494; McCormick, Damages, \u00a7 27, pp. 102-103. See also <em>Story Parchment Co. </em>v. <em>Paterson Parchment Paper Co. </em>282 U.

S. 251, 264-265.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Nevertheless, we do not accept the master\u2019s conclusion that AT\u2019s unilateral reply (to GE\u2019s RFQ) received March 19,1962, and that dated September 11,1961, afford a proper-basis for determining the value of AT\u2019s lost opportunity, or for showing what subcontract AT should fairly have negotiated with GE. Doubtless AT\u2019s March 19 and September 11 quotations were made carefully, in accordance with GE\u2019s requirements, and \u201cwith an eye to competition.\u201d They were not accepted by GE, however, and the Air Force might not have approved them. The quotations left unresolved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>questions concerning the propriety of AT\u2019s estimated costs (see fn. 6) and of its overhead allowances and allocations.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> More important, the master\u2019s computation of damages seems to have been made by allowing to AT the whole of what it would have received (by reimbursement of its costs plus a seven per cent fee) under a CPFF subcontract on the basis of its bids, less the cost to AT of performing such a subcontract. See <em>Bucholz </em>v. <em>Green Bros. Co. </em>272 Mass. 49, 54. That computation did not in any degree reflect the potential effect (see fn. 8) of bargaining or the possibility that the Air Force would not have approved such a subcontract without competition. See <em>Harding </em>v. <em>Rock, </em>60 Wash. 2d 292, 301-303. Although the damages allowable to AT upon the subsidiary findings could not exceed the amount allowed by the master, we think that the amount of damages can be fairly determined only after due consideration of the uncertainties which affected the value of AT\u2019s lost opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The master or a judge in the Superior Court, on the basis of the subsidiary findings already made and further evidence (including any appropriate expert testimony), must appraise the fair value of AT\u2019s lost opportunity in the light of the uncertainties. See analogy of <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Acc. Co. </em>314 Mass. 558, 564-567. This will be largely a matter of judgment, taking into account relevant factors, including what the trier of the fact concludes would have been (1) the approximate net amount realized by AT from a subcontract, if one had been negotiated, and (2) the probability of successful negotiations and Air Force approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">We think that such an appraisal can be fairly made with adequate certainty. Nevertheless, whatever may be the difficulties in proving damages, the amount of recovery can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>not be less than the higher of two available alternative measures of damages viz. (a) the value reasonably expended by AT in the performance of the joint arrangement, and (b) the fair value of AT\u2019s contribution to that arrangement.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The bill in equity did not seek recovery on the substantive basis, or, in general, on the theory of damages, which the master\u2019s subsidiary findings would justify. The subsidiary findings are not sufficient to enable us, using the present record only, to make a fair determination of the damages. The case must be remanded to the Superior Court to permit amendment of the pleadings to conform to the case established by the subsidiary findings and for further findings (either by a judge or by a master) on the issue of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">4. GKEQ contends that Hynes did not have authority to bind GrE to give a subcontract to AT. The subsidiary findings amply support the master\u2019s finding that Hynes \u201cwho was in charge of the 477L program for GrE . . . had authority to bind . . . [GrE] so far as AT was concerned.\u201d Making the joint proposal, which contemplated that AT would supply the EM sensor system, was formal action by GrE consistent with the joint undertaking. It confirmed the action of Hynes in arranging for AT to become a \u201cteam member.\u201d That the prime contract, after negotiations with the Air Force, differed in various respects from the proposal, or that the prime contract was awarded \u201cnot on the basis of . . . [GrE\u2019s] proposal but rather on . . . [GrE\u2019s] expected performance,\u201d did not relieve GE from its duty to AT under the joint arrangement in respect of a prime contract reasonably directly growing out of the proposal. The subsidiary findings establish that this joint arrangement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>for enlisting the cooperation of AT, was well within the authority which normally would be possessed by one who was leader of the <em>\u201c </em>group charged with responsibility for presenting\u201d GE\u2019s proposal. The findings do not suggest that AT knew or had reason to know that Hynes could not arrange for AT\u2019s participation as a team member, even if AT\u2019s representatives knew that the actual terms of a subcontract would have to be negotiated with GE\u2019s procurement staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">5. AT contends that GE should have been enjoined from supplying or arranging to supply EM sensors to the 477L project. This project was a matter important to the national defence. That GE was selected by the Air Force from a number of firms to receive the prime contract indicates that it was especially capable of carrying out the project. For this reason alone injunctive relief should not be granted. See <em>Harrisonville </em>v. <em>W. S. Dickey Clay Mfg. Co. </em>289 U. S. 334, 338. Cf. <em>Godard </em>v. <em>Babson-Dow Mfg. Co. </em>313 Mass. 280, 284, 286-288. Even if all the usual aspects of a joint venture had been present, we think an accounting alone would have provided adequate relief. See <em>Somerby </em>v. <em>Buntin, </em>118 Mass. 279, 287-288. See also <em>Berwin </em>v. <em>Cable, </em>313 Mass. 431, 434-437. With respect to this less formal joint undertaking, substantial redress can be afforded by the payment of money without injunctive relief. Damages, computed on the general basis already indicated to be appropriate, should cover all aspects of the business opportunity of which AT has been deprived, so far as the several elements of damage are reasonably ascertainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">6. The final decree is reversed. The interlocutory decree confirming the master\u2019s report is modified to confirm that report except as it relates to the issue of damages. So far as the master\u2019s report relates to the issue of damages, the interlocutory decree is to be vacated. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for appropriate amendment of the pleadings and for the redetermination of damages, in a manner consistent with this opinion. The plaintiff (AT) is to have costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b659-8\"> AT thereafter provided information to several competitors of GE in connection with the program and used in its proposals to these competitors the fruits of research by Dr. Clapp in the summer of 1961. At the first conference with GE on May 23, 1961, the AT people told the GE representatives that AT was approaching other companies. Cunningham of AT also told Hynes on September 26, 1961, that AT was participating as a team member with other companies to which it had submitted technical proposals on the 477L project.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b659-9\"> At the beginning of the conference Carp said that \u201che could not listen to . . . any proprietary information.\u201d Dr. Hillger replied that \u201cAT . . . would not treat its information as . . . proprietary.\u201d On later occasions, upon entering the GE plant, Cunningham, Dr. Hillger, and one Ekstrom of AT signed statements on the back of their visitor\u2019s badges \u201cto the effect that no disclosure made . . . was to be deemed proprietary or confidential unless pursuant to an agreement in writing signed by an authorized representative of GE.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b660-8\"> This was largely based upon data \u201cin government reports available to anyone having access to classified material.\u201d It involved a high type of theoretical physics, required considerable effort, and \u201cwas original in the sense that it had not been done before and was of value.\u201d It, however, was not \u201cnovel for scientists working in the nuclear sensor field.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b660-9\"> The Air Force received thirteen technical proposals.

That report included material concerning EM sensors <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>similar to, but not identical with, that\u201d in AT\u2019s proposal to GE (see fn. 7). AT was asked to quote on two groups of each of two items, a \u201cyield determination component\u201d and an \u201cEM direction component.\u201d Dresser\u2019s bid on each item was substantially lower than AT\u2019s corresponding bid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b662-8\"> Dr. Clapp\u2019s work with respect to the yield component was set out in GE\u2019s proposal substantially as received from AT and was represented by formulae which appeared in the GE proposal but not in the Mitre report (fn. 6). Twenty-one pages of the proposal discuss the EM sensor. Thirteen of these contain material identical with material in AT\u2019s proposal to GE.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b662-9\"> They knew that no subcontract was likely to be awarded until the prime contract had been executed, that they would have to negotiate with GE\u2019s procurement people, that each subcontract must be approved by the Air Force, and that there might be changes in technical requirements. They were familiar with the Armed Services Procurement Regulations (ASPR) found in 32 OFR and Air Force practice, and were aware \u201cthat more times than not the submission of a cost estimate did not result in ... a contract on\u2019\u2019 that basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b663-8\"> In November, GE had sent to Dresser a copy of GE\u2019s proposal to the Air Eoree with eleven pages relating to the EM sensor deleted. Dresser asked for the deleted pages. Hynes replied that they contained proprietary information belonging to AT. Bepresentatives of Dresser later examined the eleven pages at the GE office. In December, GE representatives consulted several possible vendors of the EM sensor other than Dresser and AT, and sought a quotation on a CPFF basis from Dresser on the whole sensor subsystem (including the EM sensor). Dresser affixed proprietary restrictions to its response. As a consequence it was not considered by GE. No other BFQ was sent out prior to February 26, 1962.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b665-8\"> The master found that it is \u201cvery exceptional for the Air Force to approve a sole source procurement, \u2019 \u2019 although this is possible in certain instances.

AT was to be responsible for proving the EM sensor\u2019s accuracy, for its design, and for cost estimates. GE was to have prime contract responsibility. Both risked their effort and expense, and AT assumed the further risks that its work might not satisfy GE and that the Air Force might not approve a subcontract which would permit AT its costs and a reasonable profit. The arrangement required GE (a) to keep AT informed of negotiations concerning the EM sensor; (b) \u201cto use its best efforts to secure Air Force approval of\u201d AT\u2019s continuing participation; (e) to negotiate fairly; and (d) to refrain both from using AT\u2019s information without fulfilling its part of the agreement and from performing AT\u2019s part of the work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b668-7\"> What the parties intended is indicated by GE\u2019s subsequent conduct e.g. (1) listing AT in the letter of interest as a subcontractor, \u201cteam member,\u201d and the only potential source of the EM sensor; (2) designating (see fn. 5) AT\u2019s personnel as \u201cthe only individuals . . . having program responsibility in the EM sensor field\u201d; (3) Hynes\u2019s statements that showing AT as a second tier subcontractor was a \u201cmistake,\u201d and that it was GE\u2019s \u201cintention . . . that AT would receive a sole source procurement for the EM sensor\u201d; (4) treating Dr. dapp, Dr. Hillger, and AT\u2019s DASA contract as team assets in the proposal presentation; (5) GE\u2019s early treatment (see fn. 9) of AT\u2019s EM sensor material as entitled to protection from Dresser; (6) GE\u2019s assistance in and use of Dr. Clapp\u2019s research in the summer of 1961; and (7) the absence of any GE suggestion to AT prior to December, 1961, that in the EM sensor work Dresser or other companies, and (above all) GE, were to compete with AT.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b668-8\"> The arrangement is governed by the law of Hew York, because any contract for a joint venture or other association was made in New York. <em>Seemann </em>v. <em>Eneix, </em>272 Mass. 189, 193-194. <em>West Side Motor Exp.
