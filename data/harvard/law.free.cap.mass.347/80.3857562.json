L. c. 84, \u00a7 15, for injuries sustained on September 17,1960, because of a defect in a pub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>lie way. The case was submitted on a written stipulation which meets the requirements of a case stated. See <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. </em>310 Mass. 81, 83; <em>Quintin Vespa Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Construction Serv. Co. </em>343 Mass. 547, 551-552. The judge made a finding for the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Moschella, who filed a bill of exceptions and an appeal (see Gr. L. e. 231, \u00a7 96), cannot pursue both methods of review. <em>Royal Paper Box Co. </em>v. <em>Munro &amp; Church Co. </em>284 Mass. 446, 449. We treat the judge\u2019s finding as an appeal-able order for judgment (see <em>United States Plywood Corp. </em>v. <em>Pioneer Display Co. </em>343 Mass. 150), dismiss the exceptions, and consider the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Apart from the workmen\u2019s compensation aspect of the case, all facts (as the city admits) are established which would entitle Moschella to recover under Gr. L. c. 84, \u00a7 15. Moschella was performing duties for his employer, Hol-brook Livestock Farm, Inc. (Holbrook). While collecting garbage, he sustained serious injuries by reason of a defect in a public sidewalk which could have been found to have been controlled and negligently maintained by the city. The city was given timely notice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">At the time of his injury, Moschella was employed by Holbrook, an independent contractor, to collect garbage from containers placed outside dwellings in the city. Before the contract with Holbrook became effective, the city had collected garbage, using its own employees and trucks. Moschella was one of a crew of four men, employees of Hol-brook and not of the city, assigned to a truck owned by Holbrook. All were hired, paid, and supervised solely by Holbrook. The city made no independent charge to its inhabitants for the work done by Holbrook. The contract, Holbrook\u2019s \u201conly material connection with the [c]ity,\u201d required Holbrook to provide workmen\u2019s compensation for all persons employed under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Moschella has received workmen\u2019s compensation benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>from Holbrook\u2019s insurer, which has taken no action against the city under Q-. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15. The city in 1953 had accepted the provisions of Gr. L. c. 152, \u00a7 69, as amended.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moschella did not claim or receive workmen\u2019s compensation from the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The city contends that, as a common employer insured under Gr. L. c. 152, it is immune from an action brought by or on behalf of an injured employee of an independent contractor. Moschella contends that his injury was caused in \u201ccircumstances creating legal liability in\u201d the city, that the city is \u201csome person other than the insured,\u201d that Hol-brook\u2019s insurer has not proceeded to enforce the city\u2019s liability, and that he may now do so in his own right under Gr. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">It is stipulated that if a judgment for Moschella is proper on the agreed facts, judgment is to be entered for him for $4,000. Otherwise judgment is to be entered for the city. There is no doubt that, on the stipulated facts, judgment for Moschella would be proper unless, as matter of law, he is barred by the so called \u201ccommon employment\u201d doctrine from obtaining judgment against the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The \u201ccommon employment\u201d doctrine was restated in <em>Clark </em>v. <em>M. W. Leahy Co. Inc. </em>300 Mass. 565, 568, where it was said that c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 15,18, and 24, \u201cin combination have resulted in the establishment of a rule governing common law actions for personal injuries suffered by employees of\u201d certain persons insured under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. For present purposes the provisions of \u00a7 18 (as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>amended through St. 1939, c. 93)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> set out in the margin are controlling. The common employment doctrine does not bar an action against the city under \u00a7 15, if Holbrook was engaged in an activity \u201cancillary and incidental to, and . . . no part of or process in, the trade or business carried on by the insured.\u201d We think that the garbage collection was ancillary and incidental to any work which the city itself was conducting. Garbage collection by a municipality is, of course, a permitted governmental function which may become commercial in character in some circumstances. See <em>Baumgardner </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>304 Mass. 100, 106-110. In Quincy, however, although the city at one time had engaged in garbage collection, it no longer was so engaged at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">By the arrangement with Holbrook the city had used its authority (G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 4, as amended through St. 1958, c. 613, \u00a7 2A) to make a contract \u201cfor the exercise of [one of] its corporate powers,\u201d viz. \u201c[f]or the disposal of its garbage . . . for a period not exceeding five years.\u201d See G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 1, for applicability of \u00a7 4 to cities. Although this service was in a sense a part of the city\u2019s operations and constituted a service provided for Quincy\u2019s residents without a separate charge, the city had no continuing direct participation in the work. That work could reasonably be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>found to have become ancillary and incidental to the remaining directly handled municipal functions. See <em>Pimental </em>v. <em>John E. Cox Co. Inc. </em>299 Mass. 579, 582-586 (construction of a terminal for a freight forwarder); <em>Cannon </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>318 Mass. 373, 375-377 (whether transportation of a general contractor\u2019s large power shovel by an independent trucker was \u201cancillary\u201d was a question of fact for the jury); <em>Dubois </em>v. <em>Soule Mill, </em>323 Mass. 472, 474-477 (study, survey, and overhauling of a heating plant of a factory). See also <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>H. F. Davis Tractor Co. </em>342 Mass. 675, 677-678 (informal agreement for demonstration on the job of a crane which owner wished to sell to a construction contractor). Cf. <em>McPadden </em>v. <em>W. J. Halloran Co. </em>338 Mass. 189, 192-193; <em>Van Bibber\u2019s Case, </em>343 Mass. 443, 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Because we hold that there was no common employment, this is not a case where (see <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Dowgielewicz, </em>304 Mass. 560, 562), in any event, any compensation insurance (or liability as self-insurer) of the city, or of any common employer other than Holbrook, throws its \u201cshadow over the whole work.\u201d We thus do not reach two troublesome questions argued in the briefs, viz. (1) whether the city can be an \u201cinsured person\u201d (see Gr. L. e. 152, \u00a7 1 [6]) or a common employer insured under the act (see italicized language of \u00a7 69, fn. 2, <em>supra) </em>for purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 15,18, and 24, and (2) whether there is any conflict between <em>Saxe\u2019s Case, </em>242 Mass. 290, 291, and statements made in <em>Pettiti </em>v. <em>Edward J. McHugh &amp; Son, Inc. </em>341 Mass. 566, 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Since judgment for Moschella is proper, the order for judgment is reversed and judgment is to be entered for him in the sum of $4,000 in accordance with the stipulation. Moschella\u2019s exceptions are dismissed, Mr. Justice Kirk and Mr. Justice Spiegel concur for reasons separately stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-9\"> Neither party has raised the question whether Moschella at the time of his injury was a traveler on the public way. See <em>Wershba </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>324 Mass. 327, 330-331. We do not consider the question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b126-8\"> Section 69 (as amended through St. 1959, c. 555), so far as relevant to the issue before us, reads: \u201cThe commonwealth and any county, city, town or district having the power of taxation which has accepted . . . [St. 1913, c. 807] . . . shall pay to laborers, workmen and mechanics <em>employed by it </em>who receive injuries arising out of and in the course of their employment . . . the compensation provided by this chapter. . . . The terms laborers, workmen and mechanics . . . <em>shall include all employees of any such </em>city . . . who are engaged in work being done under a contract with the state department of public works, and <em>shall include other employees </em>... of <em>any such . . </em>. city <em>... to such extent as .. . </em>such . . . city . . . <em>shall determine </em>.... Any . . . city . . . which accepts this section may provide for payment of compensation of certain or all of its employees by insurance with an insurer, <em>subject, however, to the provisions and limitations of this section\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).

The insurer, however, shall be entitled to recover indemnity from any other person who would have been liable to such employees independently of this section; and if the insurer has paid compensation under this section, it may enforce, in the name of the employee or in its own name and for its benefit, the liability of such other person. . . . This section shall not apply to any contract of am independent or sub-contractor which is merely ancillary and incidental to, and is no part of or process in, the trade or business carried on by the insured, nor to any case where the injury occurred elsewhere than on, in or about the premises on which the contractor has <em>undertaken to </em>execute the work for the insured or which are under the control or management of the insured. The word \u2018premises\u2019 . . . shall include the public highways if the contract . , . necessitates the use of the public highways.\u2019\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b128-8\">Kirk, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5f\">(concurring) Mr. Justice Spiegel and I agree that the plaintiff should recover. It is our view, however, that the decision should rest on different grounds. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>fact that the Legislature has placed the Commonwealth and its political subdivisions, of which the defendant city is one, in a separate and distinct category under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (C. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 69-75) should be the main premise upon which the opinion should be based. We think it is important that this approach should be used because, in our judgment, <em>Pettiti </em>v. <em>Edward J. McHugh &amp; Son, Inc. </em>341 Mass. 566, departs from the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and is not reconcilable with decisions of this court relating to the status of the Commonwealth and its political subdivisions under that act. Specifically, the <em>Pettiti </em>case conflicts with <em>Saxe\u2019s Case, </em>242 Mass. 290, which it does not mention. Because of this conflict, an exposition of the applicable law should now be undertaken with a view to suggesting the resolution of the conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Before proceeding with the detailed consideration of the ease before us, the following summary observation is offered: Having received workmen\u2019s compensation from his employer\u2019s insurer, the sole source of the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover against the city is Gr. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15. Under that section, if, as to the plaintiff, the city is an insured person (i.e., is <em>not </em>\u201csome person other than the insured\u201d), the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover in an action at law against the city does not exist. On the other hand, if, as to the plaintiff, the city is \u201csome person other than the insured\u201d (i.e., is not an insured person), the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover against the city is clear, and resort to the subjoined doctrine of common employment is unnecessary. Further, if it be the law that the city is under no obligation to provide, or cannot by law provide, workmen\u2019s compensation for the plaintiff, then the city is not an insured person as to the plaintiff, and he may maintain his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">For expository purposes, however, it is advisable to start, as does the court, from a broad base, by reference to <em>Clark </em>v. <em>M. W. Leahy Co. Inc. </em>300 Mass. 565. We state in full the same rule as quoted by Qua, J., in <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Dowgielewicz, </em>304 Mass. 560, 562. \u201cThe insurance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>general contractor or \u2018common employer\u2019 . . . throws its shadow over the whole work. In that shadow ... a cause of action for negligence causing a compensable personal injury cannot grow. . . . Since the insurance of the \u2018common employer\u2019 covers and protects all employees engaged in the \u2018common employment\u2019 . . ., one engaged in that common employment as contractor, subcontractor or employee cannot be a \u2018person other than the insured\u2019 within \u00a7 15, and the injured employee has no option to sue him at common law. An insurer, whether of the common employer or of a subcontractor, paying compensation to an employee, cannot recover over under \u00a7 15 against a negligent contractor, subcontractor or employee engaged in the \u2018common employment\u2019; for the insurer succeeds only to the rights of the employee receiving compensation. ... In the application of this rule, it is immaterial whether the subcontractors are insured or not. . . . The essential thing is the existence of a \u2018common employer\u2019 <em>who is an \u2018insured person\u2019 under % 18 </em>..., and who is having work done by contract in or about premises specified in \u00a7 18 ..., which work is part of or process in his trade or business\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">For our purposes the significant words are the italicized words in the last sentence of the quoted rule. It is our opinion that the city is not an \u201cinsured person\u201d under \u00a7 18. We base our opinion (a) upon the scheme of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act in the context of general tort liability; (b) upon the express terms of \u00a7\u00a7 69-75; and (c) upon our decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">We note first the principle of nonliability, in the absence of statute, of the Commonwealth in general, and of its political subdivisions, in actions of tort for the negligence of their officers and employees in the performance of strictly public functions from which is derived no special corporate advantage, no pecuniary profit, and no enforced contribution from individuals particularly benefited. <em>Bolster </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>225 Mass. 387, 389-390. <em>Baumgardner </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>304 Mass. 100, 106-109. <em>Molinari </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>333 Mass. 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>We note also that the Commonwealth and its political subdivisions are <em>not included within the definition of the word \u201cemployer\u201d i/n G. L. c. 152, % l.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We note, too, and emphasize, that the act of 1913 (now Gr. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 69-75) sets apart for separate consideration the employees of the Commonwealth and of its subdivisions as distinguished from employees in private industry. The act extended the principle of compensation to public employees; but it \u2018\u2018 applies only to the Commonwealth and to such local subdivisions as accept it.\u201d <em>Stone\u2019s Case, </em>290 Mass. 530, 531. Section 70 of the act gives <em>jurisdiction </em>of cases arising under \u00a7\u00a7 69-75 to the division of industrial accidents, prescribes that the <em>procedure </em>shall be the same as under \u00a7\u00a7 1-68, and secures to the city all the <em>rights </em>of an <em>insurer </em>under \u00a7\u00a7 1-68. <em>Hurley\u2019s Case, </em>302 Mass. 46, 48. The obligation to pay workmen\u2019s compensation benefits by those who accept the act is imposed by \u00a7 69.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">We now consider our decision in <em>Saxe\u2019s Case, </em>242 Mass. 290, 291, in which the court stated, citing earlier cases, that the \u201cright to compensation [from a city which has accepted G-. L. c. 152, \u00a7 69] is expressly limited \u2018to such laborers, workmen and mechanics employed by it as receive injuries arising out of and in the course of their employment.\u2019 \u201d It was held that an employee of an uninsured independent contractor, injured in the performance of his employer\u2019s contract with a city which had accepted \u00a7 69, was not entitled, under the provisions of \u00a7 18, to receive compensation from the city. The validity of that holding stands unimpaired by our decisions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Stone\u2019s Case, </em>290 Mass. 530, 531; <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Dowgielewicz, </em>304 Mass. 560, 563. The effect of the holding is that the city, having accepted \u00a7 69, assumed the obligation to pay compensation only within the prescribed limits of the section. That obligation extends only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>to its own eligible employees and to those covered by \u00a7 74.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It does not extend to employees of independent or subcontractors engaged in work under a contract with the city. The obligation of the city does not and cannot, under \u00a7 69, throw \u201cits shadow over the whole work.\u201d The city therefore is not a common employer insured under the act and in consequence is not entitled to immunity against such actions at law within its limited sphere of liability, as may be brought by, or in the rights of, employees so engaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">It would seem to be clear that the statute, our decisions, and the rule itself recognize that the purpose of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act <em>(Bresnahan </em>v. Barre, 286 Mass. 593, 597) cannot be carried out in all cases. \u201cOtherwise there would be no room for the application of Gr. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 15, under which an employee may . . . [proceed] in an action at law for damages against \u2018some person other than the insured.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pimental </em>v. <em>John E. Cox Co. Inc. </em>299 Mass. 579, 584. The reasoning in the <em>Pimental </em>case (58^-586) where the basis for immunity is analyzed (and recognized in <em>Clark </em>v. <em>M. W. Leahy Co. Inc. </em>300 Mass. 565, 568) is here applicable and adaptable. It is the <em>fact </em>that there is an obligation to pay workmen\u2019s compensation, and the <em>further fact </em>that the <em>obligation must extend to all workmen on the job </em>whether or not immediately employed by the contractor which give the general contractor immunity to actions at law by other employees so engaged. Here the plaintiff is outside the scope of the obligation of the city under the statute to make workmen\u2019s compensation payment. In such a case there is no basis for immunity against the liability which is imposed upon the city by Gr. L. c. 84, \u00a7 15.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Amendments to Gr. L. c. 152, since <em>Saxe\u2019s Case, </em>242 Mass. 290, tend to confirm the conclusion which we reach. The definition of an \u201cinsured\u201d or \u201cinsured person\u201d in Gk L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>c. 152, \u00a7 1 (6), as amended by St. 1943, c. 529, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> does not include a city. The definition of an \u201cinsurer\u201d in \u00a7 1 (7), as amended by St. 1950, c. 277, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> although it does include a city, places the city in a different category from a \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>self-insurer,\u201d and thus negatives the implication that a city, even though payments are made from its own funds, is an \u201cinsured\u201d or \u201cinsured person.\u201d We construe the word \u201cinsurer,\u201d in context, as being applicable to the Commonwealth and to those of its political subdivisions which have assumed the obligation to make compensation payments to their employees from funds raised by taxation. Finally, St. 1951, c. 610, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which added a paragraph to \u00a7 69 permitting political subdivisions of the Commonwealth an alternate method of providing for payment of compensation to their employees, does not indicate a legislative intent to extend the obligation of cities to pay compensation to persons other than their own employees. On the contrary, this added paragraph emphasizes that even though a political subdivision should cover employees by a policy with an insurance company (which thereupon would become the \u201cinsurer\u201d) the coverage is to extend only to \u201claborers, workmen and mechanics employed by it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">We now refer to <em>Pettiti </em>v. <em>Edward J. McHugh &amp; Son, Inc. </em>341 Mass. 566, where the court denied recovery to an employee of the Commonwealth who, having received compensation payments, sought damages from an independent contractor and its employee whose negligence caused the injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>to the Commonwealth\u2019s employee. The denial was on the basis that (a) the Commonwealth was the common employer of the negligent employee of the independent contractor, and (b) the Commonwealth was, as to the negligent employee, an insured person under the act. Specifically, the court said at page 571: \u201cAlthough it has never been decided, there can be no doubt that the doctrine of common employment applies to the Commonwealth <em>as well as to any other insured person. </em>The Commonwealth is obligated by Gr. L. c. 152, \u00a7 69, to pay compensation to its injured employees (see <em>Stone\u2019s Case, </em>290 Mass. 530) and is specifically defined as an insurer under the workmen\u2019s compensation law by \u00a7 1 (7), as amended by St. 1950, c. 277\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">It is respectfully submitted that nowhere in the statute is the Commonwealth defined as an \u201cinsured\u201d or as \u201can insured person.\u201d Gr. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (6). It is likewise submitted that there is no authority in our decisions that the Commonwealth is like \u201cany other insured person.\u201d Our cases, as noted, say the opposite. Further, the definition of the Commonwealth as an \u201cinsurer\u201d is carefully circumscribed and can scarcely be the basis for a judicial construction that it thereby became an \u201cinsured.\u201d Since the burden of paying compensation to an injured employee of the Commonwealth or of one of its political subdivisions falls upon the taxpayers (0. L. c. 152, \u00a7 69), the holding of the court in the <em>Pettiti </em>case that the Commonwealth is the common employer of the negligent employee of the independent contractor, and that the Commonwealth is an insured person, exposes the Commonwealth and towns to an obligation to pay compensation to injured employees of uninsured independent contractors. The holding in <em>Saxe\u2019s Case </em>is precisely to the contrary.
