T. Main, Inc. </em>(Main) v. <em>Massachusetts Turnpike Authority </em>(the authority), <em>ante, </em>154. The facts giving rise to the principal issues, and the findings by the same auditor and the same trial judge, are very much alike. Accordingly, to avoid duplication, in general only facts which differ significantly from those in the <em>Main </em>case will be set out here.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">The case is here on a consolidated outline bill of exceptions in which the authority presents much the same exceptions presented by it in the <em>Main </em>case. Fay, Spofford &amp; Thorndike, Inc. <em>(Fay), </em>also presents exceptions to certain rulings given at the request of the authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Fay by a contract dated June 22, 1954, for engineering services, similar<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to that in the <em>Main </em>case, was made section engineer of sections I and J of the turnpike. The auditor found, as in the <em>Main </em>case, that when this \u201ccontract was executed, both parties anticipated that the turnpike would be open for traffic on November 15,1956,\u201d and that neither Fay nor the authority \u2018 \u2018 contributed to the delay in the opening . . . until May 15, 1957.\u201d He concluded that, if Fay \u201cis not precluded by the terms of its contract from recovering for additional services,\u201d it is entitled to recover the fair value ($97,138.15) of additional services rendered after November 15, 1956, with interest from June 2, 1958. He stated also that there was no evidence to sustain any allegation that the authority \u201cdeliberately and arbitrarily extended the time for the opening . . . beyond . . . November 15, 1956,\u201d and that both Fay and the authority \u201cacted in good faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">It was admitted that the authority owes Fay, \u201ca balance of at least $68,342.90 for its services both in the design and construction phases.\u201d This amount had been retained by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>the authority under the provisions of art. 8 of the contract. See the <em>Mam </em>case, fn. 4. The auditor found the correct amount of the retainages to be $69,430.74, and that Fay was entitled to receive this amount with interest from June 2, 1958. The auditor took the view that the contract obliged the authority to make final determination of the cost of construction \u201cwithin a reasonable time after it had been furnished with the information necessary to make the determination,\u201d and that the authority had not been given \u201cthe right to make its determination at any time it sees fit, however late that time may be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">The trial judge, on the basis of the auditor\u2019s report and certain documentary evidence, found that Fay was owed $97,138.15, with interest from June 2, 1958, for additional services and $69,430.74, also with interest from June 2, 1958, for unpaid retainages from the contract fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">A. The Claim pob Additional Compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">We perceive nothing in the facts found by the auditor or in the documentary evidence before the judge which would warrant any result in this case different from that reached in the <em>Main </em>case with respect to the claim for additional compensation. The contract provisions do not permit any different result, for the reasons stated in the <em>Main </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Accordingly, the authority\u2019s requests for rulings numbered 1, 8, 9, 10, 13, and 14 (which are the same as the like numbered requests in the <em>Main </em>case) were improperly denied and the authority\u2019s exceptions to the denial of these rulings are sustained. The trial judge correctly gave the rulings requested by the authority to which Fay claimed exceptions. These exceptions are overruled. Judgment is to be entered for the authority on all counts seeking additional compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">B. The Retainage Intebest Claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">The authority does not argue that the amount ($69,430.74) of the retainages found by the auditor was incorrect. The authority does dispute the allowance of interest upon this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>amount from June 2, 1958. The pertinent dates with respect to each of the four contracts let for construction of sections I and J of the turnpike are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On July 11,1957, Fay \u201cturned over to the . . . [authority] all of its field books relating to the four . . . contracts . . . and on July 31, 1957 . . . requested payment for its services .... On December 20, 1957 . . . [Fay] forwarded the so called \u2018as-built\u2019 plans . . On December 23,1957, the authority\u2019s general engineering consultant approved these plans. On June 2, 1958, Fay wrote to the authority \u201cenclosing a statement of its engineering services.\u201d This letter \u2018 \u2018 states that it is based on final construction cost estimates and final cost of utilities \u2018as recently approved.\u2019 \u201d Nearly seventeen months later (on October 22, 1959) the value of the last of the construction contracts was accepted by the authority\u2019s hoard.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The auditor concluded that interest was due from the date of Fay\u2019s statement (June 2,1958) and that \u201cfinal payment . . . was withheld for a period beyond what was reasonable.\u201d The obvious purpose of the provision in the contract (art. 8, see the <em>Main </em>case, fn. 4) for the retainages, viz. preventing an overpayment to Fay, could not justify this delay of nearly seventeen months after the authority had the information necessary to make its determination. The auditor found no facts which tended to suggest that the delay was reasonable or proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">This phase of the ease is governed by onr discussion and conclusions in the <em>Main </em>case with respect to the retainage interest claim in that case. There was no error of law in the denial of the authority\u2019s motion to strike the portions of the auditor\u2019s report allowing interest on the retainages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>from June 2, 1958. The rulings concerning this claim, requested by the authority, were given. The authority\u2019s exceptions dealing with this interest claim are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-7\"> The contract contained in substantially the same form arts. 2, 3 (e), 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 20, and incorporated by reference the same specifications for section engineer\u2019s services.
