G-. L. c. 118A, \u00a7\u00a7 13-32. The commissioner had approved the decision of a referee. The referee had found that a few days before the application for assistance in March, 1962, G-anglof\u00edi\u2019s daughter had withdrawn all the funds ($3,552.30) in her joint savings account with Grangloff and that all but $600 of this account had been Grangloff\u2019s. He found that about $2,900 \u201cis still available and held by . . . [Grangloff\u2019s] daughter who has a legal obligation for his support.\u201d He concluded that the withdrawal was \u201ca subterfuge to make Mr. Grangloff eligible . . ..\u201d The stated ground for denial of assistance was: \u201cAppellant transferred resources immediately (eight days) prior to application to make himself eligible for Medical Assistance for the Aged. (Manual of Public Assistance, Page 38).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Por a period beginning April 12,1955, Grangloff had been the sole owner of the account. At sometime prior to February 1, 1956, the daughter\u2019s name \u201cwas added to the account as joint owner.\u201d There was no evidence that Grang-loff knew of the withdrawal in March, 1962. Through age or infirmity he was unable to give significant testimony. There was testimony by the daughter which, if believed, would have permitted the finding that $3,340.83 of the withdrawn amount was hers. This testimony was disbelieved by the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">1. The manual referred to by the referee is not before us. <em>Finlay </em>v. <em>Eastern Racing Assn. </em>308 Mass. 20, 26-28. <em>Mastrullo </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>328 Mass. 621, 622. We assume, however, that it sets out instructions for applying Gr. L. c. 118A, \u00a7 6. That section provides in part: \u201cHo assistance under this chapter shall be granted to an applicant who, at any time within five years immediately prior to the filing of an application for such assistance, has made an assignment or transfer of property so as to render himself eligible to such assistance.\u201d This does not bar assistance as Grangloff, so far as appears, made no transfer within five years prior to the application. The withdrawal by the daughter was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>shown to have been made with Gangloff\u2019s knowledge; it could not be found to be a transfer by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">2. It could not rightly be found that Gangloff at the time of the application had \u201cownership of bank deposits, securities, cash on hand or similar assets of more than two thousand dollars,\u201d so that \u201c [i]n no event shall medical assistance ... be furnished.\u201d G. L. c. 118A, \u00a7 18. Gang-loff\u2019s claim to funds held by the daughter, disputed by her, was not an asset which could be so promptly or surely liquidated as to be \u201csimilar\u201d to \u201cbank deposits, securities, [or] cash on hand.\u201d The daughter, of course, was not bound by the referee\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">3. The local board in further considering Gangloff\u2019s application for medical assistance must determine whether under G. L. c. 118A<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and applicable regulations Gangloff may be required to liquidate the claim, or to take other action in respect of it, as a condition of obtaining assistance. No such issue and no issue under G. L. c. 118A, \u00a7\u00a7 4A<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 23<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is presented on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">4. The final decree is reversed. A decree is to enter remanding the case to the commissioner for entry of a decision to provide that the local board take action on and in respect of Gangloff\u2019s application for medical assistance to the aged in a manner consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-9\"> See \u00a7 18: \u201cA person entitled to medical assistance for the aged shall receive such assistance on the basis of need. The amount of such need shall be determined, in accordance with standards approved by the department, after consideration of the degree to which an applicant\u2019s income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical care.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b119-10\"> \u201cA person shall be liable in contract to any town, for expenses incurred by it under this chapter ... if such person is in possession of funds not otherwise exempted . . ..\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b119-13\"> \"There shall be no recovery of any medical assistance for the aged correctly paid on behalf of a recipient during his lifetime or the lifetime of his surviving spouse.
