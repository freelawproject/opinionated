There is also a bill of exceptions. The case was presented on a statement of agreed facts. The judge ruled in substance that the defendants, in not conforming to the decision of the board, have enlarged a nonconforming building contrary to law. There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">The zoning by-law was adopted in 1950. The defendants then \u2018<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> owned and occupied the property at 202A and B Main Street\u201d in a general residence district. The two buildings so numbered were on a lot of about 8,000 square feet. Number 202A was a single family residence. Number 202B, in the rear, was a single story structure, twelve by twenty-nine feet, and was \u201cused as a dwelling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">In April, 1961, the defendants obtained from the selectmen a building permit to add a ground floor room fifteen feet square and an entire second story to No. 202B. The board of appeals promptly protested, the selectmen acted to revoke the permit, the defendants applied to the board for authority to make the alterations, and the board granted the application in part but excluded construction of the second story. The selectmen issued another permit to build \u201cin accordance with the Board of Appeal\u2019s decision . . ..\u201d The defendants, however, have built the second story.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">The board acted under \u00a7 7-1 of the by-law that provides that \u201cno non-conforming building . . . shall be structurally or substantially altered ... or enlarged . . . unless, upon application to the Board of Appeals it can be shown that such change, if carried out, would be less detrimental or objectionable to the neighborhood, or, if not carried out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>would work unnecessary hardship.\u201d See G-. L. c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5. The board\u2019s limited permission was \u201cgranted in order that a hardship would not be created due to the lack of bath and ldtchen facilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The zoning by-law requires that in a general residence district there be a lot of at least 7,000 square feet for each separate dwelling.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Conforming lots are not available for the defendants \u2019 two dwellings. There is nothing in the contention that the authorization of \u201ctwo family dwellings\u201d authorizes two single dwellings on the same lot. See <em>Van Arsdale </em>v. <em>Provincetown, </em>344 Mass. 146, 147. The lot size requirement is determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Nor can the defendants succeed in their contention that the smaller house is a permitted accessory building. The agreed facts establish No. 202B as a \u201cdwelling\u201d in 1950 and the sketches attached to the defendants\u2019 applications show a dwelling with adequate facilities<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for occupancy apart from any other structure. It is inconsequential whether at times some members of a single family group may occupy both dwellings. Such related use of a \u201cdwelling\u201d is not an accessory use within the contemplation of the by-law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We need not pause to consider the status of a guest house. Even if No. 202B could have been ruled an accessory structure prior to the proposed changes, which we do not suggest, no right is shown to make such a structure into a nonconforming dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>The defendants\u2019 reliance on St. 1962, c. 340, which added a proviso to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 5, is based on a misreading of the language of the proviso. It is only \u2018 \u2018 non-conforming buildings . . . used primarily for agriculture, horticulture or floriculture\u201d that are within its terms.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 5A, as amended through St. 1961, c. 435, \u00a7 1, also relied on by the defendants, refers to building on certain nonconforming lots, not to alterations of nonconforming buildings or alterations to create nonconformity.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The defendants can assert no right under the first, illegally granted, permit. See cases cited in <em>Kolodny </em>v. <em>Building Commr. of Brookline, </em>346 Mass. 289, 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">There was no error in any ruling nor in the denial of the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the bill of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">\n<em>Final decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-7\">\u201c[\u00a7] 8-5 Lot Area and Frontage ...

Doe. No. 117, and House Docs. Nos. 3501 and 3557, confirm the plain meaning of the text of the amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
