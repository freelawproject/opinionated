The declaration sought was that the plaintiff was entitled \u201cto hold the office of [and to be paid as] full-time assessor\u201d of the town notwithstanding a vote of the board of assessors on December 4,1962, by which \u201chis service as full-time assessor was terminated\u201d on December 9. The final decree ruled that from and after October 23, 1962,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the plaintiff was not en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>titled to receive compensation as full time assessor and that he was \u201cnot wrongfully ousted from the position ... on December 9, 1962,\u201d since \u201che then held the position in violation of\u201d Gr. L. c. 32, \u00a7 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 91, as amended through St. 1961, c. 367, provided: \u201cNo person while receiving a . . . retirement allowance from the commonwealth or from any county, city or town, shall, after the date of his retirement be paid for any service rendered to the commonwealth or any county, city, town or district, except . . . for service in a public office to which he has thereafter been elected by direct vote of the people.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The judge found material facts as follows: In 1957 the plaintiff retired from his position of building inspector and assessor and he has since been receiving a retirement allowance. At the annual town meeting on April 23, 1962, he was elected assessor at a salary of $1,200. An article in the warrant proposed authority to the assessors \u201cin accordance with\u201d St. 1929, c. 36, which inserted \u00a7 4A in G. L. c. 41, \u201cto appoint one of their members to another office or position under their control, and fix the salary of such person.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under this article the adjourned town meeting, on May 15, 1962, voted the sum of $2,896 \u201cfor a full-time office or position for six months of 1962.\u201d After the meeting the assessors \u201cappointed . . . [the plaintiff] a full-time assessor at the authorized rate of compensation.\u201d On December 4, 1962, the assessors voted that the plaintiff be relieved of his duties as \u201cFull Time Assessor . . . on . . . December 9th, 1962 because . . . [of a ruling by town counsel].\u201d There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>upon one of the other two assessors was \u201cappointed to the Full Time assessors\u2019s position\u201d and the plaintiff on December 9,1962, \u201cresumed serving in the office of assessor at an annual salary of $1200.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The town counsel had advised the board in substance that from and after October 23, 1962, the plaintiff could not be paid as full time assessor because of G-. L. c. 32, \u00a7 91, and the repeal of St. 1950, c. 639, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The judge ruled that the plaintiff \u201cwas not \u2018elected\u2019 to the position of full-time assessor \u2018by direct vote of the people \u2019 of Randolph. \u2019 \u2019 This ruling gives controlling weight to the circumstance that action of the board was necessary to enable the plaintiff to receive the compensation fixed for an assessor working full time. The plaintiff contends that the \u201cservice rendered [by him] to the . . . town . . . [was only] service in a public office to which he . . . [was] elected by direct vote,\u201d precisely within the specification of Gr. L. c. 32, \u00a7 91. Hence, the plaintiff contends, he was not \u201cappointed\u201d to any office other than the one to which he was elected. We agree with the plaintiff in this contention, but rule that he had no right to compensation as full time assessor after December 9,1962, for the assessors \u2019 vote of December 4, 1962, was effective in accordance with its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The effect of the town\u2019s vote of May 15,1962, was merely to fix the salary of such assessor as should by choice of the board work full time in his elected office of assessor. This complied with the provision of Gr. L. e. 41, \u00a7 108: \u201cThe salary and compensation of all elected officers of a town shall be fixed annually by vote of the town . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> No vote, as proposed in the article, to authorize the assessors under Gr. L. c. 41, \u00a7 4A, to \u201cappoint ... to another office or position\u201d was required.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Passing a vote that fixed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>salary for one member of an elected board at a higher rate gave the board by necessary implication the authority to select the member to perform, as an elected official, the full time service for which the higher compensation was voted. That the town chose to act under an article that referred to \u00a7 4A did not restrict the power of the assessors in respect of selecting the one to serve full time.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The selection was for a period at the will of the board. The vote of December 4 terminating the plaintiff\u2019s right to full time compensation was within the power of the board. It is inconsequential whether the reason for the action was a misconstruction of law. The board did not purport to make termination conditional on the correctness of town counsel\u2019s views. Indeed, the plaintiff\u2019s bill alleges that on December 9,1962, the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cservice as full-time assessor was terminated.\u201d Also, it appears that another member of the board was then designated to perform such service.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The final decree is vacated. A final decree is to enter in the Superior Court declaring that the plaintiff\u2019s right to receive compensation at the rate fixed for an assessor serving full time ceased on December 9,1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-14\"> October 23, 1962, was the effective date of St. 1962, e. 743, which by \u00a7 1 repealed \u00a7 9 of St. 1950, c. 639. The repealed \u00a7 9 had authorized the director of civil service, supported by a majority vote of the commission, to approve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>temporary reemployment of retired officers or employees of the Commonwealth and its political subdivisions during a declared civil defence emergency. When so reemployed, a retired officer or employee could be paid the difference between his retirement allowance and the full salary for his temporary services. The basis for the assumed relevance of that statute to the plaintiff\u2019s work as a full time assessor does not appear.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b697-8\"> Subsequent amendments do not change the section in relevant respects.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b697-9\"> General Laws, c. 41, \u00a7 4A, provides that \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided, a town board may, if authorized by vote of the town, appoint any member thereof to another town office or position for the term provided by law, if any, otherwise for a term not exceeding one year,\u201d and that the \u201csalary of any such appointee shall be fixed by vote of the town, notwithstanding the provisions of\u201d \u00a7 108.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b698-8\"> The date on which the plaintiff began to be paid as full time assessor does not appear.
