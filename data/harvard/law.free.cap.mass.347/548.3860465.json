Copp, widow of Ernest Gr. Copp (the testator), who died April 27, 1960, leaving a will executed September 2,1924. The petition concerns a trust, of which Worcester County National Bank is trustee, created by cl. 1 of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The first paragraph of cl. 1 gave all the testator\u2019s property in trust \u201cto pay the income . . \u00bf to my wife, Helen Gr. Copp, during her life, provided she does not remarry.\u201d Then followed the second and third paragraphs of cl. 1: \u201c [2nd par.] I . . . authorize my . . . trustee . . . to spend from the principal . . . such sum or sums, not to exceed [f]ive [h]undred . . . [d]ollars, as may be necessary or desirable for the - proper support and maintenance of my . . . wife, if the income ... is not sufficient to accomplish the aforesaid purpose. [3d par.] Upon the death of my . . . wife or upon her remarriage, I direct my trustee to pay the income ... to my children, Gilbert E. Copp and Gordon M. Copp in equal shares until they shall reach . . . thirty .... When either of said children shall attain the age of thirty ... I direct my said trustee to transfer . . . to him one-half of the principal . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The trust concerns the sum of $15,000. Each son of the testator is now over thirty. The remainder beneficial interest of Gordon Copp under the third paragraph of el. 1 has been awarded, in a separate suit in equity, to his creditor, the Union Bank of Los Angeles (the Los Angeles bank).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">No evidence was introduced, but the probate judge comments that \u201cdifferent situations were offered in argument by counsel.\u201d The judge stated the foregoing facts in his report of material facts, in which he also ruled that the sum of $500 mentioned in paragraph 2 is not either \u2018 \u2018 a lifetime or [an] annual limit.\u201d He concluded that \u201cthe purpose of the testator was to benefit his wife,\u201d who was \u201chis princi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>pal interest.\u201d A decree was entered directing the trustee to pay to the widow as life beneficia<em>ry </em>sums not exceeding five hundred dollars each, said payments to be made at any given time when it is found to be necessary or desirable for the proper support ... of the life . . . [beneficiary, the widow] when the income from . . . [the] trust is not sufficient to accomplish the purposes of the trust.\u201d The Los Angeles bank appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">1. Paragraph 2 of cl. 1 is ambiguous. We think, as did the probate judge, that the principal interest of the testator in leaving this trust, now $15,000, was the care of his widow.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A power to expend principal was a prudent provision to accomplish this purpose and must be interpreted in a manner consistent with that purpose. We conclude that the testator did not intend to limit the possible expenditure of principal to aggregate payments of $500 during the widow\u2019s entire life, for total payments of $500 would be likely to be inadequate to meet her needs. Such a limitation might thus defeat accomplishment of the testator\u2019s primary objective. In the testamentary language, we perceive no basis for limiting the payments to annual aggregate payments not exceeding $500. The words, <footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2018such sum or sums,\u201d contemplate the possibility of more than one payment. In the absence of more explicit language of limitation, we agree with the probate judge that the trustee is authorized to expend from principal such sum or sums, not exceeding $500 in any one payment, for the support or maintenance of the widow at any time or times when the trustee determines in good faith and reasonably that the income is not sufficient and that the widow\u2019s circumstances are such as to require such a payment for her reasonable support and maintenance. In the exercise of this power, the trustee is to take into account all the relevant circumstances known to it, including the sufficiency or insufficiency of the trust income, the size <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>of the trust estate, the probable diminution of future trust income as a consequence of each such expenditure of principal, the extent of the widow\u2019s then existing need, her probable future needs, her state of health, and her then existing and potential resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The power which is given to the trustee is not unrestricted, for a court of equity may control a trustee in the exercise of a fiduciary discretion if it acts beyond the bounds of a reasonable judgment or unreasonably disregards usual fiduciary principles, or the purposes of the trust, or if it fails to observe standards of judgment apparent from the applicable instrument. See Scott, Trusts (2d ed.) \u00a7 187.2. See also \u00a7\u00a7 187-187.1. See also <em>Edelstein </em>v. <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>336 Mass. 659, 663. Cf. <em>Dumaine </em>v. <em>Dumaine, </em>301 Mass. 214, 223-224. This power, accordingly, is to be exercised after serious and responsible consideration, prudently, and in accordance with fiduciary standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The Los Angeles bank contends that other provisions of the will show that the testator had a generally conservative and restrictive attitude in respect of the administration of the trust, as, for example, in the matter of investments. The brief provisions of the will to which the bank refers are not so clear, so relevant, or so unusual as to afford substantial assistance in interpreting the dispositive provisions of this instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">2. The Los Angeles bank in its answer requests a declaration of the meaning of the will\u2019s provisions for the distribution of the trust corpus upon the widow\u2019s death. The probate judge made no such declaration. It is far from clear to what extent the fourth paragraph of cl. 1 (see fn. 1) affects this distribution. The testator indicates by the fourth paragraph some desire to have the trust fund, in certain events, continue in his direct line for the benefit of his grandchildren. The will contains no spendthrift clause. We conclude from the imprecise language that Gordon Copp, upon attaining the age of thirty, obtained a vested equitable remainder interest in the trust property (see <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Molloy, </em>254 Mass. 398, 399), subject, however, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>be divested in the event of his death before his mother leaving issue living at his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The sentence (fn. 1) beginning,. \u201cIf either of my said children die leaving issue, I desire that his share of said trust continue,\u201d is not in terms limited to Gordon\u2019s death after his mother but before attaining the age of thirty. We construe it as intended to apply in the event of his death leaving issue at any time prior to reaching age thirty, or, in the event of his death leaving issue while the widow is still alive, whether before or after attaining age thirty. See Restatement: Property, \u00a7 269, comment i. We need not now consider what disposition of Gordon Oopp\u2019s equitable remainder interest will be made if before the death of the testator\u2019s widow he dies leaving issue all of whom die before the testator\u2019s widow, or in the event of other contingencies not discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">3. The decree of the Probate Court is to be modified to add a declaration that Gordon Copp now has a vested equitable remainder interest in the trust corpus, subject to the interest of the testator\u2019s widow and subject also to being divested by his death leaving issue prior to the death of the testator\u2019s widow. As so modified the decree is affirmed. The Los Angeles bank is to pay its own costs and expenses in this court and in the Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-8\"> The fourth paragraph of el. 1 reads, \u201cIf either of my said children die before reaching . . . thirty . . . leaving no issue, the trust shall continue for the benefit of the survivor. If either of my said children die leaving issue, I desire that his share of said trust continue for the benefit of my grandchildren until they reach . . . twenty-one at which time their respective share in the trust fund shall be transferred . . . free of all trusts. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b594-6\"> The record contains meager information about the family circumstances. A guardian ad litem\u2019s report states that the testator\u2019s widow \u201cis in very straitened circumstances.\u201d Since both the testator\u2019s children were mentioned by name in the will executed in 1934, we assume that the widow was then at least twenty years old, so that now she is probably over sixty.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
