He immediately started to serve the sentences. More than ten months later the defendant mailed to the clerk of the Superior Court for criminal business a paper entitled \u201cMotion for Reduction of Sentence. Orders Nunc Pro Tunc, Chapter 302, Act of 1957.\u201d This motion was received by the clerk on October 23, 1962, but was not filed by order of court until October 31, 1962. On February 26, 1963, there was a hearing on the motion before a judge of the Superior Court. The only issue was a reduction of sentence; a new trial expressly was not sought both by the terms of the motion and by statements of his counsel made at the hearing. On March 19, 1963, the judge denied the motion, ruling that he had no power to grant it. The defendant duly excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The first sentence of Gr. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29, as amended by St. 1957, c. 302, read, \u201cThe superior court may, at the sitting in which a complaint or indictment is tried, or within one year thereafter, upon motion in writing of the defendant, grant a new trial for any cause for which by law a new trial may be granted, or if it appears to the court that justice has not been or cannot be done, and upon such terms or conditions as the court shall order, <em>and said court may within sixty days after a sentence is imposed, if it appears to the court that justice has not been or cannot be done, and upon such terms or conditions as the court shall order, revise or revoke a sentence imposed without trial after a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, and in the event of revocation permit the withdrawal of the plea upon which the sentence was imposed.\u201d </em>The words in supplied italics were added by the amendment, and by a still later amendment (St. 1962, c. 310, \u00a7 2) were in substance transferred to a new \u00a7 29C.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The motion concededly was not filed within sixty days after sentence. The defendant, however, contends that the words <em>nunc pro tune </em>in the title of the motion coupled with the judge\u2019s order that the motion be filed had the same effect as if it had been so filed. The judge, however, did not by implication allow the motion to be filed as of an unstated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>earlier date within sixty days of sentence. He correctly ruled, in effect, that he had no power thus to extend the time beyond that prescribed in the statute. <em>Diggs </em>v. <em>Diggs, </em>291 Mass. 399, 402-403. <em>Jordan Marsh Co. </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>295 Mass. 210, 213. <em>Hackney </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>339 Mass. 605, 608.
