The Superior Court entered an interlocutory decree taking the bill as confessed against the corporate defendant. A final decree was entered favorable to the plaintiff from which only the assignees appealed. The evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-14\">The trial judge made a report of material facts, which we summarize. On September 1, 1957, the plaintiff and the defendant Angier Chemical Co., Inc. (Angler), entered into an agreement. Under the terms of this agreement, the plaintiff was granted an exclusive license \u201cto manufacture, use and sell the product, use or process covered by United States Letters Patent No. 2,688,585.\u201d The plaintiff agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>to pay royalties to Angier and to purchase Angler\u2019s then existing inventory of the licensed product, and Angier agreed that \u201cif the license granted should be terminated or surrendered . . . [it] would buy back from the . . . [plaintiff], at the same cost, any part of said inventory then remaining in the possession of the . . . [plaintiff].\u201d Pursuant to this agreement, the plaintiff purchased Angier\u2019s inventory. On February 24,1958, Angier assigned \u201call its right, title and interest in said agreement\u201d to the assignees, who accepted the assignment. On January 18, 1960, the plaintiff terminated the agreement, but Angier has refused to repurchase said remaining inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The assignees contend inter alla that the 1958 assignment was an assignment of rights only and not of obligations and that they are not obligated to perform any of Angier\u2019s duties under the licensing agreement. Although there is a paucity of eases in point, it is the law of this Commonwealth that \u201can assignment of what is due or is to become due under a contract is not an assignment of both the duty of performing the contract and receiving payment therefor.\u201d <em>Chapin </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>184 Mass. 184, 186. See <em>Merchants\u2019 Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>131 Mass. 397, 406. This rule is in accord with that of several other jurisdictions. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Beazley, </em>186 Cal. 437, 444. <em>Lunt </em>v. <em>Lorscheider, </em>285 Ill. 589, 593. <em>Peoples Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Geistert, </em>253 Mich. 694, 698. <em>Langel </em>v. <em>Betz, </em>250 N. Y. 159, 164. <em>Bimrose </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>78 Wash. 32, 37-38. <em>Maloyfsky </em>v. <em>Schiraldi, </em>108 N. J. Eq. 190, 192-193, affd. 110 N. J. Eq. 660.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Where, however, \u201cthe contract as a whole is assigned there is no separation between the benefits and burdens.\u201d <em>Chapin </em>v. <em>Pike, supra, </em>p. 186.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See Restatement: Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>tracts, \u00a7 164, which treats the assignment of a whole contract, still partly executory, <em>\u201cin the absence of circumstances showing a contrary intention, </em>as an assignment of the assignor\u2019s rights under the contract and a delegation of the performance of the assignor\u2019s duties\u201d (emphasis supplied). In the present case, whether the assignees impliedly promised to perform the assignor\u2019s duties thereunder is a question of interpretation of the assignment, read in the context of the circumstances. Williston, Contracts (3d ed.) \u00a7 418A, at 104. Corbin, Contracts, \u00a7 906, at 627-629.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">There is nothing in the ambiguous instrument of assignment to indicate that Angier intended the assignees to assume any obligations under the agreement. There is no express assumption by the assignees of obligations under the licensing agreement. It appears to be undisputed that the assignees were Angier\u2019s shareholders and that Angier was heavily indebted to them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nothing in the documentary evidence suggests any novation. See <em>Stowell </em>v. <em>Gram, </em>184 Mass. 562, 564; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>General Cleaning Co. Inc. </em>345 Mass. 62, 64-65. There remained few duties to be performed by Angier under the licensing agreement. In these circumstances, it is particularly dubious that the assignees also assumed duties. The use of the words \u201cright, title and interest\u201d does not necessarily show that the assignment was intended to include obligations. See <em>First Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Loan &amp; Trust Co. </em>123 Mass. 330, 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The licensing agreement itself appears to distinguish between the assignment of rights and the assignment of obligations. We note that paragraph VIII (C) provides: \u201cThis contract ... is binding upon and confers rights upon the parties hereto: upon Angier, its successors and assigns; upon Chatham [the plaintiff], its successors and assigns. Provided, however, that Angier may at any time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>assign all or part of its <em>rights </em>hereunder and further provided that Chatham may not without the written consent of Angier assign any of its <em>rights or obligations </em>under this contract\u201d (emphasis supplied). This provision may not prohibit Angier from assigning its obligations. Cf. <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>345 Mass. 555, 563. Nevertheless, when there is an omission of any provision for one party to assign obligations and in the same sentence there is a provision that in certain circumstances the other party may assign rights or obligations, we conclude that the omission was intentional. <em>\u201cExpressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>is a maxim which applies as forcibly to the exceptions to an obligation as to the enumeration of the objects to which the contract applies.\u201d <em>Higginson </em>v. <em>Weld, </em>14 Gray, 165, 172. <em>Earle </em>v. <em>De Witt, </em>6 Allen, 520, 528. <em>Smiley </em>v. <em>McLauthlin, </em>138 Mass. 363, 364-365. <em>Judkins </em>v. <em>Charette, </em>255 Mass. 76, 82. This provision of the licensing agreement has some tendency to indicate what Angier purported to assign.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">We are constrained to hold that, construing the instruments in the light of those circumstances which are essentially undisputed, the assignees did not assume the obligations under the agreement. Because of the foregoing there is no need to discuss the other issues raised by the assignees.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Accordingly, the final decree is to be modified by dismissing the bill as against the assignees with costs of appeal, and as so modified is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-7\"> Paragraph VIII (O) of the licensing agreement provides, \u201cThis contract shall be construed according to the laws of the State of Hew Jersey . . <em>..\u201d </em>See <em>Maxwell Shapiro Woolen Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Amerotron Corp. </em>339 Mass. 252, 257. The validity and effect of the assignment as between Angier and the assignees is governed by Massachusetts law. See Beale, Conflict of Laws, \u00a7\u00a7 350.1-353.1; Goodrich, Conflict of Laws (3d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 113-114, 495-499. See also Restatement 2d: Conflict of Laws (Tent.
