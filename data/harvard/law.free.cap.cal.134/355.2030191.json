The defendant obtained a verdict and judgment in its favor, and the plaintiff appeals from an order denying his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">The respondent files no brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s most important witness, both as to the extent of the damage suffered and as to the origin of the fire, was his foreman, named Augustus Keyser. The defendant, in the cross-examination of this witness, went into matters altogether outside of the issues on trial. He was asked where he got the money to pay for some land that he had pre-empted in Humboldt County, and if he did not borrow it, and then an inquiry was made, as follows: \u201c Did you not tell Mr. Cody, in December, 1893, near the old W. Whittle mill, on the public road beyond Dougherty\u2019s mill, that you got $250 to prove up some . land for a man, and that you skipped out and left the man in the lurch, and that you sold the land and pocketed the money? \u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">The court permitted this and several other similar questions \u25a0concerning the same matter to go in, against the objection and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>exception of plaintiff, taken on the ground that this was not cross-examination and was immaterial. The witness answered these questions in the negative mainly, but stated that he did not know where he got the money to pay for the land. This witness was also asked, on cross-examination, as follows: \u201cDid n\u2019t you tell Mr. Dougherty that you wanted to ship some of plaintiff\u2019s wood in Dougherty\u2019s name so that plaintiff would not find it out, so that you could get the money that was due you, and that was the only way you could get money out of Steen?\u201d The witness denied this statement also. Again, the witness was asked if he did not tell Cody that he (witness) had stood in with the choppers, and when they cut ten, fifteen, or twenty cords of wood he would report fifteen, twenty, or thirty cords to Steen, and divide with the choppers? The witness, against the objection and exception of appellant, was compelled to answer, and he denied the conversation. Thereafter, Dougherty was called as a witness, and against the objection of appellant that it was irrelevant, \u201c relates to collateral matter, and involves a question of wrongful acts of the witness Keyser toward the plaintiff,\u201d he testified, in substance, that Keyser, in April or May, 1896,\u2014nearly a year after the fire complained of,\u2014asked him (Dougherty) to allow Keyser to ship wood in Dougherty\u2019s name and pay Keyser the money for it, \u201cso that Steen (his employer) would not know it.\u201d Cody was also called as a witness by respondent, and testified that he had a conversation with Keyser in May, 1894, in which Keyser said, \u201c When the choppers cut ten or fifteen cords of wood, I report the amount to Steen at twenty-five or thirty cords, and divide the profits with the choppers,\u201d and that Keyser turned around and pointed to where a clump of oaks had formerly stood, and said, \u201c Those trees made me eight or ten cords of wood, and I turned them into Steen for twenty-five-cords, and I and the choppers divided.\u201d This was also duly objected to, and exception taken to the action of the court in admitting it. It is obvious that all this must have seriously affected the credibility of the witness Keyser in the eyes of' the jury. It is equally obvious that the rulings of the court-in connection with the matter were in plain violation of section 2051 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which forbids the-impeachment of a witness \u201cby evidence of particular wrongful acts.\u201d It cannot be said that any of the alleged statements of the witness, concerning which inquiry was made, was \u201c incon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>sistent with his present testimony,\u201d within the meaning of section 2052 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The statements of the witness must be pertinent to the issues on trial, or they cannot be contradicted. The questions at issue were the origin of the fires of July 25 and 26, 1894, and the amount of wood and other property destroyed at that time. The statements put in evidence, had no connection with these questions, nor were they contradictory of anything that the witness had testified to in his examination in chief, and therefore the questions concerning them should have been excluded. <em>(Faulkner </em>v. <em>Rondoni, </em>104 Cal. 140.)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">For the foregoing reasons we advise that the order appealed from be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Smith, C., and Chipman, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the order appealed from is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">McFarland, J., Temple, J., Henshaw, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
