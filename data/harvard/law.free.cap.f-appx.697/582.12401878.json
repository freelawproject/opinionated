Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b616-23\">On April 18, 2017, the Smiths submitted a pro se document to the district court titled \u201cComplaint Amended Declaratory Judgment and Mandatory Injunction End<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>ing the conflict between the Lex Loci and the Lex Pori and Merging them together for a Remedy in Law.\u201d The district court entered an order directing the Smiths to pay the filing fee or submit a motion to proceed in forma pauperis, and to submit a pleading on the court-approved complaint form. Despite the order\u2019s warning that failure to cure these deficiencies within thirty days would result in dismissal of the complaint, the Smiths failed to do so. The coui\u2019t thus dismissed the action without prejudice pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b) for failure to comply with the order and for failure to prosecute. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">A district court may sua sponte dismiss an action for \u201cfailure] ... to comply with ... a court order.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b); see Olsen v. Mapes, 333 F.3d 1199, 1204 n.3 (10th Cir. 2003). We review a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to comply with a court order for abuse of discretion. See Cosby v. Meadors, 351 F.3d 1324, 1326 (10th Cir. 2003). Although a district court must consider certain criteria before dismissing an action with prejudice for failing to comply with an order, it may dismiss without prejudice \u201cwithout attention to any particular procedures.\u201d Nasious v. Two Unknown B.I.C.E. Agents, 492 F.3d 1158, 1162 (10th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">We conclude the district court appropriately exercised its discretion. It gave the Smiths an adequate opportunity to comply with its order and provided them with specific instructions. Although the Smiths filed a document within the thirty-day window provided by the district court, it was largely nonsensical and failed to address the specific deficiencies identified. The Smiths filed a document titled \u201cSupreme Court Review; 28 USC 1291,\u201d which appears to be a mock Supreme Court order signed by both plaintiffs in which they represent themselves as \u201cHolding office in and for the Country of the said United States.\u201d As the district court noted, impersonation of a federal officer may violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 912 and could be subject to criminal penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">On appeal, the Smiths similarly submitted a document titled \u201cSupreme Court amended Declaratory Judgment and Mandatory Injunction\u201d in which they identify themselves as \u201cHolding office in and for the Country of the said United States.\u201d This filing fails to advance any coherent argument with respect to the district court\u2019s ruling. Although \u201c[a] pro se litigant\u2019s pleadings are to be construed liberally and held to a less stringent standard than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers,\u201d we cannot \u201cassume the role of advocate for the pro se litigant.\u201d Hall v. Bellmon, 935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir. 1991). Because the Smiths\u2019 filing \u201ccontain[s] no argument of substance,\u201d they have forfeited their right to review. Garrett v. Selby Connor Maddux &amp; Janer, 425 F.3d 836, 840 (10th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">AFFIRMED. Because the Smiths have failed to advance \u201ca reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised on appeal,\u201d DeBardeleben v. Quinlan, 937 F.2d 502, 505 (10th Cir. 1991), we DENY their motion to proceed in forma pauperis. We remind the Smiths of their obligation to pay the filing fee in fuh.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b616-7\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to honor the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. Sec Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel, It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
