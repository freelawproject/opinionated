Fed. R. App. P. 35. Appel-lee\u2019s petition for panel rehearing and petition for rehearing en banc are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-19\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-20\">The United States appeals from the district court\u2019s order reducing the prison sentence of defendant-appellee Jimmy Lee Thornton pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We ordered supplemental briefing regarding whether our en banc opinion in <em>United States v. Davis, </em>825 F.3d 1014 (9th Cir. 2016), affected Thornton\u2019s case. We conclude that Thornton is ineligible for a sentence reduction even in light of <em>Davis, </em>and so reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-21\">A defendant is generally eligible- for a sentence reduction when he or she is sentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range [under the United States Sentencing Guidelines] that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The parties agree that Thornton faced a mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, that the calculated Guidelines range in Thornton\u2019s case was initially 46 to 57 months, and that subsequent amendments to the Guidelines would have lowered the calculated range to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>30-37 months. The parties dispute only whether Thornton\u2019s sentence was actually \u201cbased on\u201d the calculated range.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\"><em>Davis </em>adopted the reasoning of Justice Kennedy\u2019s plurality opinion in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. 522, 534, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), concluding that even when a sentence is determined by a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) agreement, that sentence is \u201clikely\u201d based on the Guidelines. <em>Davis </em>held that \u201ca defendant should be eligible for a sentence reduction when <em>one </em>factor in a defendant\u2019s sentence was a \u2018since-rejected Guideline.\u2019\u201d 825 F.3d at 1027 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Freeman, </em>564 U.S. at 530, 131 S.Ct. 2685).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Thornton\u2019s plea agreement expressly stated that his sentence \u201cshould be calculated pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines,\u201d and recognized that a \u201csentence of imprisonment within the Guidelines range set forth [in the agreement]\u201d was reasonable. We therefore conclude that the calculated Guidelines range was a factor in Thornton\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">Thornton is nevertheless ineligible for a sentence reduction because the mandatory minimum sentence applicable to him displaced the calculated Guidelines range. Although the government concedes that it did not raise this argument before the district court, we have held that eligibility for a sentencing reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is a jurisdictional question. <em>United States v. Spears, </em>824 F.3d 908, 916 (9th Cir. 2016). We are therefore required to consider the question regardless of whether the parties raised it below.</p>\n<p id=\"Adr\">The Guidelines state that \u201c[w]here a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence <em>shall be </em>the guideline sentence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(b) (emphasis added). The policy statement applicable at the time of Thornton\u2019s 2010 sentencing provides that a reduction is not appropriate when a mandatory minimum displaces a Guidelines range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (requiring that any reduction be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d). The relevant policy statement instructed that \u201ca reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and is not consistent with this policy statement if ... an amendment ... does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision <em>(e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a) cmt. n.1 (emphasis added). Here, although Thornton\u2019s Guidelines range would normally have been 46 to 57 months, his 60-month mandatory minimum sentence displaced that range. Thornton is thus ineligible for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">The circuits that have addressed this question have likewise concluded that where a mandatory minimum is higher than a calculated Guidelines range, and is binding on the district court, the mandatory minimum becomes the Guidelines sentence, and the defendant is ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c) relief. The Ninth Circuit also has so held, albeit in cases decided before <em>Freeman </em>and <em>Davis. See United States v. Jackson, </em>577 F.3d 1032, 1035-36 (9th Cir. 2009) and <em>United States v. Mullanix, </em>99 F.3d 323, 324 (9th Cir. 1996); <em>see also United States v. Joiner, </em>727 F.3d 601, 606-08 (6th Cir. 2013); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>697 F.3d 443, 444 (7th Cir. 2012); <em>United States v. McClain, </em>691 F.3d 774, 777-80 (6th Cir. 2012); <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206-07 (11th Cir. 2012); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>551 F.3d 182, 185 (2d Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>We hold that Thornton was ineligible for a sentence reduction because of the applicability of a statutory minimum in excess of his calculated Guidelines range. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order granting Thornton\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence is REVERSED, and the reduced sentence is VACATED. We remand to the district court; on remand, the district court is to reinstate the original sentence of 96 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b932-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
