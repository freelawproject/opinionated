Phillips Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b625-23\">In 2010, while represented by appointed counsel, Francisco Lubio pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute over 60 grams of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), and (b)(1)(A). In a plea agreement, Lubio admitted that he possessed 330.9 grams of actual methamphetamine. Based on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>amount, the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) calculated a base offense level of 34. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(3) (U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n 2009). The PSR then subtracted three offense levels to account for Lubio\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, which resulted in a total offense level of 31. When combined with Lubio\u2019s criminal-history category of I, this total offense level produced an advisory guideline range of 108 to 135 months. But, because Lubio\u2019s offense involved at least 50 grams of methamphetamine, the PSR also noted that Lubio\u2019s conviction triggered a statutory mandatory-minimum sentence of 10 years under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Under this circumstance, Lubio\u2019s guideline range became 120 to 135 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">After receiving no objections from the parties, the district court adopted the PSR in full and imposed the mandatory-minimum sentence of 10 years, plus five years of supervised released and a $100 monetary assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In 2016, Lubio filed a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), seeking to reduce his sentence based on the U.S. Sentencing Commission\u2019s Amendment 782, which lowered the base offense level from 34 to 32 for offenses involving 330.9 grams of actual methamphetamine. But the district court dismissed Lubio\u2019s motion for lack of jurisdiction, concluding that, because of the 10-year statutory mandatory minimum, Lu-bio\u2019s advisory guideline range had not been lowered. Lubio now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">We review \u201cde novo the scope of a district court\u2019s authority to resentence a defendant in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Gay, </em>771 F.3d 681, 685 (10th Cir. 2014). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), \u201ca district court is authorized to reduce a sentence ... <em>only if </em>the defendant was originally \u2018sentenced to a term of imprisonment <em>based on a sentencing range </em>that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>765 F.3d 1240, 1246 (10th Cir. 2014) (quoting \u00a7 3582(c)(2)). But when a district court sentences a defendant to a statutory mandatory-minimum sentence, it bases the defendant\u2019s sentence on the mandatory minimum rather than \u201ca sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered,\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2), making the defendant \u201cineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2),\u201d <em>United States v. Munoz, </em>682 Fed.Appx. 635, 636 (10th Cir. 2017) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">Here, the district court sentenced Lubio to a statutory mandatory-minimum sentence of 10 years, and Amendment 782 does not lower his sentencing range in that circumstance. So Lubio is ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Therefore, the district court properly dismissed Lubio\u2019s motion for lack of jurisdiction, and we AFFIRM.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b625-8\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to honor the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\">. Based on Lubio\u2019s financial inability to pay, the district court granted Lubio\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d) </em>on appeal. Order, May 24, 2017, ECF No. 70. We do not reevaluate that decision. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 24(a)(2) (providing that a party may proceed <em>IFP </em>on appeal where the district court has granted leave to do so).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
