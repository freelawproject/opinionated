See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. Cir. Rule 34\u00ae. Upon consideration of the briefs filed by the parties; appellee\u2019s motion for leave to file supplemental appendix; appellant\u2019s motion for leave to file supplemental appendix and the response thereto; appel-lee\u2019s motion for leave to file surreply and the response thereto; appellant\u2019s motion for leave to file surreply; the motion for leave to file opposition to appellee\u2019s surre-ply, which is construed as a motion for leave to file surreply; the motion to reject appellee\u2019s brief and appendix, which is construed as a motion to strike, and the response thereto; and the lodged surreplies and supplemental appendices, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b42-20\">ORDERED that the motions for leave to file surreplies be granted. The Clerk is directed to file the lodged surreplies. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b42-21\">FURTHER ORDERED that appellee\u2019s motion for leave to file a supplemental appendix be granted. See D.C. Cir. Rules 24(b), 30(e). The Clerk is directed to file appellee\u2019s lodged supplemental appendix. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b42-22\">FURTHER ORDERED that appellant\u2019s motion for leave to file a supplemental appendix be denied. The materials related to appellant\u2019s professional credentials were not part of the district court record and are not properly included in the appendix. See Fed. R. App. P. 30(a). Inclusion of the remaining documents is unnecessary because they are already either included in appellee\u2019s supplemental appendix or attached to appellant\u2019s motion to strike. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>FURTHER ORDERED that the motion to strike be denied. See Stabilisier-ungsfonds fur Wein v. Kaiser Stuhl Wine Distribs. Pty. Ltd., 647 F.2d 200, 201 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (per curiam). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s orders filed July 15, 2016 and July 26, 2016 be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The district court correctly held that appellant\u2019s claims of conspiracy to breach a contract and civil conspiracy failed to state a claim because he offered only \u201ccon-clusory allegation[s]\u201d that did not provide \u201cplausible grounds to infer an agreement.\u201d Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 557, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). The district court also properly dismissed appellant\u2019s discrimination claim because it was supported by \u201cno more than [legal] conclusions, ... not entitled to the assumption of truth.\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). Appellant does not challenge on appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claim of conspiracy to engage in unconscionable contract. See U.S. ex rel. Totten v. Bombardier Corp., 380 F.3d 488, 497 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (argument not made on appeal is deemed waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Finally, appellant has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for reconsideration. See Firestone v. Firestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C. Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. See Fed. R. App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
