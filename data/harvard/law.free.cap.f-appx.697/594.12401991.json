He was sentenced to 97 months of imprisonment, which was at the low end of the sentencing guidelines range. Although the plea agreement contained an appeal waiver, Contreras appealed. The government moves to enforce the appeal waiver under United States v. Hahn, 359 F.3d 1315, 1328 (10th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (per curiam).</p> <p id=\"b628-22\" pgmap=\"628(20) 629(52)\">Under Hahn, we consider \u201c(1) whether the disputed appeal falls within the scope of the waiver of appellate rights; (2) whether the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights; and (3) whether enforcing the waiver would result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d Id. at 1325. We need not address a Hahn factor that the appellant does not contest. See United States v. Porter, 405 F.3d 1136, 1143 (10th Cir. 2005).</p> <p id=\"b629-5\" pgmap=\"629\">In his response to the government\u2019s motion, Contreras, through counsel, informs the court that he does not oppose the motion. Further, he has not contested any of the Hahn factors. Accordingly, the motion to enforce is granted, and this matter is terminated.</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b628-6\" pgmap=\"628\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
