Moritz, Circuit Judge</author> <p id=\"b637-21\" pgmap=\"637\">Cedric Greene brought suit against Logisticare Solutions, Inc., alleging negligent infliction of emotional distress. On July 18, 2016, the district court dismissed Greene\u2019s complaint sua sponte for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Greene then filed a notice of appeail on April 14, 2017. We abated Greene\u2019s appeal and remanded the case to the district court with directions to treat the notice of appeal as a motion to reopen time to file an appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6). The district court denied Greene\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely. Accordingly, we dismissed Greene\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Greene then filed a second Rule 4(a)(6) motion to reopen, which the district court also denied. Greene now timely appeals that decision.</p> <p id=\"b637-22\" pgmap=\"637\">We generally review a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 4(a)(6) motion for abuse of discretion. Ogden v. San Juan Cty., 32 F.3d 452, 455 (10th Cir. 1994). But Greene makes no effort to explain whether\u2014let alone how\u2014the district court abused its discretion in denying his second Rule 4(a)(6) motion. Thus, we affirm. See Nixon v. City and Cty. of Denver, 784 F.3d 1364, 1366 (10th Cir. 2015) (\u201c[T]he first task of an appellant is to explain to us why the district court\u2019s decision was wrong.\u201d); Johnson v. Johnson, 466 F.3d 1213, 1215 (10th Cir. 2006) (affirming ruling that went unchallenged on appeal).</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b637-18\" pgmap=\"637\"> After examining Greene\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument wouldn\u2019t materially assist in the determination of this appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment isn\u2019t binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. But it may be cited for its persuasive value. See Fed. R. App. P. 32.1; 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
