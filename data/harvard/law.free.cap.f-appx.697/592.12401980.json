Miles, Jr., acting pro se, appeals the dismissal of his claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 by the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. The district court held that it was clear from the face of Plaintiff\u2019s complaint that he did not exhaust his administrative remedies, as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-15\">\u201c[Fjailure to exhaust is ... an affirmative defense rather than a pleading requirement.\u201d <em>Aquilar-Avellaveda v. Terrell, </em>478 F.3d 1223, 1225 (10th Cir. 2007). Therefore, the district court may <em>sua sponte </em>raise the question of failure to exhaust only when the \u201ccomplaint [makes] it clear through ... affirmative statements that [the plaintiff] ha[s] not exhausted his administrative remedies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have cautioned against such <em>sua sponte </em>dismissals because \u201cdetermining] whether an inmate has exhausted his administrative remedies requires an understanding of the remedies available and thus likely would require information from the defendant as well as the inmate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1225-26 (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, \u201ccourts '... are obligated to ensure that any defects in exhaustion were not procured from the action or inaction of prison officials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1225.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-18\">Plaintiff, a pretrial detainee in the Reno County Jail in Hutchinson, Kansas, filed his first pro se \u00a7 1983 complaint on July 13, 2016, against a sergeant and three deputies in the .jail, alleging that they failed to protect him from an assault by his cellmate and then failed to offer medical treatment. The complaint asserts that Plaintiff filed a grievance but was told the matter was not a grievable issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-19\">The district court sent Plaintiff a notice of deficiency, requiring that he file his complaint on the proper form. He did so on July 29, 2016. The new complaint repeats the essentials of his original claim, but with much less detail. On the portion of the form that states, \u201cI have previously sought informal or formal relief from the appropriate administrative officials regarding the acts complained of,\u201d Plaintiff did not check either the \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d box, and lines for further explanation were left blank. Aplt. App. Vol. 1 at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-20\">The district court did not explain why it found the Plaintiff\u2019s complaint to be facially deficient with regard to exhaustion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>administrative relief. We assume that in looking at the second complaint the court found the blank administrative-relief section to be sufficient for a dismissal under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). But that silence in the complaint does not suffice. <em>See Aquilar-Avellaveda, </em>478 F.3d at 1225 (\u201cBecause [the plaintiffs] complaint was silent as to whether he had exhausted his administrative remedies\u2014which is acceptable under [Supreme Court authority]\u2014 the district court erred in requesting [the plaintiff] to supplement the record on that issue.\u201d). Moreover, Plaintiffs original complaint specifically alleges the filing of a grievance, denial of the grievance, and dismissive responses from the defendants. It appears from the omission of detail concerning his claim in the new complaint that Plaintiff thought his original complaint was still to be considered by the court. Because \u201cwe must construe a pro se appellant\u2019s complaint liberally,\u201d <em>Kay v. Bemis, </em>500 F.3d 1214, 1218 (10th Cir. 2007), we are particularly reluctant to agree that Plaintiff has conceded that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. Thus, his complaint did not warrant <em>ma sponte </em>dismissal under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">We REVERSE the district court\u2019s dismissal and GRANT Plaintiffs motion to proceed <em>informa pauperis.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b627-16\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
