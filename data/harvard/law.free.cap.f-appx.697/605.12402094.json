Lucero, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b639-22\">William Freeman seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to appeal the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. His counsel moves for leave to withdraw in a brief filed pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). We deny Freeman\u2019s request for a COA, grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-23\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b639-24\">In 2011, Freeman was convicted of bank robbery in federal court. The district court concluded his total offense level was 32 and his criminal history category was VI because Freeman qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Freeman\u2019s advisory Guidelines range was 210 to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court imposed a sentence of 210 months. We affirmed on direct appeal. United States v. Freeman, 451 Fed.Appx. 783, 785 (10th Cir. 2011) (unpublished). Freeman\u2019s initial \u00a7 2255 motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-25\">Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Johnson v. United States, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>135 S.Ct. 2551, 2563, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we granted Freeman permission to file a second habeas motion. The district court abated proceedings pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Beckles v. United States, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 137 S.Ct. 886, 197 L.Ed.2d 145 (2017). After the Court decided Beckles, which held that the Guidelines are not subject to vagueness challenges, id. at 890, the district court denied Freeman\u2019s motion. Freeman filed a timely notice of appeal,</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">A prisoner may not appeal the denial of habeas relief under \u00a7 2255 without a COA. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). We will issue a COA \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d \u00a7 2253(c)(2). This standard requires Freeman to show \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Freeman\u2019s counsel has submitted an An-ders brief. Under Anders, if an attorney concludes after conscientiously examining a case that any appeal would be frivolous, he may so advise the court and request permission to withdraw. 386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. In conjunction with such a request, counsel must submit a brief highlighting any potentially appealable issues and provide a copy to the defendant. |d. The defendant may then submit a pro se brief. Id. If the court determines that the appeal is frivolous upon careful examina-fi\u00f3n of the record, it may grant the request to withdraw and dismiss the appeal. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">We agree with counsel that any appeal of the district court\u2019s order would be frivolous. This court authorized Freeman to file a claim under Johnson. But a Johnson claim challenging a sentence imposed under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, including Freeman\u2019s sentence, is squarely foreclosed by Beckles. See 137 S.Ct. at 892 (\u201c[T]he Guidelines are not subject to a vagueness challenge under the Due Process Clause. The residual clause in \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) therefore is not void for vagueness.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-13\">In his pro se brief, Freeman challenges the district court\u2019s decision to abate his motion pending a ruling in Beckles. \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion to stay proceedings for abuse of discretion.\u201d Creative Consumer Concepts, Inc. v. Kreisler, 563 F.3d 1070, 1080 (10th Cir. 2009). The district court noted in its abatement order that it anticipated the Supreme Court would issue an opinion in Beckles before the expiration of any reduced sentence it might impose. That prediction proved correct. Had Freeman not been classified as a career offender, his total offense level would have been 27 and his criminal history category would have been IV, yielding an advisory Guidelines range of 100 to 125 months. U.S.S.G. Ch. 5 Pt. A (Sentencing Table) (2010). A sentence at the bottom of that range would not have been completed prior to issuance of the Beckles opinion. Under these circumstances, reasonable jurists could not debate the propriety of the abatement order.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-14\">Finally, our independent review of the record has not uncovered any other poten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>tially meritorious issues.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we DENY Freeman\u2019s request for a COA, GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b639-16\">This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-8\">. In Welch v. United States, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 1257, 1265, 194 L.Ed.2d 387 (2016), the Court held that Johnson announced a substantive rule that applied retroactively on collateral review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b641-19\">. Freeman has also filed a motion to amend his pro se response to add arguments regarding the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Because we did not authorize Freeman to pursue such claims in his second habeas motion, any such amendment would be futile. We accordingly DENY his motion to amend.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
