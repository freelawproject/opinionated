The court also denied Bird\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, stating that Bird failed to assert a reasoned, non-frivolous argument on appeal and that his appeal would not be taken in good faith. We deny a COA and Bird\u2019s renewed motion to proceed IFP on appeal and dismiss this matter.</p> <p id=\"b648-3\" pgmap=\"648\">To be entitled to a COA, Bird must show \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right, and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 478, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p> <p id=\"b648-4\" pgmap=\"648\">In its order, the court noted that Bird\u2019s most recent habeas application was nearly identical to the one he filed in February 2017, and therefore second or successive. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(1) (\u201cA claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed.\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b648-5\" pgmap=\"648\">\u201cA district court does not have jurisdiction to address the merits of a second or successive ... \u00a7 2254 claim until this court has granted the required authorization.\u201d In re Cline, 531 F.3d 1249, 1251 (10th Cir. 2008) (per curiam). Bird\u2019s application for a COA does not address the district court\u2019s conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction because the application was successive and filed without this court\u2019s authorization, and we discern no basis for concluding that jurists of reason would find the correctness of the district court\u2019s procedural ruling debatable.</p> <p id=\"b648-7\" pgmap=\"648\">Further, because Bird has not presented \u201ca reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised on appeal,\u201d McIntosh v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, 115 F.3d 809, 812 (10th Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted), we deny leave to proceed IFP.</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b647-7\" pgmap=\"647\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
