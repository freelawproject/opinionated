He has a \u201c voting residence \u201d in Brooklyn, as distinguished from the place where he actually dwells. It has been held that the word \u201c resided \u201d means a permanent residence, one\u2019s home, as distinguished from a mere stopping place for the transaction of either business or pleasure; that it is nearly or quite synonymous with the word \u201c domicile,\u201d the permanent home and the place to which, whenever absent, one intends to return, and that one\u2019s permanent residence is not affected by his interests, official position or temporary sojourn in any other place. <em>(Washington </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>103 App. Div. 423; <em>Mills &amp; Gibb </em>v. <em>Starin, </em>119 id. 336.
