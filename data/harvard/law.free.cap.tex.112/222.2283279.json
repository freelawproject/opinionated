Turner, 176 Mass., 9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-9\">The Act of the 35th Legislature amending Article 7491 says that the Comptroller shall \u201cappoint and contract with some suitable person or persons,\u201d etc. No authority is given to make a contract for any fixed or certain time. An office or position had been created by the Legislature and the Act creating the \u25a0 office or position had made it the duty of the Comptroller to act as the agent of the State and to appoint some suitable person or persons to the office or position so created. \u201cA State may enter into a contract through its agent but the limits of his power must be strictly observed.\u201d 1 Elliott on Contracts, 452, and authorities there cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>The fifth paragraph of the contract of January 21, 1919, provides that the appointees of the Comptroller may \u201csub-contract with competent persons throughout the State\u201d to do any and everything that the appointees themselves could do. This paragraph invalidates the contract, for the Comptroller had no authority to make such a contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-3\">It is our contention that Mr. Sinith and his associates are entitled to their commission on all Inheritance Taxes collected where they had rendered the services contemplated by the statute from the date of the contract and up to the 18tbi day of June, 1919 (the date the Act of the 36th Legislature became effective), and on all taxes collected after the 18th day of June, 1919, when th\u00e9 services contemplated by the statute had been rendered prior to the 18th day of June, but that they ar\u00e9 not entitled to any commission if the services were rendered after the 18th day of June, 1919. After the 18th day of June, 1919, it became the duty of the county attorneys to do those things previously required of the appointees of the Comptroller.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-4\">It is well settled that a public officer does not have such a vested right in a public office as will prevent the Legislature from abolishing an office created by the Legislature. Carver v. Wheeler County, 200 S. W., 537; Jones v. Shaw, 15 Texas, 577; Beaman v. United States, 19 Ct. Cl., 5; Miller v. Kister, 68 Cal., 142, State v. Covington, 29 Ohio State, 102; Lloyd v. Smith, 176 Pa., 213; State v. McDaniel, 19 S. C., 114; Topping v. Houston, 94 Neb., 495; Childs v. State, 4 Okla. Cr. Rep., 474.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-5\">We think that Mr. Smith and his associates were public officers, but if we are mistaken in this, they clearly held a public position, created by the Legislature, and the rule of law allowing the Legislature to abolish a public office and thereby cause the salary or commission accruing to the person holding the office, to cease, is applicable to the position of employment held by Mr. Smith and his associates, if it be held to be an employment and not an office. Maud v. Terrell, 109 Texas, 97, 200 S. W., 378; Hall v. State, 39 Wis., 74.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-6\">Even if the 35th Legislature intended for the Comptroller to make such a contract as he attempted to make and intended it to have the effect that relator says it has, the contract is void, because contrary' to sound public policy. Each Legislature miist be free and untrammelled in the exercise of its power under the limitations placed on it by the Constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-7\">The State is not as an individual or corporation in the employment of officers and. employees; individuals or corporations can make a contract of employment that is enforceable, and that cannot be abrogated by the abolishment of the office or position. Not so, the State. The reason for the distinction is one of sound public policy. Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim., 7th Ed., 833.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b262-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Mr. Justice PIERSON</author>\n<p id=\"ACd\">delivered the opinion of the- court.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\">Article 7491, R. S. 1911, as amended by the 35th Legislature, conferred authority upon the Comptroller of Public Accounts and made it his duty \u201cto appoint and contract with some suitable person or persons whose duty it shall be to look specially after, sue for and collect the taxes\u201d (inheritances taxes) provided for by Chapter 166, fixing the maximum compensation to be received by such person or persons at 10% of the amount of taxes collected and providing that the compensation due should be paid to such person bjr the Collector of Taxes out of taxes collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Under authority of this enactment, on the 21st day of January 1919 the Comptroller entered into a written contract with Jno. T. Smith, Wm. Woodall and M. M. McFarland to do and perform the services provided for in said act. Said contract provided for the maximum compensation and was to continue in force and effect until January 1, 1921, a period of approximately two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The 36th Legislature amended' said Article 7491 as amended by the 35th Legislature, substituting for and leaving, out all the provisions under which the aforesaid contract was made. This article so amended became effective June 18, 1919.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">On October 17, 1919, through the efforts of Smith and associates a certain collection of such inheritance taxes was made in Grayson County. Out of the taxes collected relator paid them the 10% commission provided in their contract, but, on the advice of the Attorney General, the Comptroller refused to credit relator\u2019s account, with the amount so paid. Relator\u2019s right to a mandamus to require respondent to enter such credit depends upon the validity of the contract between Smith and associates and the Comptroller on October 17, 1919, the date of the collection of the taxes. Respondent\u2019s chief' contention is-that the 36th Legislature repealed Article 7491 as amended by the 35th Legislature and that' the contract by and between Smith and associates and the Comptroller fell with it; that said Article as amended by the 35th Legislature and- the contract under it created a public office and that the Legislature had the authority and that it did abrogate and discontinue same.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">First, however, we1 notice three other issues-raised by respondent. He presents that relator, the Tax Collector, was not a party to the contract and has no such interest as to entitle him to maintain this suit; that he cannot plead the nullity of a law impairing the obligations of this contract; that his rights are only incidentally affected by the law impairing its obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">If the contract with Smith and associates was still operative and valid, then it was the duty of relator to pay over to them the commission due them under it, as provided in the law under which the contract was executed. It would follow, having performed this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>duty, that he would be entitled to have such amount credited to him by the Comptroller. He would have the same right to bring and prosecute this suit to require the Comptroller to credit him on his account as he would have to defend against a suit by the State against Mm and his bondsmen for said amount and to show that he had paid same to Smith and associates under authority of said contract and the law authorizing it and to maintain that said payment was legal in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Respondent insists that the article of the statute under which the contract was made did not authorize a contract for any fixed or definite period of time, and therefore the Contract was without authority and unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">It would be unreasonable to hold that the Legislature authorized and instructed the Comptroller to make a contract with some suitable person or persons who would render diligent aid in the collection of inheritance taxes and perform services, that would entail much outlay of \u2022 time, energy and expense and yet limit same to a contract at will. No suitable person or persons would be willing to enter into such a contract. It must be implied that the authority given included the making of a contract for a given or definite period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Neither do we think respondent\u2019s proposition that the provision in said contract that Smith and associates may \u201csub-contract with competent persons throughout the State\u201d invalidates the contract. That paragraph of the contract is not material here. Even if that paragraph should be held to have exceeded the authority given by the statute yet the contract otherwise would not be rendered nugatory and void thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">The contract entered into between the Comptroller and Smith and associates, under the authority of Article 7491 as amended by the 35th Legislature did not create a public office, but was a contract which is protected by Section 16. Article 1, of the Constitution of Texas which provides that no \u201claw impairing the obligation of contracts shall be made\u201d and also by Section 10, Article 1, of the Constitution of the United States. Morris v. State, 62 Texas, 743; Hall v. Wisconsin, 103 U. S., 5; United States v. Hartwell, 6 Wallace, 385: New Orleans Gas. Co. v. Louisiana Light Co., 115 U. S., 650 ;Long Island Water Supply Co. v. Brooklyn, 166 U. S., 685; The Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheaton, 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">We think there can be no doubt that the 36th Legislature did repeal Article 7491 as amended by the 35th Legislature by substituting for it in its entirety. It was competent for the Legislature to repeal or so amend Article 7491 as to change the plan for collecting inheritance taxes and to withdraw the authority for other contracts under its provisions. This it did, but in doing so it did not and could not affect or terminate prior contracts legally entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>into under said authority. There is nothing in the Article as amended by the 36th Legislature which manifests an intent to affect or avoid prior contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\">Article 7491 as amended by the 35th Legislature directed and made it the duty of the Comptroller to \u201ccontract with some suitable person\u201d and provided the duties to be performed by the person \u201cso contracted with\u201d limiting the compensation to be fixed by said contract to a commission of not to exceed 10% and provided how it should be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">It is true that the statute made it the duty of the Comptroller to \u201cappoint and contract\u201d, and refers to the appointee of the Comptroller, yet the effect of the statute was to authorize and direct the Comptroller to \u201ccontract with some suitable person\u201d to be selected by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The Supreme Court of the United States in the case of U. S. v. Hartwell, supra, in distinguishing between a government office and a government contract said:</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u201cAn office is a public station, or employment, conferred by the, appointment of government. The term embraces the ideas of tenure, duration, emolument, and duties. ... A government office is different from a government contract. The latter from its nature is necessarily limited in its duration and specific in its objects. The terms agreed upon define the rights and obligations of both parties, and neither may depart from them without the assent of the other. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The contract of Smith and associates with the State was specific in its objects and limited in duration, the duration being a matter of agreement in the making of the contract, the duties were defined and neither could withdraw therefrom without the consent of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Could it be maintained that Smith and associates could resign from their contract as from an office and withdraw from their obligtions thereunder and have their $10,000 bond cancelled at their will? We think not. Their Bond and their contract were for the performance of their obligations for the term of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">The able attorneys for respondent insist that to hold that the Legislature could not repeal the law so as to terminate this and similar contracts would be against public \u25a0 policy and disastrous to the public good. The State, like individuals, especially when entering into private contracts, must first well consider what contracts it will enter into or authorize with the view of having them performed according to their terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">When the State becomes a party to a contract with a citizen, the same law applies to it as under like conditions governs the contracts of individuals. Anderson v. Robison, 238 S. W., 883 and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">The writ of mandamus is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">Chief Justice Cureton took no part in the decision of this ease.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
