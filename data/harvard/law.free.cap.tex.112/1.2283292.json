Therefore the Constitution, in declaring (Art. 8, Sec. 11) that property shall be taxed where situated has done no more than to declare the Common Law rule. It did not define the words \u201cwhere situated\u201d and meant thereby where situated for the purposes of taxation under the general principles of the Common Law as then understood, (pp. 9, 10).</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b37-12\">4. \u2014Taxation\u2014Jurisdiction.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b37-13\">Taxes can only be imposed upon persons resident or property situated within, or business carried on, acts performed, or privileges enjoyed within the limits of the sovereignty imposing them.

But this rule has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>so far abrogated that certain classes of visible and tangible personal property, as well as intangible property having similar characteristics (money, state and municipal bonds, circulating bank notes, or shares of stock in private corporations) may have, or be given by legislation, a <em>situs </em>for taxation where they are permanently kept, apart from the domicile of the owner, (pp. 11, 12).</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b38-5\">6. \u2014Same.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b38-6\">So, also, securities may have a business <em>situs </em>at which they may be taxed, apart from the domicile of the owner.

Where there is no expression of a legislative intention to fix a local <em>situs </em>for such purpose the maxim that personal property follows the domicile of the owner governs, and the mere fact that promissory notes are actually kept in a State other than the residence of the owner, if not used in connection with some business there, gives them no <em>situs </em>in such State for the purposes of taxation, (p. 12).</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b38-7\">7. \u2014Same\u2014Constitution.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b38-8\">These rules constituted the general body of the Common Law relative to the taxable <em>situs </em>of property when the Constitution was adopted, and it was with reference to these fundamental principles that the Constitution, in. its declaration that all property should be taxed in the county where situated is to be construed, (p. 13).</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b38-9\">8. \u2014Same\u2014Legislative Construction.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b38-10\">The legislation of the State subsequent to the adoption of the constitutional provision as to the <em>situs </em>of property for taxation shows that same was interpreted by the legislature with reference to the established principles of the Common Law upon that subject (Acts of Aug. 21. 1876, Laws, 15th Leg., pp. 265-281, 8 Gammel\u2019s Laws, pp. 1101-lill; Rev.

Black, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-6\">The requirement of the Constitution that property shall be taxed in the county \u201cwhere situated\u201d did not prevent the Legislature from passing this law, requiring that these intangible securities deposited with a public officer to subserve a special purpose, and whose control over the same was expressly limited by law, should be taxed at the Home Office of the depositing company, which company, under the law, reserved general control over the securities and the right to withdraw them, at any time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-7\">The requirement of the Constitution that property shall be taxed in the county where situated does not prevent the Legislature from defining by law the <em>situs </em>for taxation of property that is intangible in nature and ordinarily incapable of possessing an actual <em>situs. </em>Especially is this true where property of an intangible nature is deposited, in pursuance of a statute, with a public officer for a special purpose, and the property deposited is subject not only to the control of the officer for the special purposes named in the statute, but is subject also to the general control and disposition of the depositing company. In such event, the Legislature may provide by statute that the property be taxed a1# the Home Office of the depositing company or in the hands of the public officer, as it may desire.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-8\">Promissory notes are mere paper evidences of debt and, while they are capable under some circumstances of acquiring an actual <em>situs </em>at a place other than the domicile of the owner, their intrinsic nature is such that the Legislature has the power to fix their taxable <em>situs </em>at the domicile of the owner. It is within the discretion of the legislature to treat the taxable property in a promissory note as being situated either at the domicile of the owner or where the paper evidence of the debt is situated. Promissory notes have no such actual, physical, tangible nature and existence as deprives the Legislature of the power to treat the debts they evidence as the real taxable property and to tax the same at the domicile of the owner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-9\">These notes having been deposited with the State Treasurer, a public officer, and he having no power over them or to hold them except that given by the statute, and his holding and possession of them being subject to all thp conditions and limitations set out in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>statute defining his authority, and one of these conditions being that, notwithstanding his possession and holding of the notes, they should remain taxable at the Home Office of the company, is was error to reject this condition and limitation, and undertake to define and determine the legal effect of his possession and holding, irrespective of this condition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-3\">The Legislature had the constitutional power to define the terms and conditions upon which the State Treasurer should hold the securities deposited and to limit his holding in any way it desired.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-4\">It having been agreed as a fact that these notes were deposited with the State Treasurer under the terms and conditions of Section 38 of the Act of 1909 (and these being the only facts proven relating to the <em>situs </em>of the notes), the terms and conditions of said Act become the sole elements, either of fact or law, from which the <em>situs </em>of the securities must be determined. Obviously, the notes had <em>no'situs </em>in Austin, unless the conditions outlined in the statute are such as gave them a <em>situs </em>in Austin. This being true, and one of the conditions of the deposit being that the securities should remain taxable at the Home Office of the depositing company, this condition becomes one of the elements from which the nature of the statutory deposit must be determined. The position of'the city of Austin can only be sustained by denying the power of the Legislature to limit the terms and conditions upon which the State Treasurer should hold this deposit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4\">The Legislature, under the terms of this statutory deposit with, the S'tate Treasurer, having conferred upon the insurance company the right to withdraw any of the securities deposited at any time it desired and substitute others, and having thus expressly conferred upon the insurance company the right to make the deposit as shifting, changing and uncertain as it might desire, had also the right and power to take into consideration the shifting and changing nature of the deposit as authorized and to fix the taxable <em>situs </em>of the securities at the Home Office of the company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-6\">Being mere evidence of debt and having a dual nature as property and capable of possessing a two-fold <em>sitios </em>\u2014 one at the Home Office of the company, where the officers of the company reside who possess the general power on behalf of the company to control the securities, and the other at the office of the State Treasurer, whose possession and control of the securities was expressly limited, by this statute and made subject to the right of the company to withdraw same at any time\u2014 the Legislature had the right to select between the two- places and determine where the securities should be regarded as being situated for taxing purposes.

That where a particular business purpose can be accomplished only by locating property, be. it promissory notes, or horses or cattle, at a certain place, and the property is so located and devoted to the purpose for more than a temporary period, it very clearly acquires a <em>situs </em>at that place. That promissory notes voluntarily deposited by an insurance company under the provisions of the Act of 1907 as well as the Act of 1909, makes the possession of the Treasurer necessarily exclusive, and gives the notes a permanent <em>situs </em>in the city of Austin, and makes them taxable there.

Chief Justice CUBETON,</author>\n<p id=\"A_\">delivered the opinion of the court. This suit was filed on April 14, 1917, by the City of Austin, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>municipal corporation, incorporated by special act of the Legislature, against the Great Southern Life Insurance Company, a domestic private corporation, chartered for the purpose of doing a life in-, surance business, with its main office and principal place of business located in the city of Houston, in Harris County, Texas. The purpose of the suit was to recover taxes alleged to be due by plaintiff in error on certain securities deposited by it under the laws of the State with the State Treasurer. The taxes sued for were for the years 1911 to 1916, both inclusive. The securities deposited with the Treasurer were promissory notes, The total amount of the taxes claimed is $51,236.45. These securities were deposited in the State Treasury under S'eetion 38, Chapter 108, Acts of the Regular Session of the Thirty-first Legislature, passed in 1909, and the principal question involved is the constitutionality of a portion of this Section of that Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-3\">Judgment was rendered by the trial court on December 20, 1917, in favor of the plaintiff in error. The case was appealed by the city of Austin, and the Court of Civil Appeals held that the Act under which the deposit was made, in so far as it required the securities on deposit to be taxed at the domicile of the insurance company, was in violation of Section 11, Article 8, of the State Constitution, and reversed and rendered the ease in favor of defendant in error. 211 S. W., 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Chapter 108 of the Acts of the Legislature previously named not only provided a method for the deposit of securities, which was followed in the instance of the plaintiff in error, but set forth a plan of taxation of insurance companies subject thereto. Section 38, which became Article 4749, Revised Statutes of 1911, prescribing the method and effect of depositing securities with the State Treasurer, declares in substance that an insurance company, such as the plaintiff in error, might, at its option, deposit with the State Treasurer securities representing investments of its capital stock, with the privilege of withdrawing them, or substituting other securities therefor; that upou such, deposit being made, the State Treasurer should issue his receipt for the securities, and the company making the deposit and holding such receipt should have the right to advertise such fact and print it upon its policies of insurance; and that the proper officers and agents of the company making the deposit should be permitted at all reasonable times to examine the securities, detach coupons therefrom, and collect the interest thereon, under such reasonable rules as might be prescribed by the Treasurer and the Commissioner of Insurance and Banking.

It did not define what was meant bjr the words \u201cwhere situated.\u201d Since it had reference to the taxing power, it evidently meant property <em>where situated </em>for the purposes of taxation under the general principles of law as then understood.

This is still the basic principle upon which the taxation of personal property rests. 26 R. C. L., Section 241, pages 273, 274. But even prior to the Revolution the principle had been abrogated to the extent that as between different towns and taxing districts certain classes of tangible personal property had a taxable <em>situs </em>where employed in business, regardless of the domicile of its owner. 26 R. C. L., Section 244, pages 276, 277; Pullman Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, 141 U. S., page 18, 35 L. Ed., 613, 11 Slip. Ct., 876; State Board of Assessors v.

In the absence of controlling circumstances to the contrary, the general rule is that the <em>situs </em>of intangible property for purposes of taxation is at the owner\u2019s domicile. 26 R. C.

But the general rule is that property of an intangible nature, such as credits, bills receivable, bank deposits,, bonds, promissory notes, mortgage loans, judgments, and corporate stock, has no <em>situs </em>of its own for purposes of taxation, and is, therefore, assessable only at the place of its owner\u2019s domicile, regardless of the actual location of the evidence of the debt or the security named. 26 R.

In most cases, however, where liability for taxation has been predicated on a business <em>situs, </em>the local business has been maintained through a resident agent. ' The taxation of intangible property of the character refered to, at a <em>situs </em>other than the domicile of the owner, has usually' been based upon an expression of legislative intention to fix a local <em>situs </em>for such purpose. Where there is no such intention, then the maxim that personal property follows the domicile of the owner governs. 26 R. C. L., Section 250, pages 284, 286; New Orleans v. Stempel, 175 U. S, 309, 44 L. Ed., 174, 20 Sup. Ct., 110; State Board of Assessors v. Comptoir National D\u2019Escompte, 191 U. S., 388, 48 L. Ed., 232, 24 Sup. Ct., 109; Bristol v. Washington County, 177 U.

Ct., 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">It will be noted from the cases cited that the principle of taxing credits away from the domicile of the owner is not controlled by the existence of any note or bond or other written evidence of the credit within the taxing district, but is made to depend on the transaction of business, or the employment of the property sought to be taxed as capital in the transaction of a business within the taxing State. In one of the cases cited (Liverpool, etc. Ins. Co. v. Orleans Assessors, <em>supra,) </em>the indebtedness was not evidenced by notes or written instruments of any character; yet the rule was applied. This is made plainer by a consideration of the cases which hold that the mere fact that promissory notes are actually kept in a State other than the residence of the creditor, if not used in connection with some business there, gives no <em>situs </em>in such State for the purposes of taxation. 26 R. C. L., Section 251, page 286; Buck v. Beach, 206 U. S., 392, 51 L. Ed., 1106, 11 Ann. Cases, 732, 27 Sup. Ct., 712; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Kimball Co. v.

Ct., 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Bank deposits may be taxed at the domicile of the owner, or where they have acquired a business <em>situs, </em>or where they are actually kept, although the latter rule does not preclude their taxation in the State of the depositor\u2019s domicile. 26 R. C. L., Section 255, page 291; Fidelity, etc. Trust Co. v. Louisville, 245 U. S., 54, 62 L. Ed., 145, L. R. A., 1918C, 124, 33 Sup. Ct., 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The foregoing are the general principles of law which govern the determination of the <em>situs </em>of property for taxation. The authorities cited cover various applications of these principles, but space does not permit us to discuss them in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">We have heretofore adverted to the fundamental principle that the power of taxation could only be exercised where the property was actually or constructively situated, \u2014 that is, within the jurisdiction of the taxing power. The authorities cited are all based upon this conception of the primary basis of the taxing power. The general rules of law which we have stated arose out of a construction and an application of this fundamental principle, and these rules constituted the general body of the law relative to the taxable <em>situs </em>of property when the Constitution was adopted. They were, and are, a part of the common law as it has been declared to exist and applied by the judicial and legislative authorities in the United States. They present the elements of the system known and followed by the people when they adopted the Constitution. Our conclusion is that by them the Constitution is to be construed and applied, and that when the Constitution declared all property should be taxed in the county where situated, it meant where situated for the purpose of taxation under the common law, the general body of the law then in existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">That a constitution by the use of the words \u201cwhere situated\u201d does not define the actual <em>situs </em>of property for the purposes of taxation, has been held by the Supreme Court of California in a case, to which we have heretofore referred': San Fancisco v. Lux, 64 Calif., 481, 2 Pac., 254. The court held that the property, which in this particular case was a bank deposit, was taxable at the domicile of the owner, although the deposit itself was in a bank in a different county and city. The court adhered to the common-law rule as to the taxable <em>situs </em>of this class of property, notwithstanding the constitutional provision referred to. There are various other California cases cited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number><em>supra, </em>but it is unnecessary to discuss them. See also City and County of San Francisco v. Nevada, 22 Fed., 602. Similar words used in statutes have been construed in the same way and held not to define a taxable <em>situs </em>for intangible property, but to permit the common-law rule to apply. County Treasurer v. Webb &amp; Harrison, 11 Minn., 500; Johnson, Executor, v. Oregon City, 2 Oregon, 327. That the use of the words \u201cwhere situated\u201d in the Constitutipn does not determine and fix the taxable <em>situs </em>of tangible and intangible personal property, other than as provided by the common-law rules, is shown' by the practical and contemporary construction of the Constitution by the Legislature and courts of this State. That the practical and contemporary constructions of the Constitution are valuable aids in determining its meaning and intention in cases of doubt, is a rule universally adopted. Black on Interpretation of Laws, page 81; Copley\u2019s Constitutional Limitations, 7th Ed., page 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-3\">Our present Constitution was adopted by the people February 15, 1876. The first Legislature thereafter met in that same year, and in August. passed several general Acts covering substantially the entire field of taxation. Gammel\u2019s Laws, Vol. 8, pages 1091, 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">An examination of these and subsequent Acts will show that in many, if not in all, instances they merely declare and apply the common-law principles of taxation which we have set forth in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Article 7510, Revised Statutes 1911, in its original form was Section 8 of the Act of 1876. It then declared, and now declares, \u201cAll property, real and personal, except such as is required to be listed and- assessed otherwise, shall be listed and assessed in the county <em>where it is situated</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">This language is similar to 'that used in the Constitution, and in discussing the Act of 1876 we are considering a legislative Act containing the words of the Constitution, showing clearly that the purpose of the Legislature was to pass a measure conformable to the declaration made in the organic law itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Article 7504, which was a part of the original tax law named above, defines real property, and we deem it unnecessary to discuss it in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Article 7505 was S'ection 3 of the Act of 1876. It defines as personal property subject to taxation, all goods and chattels, including money, credits, bonds, and other evidences of debt, owned by citizens of this State, <em>whether the same be in the State or out of. the State; </em>it makes taxable boats and vessels, if registered in the State, <em>whether they are in or out of the State, </em>including the capital invested therein; it makes taxable in the State all moneys at interest due to one in thisoState, <em>whether the money is at interest in or out of the State; </em>and declares taxable in this State, all stock in corporations, except national banks, where it is owned by inhabitants of this State, <em>although the stock may be out of the State.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Article 7506 was also a part of the Act of 1876, and defines money as meaning, besides money every demand deposit owned by a person within this State, regardless of the actual location of the money deposited.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Article 7514, originally enacted in 1876, fixed the <em>situs </em>for the purposes of taxation of boats and vessels in the county where they were registered, enrolled, or licensed, or where kept, when not enrolled or licensed.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Section 16 of the Act of 1876 provided for the taxation of the funds of banks and bankers, etc., in the hands of other bankers, when subject to draft, regardless of the actual location of such funds. Gammel\u2019s Laws of Texas, Vol. 8, page 1115.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">These illustrations suffice to show that the Legislature, within a few months after the adoption of the Constitution, construed it as permitting the law-making power to fix the <em>situs </em>for purposes of taxation of intangible personal property, and in some instances of tangible personal property, at the domicile of the owner, although the property itself was actually situated in other places, or in other States. The legislative Act in which this power was exercised contained, as we have shown, a section declaring that all property should be taxed <em>where situated. </em>Construing the various provisions of the Act, and giving effect to each, it is quite apparent that the Legislature by the use of the term <em>\u201cwhere situated\u201d </em>meant where situated for the purposes of taxation under the common law, as then understood or as defined by statute. It is equally clear that in the passage of this measure the Legislature construed the constitutional provision in the same way. Moreover, the Act as then passed has remained, in its general effect, the law to the present time, having come down through the several codifications of 1879, 1895, and 1911, as a part of the Revised Statutes of the State: There have been, of course, some minor changes, but none material to this inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">Section 16 of the Act of 1876, relating to the taxation of banks, became Article 4684 of the Revised Statutes of 1879. The Article was amended in 1883. By the terms of this amendment, the shareholders of the stock in national banks were taxed for their shares of stock in' the county in which the bank was located. All other banks, bankers, brokers, and dealers in exchange, were required to pay taxes on money in hand or in the hands of other banks, or others, subject to draft, whether the same was in or out of the State. Gammel\u2019s Laws of Texas, Vol. 9, pages 417, 418. This Act was amended in 1895, but not in the respects discussed above. Revised Statutes, Article 7521.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">Article 7522, Revised Statutes, was enacted in 1885. It relates to banking corporations, and requires that all shares of stock in banks shall be rendered for taxation in. the city or town where the bank is situated.</p>\n<p id=\"AqS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>These statutes relating to the rendition of bank stocks show clearly the exercise of legislative power to fix the <em>situs </em>for taxation of intangible property at the domicile of the bank, regardless of \"the actual location of the stock certificates or the domicile of their.owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\">The Act of the Legislature fixing the taxable <em>situs </em>of securities deposited in the State Treasury at the domicile of the depositing company was passed in 1909. In 1918 the Legislature passed an Act fixing the taxable <em>situs </em>of all securities deposited with the State Treasurer, or other State officer, where they are deposited by residents of the State or corporations chartered by the State, at the domicile of the person, firm, or corporation making the deposit, and at no other place. Vernon\u2019s Complete Texas- Statutes, Article 7510a.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">We have, therefore, before us legislative Acts beginning within a few months after the adoption of the Constitution and extending over a period \"of more than forty years, and through various codifications of the statutes, by which the Legislature has construed the constitutional provision here under consideration, and in which the Legislature has exercised the power to fix the <em>situs </em>for taxation of personal property at the domicile of the owner, or has assumed the authority to fix the <em>situs </em>of such property for taxation, regardless of the actual location of the property or the domicile of the owner. This exercise of legislative authority is entitled to great weight, and we cannot hold it without constitutional warrant unless it is plainly so beyond a reasonable doubt. Ashford v. Goodwin, 103 Texas, 491, 495, Ann. Cases, 1913A, 699, 131 S. W., 535; Railroad Commission v. H. &amp; T. C. Ry. Co., 90 Texas, 340, 349, 38 S.

The first two arose over notes which were clearly part of the business being transacted in this State, and under the common law rules had a <em>situs </em>here for purposes of taxation: The last-named case is that of a foreign corporation which had deposited securities with the State Treasury.

In the last-named case the actual <em>situs </em>of the boats and the residence of their owners was in Jefferson County, Texas. They were, therefore, taxable in that county under the common law and within the terms of the Constitution. The statute involved (Article 7514, Revised Statutes), must be held to apply to boats which had not otherwise obtained an actual <em>situs. </em>The Higgins Oil &amp; Fuel Company case is similar to the one just discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">The foregoing cases in no sense .militate against the conclusions which we express in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">It is insisted that the case of Guaranty Life Insurance Co. v. City of Austin, 108 Texas, 209, 190 S. W., 189, is authority for the proposition that the Legislature did not have the power to fix the <em>situs </em>of the securities in question here at the domicile of the depositing company. The ease is not in point. Chief Justice Phillips, who wrote the opinion in the Guaranty Life Insurance Company case, stated that the taxes antedated the Act off 1909, fixing the <em>situs </em>of the personal property, of home life insurance companies at the domiciles of the companies, and that the holding made by him as to the <em>situs </em>of the securities in that case was made in the absence of a positive statute fixing the domicile of the owner as the place for taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The courts of this State, in so far as occasion has permitted them to declare the law, have followed the common law rule that the <em>situs </em>of intangible property, unless fixed by statute, or unless it has acquired in effect a business <em>situs </em>under the rules which we previously discussed, is at the domicile of the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">In the case of Angier v. Jones, 28 Texas Civ. App., 402, 67 S. W., 449, the Court of Civil Appeals, in construing various statutes, held that where a deceased had no fixed domicile, and no property save a judgment rendered in a certain county, the statute did not authorize administration in the judgment county, since the <em>situs </em>of the judgment follows the owner\u2019s residence, saying: \u201cThe <em>situs </em>of a judgment, or of any chose in action, follows the residence of the owner, and cannot in law be regarded as situated elsewhere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">In the case of Ferris v. Kimball, 75 Texas, 476, 12 S. W., 684, the facts were, briefly, as follows: Ferris, who resided without the corporate limits of the city of Waxahachie, had his office within the city. He kept in a bank within the city certain promissory notes. The notes were payable to his order at the bank in the city of Waxahachie. He did not do a general loaning business, but kept an account in the bank, and made loans when he had means to spare. The notes were kept in his portfolio with other papers in the vault of the bank, as a protection against fire, he alone having access to them. Under this state of facts, this court held they were not taxable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>within the city of Waxahachie, saying: \u201cIntangible personal property, such as credits, are taxable only at the place of residence of the owner, without regard to where they are kept or deposited, and equally without regard to how they were earned or to the place of residence of the debtor. \u2019 \u2019 As we have previously suggested, intangible personal property might acquire a situs, different from the residence of its owner by statute, or by having acquired a business <em>situs, </em>as that term has heretofore been explained; but, in the absence of this, the common-law rule obtains as thus enunciated by Justice Henry in the case of Ferris v. Kimball, <em>supra. </em>See also Connor v. City of Waxahachie, 13 S. W., 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\">From a consideration of all of the foregoing Texas cases, we think it clear that the courts of this State have followed the common-law rule, and have construed and interpreted the constitutional provision in the same manner as has the Legislature in the enactment of the statutes we have discussed, and that there is nothing in any of the opinions which militates against the application of the principles of the common-law in the construction and interpretation of the constitutional provision which declares that property shall be taxed where situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Since we have concluded that this constitutional provision is to be construed according to the principles of the common law, it necessarily follows that the Constitution leaves the field open for reasonable legislative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">That the Legislature has the power to fix the <em>situs </em>for taxation of intangible personal property at the domicile of the owner, is evidenced, we think, by the statutes enacted by the Legislature from 1876 down substantially to the present time. That the Legislature has the authority to fix the taxable <em>situs </em>of this class of property, is clear from the decisions of the courts of other States and from the text writers. A leading text states the rule to be, as to personal property, which necessarily includes intangible personal property, that the Legislature has the power to fix its <em>situs </em>for the purposes of taxation either at the owner\u2019s domicile or where the property itself is located. 37 Cyc., 947, 952; and cases cited in the Notes. We cite the following additional cases: City of Henderson v. Barrett\u2019s Executor, 152 Ky. 648, 153 S. W., 992; Commonwealth, etc. v. Northwestern Mutual Life Ins. Co. (Ky.), 107 S. W., 233; County Treasurer v. Webb &amp; Harrison, 11 Minn., 500; Tappan v. Merchants\u2019 National Bank, 19 Wallace (U. S.), 490, 22 L. Ed., 189; Walton County v. Morgan County, 120 Ga., 548, 48 S. E., 243; State v. Runyon, 41 New Jersey Law, 98; Botto\u2019s Executor v. City of Louisville, 117 Ky., 798, 79 S. W., 241; Freedom Township v. Douglas, 99 Kan., 176, 160 Pacific, 1147.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">In view of the conclusions reached, it is unnecessary to consider the other questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Having determined that the Constitution did not of itself fix any definite <em>situs </em>for the taxation of intangible property, but left such <em>situs to be </em>determined under the rules of the common law as then understood, and having determined that the Legislature had authority to fix the <em>situs </em>of such property at the domicile of the owner, it necessarily follows that Section 38, Chapter 108, General Laws of the 31st Legislature, fixing the taxable <em>situs </em>of the personal property referred to therein at the domicile of the companies named, is constitutional and must be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">We conclude that the judgment of the trial court was correct, and that of the Court of Civil Appeals erroneous. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals, in favor of the defendant in error, is reversed, and that of the trial court, in favor of the plaintiff in error, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\n<em>Reversed and judgment of District Court affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
