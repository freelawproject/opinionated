The manner in which one uses\u2014or does not use\u2014land is debated endlessly and has become a volatile emotional issue for all concerned. Peace may not be at hand, but the courts and the agencies charged with applying land use and environmental regulations have a responsibility to be evenhanded and balance the many competing concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">After five years and seven redesigns, the City of Bellevue (Bellevue) issued a conditional use permit, a shoreline height variance and a substantial development permit to the Overlake Fund to construct a hotel on the shore of Lake Washington. Bellevue imposed numerous conditions on the permits to protect the surrounding environment and comply with zoning, building, traffic and fire safety requirements. No one appealed the conditional use permit. Geoffrey Bidwell appealed the shoreline permits to the Shorelines Hearings Board (Board). After a hearing, the Board affirmed the height variance. It also \u201caffirmed\u201d the substantial development permit, but only after imposing additional conditions which prohibited Overlake from using any of the wetland on the site for any purpose. Over-lake and Bellevue appealed the substantial development permit decision to the superior court which affirmed the Board. Bellevue and Overlake appealed to this court. We conclude that the administrative board unnecessarily thwarted Bellevue\u2019s careful, balanced permitting decisions by considering issues not before it and failing to recognize the importance of balancing competing interests. The Board ignored or did not inquire into the reasons for the municipal balancing act, considered only one of the many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>competing values that contributed to Bellevue\u2019s decision and substituted its judgment on the reasonableness of the use for that of local decision-makers. We hold that the decision of the Board redesigning the Overlake hotel project was arbitrary and capricious and not supported by substantial evidence. We therefore reverse and remand to reinstate the original permits issued by Bellevue. This will restore the balance Bellevue sought to achieve.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">After years of negotiation and attempts to find an economically-viable plan that satisfied its myriad planning and environmental concerns, Bellevue issued a substantial development permit and shoreline variance to Overlake on October 21, 1993. As finally approved, the permits allowed Overlake to construct a 7-story, 238 room hotel with parking for 346 vehicles on a 6.9 acre parcel of land located between downtown Bellevue and the Lake Washington shoreline. The Department of Ecology (DOE) approved the permit and variance subject to certain conditions on November 29, 1993. As outlined above, these appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Overlake has owned the property on which the hotel is to be built since 1980. It has been zoned for urban uses, Office and Limited Business, since 1981. Of the 6.99 acre site, 0.8 acre is dry land. The remaining 6.19 acres are wetland. The proposed construction would use 1.62 acres of the site and impact between .73 and 1 acre, or 13 percent of the site\u2019s total wetland. If no further design review changes are authorized, the project will have some impact on .82 acre of the 6.19 acres of wetland, but 5.73 acres will remain untouched. The proposal was conditioned on the developer\u2019s implementing a number of wetland mitigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>measures. The Corps of Engineers,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Department of Ecology and Bellevue have all issued permits and approved the project. It has gone through the process of developing an environmental impact statement and seven redesigns over five years. The original proposal would have covered 1.5 acres of wetland. That has been reduced to a little over half of the originally-proposed wetland coverage. Even though the Corps approved filling an acre of the property, Bellevue insisted on redesigns that put the structure as far upland as possible on the dry portion of the property and located the wetland development on pilings to minimize any impact on the wetland below.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">The property is bisected by Sturtevant Creek which flows from the north through the wetland and connects to Mercer Slough and Lake Washington. The Board found that although road and building development had acted over time to isolate the wetland adjacent to the project from the larger Mercer Slough wetland, it remains a functioning part of the Mercer Slough system as a whole and is not an isolated wetland.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The substantial development permit approved by Bellevue allowed the hotel to cover 52,274 square feet of the site, including 35,624 square feet on pilings over the wetland. The Board observed that, as approved, the hotel would cover all of the dry land on the site, except for the street setbacks required by Bellevue, and .82 acre of the wetland. It also found that, although there had been agricultural activities in portions of the wetland system, the site is in an essentially natural state. The Board concluded that the proposed development would intrude into and damage the wetland and that the proposed mitigation plan failed to adequately mitigate the impact of the hotel on it. The Board approved a height variance of 92.27 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>feet because Bidwell failed to meet his burden of proof on that issue, but modified the substantial development permit to prohibit any use of the wetland on the site. It also imposed, sua sponte, view, public access and lighting conditions on the project.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AtZ\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">All development on the shorelines of this state undertaken after June 1,1971, must conform to the Shoreline Management Act of 1971 (SMA), RCW 90.58. <em>Buechel v. Department of Ecology, </em>125 Wn.2d 196, 203, 884 P.2d 910 (1994). The Shorelines Hearings Board reviews the issuance of a shoreline development permit de novo. <em>Buechel, </em>125 Wn.2d at 202. Appellate review is of the Board\u2019s decision, not that of either the local government or the superior court, and is based on the record before the Board. <em>Buechel, </em>125 Wn.2d at 202.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Courts review the Board\u2019s decision to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>in light of the entire record, or is arbitrary and capricious.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> RCW 34.05.570(3); <em>Heinmiller v.

State, </em>73 Wn. App. 405, 412, 869 P.2d 1086 (1994)). A decision is arbitrary and capricious if it is \u201c \u2018willful and unreasoning action in disregard of [the] facts and circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Buechel, </em>125 Wn.2d at 202 (quoting <em>Skagit County v. Department of Ecology, </em>93 Wn.2d 742, 749, 613 P.2d 115 (1980)). Where there is room for two opinions, an action is not arbitrary and capricious so long as it is undertaken honestly and upon due consideration, even if the reviewing court disagrees with it. <em>Buechel, </em>125 Wn.2d at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Legal determinations of administrative agencies are reviewed under an error of law standard which permits a reviewing court to substitute its interpretation of the law for that of the agency. <em>Haley v. Medical Disciplinary Bd., </em>117 Wn.2d 720, 728, 818 P.2d 1062 (1991). While we give substantial weight to agencies\u2019 interpretations of the law within their areas of expertise, we need not do so when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>they are applying the law of another jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">The Board\u2019s Findings</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The Board made several dispositive findings which Overlake and Bellevue contend are not supported by substantial evidence. The Board found that: (1) the wetland on the site is in an essentially natural state (finding XIII);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (2) its function and value is similar to that of the Mercer Slough (finding IV);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (3) neither Overlake nor Bellevue designed the project to minimize intrusion into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>the wetland (finding XI).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> They also challenge the Board\u2019s conclusion, based on those findings, that Overlake\u2019s mitigation plan failed to adequately mitigate the impact of the project on the wetland. <em>See Batchelder v. City of Seattle, </em>77 Wn. App. 154, 158, 890 P.2d 25, <em>review denied, </em>127 Wn.2d 1022 (1995) (there is \u201csubstantial\u201d evidence to support an agency decision if it would convince an unprejudiced, thinking mind of the truth of the declared premise).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">While there is evidence in the record to support some of the Board\u2019s findings,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> it is insufficient to support the critical findings that led to the remedy the Board imposed. The Board heard evidence that the affected wetland is a \u201ctype-A\u201d wetland and that Sturtevant Creek, which bisects the project site, is a \u201ctype-A riparian corridor.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It also heard evidence about the function and value of the wetland in the general area, as well as the impact of the proposed development on both the project area wetland and parts of the Mercer Slough, including testimony that the site is a very sensitive area that is part of the slough system generally, that the vegetation on the main wetland block area is similar to that of the Mercer Slough itself, and that there are various species of birds and mammals on site.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">But the issue in this case is not simply whether the wet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>land adjacent to the project is part of the Mercer Slough or not. There was testimony on both sides of that issue. Besides the testimony the Board relied on, other witnesses testified that the Mercer Slough is approximately 1,000 feet from the project. Those witnesses established that the wetland adjacent to the project is significantly degraded by the proliferation of commercial development next to it and is not of the same quality as either Sturtevant Creek or the Mercer Slough. There was also testimony that the adjacent wetland has no trees or shrubs on it and is covered with reed canary grass, an invasive nonnative species that moved in after the earlier agricultural uses were abandoned and which is of little value to the native wetland species except for flood storage and biofiltration. The flood control and drainage capabilities of the area will be affected very little because the portion of the building and garage which are over the wetland will be built on pilings, rather than on the fill placed in the wetland which the Corps of Engineers had approved. Bellevue required the applicants to provide wetland enhancement for .64 acres on the property and 1 acre in Mercer Slough Nature Park to compensate for putting pilings in .82 acres of its site. The applicant must place native trees, shrubs and other plantings in these areas to improve the wildlife habitat and water quality function of the wetland. Thus, even if the adjacent wetland is part of the Mercer Slough system, substantial evidence does not establish that the project will degrade that system as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">The Board also concluded that neither Overlake nor Bellevue designed the project to minimize intrusion into the wetland. It found that \u201cOverlake\u2019s design has the hotel built around a central courtyard, thus using up precious dry land.\u201d Bellevue required setbacks from the street on two sides for what the Board characterized as \u201caesthetic\u201d reasons, thus forcing the entire structure farther into the wetland. Finding XI. The Board further explained in finding VII:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-5\">Bellevue\u2019s land use code incorporates a wide range of values, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>from environmental protection to protection from adverse effects of density, noise, and parking. One of the values it seeks to farther is the aesthetic one of how a development looks and feels from the street. To this end the City requires set-backs from the street for new construction. The required setback for the Overlake project would by code have been 50 feet, unless a smaller setback were approved. The City did grant smaller setbacks. In order to reduce the intrusion of the hotel into the wetlands, City staff had recommended little or no setback from the street line on the S.E. 6th side. The City Council, apparently weighing street [a] esthetics more heavily, required a 20-foot setback from the street, at the cost of greater intrusion into the wetland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-4\"> The Board correctly observed that the building is designed around a courtyard. The courtyard would take up 8,000-9,000 square feet of usable building area. However, this is a de minimus intrusion into the wetland. Even if it were ehminated, the portion of the project on pilings would still cover over 27,000 square feet of the wetland. The size and configuration of the auto court promotes access and traffic safety and reduces traffic on adjacent streets. The Board was also correct in observing that, by requiring 20-foot setbacks, Bellevue did not go as far as it theoretically could have to minimize intrusion onto the wetland. But this was an improper consideration and could not be used as a basis for revising the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The Board\u2019s finding that Bellevue required a 20-foot setback for \u201caesthetic reasons\u201d is also simply wrong. There was no appeal of the Conditional Use Permit which was the only permit incorporating Bellevue\u2019s decision to grant 30-foot rather than 50-foot variances from the 50-foot setbacks required by the Land Use Code for the Office, Limited Business (OLB) zone in which the project is located. Because the Conditional Use Permit was not appealed, the issue was not before the Board and no party developed a record on the basis for Bellevue\u2019s decision to require a 20-foot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>setback.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Yet it was Bellevue\u2019s decision to require that setback which prompted the Board to find that Bellevue had given insufficient consideration to the shoreline issues and focused instead on streetside \u201caesthetic\u201d considerations when it approved the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">In fact, the reasons for the 20-foot setback requirement, as reflected in the hearing examiner\u2019s findings, were completely unrelated to \u201caesthetics.\u201d Rather, they stemmed from the problems the applicant and Bellevue had in vacating a right-of-way adjacent to the property because yet another agency, the State Department of Transportation, was considering using that right-of-way to install a light rail system. Because the right-of-way was not available, the 20-foot setback was necessary to provide fire lanes and sight distances for traffic safety purposes. Bellevue specifically recognized the relationship between the setback and the wetland impact in its Conditional Use Permit and granted the 30-foot variance in order to reduce that impact to the maximum degree possible without ignoring legitimate fire and traffic safety concerns. Far from being an \u201caesthetic\u201d decision, this was one of many ways in which Bellevue balanced competing important safety and environmental concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">This factual error was compounded by the Board\u2019s legal conclusion that Bellevue\u2019s failure to grant a variance to permit a zero lot line (i.e., no setback at all) was in conflict with the Bellevue Shoreline Master Program (BSMP). But it was unable to cite any provision of the BSMP which requires, prohibits or even relates to setbacks or variances from them. Rather, the Board assumed that Bellevue required a 20-foot setback for aesthetic reasons, thereby giving insufficient weight to shoreline concerns. Based on its assumption, it then concluded that Bellevue\u2019s action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>was in conflict with the BSME The Board then cited the provision of the BSMP which requires Bellevue to give effect to the BSMP where there is a conflict between the land use and shoreline regulations. Bellevue City Code (BCC) 20.25E.030. But because there is no BSMP setback regulation that conflicts with the 50-foot setback requirement in the OLB land use zone, that provision simply does not apply here. Nor is there any provision in the BSMP which provides that Bellevue must grant setback variances to minimize the impact on wetland or the shoreline. The combination of this legal error and the factual errors on which it is premised undercuts much of the rationale for the Board\u2019s decision. It was this fundamental error, together with the Board\u2019s admittedly sua sponte determination discussed below that a hotel, a use permitted outright by the zoning, was not a reasonable use of the property, that produced its decision to \u201credesign\u201d the building to do what Bellevue had not done\u2014remove <em>all </em>potential for <em>any </em>impact on the adjacent wetland.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">After reviewing the record, we are convinced that the real reason for the Board\u2019s decision was that it believed the proposed use was not reasonable.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Board acknowledged that the reasonableness of the use of this property was not before it. Yet it went out of its way to announce that it \u201cquestioned\u201d the reasonableness of the use and would have s\u00f3 opined had it been asked. The Board had no basis on which to consider whether the Bellevue City Council had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>adopted a reasonable use for the property. No one questioned that legislative decision, and no change of use or zoning was required to build this project. The Board\u2019s sua sponte consideration of this issue reveals its true attitude toward the proposed project, an attitude which affected its ability to look objectively at the evidence and balance the competing values that were properly before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Most of the problems with the sufficiency of the record and the Board\u2019s findings arose from the real nature of the appeal. Bidwell\u2019s primary objection to the project was not wetland impact but the potential impact the height of the building could have on the blue heron rookery 900 feet from the project. He had \u201cno problem\u201d with the building being on pilings in the wetland and would have traded greater wetland coverage for reduced height. While he did present testimony about the nature of the wetland, and particularly the Mercer Slough, his emphasis was on the height of the building. He thus provided little basis for the Board to conclude that the impacts of the proposal on the adjacent wetland, as opposed to the height of the building, would have any impact on the slough and its wetland park 1,000+ feet away. Because his appeal focused on height impacts, and the Board rejected that argument for lack of evidence, he did not develop a record sufficient to support the Board\u2019s findings on wetland impact or its remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">The point is that, even if the adjacent wetland is part of the system in which the Mercer Slough Nature Park is located, that does not answer the questions presented to the Board by Bidwell\u2019s appeal. The SMA does not prohibit all development in the shoreline. Rather, its purpose is to allow careful development of shorelines by balancing public access, preservation of shoreline habitat and private property rights through coordinated planning, i.e., shoreline master plans which must be approved by DOE. RCW 90.58.020. In this case, the Board ignored the other components of the SMA\u2019s purpose in order to prohibit any development at all in the wetland. The Board\u2019s findings and conclusions establish that it did not think the proposal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>was a reasonable use of the land and that it believed Bellevue had ignored the mandate of the SMA by sacrificing some wetland protection to its selfish \u201caesthetic\u201d concerns. It therefore redesigned the project in a manner that makes it completely infeasible to build.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">The SMA is a very significant piece of legislation with an extremely laudable purpose. But it is not the only statute or ordinance that decision-makers must consider in achieving the balance mandated by the SMA. Because the Board arbitrarily chose not to learn about or to ignore the other significant considerations that went into the decisions of the Corps of Engineers, the Department of Ecology and Bellevue to permit this project, its decision cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\"> The dissent is premised on the same fatal flaw.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-6\">The majority allows there was substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding that the wetland on the site is in a natural state, with function and value similar to Mercer Slough. This was all that was necessary to show that the project, which degrades close to an acre of the wetland, was at odds with the policies calling for conservation of existing natural resources.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Dissent at 769 (footnote omitted). But the mere fact that a wetland is in a \u201cnatural\u201d state does not require that it remain that way or dictate the result of the permitting process. Both the SMA and the Bellevue Shoreline Master Program contemplate and permit the full range of land uses even within the shoreline district. Different zoning classifications and shoreline designations are designed to provide different levels of protection for shorelines. While Bellevue has not expressly adopted these designations, they establish the range of uses permitted and expected in the shoreline. The most restrictive designation is \u201cNatural.\u201d WAC 173-16-040(4)(b)(i). The natural environment \u201cis intended to preserve and restore those natural resource systems existing relatively free of human influence\u201d and therefore permits little or no development. <em>Id. </em>By contrast, the \u201cUrban\u201d environment is the least restrictive designa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>tion, recognizing that commercial, residential and industrial uses will be located in those portions of the shoreline area. WAC 173-16-040(4) (b) (iv). \u00a3\u00a3[H]igh-intensity land-use\u201d is expected in the urban environment which \u201cis particularly suitable to those areas presently subjected to extremely intensive use pressure, as well as areas planned to accommodate urban expansion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, this is an environment that would be characterized as \u201curban\u201d under the classifications recommended in the SMA. The State shoreline regulations also recognize that, within the limited urban shoreline area, \u201cemphasis should be given to development within already developed areas.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">As noted above, Bellevue designated the Overlake property OLB, Office and Limited Business, in which hotels are a use permitted outright. The adjoining parcels are already developed with office or industrial uses. This is an urban shoreline environment. When it approved the Bellevue Shoreline Master Program,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> DOE approved Bellevue\u2019s decision to permit the high-intensity commercial uses contemplated by the regulations governing the urban Shoreline environment along this portion of Lake Washington. In so doing, both the City and DOE recognized that the area in which this proposal is located is an already-developed area within a city which is suitable for commercial development. In an ideal world, we might well choose to preserve all shorelines in a natural, undisturbed state. But the Shoreline Management Act, DOE and the City understand that, in a practical world, urban pressures exist and permitting a range of uses is necessary to accommodate those pressures. On the sliding scale of values contemplated by the Act and regulations, the natural condition of the wetland portion of the site simply does not justify effectively denying a permit for an urban use in an urban area of the shoreline.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">In short, we conclude that the Board\u2019s decision to limit building to the dry land area on the site was not supported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>by evidence that is substantial in light of the whole record before the court. <em>Heinmiller, </em>127 Wn.2d at 607. In addition, in deciding whether Bidwell had met his burden of proof on appeal of the substantial development permit, the Board relied on the setbacks approved in the conditional use permit and the reasonableness of the use, neither of which was before it and neither of which it could consider. Its decision was therefore \u201cin disregard of [the] facts\u201d and arbitrary and capricious. <em>Buechel, </em>125 Wn.2d at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Because we decide that the Board\u2019s decision must be reversed for these reasons, we need not decide the other issues Bellevue and Overlake raise.

The Board\u2019s imposition of a condition that the hotel not intrude into the wetland was a reasonable exercise of the Board\u2019s authority, supported by the evidence and the policies of the Shoreline Management Act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Because I believe the majority has improperly substituted its judgment for the Board\u2019s, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">The Shoreline Management Act is to be liberally construed \u201cto give full effect to the objectives and purposes for which it was enacted.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The essential purpose of the Act is to protect shorelines. Shorelines are not, as the majority suggests, simply one among many competing concerns that local governments have to balance; if that were so, there would have been no reason to pass the Act. Shorelines of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>the state, because they are \u201camong the most valuable and fragile of its natural resources,\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> have priority.

This means the Board is not required to accord any particular deference to the decision of the local government.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Board is recognized as having \u201cspecialized skills in hearing shoreline cases,\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and this court is obligated to give due deference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>the Board\u2019s \u201cspecialized knowledge and expertise.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">This court reviews the present order of the Shorelines Hearings Board against a number of challenges. Primarily the appellants contend the Board\u2019s order is arbitrary and capricious; not supported by evidence that is substantial when viewed in light of the whole record; and that the Board has erroneously interpreted or applied the law.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> With respect to the first two grounds for challenge, a court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Board; it may reverse only if the Board\u2019s order is a willful, unreasoning action, in disregard of facts and circumstances, or if firmly convinced that a mistake has been committed in light of the policy of the Act.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> With respect to interpretation of the law, a reviewing court may substitute its judgment for the Board\u2019s when \u201cnecessary to ensure that a proposed project complies with the SMA,\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> but should ordinarily give substantial weight to the Board\u2019s interpretation of the law within its area of expertise.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The majority suggests that a court need not give substantial weight to the Board\u2019s interpretation of law when the Board is applying \u201cthe law of another jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> To the extent the majority implies that the Board was not acting within its expertise in applying Bellevue\u2019s Master Shoreline Program, I disagree. Shoreline master programs, though initially developed by local governments, are adopted as state regulations only after the State has approved them as consistent with the Shoreline Management <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>Act.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The Board regularly applies and interprets them as state regulations when deciding whether or not to approve a substantial development permit. The Board\u2019s interpretation of Bellevue\u2019s Shoreline Master Program, not Bellevue\u2019s, is the interpretation to which due weight should be given by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">The majority erroneously declares the shoreline in question to be \u201curban.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The Bellevue Shoreline Master Program does not use the classifications of natural, conservancy, rural and urban, a system of classification that is recommended by the Department of Ecology but not required.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Instead, Bellevue specifies the shorelines to which each of its policies applies. The Majority concedes that Bellevue has not adopted Ecology\u2019s suggested classifications, yet concludes that if Bellevue had done so, it would have classified the project\u2019s environment as \u201curban.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> This court cannot, by fiat, classify the project acreage as urban and therefore suitable for high-intensity land use when Bellevue\u2019s own shoreline plan designates Lake Washington wetlands within the city as subject to the highest degree of conservation. The land use designation of the property for office and limited business use is irrelevant because the regulations of the Shoreline Overlay District prevail over any conflicting land use district regulation.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The Bellevue City Council Ordinance approving the substantial development permit identified the following policies of Bellevue\u2019s Shoreline Master Program as relevant to the project in question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-5\">Uses and activities in unique or fragile areas should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>discouraged unless measures can be satisfactorily undertaken to mitigate all related adverse impacts.[<footnotemark>34</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-4\">Existing natural resources should be conserved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-5\">b. Wildlife habitat should be protected, improved and, if feasible, increased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-6\">c. Unique and fragile areas should be so designated and maintained. Access and use should be restricted if necessary for the conservation of these areas.[<footnotemark>35</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-7\">Wetlands</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-8\">a. Economic uses and activities should minimize and cluster that water-dependent portion of their development along the wetland shoreline and place inland all facilities which do not require a water\u2019s edge location.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-9\">e. Economic development should be designed to preserve the aesthetics and natural amenities of the wetland area and to be compatible with appropriate existing developments in the same vicinity.[<footnotemark>36</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">All of the above policies are specifically applied to wetlands by the Bellevue Shoreline Master Program Policy Element.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> In addition to the Master Program policies, the Act itself provides that local governments, in their planning for such shorelines, are to give preference to uses which \u201c[preserve the natural character of the shoreline\u201d and \u201c[pjrotect the resources and ecology of the shoreline.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AcB\">The proposed hotel and parking structure is not a facility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>that requires a water\u2019s edge location.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The adjacent wetland, as an associated wetland of Lake Washington, is a shoreline of statewide significance.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> And the adjacent wetland is functionally related to \u201ca natural feature of the first importance,\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> the Mercer Slough. Yet the City Council of Bellevue interpreted the pertinent policies as permitting the hotel to cover portions of the wetland. The Board, on the other hand, reasonably concluded that the proposed substantial development, to the extent it intruded into the wetland, was inconsistent with Bellevue\u2019s own shoreline policies, as well as the policy of the Act itself. The Board reached this conclusion after finding that the adverse impacts of the project on the wetland would not be mitigated by enhancement projects, uncertain of success, on wetlands some distance away.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">THE BOARD\u2019S FINDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Findings IV and XIII. The majority allows there was substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding that the wetland on the site is in a natural state, with function and value similar to Mercer Slough.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> This was all that was necessary to show that the project, which degrades close to an acre of the wetland, was at odds with the policies calling for conservation of existing natural resources. The majority then goes on to say, however, that the appellants did not introduce evidence that the project would degrade the Mercer Slough system as a whole.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">When a developer proposes to locate a substantial project on a particular stretch of shoreline, the Act does not require an opponent to prove the proposed development will degrade the larger system of which the particular shoreline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>is a part. Such a rule would render the Shoreline Act much less effective because often a single development will degrade an entire system either minimally or not at all. The Act as written contemplates restrictions that will forestall the continuing cumulative effects of development on shorelines.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">The material issue here was whether Overlake\u2019s proposal to cover a portion of a significant wetland was consistent with relevant shoreline policies. Consequently, the Board did not make, and did not need to make, a finding that the project would degrade the Mercer Slough system as a whole. The Board\u2019s decision cannot be reversed for a lack of substantial evidence to support a finding it did not make or need to make. Findings IV and XIII faithfully reflect testimony heard by the Board, and should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Finding XI. The Board found neither the City nor Over-lake designed the project to minimize wetland intrusion. The Board specifically mentioned the dry land devoted to a central courtyard, and the City\u2019s required setbacks, which forced the structure further into the wetland \u201cfor aesthetic reasons.\u201d The majority dismisses the courtyard factor as de minimis because it involves only 9,000 square feet.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> But the project as designed covers over 35,000 square feet of wetland. If one quarter of this amount can be spared, in my view the result is not de minimis, particularly when combined with the dry land lost to the setbacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">As to the setbacks, the majority asserts they were necessary for safety concerns, not aesthetic reasons.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> But the record reflects no reason other than street aesthetics for the 20-foot setback along S.E. 6th, the project\u2019s northern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>boundary.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The only other concern I can locate in the hearing examiner\u2019s findings pertains to 114th Street S.E., the project\u2019s eastern boundary, where there was an identified potential future need for a rapid transit stop.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The Board\u2019s unchallenged finding of fact VII addresses the northern setback along S.E. 6th as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-4\">In order to reduce the intrusion of the hotel into the wetlands, City staff had recommended little or no setback from the street line on the S.E. 6th side. The City Council, apparently weighing street esthetics more heavily, required a 20 foot setback from the street, at the cost of greater intrusion into the wetland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">This finding supports challenged finding XI. Finding XI should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The majority also holds the Board erred legally with respect to the setback along S.E. 6th because it failed to identify a specific regulation in Bellevue\u2019s Master Program giving shorelines priority over setbacks.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> In light of the previously quoted policies of the Act and the Bellevue Shoreline Master Program, I would hold no specific regulation is needed to establish that shorelines of statewide significance have priority over street setbacks. If Bellevue was unprepared to sacrifice its interest in the aesthetic appearance of S.E. 6th, its alternative was to deny the project, not to sacrifice the wetlands.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The majority contends the setback issue was conclusively resolved earlier by the City\u2019s decision to grant a conditional use permit, and therefore was not before the Board and was inadequately documented in the record.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> I disagree. The shoreline substantial development permit incorporated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>the conditions of approval provided by the conditional use permit, and therefore an appeal of the substantial development permit put at issue the conditions of the conditional use permit that impact the shoreline.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The presiding member of the Board specifically referred to lot coverage issues at the beginning of the first day of proceedings,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> and the record contains voluminous staff reports and other evidence detailing the evolution of the setback requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">FINDING IX. Overlake developed a mitigation plan after consultation with the Department of Ecology. The Board summarized the evidence concerning this plan in its Finding IX:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-5\">As a result of the City\u2019s and Ecology\u2019s required mitigation of wetland impacts, some trees would be planted near the hotel, and other enhancements, mostly in the form of vegetation, would be made, not to the wetland adjacent to the hotel, but to the main portion of the Mercer Slough wetland many blocks to the south.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The Board concluded as a matter of law that \u201cthe wetland mitigation plan proposed fails to fully mitigate the impacts on the wetland of the development, and most particularly fails to mitigate impacts on the Sturdevant Creek portion of the wetland system,\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> and \u201cthe wetland mitigation proposed fails to compensate for the adverse effects of the project.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> The majority opinion does not address the mitigation issue, but Overlake vigorously challenges these conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">As framed by Bellevue\u2019s Master Program policies, the material issue was whether \u201cmeasures can be satisfactorily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>undertaken to mitigate all related adverse impacts.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Finding XI, unchallenged by Overlake in its appeal, establishes that the proposed mitigation fails to compensate on-site for the project\u2019s adverse impacts.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Further, evidence in the record depicted the proposed off-site mitigation as uncertain in success.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> And Overlake\u2019s evidence introduced to demonstrate the wetland\u2019s insignificance as a habitat for wildlife was far from overwhelming, in that the inventory was not thorough.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> The Board\u2019s expertise is particularly adapted to evaluating such evidence. From the entire rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>ord, an unprejudiced, thinking mind could conclude that measures could not be \u201csatisfactorily undertaken to mitigate all related adverse impacts\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> and that there would be a net loss of wetland functions. I would therefore hold the Board did not err in concluding the mitigation plan was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">I also observe that the first of Bidwell\u2019s issues identified in the prehearing order states, \u201cDoes the permittee\u2019s proposed wetland mitigation plan adequately compensate for the project\u2019s adverse impacts on shoreline wetlands at the site?\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Bidwell did introduce considerable evidence on this topic, and Overlake\u2019s witnesses supplied more evidence in response to questions from the Board. I therefore believe the majority is inaccurate in its assertion that Bidwell focused only on the height issue and failed to develop an adequate record for the findings pertaining to the substantial development permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">\u201cREASONABLE USE\u201d DICTA</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The majority is convinced that the Board\u2019s stated reasons for altering the permit are but a smokescreen for its \u201creal reason\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> or \u201ctrue attitude\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark>&amp;emdash;a belief that the proposed hotel was not a reasonable use for the small sliver of dry land on the subject parcel. The majority uses the Board\u2019s comment on reasonable use as a basis to conclude the Board allowed \u201cits ability to look objectively at the evidence\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> to be affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">This is certainly a mischaracterization of the Board\u2019s decision-making process. First, the Board\u2019s comment questioning reasonable use was straightforward dicta, unnecessary to its decision but useful in showing what its decision on the height variance was <em>not </em>based on. When the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>Board used dicta about reasonable use to similar purpose in the decision upheld in <em>Buechel, </em>the Supreme Court did not fault the Board for doing so.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> This court occasionally expresses its thoughts on issues that do not expressly constitute the basis of decision.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> We should be very reluctant to infer that the similar use of dicta by a hearing board reveals a hidden and improper motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">Second, the Board\u2019s statement about reasonable use is most fairly understood as illuminating its decision to grant the <em>height </em>variance\u2014a decision not at issue in this appeal\u2014 not its decision to condition the substantial development permit. Only with respect to the height variance was \u201creasonable use\u201d a specific criterion for decision. That is, Bid-well could have blocked the height variance if he had shown the project did not meet the five defined variance criteria, including \u201c[t]hat the strict application of the . . . standards set forth in the applicable master program precludes or significantly interferes with a reasonable use of the property not otherwise prohibited by the master program.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> But since Bidwell did not carry his burden of proof on any of the variance criteria, the Board\u2014despite its reservations about reasonable use\u2014affirmed the height variance.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">In short, the real reason the Board conditioned the substantial development permit is exactly as set forth in its decision\u2014the development \u201cviolates the Shorelines Management Act and the Bellevue Shoreline Master Program in its extensive and unwarranted coverage of this wetland, and that the wetland mitigation proposed fails to compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>sate for the adverse effects of the project.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> In speculating that the Board\u2019s remark about reasonable use betrays a lack of objectivity, the majority unnecessarily casts doubt on the Board\u2019s professionalism and thereby undermines the Board\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Overlake and Bellevue raise a number of procedural issues with the Board\u2019s decision. Essentially, they argue they lacked fair notice of the issues decided by the Board. This argument is contradicted by the broad scope of the prehearing order, and by Bellevue\u2019s opening statement: \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to characterize our debate over the substantial development permit ... as a debate over the wetland impacts and the impacts to Mercer Slough that this project could pose.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> 1 see no merit to the procedural issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">In summary, the Board acted within the law and its own expertise in ordering that Overlake\u2019s hotel project should proceed only if redesigned so as not to intrude into the wetland.
