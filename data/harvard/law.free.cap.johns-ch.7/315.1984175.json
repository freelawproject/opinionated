They stated, that, on the 3d of <em>May </em>last, eight persons (named) entered into a contract with <em>Samuel Young, </em>one of the Canal Commissioners, to complete the lock and dam on the <em>Hudson River, </em>&amp;c. That it was expressly understood between the contractors and the Canal Commissioners, that the materials for filling in the dam should be furnished to the contractors from the \u2022 rocky hill near the dam, and from which materials for that purpose had been previously obtained, without objection on the part of the owners, under the direction of the engineer, and by virtue of several statutes; and it was covenanted by the contractors, that the lock and dam should be completed, in a permanent and substantial manner, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>the 1st day of <em>October </em>next. That, on the 20th of <em>May </em>last, the contractors entered into a sub-contract with the defendants, <em>L, B. </em>and <em>R, K,, </em>for the completion of the dam, &amp;c., under the direction of the engineer, by the 1st day of <em>September </em>next. That the erection and construction of the dam are absolutely necessary for the completion of the <em>Champlain </em>canal, inasmuch as part of the canal, adopted by the Canal Commissioners, can be supplied with the necessary quantity of water in no other way; and the Commissioners have taken the possession and control of the dam, and the lock connected with it, upon the terms and under the provisions of the act of the\" Legislature, entitled, \u201c An act respecting the navigation of the <em>Hudson river </em>between <em>Troy </em>and Waterford,\u201d passed <em>March </em>9, 1821; and the works mentioned, are an essential part of the Canal. That the defendant, Jerome, by the appointment of the Canal Commissioners, is, and from the 1st <em>of May, </em>1823, has been, the principal engineer on the <em>Champlain </em>canal, and in the employment of the Canal \u2022 Commissioners; and as such engineer, and by the authority of the statutes, fee., he entered upon, and located a sufficient quantity of a certain rocky hill near the dam, for the purpose of getting good and substantial materials, fee., to be used in the erection and completion of the dam, and directed the defendants, the sub-contractors, to enter upon, break up, and take away the rock for these purposes; and which location was seen and approved of by S. <em>Y., </em>the acting Canal Commissioner on the <em>Champlain </em>canal. The defendants admitted the entry on the plaintiff\u2019s land, and the digging, fee., without any other license than that received from the public agents. That the stones have been taken along the foot <em>of </em>the east side of the hill, for about ten rods in length, and penetrating into the side of the hill about thirty feet; and that the foot of the hill crosses the lots of the plaintiff, fee. They admitted the . suit and judgment stated in the bill; but, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>being advised that the judgment was erroneous, they had brought a <em>certiorari </em>to reverse it. They alleged, that the stone and rock broken up and taken away are of no use, ex-ceptforsome such purpose as that to which they havebeenapplied; and are of no use for buildings or enclosures; and that the injury to the plaintiff is merely nominal. They admitted that they told the plaintiff that they would not pay for the stone : That it will take above 5000 loads of stone to complete the work, and there was nearly a sufficient quantity broken up and lying on the premises, for the completion of the dam, &amp;c., and that the expense of breaking them up had been above 800 dollars. That if the work should be delayed until a freshet in the river, before the timber curbs which had been sunk, were filled in, the work would be endangered, and the canal could not be completed this season, to the great damage of the contractors, and serious detriment of the public, as the free use of the canal depends on the completion of the work. They admitted that the injury, if any, was irreparable, because the stones could not be restored to their former place; but they denied that the rocks, in the situation in which they were, being broken up, were of any great value; and alleged that the laws have provided sufficient means of compensation, without troublesome litigation. They admitted the location of the rock and premises, as stated in the bill, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-8\">A motion was made, on the 21st of <em>July, </em>on the coming in of the answer, in the Court below, to dissolve the injunction, on two grounds: 1. Because the injury to the plaintiff was not irreparable; and, <em>2. </em>Because the matter set up in the answer was no justification.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-9\">The Judge of the circuit stated at large his reasons for refusing to grant the motion, and which are contained in the following opinion, delivered by him, and transmitted, with his certificate, and copies of the proceedings, &amp;c., before him, to the Chancellor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number><em>Opinion. </em>The motion to dissolve the injunction in this case, rests upon two grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-4\">1st. The want of equity in the bill; and 2d. Upon the matter of justification set up in the answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-5\">1. The grounds laid for the injunction in the bill are, that the defendants are committing irreparable waste, without any pretence of title or right to the occupation of the soil $ and that the plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law, without bringing a multiplicity of suits; or, at all events, that the mischief may be completely effected before their termination. Since the disuse of the common law actions of waste and estrepement, the more easy and complete mode of proceeding by bill in equity, to <em>stay </em>waste, either threatened, or which the party is in the act of committing, and for <em>an account </em>of such as may have already been done, has been particularly favoured by the Courts, both in <em>England </em>and in this country. And it is laid down, by the present Chancellor, in one of the earliest cases before him, <em>(Kane </em>v. <em>Vandenburgh, </em>1 <em>Johns. Ch. Rep. </em>12.) \u201c that it is a wholesome jurisdiction, to be liberally exercised in the prevention of irreparable injury, and depends on much latitude of discretion in the Court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-6\">The Courts in <em>England </em>were, however, for a long time, extremely strict in confining the relief in equity to cases of tenancy, founding their interference in restraint of waste on the privity of title between the parties. The first instance of relaxation, was in a case where an injunction was granted, upon a forcible entry, against the commissioners of a ' turnpike for digging gravel on land of the plaintiffj but this seems to have been grounded on the equity of <em>quieting possession </em>merely. <em>(Hughes </em>v. <em>Merton College, </em>1 <em>Ves. </em>188.) The rigour of the ancient rule was at length further relaxed, upon the avowed principle of enjoining in matters of <em>trespass, where irreparable injury is the </em>conse<em>quence ; </em>and upon the authority of this case, Lord <em>Eldon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>granted an injunction to restrain a trespasser from digging coal upon the premises of another. <em>(Mitchell </em>v. <em>Dors, </em>6 Ves. 147.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-8\">Where the title comes in question, the Court, nevertheless, requires a strong case of destruction to be made out against trespassers\u2014a case of irreparable mischief, which may be completely effected before any trial can be had as to the controverted right. <em>(Eden on Injunction, </em>139. 7 Ves. 308. 1 <em>Johns. Ch. Rep. </em>318.) But where the plaintiff\u2019s title is not controverted, it is considered as established, that a Court of equity will always interpose to restrain irreparable mischief. <em>(Eden on Injunction, </em>140.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-9\">Had the right of the plaintiff in this case to the premises appeared doubtful from the bill, or had the bill disclosed an adverse <em>claim </em>to the land, I should have refused the injunction, unless it had been alleged, that the injury would have been complete before the right could have been settled at law; in which case 1 should have directed notice of the application to have been given, before ordering the writ. But I consider the bill as presenting a clear case of irreparable injury, without pretence or claim of title to the premises ; a case, in which it is evident, from the nature of the injury, that the remedy at law must be inadequate, not merely from the necessity of resorting to a multiplicity of suits, but from the ineffectual nature of those suits in preventing a continuance or repetition of the \" injury. Nor am I now induced, from the argument, to think that the matter of the bill is not such as to warrant the exercise of the jurisdiction of this Court, in granting the injunction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-10\">2. It remains, therefore, to consider, whether, upon the justification set up in the answer, the writ ought to be dissolved or modified. The answer admits the entry of the defendants upon the premises, without the consent of the plaintiff; the digging, breaking, and carrying away of the stone; and the irreparable nature of the injury; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>but denies the stone to be of any great value. Hence it has been argued by the counsel for the plaintiff, upon the authority of <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Crobroft, (Barnard. Ch. Rep. </em>373.) that inasmuch as the defendants admit the equity of the bill, and set up new matter of defence on which they rely, the injunction ought to be continued to the hearing. But the rule, I apprehend, cannot apply to a case of this kind, in which the substantial merits are to be decided upon this motion j and, in a matter so much in the discretion of the Court as the dissolving or continuing of an injunction, I should certainly not feel myself bound, in the present instance, to retain it, if 1 were not satisfied that the matter relied on by the defendants is, in itself, insufficient. They claim to have rightfully entered upon the premises in question, and to have taken the stone therefrom, by direction of the Canal Commissioners, or their agents, under the authority of the several acts of the Legislature relative to the <em>Erie </em>and <em>Champlain canals; </em>they allege, that the dam in the <em>Hudson </em>river, to the construction of which the materials have been applied, is absolutely necessary for the completion of the <em>Champlain canal, </em>upon the plan adopted by the commissioners, and aver that they are the most suitable and convenient materials for the purpose intended, and that they may be taken with less injury <em>to </em>the owner than any upon the same side of the river.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-6\">Their right to take them, therefore, depends upon the true construction of the acts referred to ; and although the defendants specify no one of those acts in particular, nor any definite part or portion of any of them, yet it is abundantly evident from the answer, (and was indeed admitted by one of the counsel, on the argument,) that they mean to rely on the 3d section of the act of <em>April </em>15,1817. (sess. 40. c. 262.) This section enacts, 61 that it shall and may be lawful for the said Canal Commissioners, and each of them by themselves, and by any and every superin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>tendant, agent, and engineer employed by them, to enter upon, take possession of, and use all and singular any lands, waters, and streams, necessary for the prosecution of the improvements intended by this act.\u201d Now, whether the dam in question be an improvement intended by this act, I do not mean to decide; for although points have been raised and debated by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, with respect to the distinct nature of the powers vested in the Canal Commissioners, in relation to the dam, and to the omission of the Legislature to extend, as in other cases, the specific powers conferred by the clause above cited, to that particular work, by an express re-enactment; yet from the view I have taken of the case, it will be unnecessary for me to consider them. If it shall appear, as I conceive it will, that the statute referred to affords no warrant for the acts set forth in- the bill, and admitted by the answer, it would be useless to discuss the other questions which heve been made: for if all other grounds were conceded to the defendants, they would, nevertheless, fail on that on tvhich they place their ultimate reliance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-6\">The question then is, whether, according to the true construction of the act of 1817, any other power was intended to be conferred on the commissioners, than that of taking such lands, &amp;c. for the canal improvements, as may be <em>necessary </em>to be permanently appropriated and occupied as the site and tract of the canals, and of the works connected with them, which, according to the provisions of the same section of the act, are to be taken and paid for upon appraisement, and the fee simple vested in the State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-7\">The defendants contend, that much more than this was meant by the Legislature, and that the commissioners have authority, under the act, to enter upon any land not immediately contiguous to the canals, or to the works connected with them, without any design of permanent appropriation and acquisition of the fee; but for the mere purpose of carrying away such materials as they may deem most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number><em>suitable </em>for their purpose, and most <em>convenient, </em>though not absolutely <em>necessary </em>to be there taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-4\">To support this position, they refer to the opinion delivered by his honour the Chancellor, in the case <em>of Rogers </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>(20 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>735.) decided in the Court of Errors, in <em>February </em>last; but a careful examination of that case has convinced me, that there is nothing in it to sustain the doctrine thus attempted to be deduced from it. In that case, the plaintiff in error, who was defendant in the Court below, was sued in an action of trespass for entering upon the land of the defendant in error, and cutting and despoiling timber growing thereon. The defendant below justified under the several acts relative to the canals, and it was shown in proof, that a turnpike road, adjoining the place where the trespass was alleged to have been committed, was unavoidably encroached upon <em>by the </em>track or course of the canal, and that another road tvas indispensable at that place, and must have been made before that part of the canal was commenced 3 that the land on which the entry was made, was a necessary,, if not the only course for a road 3 that it was staked out under the direction of the chief engineer 3 and that the defendant, under the authority of the Canal Commissioners, and in pursuance of a contract with one of them, was putting the ground in the form of a turnpike, when the action was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-5\">Upon these facts, his honour the Chancellor held, in opposition to the judgment of the Supreme Court, (20 Johns. <em>Rep. </em>103.) that the plaintiff in error was justified by the act of <em>April, </em>1817, and also by an act passed in <em>April, </em>1820, (sess. 43. c. 202.) declaring, \u201c that in all cases, in which it should be deemed necessary by the principal engineer, in laying out the line of the canals, or any work connected therewith, to discontinue or alter any part of the public road or highway, on account of its interfering with a proper location or construction of either of the canals, the engineer shall be authorized to make such discontimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>anee or alteration, provided that the Canal Commissioners', before they obstruct the passage or any part of a highway-now legally established, shall open, and reasonably work, . in order to render it passable, such part' of the said highway, as may be new laid out by the engineer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-8\">As no other member of the Court of Errors assigned reasons for his opinion, it is impossible to determine to what extent the provisions of the last mentioned statute may have operated in producing the unanimous judgment which was rendered in that case. His honour the Chancellor, however, considered the conduct of the plaintiff in error, equally defensible under the act of 1817. I not only bow to the authority, but assent to <em>the </em>reasoning of that opinion. I merely deny its application to the case 'before me ; for the grounds on which his honour rests his decision, are, that the land taken in that case was <em>necessary </em>for the prosecution of the improvement intended by the act; .that it was permanently appropriated to that object; and that the fee became vested in the State. He argues, most conclusively, that if the plaintiff had no power, under the act of 1817, to make such a substituted road, on the neighbouring ground, in place of the turnpike taken for the canal, they could not go on with their work. The line of the canal must have been either diverted from its course, perhaps with great and lasting inconvenience, or else its progress must have been suspended until new powers had been conferred by the Legislature; and he repudiates a construction leading to such inconvenience and absurdity. He presumes, that the land over which the turnpike road led before it was taken for the canal, had been paid for, under the act establishing the road; and as the act of 1817 provides, that when lands were taken, as being necessary for the prosecution of the improvements, the fee should vest in the State, he supposed that the State, upon paying the party for his land, held the fee of the newly made road, subject to the easement or right of the turnpike corpora-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>lion 5 and thus only does he harmonize and adjust every conflicting interest in that case, under a just and fair operation of the act of 1817.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-6\">But in the case at bar, the rights of the parties are not thus to be reconciled. It is not pretended that the land of the plaintiff, or even the materials taken from it, are <em>necessary </em>for the canal improvements, or that it adjoins, or interrupts, or interferes, either directly or indirectly, with the course of the canal, or of a work connected with it 5 or that it is a proper site for any such improvement, or work; or that it is intended that the land itself should be permanently appropriated to the use of the canal, and the fee simple paid for and vested in the State. On the cqntrary, it is admitted that it is the material it affords, and not the land itself, that is wanted ; and in regard to the material, it is merely alleged, that it is more <em>suitable </em>and convenient than any other upon the same side of the river, across which the dam is to be extended. It is admitted, too, that the premises are sixty rods distant from the bank of the river, on the other side of a public highway, with several buildings and tiers of lots between them, and that nothing more than the mere damage sustained by the plaintiff from breaking up and carrying off the stone, is to be appraised and paid for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-7\">If the words of the statute warrant the taking of the stone under these circumstances, I can imagine no possible limit to the authority or discretion of the commissioners. If they have power to take from land, not appropriated as necessary to the prosecution of their works, materials which they conceive <em>suitable </em>in their nature, and <em>convenient </em>in point of situation, at the distance of 60 rods, 1 see nothing to prevent their taking from, the lands and enclosures of individuals, any other mat\u00e9rials they may fancy, in any situation, or at any distance. Such a construction, therefore, is unreasonable and dangerous; and, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>adopted, would give sanction to a stretch of power never contemplated by the act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-3\">I readily admit that statutes, vesting an undefined discretion in public agents, to enable them to effect a great and beneficial object, ought to be benignly and liberally expounded in favour of those agents, if acting in good faith, and within the scope of their authority. But i am, nevertheless, bound to restrain them, whenever from mistake they exceed that authority; and, on all occasions, to protect the rights of individuals from the encroachments of power. The characters of the Canal Commissioners forbid the supposition of any intentional abuse of their authority; and the property in this case may be of little or no value to the owner; but as this motion must be decided on principle, those circumstances can have no weight or bearing. Their agents may abuse their confidence, and wrest their power to the purposes of their private interest; and they, as well as persons exercising similar powers under other statutes, for less meritorious objects, may invade property of greater value; but the rule which governed in the one case, would, nevertheless, be applicable to the other. This rule, therefore, must be general, and is, as I conceive, well established, by the cases which declare, that all powers granted by statute, and especially those authorizing an interference with the right of private property, must be strictly pursued. Nor, from these cases, can there be any greater doubt of the power of Courts of equity, to interfere in relation to the proceedings of persons acting under a statute, than in cases of trespass by private individuals. The Court of Chancery of this State, has interfered to restrain inspectors under the act for draining swamps and bog meadows, in the counties of <em>Orange </em>and <em>Dutchess, </em>(sess. 27. ch. 91.) and enjoined them perpetually in a case in which they had exceeded their powers. <em>(Belknap </em>v. <em>Belknap, </em>2 <em>Johns. Ch. Rep. </em>463.) And, in <em>England, </em>the instances of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>interference are numerous, and the cases more directly in point. They are, moieovei, recognized by the Chancellor m the authority last cited from Johnson. In the case of <em>Shand </em>v. <em>The Aberdeen Canal </em>Company, (2 Dow, 519.) Lord <em>Eldon </em>said, that it the Canal Commissioners exceeded their power, they became trespassers; but Chancery would restrain them by injunction, and keep them strictly within the limits of their power. The case of <em>Agar </em>v. <em>The Regent's Canal Company, (Cooper's </em>Eq. <em>Rep. </em>77.) shows, as his honour the Chancellor observes, in <em>Belknap </em>v. <em>Belknap, \u201c </em>that the jurisdiction on this subject is well settled, and in constant exercise; and that the cases maintain the most steady uniformity in their doctrine and relief.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-5\">It was contended, however, by the defendants\u2019 counsel, on the argument, that the injunction granted in the case should, at all events, be so modified, as to permit the taking away the materials already severed from the freehold ; as in cases of waste committed upon timber, where, subsequently to its being cut down, it has been suffered to remain on the land; but those are all cases of tenancy, in which the party, committing the waste, was in possession of the premises. (5 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>Rep. 170.) To permit \u00e1n entry in this case, for the purpose suggested, would, in effect, be to authorise a repetition of the trespass. As there are no facts to be settled, except the quantiy and value of the materials, which may be ascertained upon a reference, the whole controversy turns on the construction of the act of <em>April, </em>1817, and from the opinion which I entertain upon that question, I must deny the present motion, and order the injunction to be retained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-7\">The cause was set down for a hearing, before the Chaneellor, on the petition of appeal, and copies of proceedings, &amp;c., transmitted by the Circuit Judge, on notice for the purpose to the appellants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AdH0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number><em>Veile, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5h\">He cited 7 <em>Vesey, </em>310. 17 <em>Vesey, </em>110. 2 <em>Vesey, </em>jun. 415. 452. 2 <em>Atk. </em>483, 2 . <em>Johns.

The 10th section of the act declares, that \u201c the Circuit Judges shall have, within the limits of their respective circuits, concurrent jurisdiction with the Chancellor of this state, of all matters and causes in equity, of every description and character, subject, however, in all cases, to the appellate jurisdiction of the Chancellor.\u201d The 15th section declares, \u201c that it shall and may be lawful to appeal from any final decree of either of the Circuit Judges, to the Chancellor of this state, saving, however, to the party appealing, and to the appellee, before the Chancellor, all exceptions taken and reserved in the Court of the Circuit Judges, to any interlocutory order or decree. And it shall be lawful for either party to appeal to the Chancellor from any interlocutory decree of any Circuit Judge; but there shall be no appeal from any interlocutory decree of any Circuit Judge, before a final decree in the cause, unless such Circuit Judge shall certify that such interlocutory decree involves the merits of the cause, and that there may be ground for appealing ; and the Chancellor shall hear and decide such appeal, in a summary manner ; and if, by his decision, further proceedings in the same cause shall be necessary, the same shall be remanded to the Circuit Judge, for such further proceeding; and if the cause be remanded, no appeal shall be taken to the Court for the Trial of Impeachments and the Correction of Errors, from any decree Of the Chancellor, until such further proceedings and a final decree be had in the cause ; <em>andfurther, </em>that in all appeals from the said Circuit Judges, or either of them, to the Chancellor, it shall be the duty of the Circuit Judge, to return to the Chancellor all the proceedings had before him, including the testimony taken, and certified copies of all rules and orders, entered by direction of the said Court so appealed from; and that it shall be the duty of the Chancellor to proceed on such appeal, and pronounce judgment thereon ; and that it shall and may be lawful for the Chancellor to enforce his decree, in any cause so brought before him by appeal, and decided by him, in like manner as if the same had been originally commenced in the Court of Chancery; and that the time, form and mode of filing such appeals, shall be regulated by the Chancellor of this State, subject to alteration by the Legislature from time to time.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AC2\">The Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"AYK\">This is the case of an appeal from an interlocutory decree of the Circuit Judge, for the third circuit, sitting in equity, pronounced on the 21st of <em>July </em>instant, and by which decree, the injunction, allowed on the 15th, instant, is continued until the hearing. The reasons assigned in the order, for the continuance of the injunction, are, that the injury complained of in the bill is irreparable in its nature, and the matter set up in the answer insufficient for the justification of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">Under the 15th section of the judicial act of the last session, (sess. 46. ch. 182.) an appeal lies from an interlocutory decree of a Circuit Judge, providedthe Judge certifies that such decree involves the merits of the cause, and that there may be ground for appealing. The requisite certificate was given in this <em>case; </em>and as the Chancellor is directed, by the act, \u201c to hear and decide such appeal in a summary manner,\u201d I allowed the cause to be set down forthwith for hearing, upon what was deemed reasonable notice to the parties, under the circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">The order, continuing the injunction, overruled the two grounds, taken in support of the motion for dissolving the injunction, and which were,</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">1. The want of equity in the bilk</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>2. The sufficiency of the justification set up in the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">I. I have not been able to satisfy myself that the bill contains sufficient equity to warrant the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The bill contains a charge of trespass, by entering upon the land of the plaintiff, and digging, throwing up, and carrying away, large parcels of stone, from a ledge of stone and mass of rock on the premises. Several actions have been commenced in a Court of record to recover damages for this trespass; but it is not stated that any of these actions have been brought to trial. One action has likewise been instituted before a justice of the peace, and that action has been tried, and the plaintiff recovered damages to the amount of 25 dollars. The plaintiff has his complete and perfect remedy at law for the trespass, as often as it maybe repeated j and the only question is, whether the injury be so ruinous and irreparable as to call for the extraordinary interposition of a Court of equity. The bill does not pretend that the ledge of rock, upon which the trespass was committed, was of any particular use or value to the plaintiff, or that he ever did or ever intended to apply it to any valuable purpose. The plaintiff speaks of the injury as irreparable, because the loads of stone, taken from the mass of rock, cannot be replaced or restored; but as he does not state that the rock was of any use to him, as proper or fit for building, fencing, 8tc., or that it was even desirable as an object of ornament or taste, there was no need of having the same identical fragments of stone replaced, and the injury was not, in the sense of the law, irreparable. It was susceptible of a perfect pecuniary compensation. The case, therefore, seems to resolve itself into this single point, whether a Court of equity ought to interpose, by injunction, to restrain a trespass, when the injury does not appear to be irremediable and destructive to the estate, and when the ordinary legal remedy in the Courts of law can afford adequate satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>The <em>English </em>Court of Chancery is now in the habit of granting injunctions in trespass, when the case is peculiar and .special; and even this practice came into use long subsequent to the date of our revolution,/ As late as 1786, <em>(Mogg v. Mogg, Dickens, </em>670.) Lord <em>Thurlow </em>directed a search to be made, to see if ever there was an instance of an injunction, where a mere trespasser entered upon land and cut timber ; and as no such precedent could be found, he denied it even in a case of trespass in cutting down timber. But since that time, the practice has been introduced, and justly and reasonably applied to special cases, where irreparable ruin would have followed the refusal to injoin the trespass. It was allowed by Lord <em>Thurlow, </em>in <em>Fleming\u2019s </em>case, (cited 6 <em>Vesey, </em>147.) where the defendant had worked from his own land into the coal mine of the plaintiff; and that case was followed by Lord <em>Eldon, </em>(6 <em>Vesey, </em>147. 7 <em>Ves. </em>307.) on the principle that irreparable mischief and ruin of the property, <em>as a mine, </em>would be the consequence, if the party was not stopped. On the same ground, the injunction is granted against diverting a water course from a mill; (1 <em>Bro. </em>588.) against the destruction of timber; (10 <em>Vesey, </em>290.) against the taking of stones of a peculiar value; (17 <em>Vesey, </em>128.) or stones, from a quarry. (18 <em>Vesey, </em>184.) Butall these are cases of \u25a0 great and irremediable mischief, which damages could not compensate, because the mischief reaches to the very substance and value of the estate, and goes to the destruction of it in the character in which it is enjoyed. / The present case is, in no reasonable sense, analogous to those cases. The plaintiff does not aver, or show, that the \u201c ledge of stone and mass of rock,\u201d on which the trespass is committed, is of any essential use, or that he does or can apply itto any valuable purpose. It is very possible that this \u201c ledge of rock\u201d may be some precipitous, naked, barren hill, absolutely worthless for any other purpose than that to which the defendants apply it. j Is the case, then, to be compared to that of a lead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>or coal mine, or a quarry of marble, or a fine building, or precious stone, or a grove of timber, or a mill establishment, which the Court of Chancery has thought proper to protect from trespass and ruin, by the strong and menacing hand of an injunction ? Certainly not 5 and if the plaintiff is entitled to an injunction in this case, I do not see why every man, in possession of land, may not call for an injunction to protect him from his neighbour\u2019s trespasses in every possible case.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\">The objection to the injunction, in cases ' of private trespass, except under very special circumstances, is, that it would be productive of public inconvenience, by drawing cases of ordinary trespass within the cognizance of equity, and by calling forth, upon all occasions, its power to punish by attachment, fine and imprisonment, for a further commission of trespass, instead of the more gentle common law remedy by action, and the assessment of damages by a jury. In ordinary cases, this latter remedy has beets found amply sufficient for the protection of property ; and I do not think it advisable, upon any principle of justice or policy, to introduce the Chancery remedy as its substitute, except in strong and aggravated instances of trespass, which go to the destruction of the inheritance, or where the mischief is remediless. This was the opinion and doctrine which I had occasion to declare in the case of <em>Stevens </em>v. Beekman, (1 Johns. <em>Ch. Rep. </em>318.) and it appears to be the <em>English </em>doctrine, and the practice of this Court has been in conformity to it. I do not know a case in which an injunction has been granted to restrain a trespasser, <em>merely because he was a.trespasser, </em>without showing that the property itself was of peculiar value, and could not well admit of due recompense, and would be destroyed by repeated acts of trespass. In ordinary cases, the damages to be assessed by a jury will be adequate for a check and for a recompense. Every man is undoubtedly entitled to be protected in the possession and enjoyment of his pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>perty, though it may be of no intrinsic value. He may have on his land a large mound of useless stone or sand, which he may not deem worth the expense of enclosing, and yet it would be a trespass for any person to remove any portion of the stone or sand without his consent; and <em>he </em>would be entitled to his action, even though the damages were nominal. But would it be proper for this Court to assume cognizance of such a trespass, and lay the interdict of an injunction upon it ? I apprehend not.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">The bill, to which I am still confining myself, does not, except in a very imperfect manner, disclose the pretences or claim of right under which the trespass has been committed. It only states, that the defendants are engaged in building a dam in <em>Hudson\u2019s </em>river, near the north line of the city of <em>Troy, </em>and that the materials taken from the ledge of rock are applied to the dam; that one of the defendants acts as engineer in that operation, and that the defendants pretend that they are acting on behalf of this State, and by authority of the statutes, relative to canals. But admitting that the defendants do pretend to act by public authority in their commission of the trespass, it does not alter the principle; and the trespass itself must be of the character I have described, before a Court of equity can be called upon to interfere by injunction. All the cases referred to, were those in which the trespass went to the destruction of the property, as it had been held and enjoyed. In the case of <em>Agar </em>v. <em>The Regent\u2019s Canal </em>Company, <em>(Cooper\u2019s </em>Eq. <em>Rep. </em>77.) the defendants were empowered by a private act of Parliament to cut a canal; the line of the canal had been prescribed, and they departed from that line, and were carrying the canal through a garden and rickyard, and Lord <em>Eldon </em>allowed an injunction. So in the case of <em>Shand </em>v. Henderson, (2 <em>Dow, </em>519.) the <em>Aberdeen Canal Navigation Company </em>were charged with having taken and appropriated lands to their use, by unwarrantably deviating from the line particularly prescribed by sta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>tute, and an injunction to restrain the Canal Company within their limits, was admitted to be proper. But in both these cases, the companies were making a permanent appropriation of the land, and destroying the inheritance; and upon the acknowledged principle, in all the cases, it was necessary to restrain them. In the case, also, of <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>The Trustees of Merton College, </em>(1 <em>Vesey, </em>188. and <em>Belt\u2019s Supp.) </em>the commissioners of a turnpike company entered, took possession of, and were destroying, by digging for gravel, large garden grounds of the plaintiff, who was a gardener by trade. The turnpike act had specially excepted gardens, as well as orchards, planted walks, &amp;c\u201e$ and Lord <em>Hardwiclce </em>thought it a clear case of trespass, and of such a nature, that the plaintiff was entitled to seek his remedy by injunction, though he had his remedy at law. But he admitted, that if there had been any ground for doubt, whether or not the commissioners had authority, he would not have interposed until the doubt had been removed, and the matter finally determined at law. And it is to be observed, that here was the destruction of what a man was using <em>as his trade or livelihood.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-3\">Several cases have occurred in this Court, in which public trustees have been restrained by injunction from acts of trespass, but the acts were such as went to destroy the enjoyment of valuable property and privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Thus, in the case of <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>The Trustees of Newburgh, </em>(2 <em>Johns. Ch. Rep. </em>162.) the trustees were going to divert a stream of water that had flowed immemorialiy,' and had supplied the brickyard, the distillery, and mill erections of the plaintiff; and the case not being deemed within the provisions of the act in favour of those trustees, an injunction was granted. Afterwards, in <em>Belknap </em>v. <em>Belknap, </em>(2 <em>Johns. Ch. Rep. </em>463.) an injunction was allowed upon the same principle, of preventing a great and irreparable mischief. In that case, inspectors under an act of the Legislature for draining certain swamps <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>and bog meadows, for the benefit of some individuals, un\u00bb dertook to lower a large pond of 400 acres, by cutting down the outlet, which would destroy the value of the pond and outlet as a source of water for the use of mills established on the outlet. It was considered to be an interference not warranted by the statute, and to be a great and special trespass, leading to lasting mischief, and the destruction of the estate. It was further observed, that it was not a case which concerned the public, but one of mere private convenience and profit, and the act ought to be strictly construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\">These cases all show, that, in respect to acts of trespass committed upon land, even by persons in a public trust, under colour of law, the Court has not interfered by injunction, unless where the trespass was permanent, as well as grievous, or went to destroy the value of the property to the owner. It is not sufficient that the act be simply, <em>per </em>se, a trespass; but it must be a case of mischief and of irreparable ruin to the property, in the character in which it has been enjoyed. In all other cases, the common law remedy is deemed to be adequate, and perfectly competent to give compensation, as well as to deter and prevent the repetition of the trespass, by the exemplary damages which it will inflict.</p>\n<p id=\"AcAZ\">IA Court of equity will sometimes interfere, to prevent a multiplicity of suits, by a bill of peace. ] The principle is stated in <em>Lord Tenham </em>v. <em>Herbert, </em>(2 <em>Atk. </em>483.) and in <em>Eldridge </em>v. <em>Hill </em>Murray. (2 <em>Johns. Ch. Rep. </em>281.) But that is only in cases where the right is controverted by numerous persons, each standing on his own pretensions; and it has no application to the case of one or more persons choosing to persevere in acts of trespass, in despite of suits and recoveries against them. A troublesome man may vex and harass his neighbour, by throwing down his fences, and turning cattle upon his grounds, or by passing over ihem, or otherwise annoying him j but it is to be presumed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>that repeated recoveries for damages, with the punishment of costs, and such smart money as a jury would naturally give, would soon effectually correct any such disposition.ji At any rate, i do not know that a Court of equity has ever interfered merely to correct such a practice; and it would certainly require very strong evidence of the inefficacy of the ordinary legal remedies for compensation, as well as for correction, before this Court would venture to assume a jurisdiction hitherto unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">For these reasons, I am of opinion, that the bill itself does not contain matter sufficient to warrant or sustain the injunction; and that the plaintiff ought to have been left to his remedy at law. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">3. But, admitting that the injunction was warranted by the bill, the next question is, whether the answer does not contain a sufficient justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">It appears by the answer, that the defendants are employed by the Canal Commissioners to complete a lock and dam in the <em>Hudson river, </em>and that the work is carrying on under the direction of one of the defendants, who is the principal engineer employed on the <em>Champlain canal\u00a1 </em>and that by an agreement between the persons engaged to build the dam, and one of the Canal Commissioners, the materials for filling the dam were to be furnished from the rocky hill near the dam, and from which materials for that purpose had been previously taken without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">It further appears, that the erection and construction of the dam is absolutely necessary for the completion of the <em>Champlain canal, </em>because a part of the canal, upon the plan adopted by the Canal Commissioners, cannot be supplied with the necessary quantity of water in any other way; that the Commissioners have taken the possession and control of the dam, and the lock connected with it, upon the terms, and under the provision of the act, entitled, \u201c an act respecting the navigation of <em>Hudson\u2019s river </em>between <em>Tr\u00f3y and </em>Waterfordand that these works <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>are an essential part of the canal. It further appears, that the defendant, <em>Jerome, </em>the principal engineer, and in the employment of the Canal Commissioners, entered upon, and located a sufficient quantity of the rocky hill near the dam, for the purpose of procuring good and substantial materials for filling in the timber cribs in the dam, and the location was seen and approved of by the acting Canal Commissioner on the <em>Champlain canal; </em>that the stone have been taken along the foot of the hill, penetrating its steep side for about thirty feet; that the stone and rock broken up and taken away, are useless for building or fencing; and that there is sufficient, or nearly sufficient, stone already broken up upon the premises to complete the dam, the expense of breaking up of which cost upwards of 800 dollars; that the rock is not above 60 rods from the river, and it furnishes the most suitable and convenient materials, and can be taken with less injury to the owners than any other upon that side of the river. They admit the recovery before the Justice, but they insist upon their authority under the statute to take the stone, and that the recovery is erroneous; and they have already brought a <em>certiorari </em>for the purpose of having the judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">After the opinion which has been expressed upon the first point, it is not necessary, for the present disposition of the case, to give any decided opinion on the validity of the matter alluded to in the bill, and expressly set up in the answer by way of justification. It might, perhaps, be as well to avoid it altogether, inasmuch as the justification under the canal acts is a legal question, and which appears from the pleadings, to be pending at law. But as this second point was discussed and passed upon by the Court below, and as it has been raised and discussed before me, without objection, and is involved in the decree appealed from, and as the essential facts leading to that justification are founded on statute powers, and are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>controverted, it cannot be improper to take it into consideration ; and it would be required, if I am to pass in review the whole merits of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\">The Canal Commissioners, in the erection of the lock and dam in question, have the same powers that are conferred upon them in respect to the <em>Champlain canal. </em>By the act referred to in the answer, (sess. 44. c. 78.) the Canal Commissioners were authorized to complete the lock and dam, \u201c in order to connect the <em>Champlain canal </em>with sloop navigation,\u201d if they should deem it advisable, and should signify in writing their intention to do the <em>samp. </em>The answer avers that they have done <em>so. It </em>becomes, therefore, essentially part and parcel of the <em>Champlain canal, </em>and the real property appropriated for the site of the lock and its appendages, vests in the people of this State, on the completion of the lock and dam, and the Canal Commissioners are authorized to establish and collect tolls at the lock.</p>\n<p id=\"AD\">Assuming, then, as a clear and plain proposition, that the Canal Commissioners are vested with the same powers in the erection of this dam, as in the construction of works on any part of the line of the canals, they had a right to, .take possession of, and use the ledge of rock in question, for the construction of the dam. The 3d section of the act of the 15th of <em>April, </em>1817, <em>\u201c </em>respecting navigable communications between the great western and northern lakes and the <em>Atlantic </em>ocean,\u201d (sess. 40. c. 262.) declared, that it should be \u201c lawful for the Canal Commissioners), and each of them, by themselves, and by any and every superintendant, agent, and engineer, employed by them* to enter upon, take possession of, and use, all and singular any lands, waters and streams, neeessaKy for the proseeur tion of the improvements intended by this act; and to make all such canals, feeders, dykes, locks, dams, an;d other works and devices, as they may think proper for making said improvements, doing, nev\u00f1r\u00edhel^s.,. no -tiiinec.essary damage-.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>The case before us falls precisely within the words of this provision. The Commissioners, and those under them, may <em>enter upon and use any lands necessary for the prosecution of the improvements intended by the act. </em>The dam in question being connected with the <em>Ch'amplain canal, </em>is an improvement within the meaning of the act. What lands are necessary to be entered upon, and used, must rest in the judgment of the Commissioners, and all that can be required is, that they act with good faith, and with sound discretion. The word <em>\u201c </em>necessary\u201d does not mean absolute and indispensable, or that without the use of the land, in the given case, the work could not possibly go on. That would be the same as extreme necessity. The Legislature used the word in a more reasonable and popular sense. It is sufficient that the land used, and the materials taken from it, are needful, and conducive to the object, and more convenient in the application, and less valuable, and the use of them less injurious to the owner, than any that might readily be selected. There must, from the reason of the thing, and the nature of the case, be great latitude of discretion in the selection of the land and the materials; and, in the present case, it is perfectly apparent, that the Canal Commissioner located the ground from which the materials for filling in the dam were to be taken, with judgment, and according to the spirit and letter of the act. He did take care, as the act required, to do <em>no unnecessary damage. </em>The materials must have been taken from some adjoining land, and from whence could they have been taken with more discretion ?</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\">I cannot perceive any room for doubt, as to the power of the Commissioners to <em>enter upon and use </em>the ledge of rock in question^ for the purpose of making the dam. There is no avoiding this conclusion, unless we can maintain the construction, that the act only intended that the Commissioners might enter, use, and take possession of land, for <em>permanent appropriation </em>of the whole fee of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>land, and not for temporary use.' According to this construction, if they wanted room adjoining the canal, for a temporary deposit of materials for locks and dams, or a right of way or passage to the canal, or the materials of stone, gravel, clay, 8\u00bfc. from the adjoining lands, they could not use them, without at the same time appropriating the fee of the land. But why should the Commissioners be obliged to appropriate a greater interest in the adjoining land than is requisite for the public object; and what possible objection can there be to the construction, allowing them to make as much use of the adjoining grounds as should be necessary for the prosecution of the improvements, <em>and no more </em>? The precaution enjoined upon them, to do <em>no unnecessary </em>damage, seems to imply, that they v/ere authorized to make a temporary use of the lands. The act of 1816 authorized the Commissioners to explore and examine the lands contiguous to the probable course of the canal, and to cause surveys and levels to be taken. This necessarily implied a right of entry upon lands for these purposes. The act of 1820 (sess. 43. c. 202. s. 3.) also authorized them to enter upon any lands contiguous to the canals, or the works connected therewith, \u201c and to dig for, work, get, and carry away, and use, all such stone, gravel, clay, timber, and other materials, as might be necessary or proper, in their opinion, for <em>the reparation of the canals, </em>or the works connected therewith, doing as little damage thereby as the nature of the case would permit.\u201d The Commissioners would then be authorized to take the stone from the ledge of rock in question, to repair this dam in the <em>Hudson; </em>and can it be reasonably supposed, that the Legislature did not intend they should have this power for the necessary construction of the dam in the first instance ? The public utility is as much concerned in the exercise of the one power as of the other, and these several canal acts constitute a distinct code of statute law, and are to be taken and construed together, as being made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>in furtherance of one great, useful, and splendid public object, and which, in the language of the Legislature, in their act of 1817, will \u201c promote agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, mitigate the calamities of war, and enhance the blessings of peace, consolidate the union, and advance the prosperity and elevate the character of the <em>United States.\u201d </em>Statutes made for the public good, and for general and beneficent national purposes, are to receive a very liberal construction, and to be expounded in such a manner, as that they may, as far as possible, attain the end. The rule is, that they are to be so construed, as not to advance a private and destroy the public interest, but always to advance the public interest, doing as little damage as possible to the private interest. (11 <em>Co. </em>73. <em>b. Str. </em>253. 2 <em>Vern. </em>431.) So, it is a general rule of interpretation, that a greater will include a less interest; and a provision, as to more objects than one, includes a provision for one of those objects.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">I have no doubt, therefore, that under the general authority to <em>enter upon and use any lands necessary for the prosecution of the improvements, doing no unnecessary damage, </em>the commissioners, and the defendants, by their authority, might lawfully enter upon and use the ledge of rock in question for the building of the dam; and that a contrary construction is not only against the words, but is too narrow and too rigid for the liberal spirit and enlarged policy of i the act, and the immense pressure of the public interest. If there was ever a case in the ordinary pacific operations of government, in which all petty private interests should be made subservient to the interest of an entire people, this is one. The canals were undertaken <em>\u201c </em>in full confidence that the Congress of the <em>United States, </em>and the States equally interested with this State in the commencement, prosecution, and completion of these important works, would contribute their full proportion of the expense.\u201d We have not, as yet, realized the fruits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>of that confidence, and we are left to bear singly the whole expense, as well as to enjoy all the honour and glory of this stupendous undertaking. <em>We </em>have advanced too far to recede. The whole entire plan must and will be completed. All little impediments must be <em>surmounted; </em>and the powers of the Commissioners must be taken to be. as they were certainly intended to be, commensurate with the duties to be performed. In the language which I had occasion to use at the last session of the Court of Errors, in <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>and, as I presume, with the entire approbation of the Senate, \u201c we must take expressions in the most extensive sense, when it is probable the lawgiver had in view every thing pointed out by that extensive sense, and when we give to the expressions the sense most suitable to the subject, and best adapted to the facility and success of a great and generous scheme of public policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\">There is an additional provision in the 3d section of the act of 1817, which declares, \u201c that in case any lands, waters, or streams, taken and appropriated for any of the purposes aforesaid, shall not be given or granted to the people of this State,\u201d it shall be the duty of the Canal Commissioners to cause the loss and damage, if any, over and above the benefit and advantage to the owner, to be certified in the way pointed out, and the damages to be paid, and the fee simple of the premises so appropriated, shall vest in the people of this State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">This provision applies only to lands taken <em>and </em>appropriated, and which, I should rather think, means lands permanently applied, so as to be entirely lost to the owner, and not lands affording a temporary use for passage and deposit, or for procuring materials for the locks, dams, 8cc. But there is no suEcient reason to consider this latter part of the section as qualifying and controlling the general powers given in the former part of it. The general power is, to <em>enter upon and use all lands necessary for the proseen</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number><em>(ion of the improvements, and to make canals, feeders, locks, dams, fyc. doing, nevertheless, no unnecessary damage ; </em>and then comes the provision, that any lands taken <em>and appropriated </em>for any of the purposes aforesaid, shall be paid for and vest in the State. There was no need that the fee of lands used only for a temporary purpose, should be vested in the public. If the owner is paid for the damage occasioned by the temporary use of his lands, it is all that he can justly require, and this compensation the State is bound to give him. If the act we are examining has omitted to make any provision for the assessment and payment of damages for such temporary use, it may have escaped the attention of the Legislature, or the case may have been deemed, at the time, immaterial and unimportant. The omission, however, if it be one, does not prevent the right of the commissioners to enter and use the land; nor prevent the just claim of the owner upon the commissioners or the Legislature for his reasonable compensation. The commissioners are not trespassers, when the act authorizes them to enter, if they enter before the damages are paid for. This was so understood and declared, in <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>already referred to. The claim for compensation arises after the use has been had; and the damages cannot,well be assessed before they have arisen. Whatever, therefore, may be the better construction as to the mode of ascertaining and enforcing the compensation, it does not affect the right of the commissioners to enter, nor justify the interference of a Court of equity to interdict their entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\">It is probable the Legislature considered that the Canal Commissioners had sufficient discretionary power to pay for all damages arising from the temporary use of lands, upon which they might enter for the prosecution of the improvements, and the appropriation of materials, which they might derive from such use. Their discretion, in the expenditure of the canal moneys, is very large. They are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>EE to cause the same to be expended in the most prudent and economical manner, in all such works as may be proper to make the canals.\u201d And as they are to do no unnecessary damage, it was doubtless intended that all <em>necessary damage </em>should be paid for by them. The only difficulty in the case is, how to assess the damages when the parties cannot agree. If the lands are <em>appropriated </em>permanently by the transfer of the fee, or if materials are taken from adjoininglands for <em>reparations </em>of injuries to the canals, or the works connected therewith, the statute points out a specific mode of assessment. As all these canal statutes are to be taken and construed together, as being made <em>in pari </em>materia, the damages resulting from a temporary use of the land, fall within the equity of these provisions; and the Commissioners would be justified in adopting one of them, or the owner might, perhaps, by application to the Supreme Court, or to a Court of equity, enforce an assessment and payment, in the mode provided for in other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">But the question of compensation is distinct from the right of entry to take and use the land necessary for the purpose of the improvements ; and that right I hold t\u00f3 he unquestionable, provided it be not abused in the exercise, through the want of good faith or due discretion. If the Commissioners enter to procure necessary materials, and they keep within the limits of a reasonable discretion, and do no unnecessary damage, they come within the range of the strong powers conferred upon them, and their entry is justified by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">I am of opinion, therefore, on this second point, as well as on the other, that the injunction ought to be dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The case is interesting in every point of view; and I have examined it with all the care and diligence that the closing period of my office would permit. I regretted that the case pressed upon me at so late a moment; and I regret still more, that I should be obliged, in the very last act of my judicial life, to overrule one of the earliest decisions ic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>equity of one of my junior \"brethren, for whom I entertain a sincere respect, and to whom I look forward with confident expectation, for an administration of justice, pure and intelligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">I shall order that the interlocutory decree appealed from be reversed; that the injunction, issued by the Circuit Court,be dissolved) and that the cause be remanded, to the end that, such further proceedings may be had upon the bill filed in the Court below as shall be just.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Order accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
