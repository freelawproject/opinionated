Testator unquestionably had a definite intention respecting appellant\u2019s substitution and, in doubly providing, in three substitutionary provisions, for substitution of Mrs. Childs\u2019 <em>\u201c </em>lawful issue \u201d and \u201c or descendants,\u201d manifested his intention not to exclude but to substitute appellant. <em>(Munie </em>v. <em>Gruenewald, </em>289 Ill. 468; <em>Matter of Horn, </em>256 N. Y. 294; <em>Bourne </em>v. <em>Dorney, </em>227 N. Y. 641; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Brasington, </em>156 N. Y. 181; <em>Soper </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>136 N.

The \u201c separate and distinct \u201d trust under paragraph Seventh (B), and the provisions of paragraph Seventh (D), are inconsistent with exclusion of appellant, and conclusively establish her right to substitution. <em>(Gwyer </em>v. <em>Gwyer, </em>5 App. Div. 156, 160 N.

The explanation carefully made in paragraph Seventh (C) that testator intended that substitutionary provision for the benefit primarily of the \u201c lawful issue or descendants \u201d of the named beneficiary, is inconsistent with the exclusion of appellant and further conclusively establishes her right to substitution. <em>(Matter of Trevor, </em>239 N.

To determine \u201c whether or not\u201d appellant\u2019s substitution was intended requires a judicial ascertainment of testator\u2019s intent from .the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>whole will and surrounding circumstances; and the holding below that the proceeding was \u201c exclusively concerned with \u201d one subparagraph has precluded this. <em>(Matter of Title Guar. &amp; Trust Co., </em>195 N.

Instead of judicially ascertaining <em>\u201c </em>whether or not \u201d testator intended appellant to be substituted, both Surrogates and the Appellate Division have erroneously avoided and defeated this by holding that <em>\u201c </em>Section 115 * # * prohibits \u201d appellant <em>\u201c </em>from taking \u201d. <em>(Colton </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>67 N.

At the times both of appellant\u2019s adoption (1905) and when testator made his will (1917), testator was full owner of his property, entitled to dispose of it as he pleased; there were no <em>\u201c </em>rights of remaindermen \u201d for either a birth or an adoption to <em>\u201c </em>defeat \u201d; and the statute does not \u201c prohibit \u201d the bequest nor <em>\u201c </em>prohibit \u201d appellant <em>\u201c </em>from taking \u201d. <em>(Matter of Hoyt, </em>223 N.

The Surrogate has correctly construed paragraph Seventh (C) of the will, on the pleadings and record before him, to exclude appellants as secondary income beneficiaries of the trusts created by paragraphs Seventh (A) and (B) of the will, under the general rules for the construction of wills. The intention of the testator governs and the Surrogate has here found an intention that the adopted child, Alice Elizabeth Childs Lake, was not included in the descriptive class of \u201c lawful issue or descendant \u201d of the named beneficiary Alice A. Childs. <em>(Matter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number><em>of Barrett, </em>141 Misc. 637; <em>New York Life Ins. &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Viele, </em>161 N.

The Seventh (C) substitution formula applies equally to income beneficiaries of the Seventh (A) and (B) trusts and to beneficiaries of the Seventh (B) trust principal. Analysis of the pattern of both trusts demonstrates testator\u2019s intention that survivorship is required for participants in the (B) trust remainders. <em>(Matter of McCombs, </em>261 App. Div. 449, 287 N.

The Appellate Division correctly held that payments of costs and allowances must he made out of the corpus of the Alice S. Childs\u2019 trust. II. The only trust in issue is the subsidiary trust to which appellants have made claim, and the issue was created by the status of appellant Elizabeth Childs Lake. None of the other subsidiary trusts are involved in any way in the construction proceeding. III. The decree of the Surrogate was correct in directing disposition of the income and principal of the Alice S. Childs \u2019 trust, and should have been affirmed by the Appellate Division.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b404-6\">Fuld, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJHA\">Frederick Lawrence Upjohn died in December of 1917. By paragraph Seventh (A) of his will, executed some eleven months before his death, he directed that the income of one half of his residuary estate be paid to his wife during her life, and then, during the life of his grandnephew, Bobert Bed-path, to the beneficiaries named in Seventh (B). By the latter provision, the testator created seventeen separate trusts \u2014 in favor of nephews, nieces, grandnephews, grandnieces, and other persons \u2014 out of the remaining one half of the residue, and directed that the income of each be paid during Bedpath\u2019s life to the designated beneficiary. Mrs. Alice Childs, the testator\u2019s niece, was one of those beneficiaries. After making provision in Seventh (B) for the disposition of the corpus of the several trusts therein created, the testator provided in Seventh (C) that, if any beneficiary named in (B) was to die before the termination of the trust, the income payable to that beneficiary was to be paid, during the existence of the trust, \u201c to his or her lawful issue or descendants, if any * * * and in default of such issue or descendants surviving \u201d to the other designated beneficiaries; and, if any of the latter were then dead, to their \u201c lawful issue or descendants,\u201d in the same proportions as provided for the original shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>In 1905, Mrs. Childs and her husband, who never had any children of their own, adopted a two-month-old baby, Alice Elizabeth (now married, she is the appellant Mrs. Lake). The testator knew of the adoption, though with other members of the family he kept it secret. Upon Mrs. Childs\u2019 death in 1950, the trustees petitioned the Surrogate\u2019s Court to \u201c construe the provisions of Paragraph Seventh (C) e * * and determine \u201d whether or not Alice Elizabeth is the \u201c issue \u201d or \u201c descendant \u201d of Mrs. Childs, <em>\u201c </em>as such words are contained in said Paragraph Seventh (C) \u201d. The surrogate held that she is not, and the Appellate Division \u2014 though it modified the decree with respect to costs and allowances \u2014 agreed with that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Embodied in our adoption statute is the fundamental social concept that the relationship of parent and child, with all the personal and property rights incident to it, may be established, independently of blood ties, by operation of law, and that has been part of the public policy of this state since 1887 (Domestic Relations Law, \u00a7 115; L. 1887, ch. 703; cf. L. 1873, ch. 830). The statute unequivocally ordains that \u201c The foster parents or parent and the foster child shall sustain toward each other the legal relation of parent and child and shall have all the rights and be subject to all the duties of that relation including the rights of inheritance from each other.\u201d (Domestic Relations Law, \u00a7 115, 3d par.). By reason of that provision, we have held, \u201c the adopted child, in a legal sense, became the natural child of the adoptive parent.\u201d <em>(Carpenter </em>v. <em>Buffalo Gen. Elec. Co., </em>213 N. Y. 101, 108.) \u201c In the eye of the law, therefore, adopted children are lineal descendants of their foster parent. They are in the line of descent from him through the command of the statute, the same as if that line had been established by nature.\u201d <em>(Matter of Cook, </em>187 N. Y. 253, 261.) In harmony with the legislative policy thus expressed, the adoption statute has been most liberally and beneficently applied. It has been held that, where property is devised or bequeathed to a brother, sister, child .or descendant of the testator, and that person dies in the lifetime of the testator survived by a foster child, the devise or legacy does not lapse, but vests in the foster child \u2014 for the latter is a \u201c child \u201d or \u201c descendant \u201d of the legatee or devisee within the meaning of section 29 of the Decedent Estate Law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>(See <em>Matter of Walter, </em>270 N. Y. 201.) By the same token, a foster child, adopted subsequent to the execution of its foster parent\u2019s will, has a right, as a \u201c child born after the making of a last will \u201d, to an intestate share of the parent\u2019s estate if no reference is made to him in the instrument. (Decedent Estate Law, \u00a7 26; see <em>Matter of Guilmartin, </em>277 N. Y. 689; <em>Bourne </em>v. <em>Dorney, </em>184 App. Div. 476, affd. 227 N. Y. 641.) And an adopted child is entitled to the benefit of section 17 of the Decedent Estate Law, prohibiting devises or bequests of over half the testator\u2019s estate to charity in the event that he is survived by a \u201c child.\u201d (See <em>Matter of Mawhinney, </em>146 Misc. 30, affd. 239 App. Div. 874.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Wills, too, must be read and construed in harmony with the legislative policy of placing adopted children on a level with natural born offspring. (See <em>Gilliam </em>v. <em>Guaranty Trust Co., </em>186 N. Y. 127, 138; <em>Matter of Ellis, </em>178 Misc. 491, 492.) It is in that spirit that the question of construction before us \u2014 whether Alice Elizabeth is Mrs. Childs\u2019 \u201c issue \u201d or \u201c descendant,\u201d as those terms are used in paragraph Seventh (C) of the will \u2014 must be approached.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The limitation under consideration does not, contrary to respondents\u2019 contention, contain \u201c language that has acquired, through judicial decision, a definite and established significance \u201d. <em>(Matter of Krooss, </em>302 N. Y. 424, 428.) Terms such as \u201cissue\u201d, \u201clawful issue\u201d, \u201cdescendants\u201d \u2014 and the word \u2018 \u2018 children \u2019 \u2019, as well \u2014 may or may not include adopted children ; read alone, and apart from context, those words are ambiguous. If they are viewed in their historical sense, they do not include foster children, because adoption is purely a creature of statute, unknown to the common law. (See 3 Restatement, Property, \u00a7 265, comment <em>c; </em>\u00a7 287, comment <em>a.) </em>If, though, they are read in light of the adoption statute \u2014 as properly they may be (see <em>Munie </em>v. <em>Gruenewald, </em>289 Ill. 468, 472; <em>Mooney </em>v. <em>Tolles, </em>111 Conn. 1, 7) \u2014 they do include a foster child. As we have seen, the law places an adopted child on a plane of equality with a natural born child and in the line of descent from his foster parent. It has been said that the terms \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>issue \u2019 \u2019 and \u201c descendants \u201d \u201c probably carry a stronger connotation of blood relationship than the word \u2018 children \u2019 \u201d (Oler, Construction of Private Instruments Where Adopted Children Are Concerned, 43 Mich. L. Rev. 705, 727; see, also, 3 Powell, Real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Property [1952], p. 132), but that is not normally a factor of weight, in view of the known frequency with which testators employ \u201c issue \u201d and \u201c descendants \u201d as essentially synonymous with <em>\u201c </em>children \u201d and, certainly, in a sense no more restrictive or narrow. (See, e.g., <em>Pross </em>v. Anson, 273 App. Div. 860, affd. 298 N. Y. 718; <em>Matter of Fedders, </em>187 Misc. 207; <em>Mooney </em>v. <em>Tolles, supra, </em>111 Conn. 1; <em>Kindred </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>357 Mo. 564; <em>Matter of McEwan, </em>128 N. J. Eq. 140; see, also, Oler, <em>loc. cit.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">What the testator meant when he used the words \u201c issue \u201d and <em>\u201c </em>descendants \u201d is not to be decided <em>in vacuo. </em>It is impossible for a court to ascertain the meaning with which they were employed in a particular will without considering the context of the entire instrument and the background of facts and circumstances existing when the will was made. (Cf. <em>Matter of Title Guar. &amp; Trust Co., </em>195 N. Y. 339, 344.) The rule in this state, declared in <em>New York Life Ins. &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Viele </em>(161 N. Y. 11, 20), is that the limitation will be construed to designate only those related to the named ancestor by blood if <em>\u201c </em>there is nothing to the contrary to be found in the context of the instrument or in extraneous facts proper to be considered \u201d. In other words, in the absence of any indication of the testator\u2019s intent, it will be assumed that the testator did not envisage adopted children taking under the limitation. That, though, is a rule of construction and nothing more. Where the testator\u2019s design to include an adopted child is clear, the limitation will be construed <em>to </em>effectuate that intention. In our view, the present is such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Of surpassing significance is the fact that, when the testator drew the will, he had full knowledge of the adoption that had taken place eleven years earlier when Alice Elizabeth was two months old. Far more often than not, it is recognized, a testator <em>\u201c </em>accepts the situation and relationship which the adopting parents have created.\u201d <em>(Matter of McEwan, supra, </em>128 N. J. Eq. 140, 147.) Where it appears that he knew of the adoption, he is taken, therefore, to have intended inclusion of the adopted child, and his will is so construed, unless other language in the will or other circumstances reflect a different or contrary intention. (See <em>Matter of Horn, </em>256 N. Y. 294; <em>Dodin </em>v. <em>Dodin, </em>16 App. Div. 42, 47, affd. 162 N. Y. 635; <em>Matter of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number><em>Fedders, supra, </em>187 Misc. 207, 217; <em>Estate of Pierce, </em>32 Cal. 2d 265, 271; <em>Mooney </em>v. <em>Tolles, supra, </em>111 Conn. 1, 9-11; <em>Ansonia Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Kunkel, </em>105 Conn. 744; <em>Munie </em>v. <em>Gruenewald, supra, </em>289 Ill. 468, 472; <em>Bray </em>v. <em>Miles, </em>23 Ind. App. 432; <em>Mesecher </em>v. <em>Leir, </em>241 Ia. 818; <em>Matter of McEwan, supra, </em>128 N. J. Eq. 140, 147; <em>Smyth </em>v. <em>McKissick, </em>222 N. C. 644, 654-655; <em>Matter of Truman, </em>27 R. I. 209, 212; see, also, 3 Restatement, Property, \u00a7 287, subd. [2], cl. [b] and comment <em>g; </em>cf. \u00a7 292, comment <em>a; </em>3 Powell, <em>op cit., </em>pp. 124, 133-134, n. 78; 2 Simes, Law of Future Interests [1936], \u00a7 415, p. 223; Oler, Construction of Private Instruments Where Adopted Children Are Concerned, 43 Mich. L. Rev. 901, 909-911.) \u201c Thus,\u201d writes one commentator, \u201c if the adoption occurred before the execution of an instrument, such as a will or deed of trust, which made, provision for the adopter\u2019s children or issue, and the testator or settlor knew of the adoption, and particularly if he approved of it, the adoptee has usually been deemed to be within the designation. \u2019 \u2019 (Oler, <em>op. cit., </em>43 Mich. L. Rev. 901, 909.)</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">In the present case, the testator knew that Alice Elizabeth had, by force of the adoption, become his niece\u2019s child, her issue and descendant. Indeed, in view of Mrs. Childs \u2019 age \u2014 she was over forty years old \u2014 and her failure to have any natural born children during twenty years of marriage, the testator must have realized \u2014 even assuming that he did not know that his niece was physically incapable of bearing children \u2014 that Alice Elizabeth would in all probability be Mrs. Childs\u2019 <em>only </em>descendant. (See <em>Ansonia Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Kunkel, supra, </em>105 Conn. 744; <em>Bray </em>v. <em>Miles, supra, </em>23 Ind. App. 432; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>73 Me. 25; see, also, 3 Restatement, Property, \u00a7 287, comment g; cf. <em>Matter of Horn, supra, </em>256 N. Y. 294.) The designation \u201cissue\u201d and \u201c descendant,\u201d therefore, adequately and sufficiently identified the adopted Alice Elizabeth as a possible beneficiary of his bounty. Had he desired that she be excluded, he could and would have indicated that intention plainly and expressly.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Moreover, in view of the evidence of the testator\u2019s relationship with Alice Elizabeth and her foster parents, it is manifest that he could not have harbored a design to exclude her. The proof establishes that he was on intimate terms with his niece and her family. They often were house guests for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>extended periods at his Long Island home, and he was a frequent visitor of theirs. It was actually during a two-week stay with Alice Elizabeth and her parents at their New York City apartment that he drafted and executed the will before us. And the uncontradicted evidence \u2014 consisting largely of the testimony, against interest, of a grandniece of the testator, a childhood companion of Alice Elizabeth \u2014 reveals numerous instances of the testator\u2019s affection and generosity toward his niece\u2019s foster daughter and demonstrates that he regarded and treated her at least as favorably as the children of his other nieces and nephews. More, he actively sought, in concert with other members of the family, to conceal from her the fact that the Childs were not her natural parents. It casts considerable light on Alice Elizabeth\u2019s place in the family group that, as a result of these efforts of the Upjohn clan, she did not discover that she was an adopted child until 1950, thirty-three years after the execution of the will, when Mrs. Childs\u2019 death occasioned the present litigation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">We are drawn, then, to the conclusion that the only reasonable inference to be educed from the record is that the testator, in making his will, considered Alice Elizabeth to be his niece\u2019s \u201c issue \u201d and \u201c descendant,\u201d and intended that she be substituted as beneficiary of the Childs trust on her foster mother\u2019s death. And the plan of his dispositions supplies still further confirmation. The trust, it will be recalled, was measured, not by Mrs. Childs\u2019 life, but by the life of a third person, Robert Redpath. If the testator\u2019s niece had survived Redpath, the corpus of the trust would have vested in her under Seventh (B) and, on her death, Alice Elizabeth would in all probability have become owner of that portion of the estate by inheritance from her foster mother. The testator, of course, realized that, and there is no reason for assuming that he desired a different disposition of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>income if \u2014 as actually occurred \u2014 Mrs. Childs predeceased the measuring life. (Cf. <em>Munie </em>v. <em>Gruenewald, supra, </em>289 Ill. 468.) In this respect, the case before us differs materially from the <em>Viele </em>case <em>(supra, </em>161 N. Y. 11, 20-22), upon which respondents rely; there, as the court observed, the will itself clearly evidenced a design to exclude adopted children. It follows that the courts below erred in concluding that the testator\u2019s design was not to include the adopted child.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Nor may the exclusion of Alice Elizabeth be predicated upon section 115 of the Domestic Relations Law. The fourth paragraph of that section \u2014 which follows the clause, quoted above, declaring that foster parent and child \u201c shall sustain toward each other the legal relation of parent and child \u2019 \u2019 \u2014 provides : \u201c As respects the passing and limitation over of real or personal property dependent under the provisions of any instrument on the foster parent dying without heirs, the foster child is nor. deemed the child of the foster parent so as to defeat the rights of remaindermen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The motivation for this provision and its underlying rationale are clear. Designed to assure that the testator\u2019s intention be effected, it mandates that, where the testator has designated remaindermen to share in his estate in the event that a named individual dies without children or descendants, an adopted child of the latter may not, by force of the adoption law, be held to come within the class and thus defeat the remainders. The legislature was particularly concerned about the perpetration of fraud on the rights of remaindermen <em>\u201c </em>through an adoption for the very purpose of cutting out a remainder.\u201d <em>(Matter of Walter, supra, </em>270 N. Y. 201, 206.) As we wrote in <em>Matter of Horn (supra, </em>256 N. Y. 294, 297): \u201c Where the passing by limitation ow r of real or personal property is dependent on a parent dying without heirs or children, it would be very easy for a person having no child or children to adopt one and thus cut off the contingent remainder. The statute was aimed at such a possibility. Such is the reasoning in <em>Matter of Leask </em>[197 N. Y. 193].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">As we have seen, Frederick Lawrence Upjohn\u2019s intent to include Alice Elizabeth as \u201c lawful issue \u201d and \u201c descendant \u201d of Mrs. Childs is exceedingly clear and, for that reason, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>statute \u2014 designed \u201c to safeguard the intention of a testator \u201d, not to defeat it \u2014 does not apply. <em>(Matter of Walter, supra, </em>270 N. Y. 201, 206.) And the possibility of fraud, it must also be marked, is entirely absent. When he made his will, the testator knew full well of Alice Elizabeth\u2019s adoption years before. The words were at hand to announce that that adoption should not entitle her to share in his estate in preference to the remainder-men if that was really his wish or desire. The danger of fraud arises where the adoption takes place Avithout the testator\u2019s knowledge, especially when it occurs after his death. That was, Ave observe, the situation in <em>Matter of Leask, </em>197 N. Y. 193, and is one circumstance that thoroughly differentiates that case from the one under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In modifying the decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court, the Appellate D\u00cdA7ision provided that costs and allowances be paid out \u2022of the corpus of the Childs trust alone, rather than, as the surrogate had directed, out of the principal of all the Seventh (B) trusts, in the same proportions as each of those trusts bears to the total of the trust estates under said paragraph Seventh (B). In our view, since decision herein will have a practical bearing upon the construction of other provisions of the will, the surrogate properly exercised his discretion in making the direction that he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The order of the Appellate Division and the decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court should be reversed, and the matter remitted to the Surrogate\u2019s Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion, Avith costs in this court and in the Appellate Division to all parties appearing separately and filing separate briefs, payable out of the principal of all the trusts created and now existing under paragraph Seventh (B) in the same proportions as each trust bears to the total of the trust estates under said Seventh (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Loughran, Ch. J., Lewis, Conway, Desmond, Dye and Froessel, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Order reAmrsed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-6\">. It is perhaps of some significance that, although twelve of the seventeen persons designated by the will as beneficiaries of Seventh (B) trusts are still alive, only one, a grandnephew of the testator, who was a child when the will was executed, contests Alice Elizabeth\u2019s claim. The only other contestant is the special guardian appointed to represent the infants having contingent interests in the other Seventh (B) trusts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
