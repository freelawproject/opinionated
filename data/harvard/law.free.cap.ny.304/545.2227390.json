Special Term was in error in dismissing the complaint and the judgment of the Appellate Division sustaining Special Term is likewise erroneous. <em>(Bennett </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>116 N. Y. 584; <em>Oppenheim </em>v. <em>Kridel, </em>236 N. Y. 156; <em>Psota </em>v. <em>Long Island R. R. Co., </em>246 N. Y. 388.) II. Lack of precedent should not deprive a wife of the right to maintain an action for loss of consortium, for under the growth of the common law, a wrong can always be remedied. <em>(Woods </em>v. <em>Lancet, </em>303 N. Y. 349.) I'll. The contention of respondent in the lower appellate court and in opposition to the application for a review by the Court of Appeals that the wife has no cause of action under the Jones Act and the general maritime law is erroneous.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b578-5\"><em>Arthur M.

Whatever rights plaintiff has must be given to her by the maritime law. <em>(Robins Dry Dock &amp; Repair Co. </em>v. <em>Dahl, </em>1925 A. M. C. 182, 266 U.

The common law does not give a wife a cause of action against a defendant for injuries the defendant inflicted upon the husband by negligence. <em>(Maloy </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>169 Misc. 964; <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>30 Misc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>336; <em>Oppenheim </em>v. <em>Kridel, </em>236 N.

That alleged breach of duty by the defendant was a maritime tort. As' such it cannot serve as a basis for plaintiff\u2019s complaint which demands relief of a character not within the purview of the 1920 amendment of the Merchant Marine Act (\u201cJones Act\u201d) (41 U. S. Stat. 1007; U. S. Code, tit. 46, \u00a7 688). Upon that subject the United States Supreme Court has had occasion to state \u2014 <em>*1 </em>This Court has specifically held that the Jones Act is to have a uniform application throughout the country, unaffected by <em>\u2018 </em>local views of common law rules.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Garrett </em>v. <em>Moore-McCormack Co., </em>317 U.
