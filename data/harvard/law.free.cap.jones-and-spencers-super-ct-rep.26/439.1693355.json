It made a mortgage whereby it purported to mortgage the right of seizure, occupation and possession, for the purpose of constructing and maintaining an underground double tract railway, of certain lands, premises and grounds in the city of New York, in, on, and under which the main line of the said railway is located, and which line extends from the City Hall park to and beyond Forty-fifth street by a route described as follows, namely: commencing in the City Hall park, on the easterly line of Broadway; thence easterly passing in front and in rear of the old City Hall to Centre street; thence under and across Centre street to City Hall place; thence through City Hall place to Pearl street; thence across Pearl street northeasterly' in a curved line to or near Mulberry street at a point between Bayard and Park streets; thence northerly under Mulberry street to Bleeeker street, and continuing northerly to and under Lafayette place to Astor place; thence northerly and easterly under Astor place, Eighth street and across the southeast corner of the block between Eighth and Ninth streets and easterly of St. Ann\u2019s Church, to and under Fourth avenue; thence northerly under Fourth Avenue and Fourteenth street and Fourth Avenue to and under Union square; thence northerly in, under and through Union square to and under Seventeenth street; thence northerly, bearing easterly in a straight line to and under and across Twenty-third street, to and in, under and through Madison square and continuing northerly in, under, on, over and upon Madison avenue to and along the Harlem river. This mortgage was foreclosed, and on the foreclosure sale Origon Yandenburgh and Harvey Sheldon purchased the property purported to be mortgaged, and the same was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>conveyed to them on March 7, 1876. On the 19th of July, 1880, pursuant to chapter 469 of the Laws of 1873, as amended by chapter 113 of the Laws of 1880, the said Yandenburgh and Sheldon duly associated with themselves other persons and organized a corporation under the name of the New York Underground Bailway Company, and Vanderburgh and Sheldon conveyed to that company all that passed to them under the conveyance made under said foreclosure sale.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b460-5\">The commissioner of public works of the city of New York having refused to grant to the New York Underground Bailway Company a permit to open the streets on the line of said railroad, that corporation appealed to the court for a mandamus compelling him to do so. The corporation had not obtained the consent of the majority of the owners in value of the property bounded on the line of the road, nor that of the proper local authorities having control over the streets, to the building of the road. There was no proof that it was the intention of the corporation to construct and operate the road, or that it had, or controlled sufficient pecuniary means to construct it. No map was filed specifically defining the route, and no such specified definition or determination appeared in the case; it appeared that the attorney-general had brought an action (which was still pending) for a dissolution of the relator\u2019s company on the ground of forfeiture by reason of non-user and lapse of time.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b460-6\">Held,\u2014That under the acts the relator had shown neither a clear legal right to, nor the necessity for, the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandamus at the present time, and, therefore, the application for such a writ was properly denied.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b460-7\">That the act of 1873, was as to railroad corporations supplementary to the general railroad act of 1850, chapter 140, and, therefore, the New York Underground Bailway Company, being organized under it, was subject to the provisions of chapter 582 of the Laws of 1880, which enacted that all railroad corporations theretofore or thereafter formed under chapter 140 of the act of 1850, and all acts supplementary thereto and amendatory thereof, should be subject to its provisions. \u2014Fbeedman, J., at Special Term.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b460-8\">That the New York City Central Underground Bailway Company, being organized under chapter 230 of the Laws of 1868, was by the third section of that act subjected to all the provisions of the general railroad act, chapter 140 laws of 1850, and the several .acts amendatory thereof and additional thereto, and for that reason it was subject to the provisions of chapter 582 of the Laws of 1880, and the New York Underground Bailway Company taking under a foreclosure of a mortgage made by the New York City Central Underground Bailway Company could take no greater\" rights than that company possessed. \u2014Ebeedman, J., at Special Term.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b460-9\">As a result from these propositions that the New York Underground Bailway Company was subject to the provisions of chapter 582, of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Laws of 1880, requiring a railroad corporation, before building its road or any part thereof under any of the streets, roads or public place of any city in this state, to obtain the consent of the owners of one-half in value of the property bounded on the line of the road and of the proper authorities having control of the streets under or through'which it ran.\u2014Freedman, J., at Special Term.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b461-5\">That under \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 48 of the general railroad act (Laws of 1850, chap. 140) and \u00a7 8 of title 3 of chapter 18, part 1 R.

The relator is not forbidden by chapter 582 of the Laws of 1880, from building its railroad, until it has obtained the consent of certain property owners and local authorities. First.\u2014That act does not apply to this person\u2014the New York Underground Railway Company. First, because no such person is described in the act. The relator was not formed under any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>special act. The Act of 1868 created only the New York City Central Underground Railway Company, which is still living, and the relator is another, and quite a different <em>person. </em>People, <em>ex rel. </em>Schurz <em>v. </em>Cook, 110 <em>N. Y. </em>443, 449. The relator was not formed under the Act of 1850, nor any act \u201c amendatory thereof.\u201d That is not argued. It is claimed, however, that it was formed under an act \u201c supplementary thereto.\u201d That this is not so, will, it is submitted, quite plainly appear from the following : The act under which the relator was formed is chapter 469 of the Laws of 1873, as amended by chapter 113 of the Laws of 1880, which provides for the incorporation of purchasers of property of corporations which have been sold under mortgage. It applies to all corporations. A college is said to have been reorganized under it. The first criticism that is to be made, is that if the Law of 1873 is an act supplementary to the general railroad act, it must also and in the same literal sense be an act supplementary not only to all the other general corporation acts, but also to each special charter. That is to say, it is just as much \u201c supplementary \u201d to the act chartering the Bank of New York as it. is to the general railroad act. Suppose the Bank of New York to be reorganized, it would hardly be argued that the new bank would be subject to all the provisions of any act which might provide things about all corporations formed under acts \u201c supplementary \u201d to the general railroad act, and, for the reason, that the new bank would not have been \u201c formed \u201d under the Act of 1873 as supplementary to the general railroad act, because the old bank had nothing to do with it. The same rule and reason apply here. It is held that the general railroad act applies only to steam railroads in the country, and not to street railroads in cities. N. Y. Cable Co. <em>v. </em>The Mayor, etc., 104 <em>N. Y. </em>1, 14. And there is an express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>statute which prevents its application to any railroad of any kind in the city of New York, chap. 10, Laws of 1860. So far as this corporation is concerned, therefore, the Act of 1873 was not \u201c supplementary \u201d to the Act of 1850. When chapter 582, Laws 1880, was passed, there were provisions, consisting of five enactments, providing, with great minuteness and elaborate detail, for the reorganization of steam railroads in the country, all, of course, supplementary to the general railroad act. And one act for the reorganization of all corporations, conferring a few of the privileges provided for the railroad reorganization acts, and nothing not in those acts. And both classes of acts had been amended at that same session so that the legislature had the difference in their provisions, and in the persons to which they applied, fresh in its mind. Laws 1854, ch. 282 ; Laws 1873, ch. 710 ; Laws 1874, ch. 430 ; Laws 1876, ch. 466 ; Laws 1880, ch. 155. It follows that the general corporation act of 1873, under which the relator was organized, is not an act \u201c supplementary \u201d to the general railroad act. People <em>v. </em>B. F. &amp; C. I. Ry. Co., 89 <em>N. Y. </em>75, 84. The relator is not, therefore, one of the persons described by the language used in the Act of 1880. But as this is an act which it is claimed takes away a private, existing right, we are entitled to have it construed strictly. <em>Maxwell\u2019s Interpretation of </em>Statutes, 346 ; <em>Endlich\u2019s Maxwell, </em>\u00a7 340 ; <em>Bishop on Written Laws, </em>\u00a7 192. \u201c Strict \u201d construction means, at the least, that the statute shall not go beyond the letter\u2014not go further than the meaning in words. <em>Bishop, </em>\u00a7 194 ; <em>Smith's Com., </em>p. 606, \u00a7 446 ; <em>Endlich\u2019s Maxwell, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 127, 329; Hasbrook <em>v. </em>Paddock, 1 <em>Barb. </em>635, 641-2. Secondly. \u2014The act, by its letter, applies only to companies whose roads should be \u201c wholly underground.\u201d But this railroad is to be partly in open cut, and partly elevated. It therefore does not apply. Thirdly.\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Neither is the relator within the spirit of the act. The act was plainly intended to confer upon corporations, which otherwise would not have such powers, the power to build and operate railroads under ground. And the proviso requiring the consent of property owners was added, because of the constitutional requirement, by which otherwise the grant of such new powers would not be good. It was intended to confer powers, not to take them away. And thus to apply only to corporations which did not already and from other sources possess the same powers. But Messrs. Yandenburgh and Sheldon, who then owned the franchises in question, had then the right to form a corporation, as they afterwards did, which would possess all these powers and greatly more. Therefore the act was not intended to apply. Fourthly.\u2014No rights can be taken away by such general words. The Acts of 1868 and 1869 had given to the old company, by a grant from the owner of the soil, an easement in the soil, which was property. Milhau <em>v. </em>Sharp, 27 <em>N. Y. </em>611, 620-622 ; Sixth Ave. R. R. Co. v. Kerr, 72 <em>lb. </em>330, 332 ; The Mayor v. Second Ave. R. R. Co., 32 <em>lb. </em>261, 272. And also a franchise to so use the public highways, which was and is also property. The Mayor v. Second Ave. R. R. Co., 32 <em>N. Y. </em>261, 272-3 ; Brooklyn Central R. R. Co. v. B. City R. R. Co., 32 <em>Barb. </em>358, 363 ; Davis v. The Mayor, <em>14 N. Y. </em>506, 523-4 ; Milhau v. Sharp, 27 <em>lb. </em>611, 618-20. Neither of these things was personal to the corporation to which it was given, but afterwards became the property of human beings and can so become again. People v. O\u2019Brien, 111 <em>N. </em>Y. 1, 44-53. If such property is to be destroyed, assuming the power to do it, the legislature must unmistakably say so, and general words are not enough. <em>Sedgwick, Stat. &amp; Cons. Law </em>(ed. 1874), 361 ; Main v. Green, 32 <em>Barb. </em>448 ; Berley v. Rampacher, 5 <em>Duer, </em>183, 187 ; <em>Matter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number><em>of </em>B. &amp; A. R. R. Co., 53 <em>N.

Fifthly.\u2014The restriction claimed is by way of proviso only, but a proviso, as Justice Baldwin says in Voorhees v. U. S. Bank, 10 <em>Pet. </em>449, 471, is simply a \u201c limitation or exception to a grant made or authority conferred, the effect of which is to declare that the one shall not operate nor the other be exercised unless in the case provided.\u201d <em>Potter's Dwarris, </em>128, note 11 ; <em>Sedgwick, </em>49 (ed. 1874) ; <em>Bishop, </em>\u00a7 57. As the grant here does not operate, the restriction does not operate either. Sixthly.\u2014The restriction itself is unconstitutional. It is (italics ours) : the \u201cconsent of the owners of one half in value of the property <em>bounded on the line.\" </em>Sec. 17 of Art. III. of the Constitution contains the following (italics ours) : \u201c Consent of the owners of one half in value of the property bounded on <em>that portion of a - street or highway </em>upon which it is proposed to construct or operate such railroad.\u201d The consent of one half the owners \u201c on the line \u201d does not satisfy the Constitution. The owners of one half of each street must consent. Hilton <em>v. </em>Thirty-fourth Street R. R. Co., 1 <em>How. </em>N. <em>S. </em>453. This is a street railroad. <em>Matter of </em>N. Y. District Ry. Co., 107 <em>N. Y. </em>42. And the unconstitutional part cannot be separated from the rest. <em>lb. </em>54-5. The answer to this argument which is made in the opinion of the special term is, it is respectfully submitted, inapplicable. That answer is, that as the relator took only the rights and franchises of the New York City Central Underground Company, and that as those rights had been conferred prior to the adoption of the Constitutional amendment of 1875, that amendment does not apply. But the Act of 1880 does not apply to rights and franchises at all. It relates solely to persons. At the time of its passage the rights and franchises were held by two human beings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>\u2014Vandenburgh and Sheldon\u2014and, of course, it is beyond all question that the act did not apply to them, or to anything in their hands.. After the passage of the Act of 1880, the present relator was created, and the question is whether the Act of 1880 applies to it. This question is obviously unaffected by the fact that Vandenburgh.and Sheldon after-wards conveyed the rights and franchises to it. If they had never conveyed anything to it, the question would have been the same, <em>i. </em>ei.does the Act of 1880 describe such a person as the relator ? If, therefore, the above provision of the Act of 1880 be unconstitutional, as it is submitted that it plainly is, it cannot affect the relator. Lastly.\u2014The legislature has no power to impose such a burden\u2014because no such power has been reserved\u2014and the relator is therefore protected by the Constitution of the United States, as construed in the Dartmouth College case. The Acts of 1868 and 1869, as already stated, granted to the artificial person which was created by that act an easement in the soil, and a franchise to so use, as granted in the easement, the public highways. Both of those things were and are property in no way dependent upon the life of the artificial person to which they were originally granted. With the power of the legislature to deal with that artificial person we have here no concern. But so far as that easement and that franchise are concerned,' the power reserved in the Act of 1868 (\u00a7 15)\u2014\u201c to alter, amend or repeal\u201d that \u201cact\u201d\u2014is <em>not </em>sufficient to render them liable to destruction or modification by the legislature. People <em>v. </em>O\u2019Brien, 111 <em>N. Y. </em>1, 45, 48-55. It remains to inquire whether the legislature can deal with the person owning that easement and that franchise. With the persons of Messrs. Vandenburgh and Sheldon, who owned it when the Act of 1880 was passed, the legislature, of course, could do nothing. The relator was formed under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>the Act of 1873, but that act contains no reservation of power at all. We are, therefore, to go to the Constitution. But the provision of the Constitution is (italics ours) : \u201c Corporations may be formed under <em>general </em>laws.\u201d * * * \u201c All <em>general </em>laws and special acts passed pursuant to this section may be altered from time to time or repealed \u201d (Art. VIII, sec. 1). But this does not reserve any power of interference with a corporation formed under the act, \u201c <em>so long as the act stood unrepealed.\u201d </em>People <em>v. </em>O\u2019Brien, 111 <em>N. Y. </em>1, 47-55. The case of People <em>ex </em>rel. New York Electric Lines <em>v. </em>Squire, 107 <em>N. Y. </em>593, has no application, because, first, there was nothing but a police regulation contemplated, and the court put its decision expressly upon that ground (pp. 603-7); and, secondly, the general manufacturing act, under which that company was formed, reserves sufficient power. The case of Miller <em>v. </em>State, 15 <em>Wall. </em>478, cited, in the opinion of the court, is wholly inapplicable. The railroad company there under consideration was formed under the general railroad act of 1850 ; and it cannot be successfully contended but what that act contains a sufficient express reservation (\u00a7 48), and the decision goes upon that ground (p. 493). It is respectfully submitted also that the distinction taken in the opinion between the grant with the road unbuilt and the same grant after the road has been built, is unsound. The grant, as it is, is an easement and property, just as much property as if the road were built. Milhau <em>v. </em>Sharp, 27 <em>N. Y. </em>611, 620-622 ; Sixth Ave. R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Kerr, 72 <em>lb. </em>330, 332 ; Mayor <em>v. </em>Second Ave. R. R. Co., 32 <em>lb. </em>261, 272.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-6\">II. The objections that it is not proved that the relator in good faith intends to build the road, and has not sufficient financial .means, are of no force. (1.) The Metropolitan Transit Co. case, 111 <em>N. Y. </em>588, is supposed to support this proposition. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>was an application to take lands, by the right of eminent domain, under section 14 of the general railroad act, and that section expressly requires those things to be alleged in the petition. They are required to be alleged and proved only in that one proceeding. <em>Matter of </em>Lockport and Buffalo R. R. Co., 77 <em>N. Y. </em>557, 561-2. And expressly as to this corporation by the Act of 1868, chap. 230, \u00a7 6. (2.) The issue was tendered by the answer only, and the defendants have failed to prove it. There is nothing about it in the verdict. It is, therefore, not in the case\u2014for (3.) The only other way in which the question could have been raised would have been by a seasonable motion on the part of the defendants to dismiss the writ, because it did not contain such an allegation. No such motion having been made, it is now too late, even if it were sound. Flora <em>v. </em>Corbean, 38 <em>N. Y. </em>111, 113.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-6\">TIT. The application is sufficiently precise as to the parts of the streets to be opened. (1.) The learned judge at special term is in error in the assumption that no maps are filed. They are so filed. It is true they are not returned with the verdict, but that does not alter the fact. The particular route and plans have been adopted, and the application for the permit was made with express reference to it. (2). The application is for a permit to construct according to the provisions and under the limitations of the charter. These provisions grant the power to enter upon and underneath the streets \u201c along the route and to the points herein specified,\u201d and the excavations are not to be opened at any one time nor more than one in each quarter mile, nor more than two hundred and fifty feet in any one place, nor open longer than for a period of sixty days, and there are other details (Laws 1869, chap. 824, \u00a7 2). The description of the route is quite sufficiently distinct and precise so far as the streets are concerned; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>all the ambiguities specified, which were created by the permission to choose between alternative lines at certain places, having been removed by the choice having been made and the line adopted as described in the verdict. Under such circumstances no map is required. <em>Matter of </em>Coney Island and Brooklyn R. R. Co., 12 <em>Hun, </em>451 ; <em>Matter of </em>P. P. &amp; C. I. R. R., 67 <em>N. Y. </em>371, 376. Nor is a map ever required, except for the purpose of the taking of land by the right of eminent domain under the general railroad act. <em>Matter of </em>Lockport and Buffalo R. R. Co., 77 <em>N. Y. </em>557, 561-2 ; <em>Matter of </em>N. Y. L. E. &amp; W. R. R. Co., 110 <em>lb. </em>374. And in this particular case the necessity for all such things is expressly dispensed with by the act itself (ch. 230, \u00a7 6, Laws of 1868). (3.) Whatever may be the case as to the rest of the route, this objection cannot possibly apply to Lafayette place to which a separate demand was made for a permit, and a separate mandamus is prayed for. This is precisely within the language of the act construed in <em>Matter of </em>P. P. &amp; C. I. R. R. Co., 67 <em>N.

That the attorney-general has brought a suit to kill the relator establishes the fact that the relator now lives. (2.) Counsel applied in that action to the special term of the Supreme Court for an injunction to stop this proceeding and that court denied their motion upon our stipulating not to open the streets under the permit Which we should get, by virtue of a judgment in this proceeding, until we had defeated the attorney-general\u2019s action.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b469-7\"><em>William H.

The relator has no right to occupy the streets of the city of New York for the construction and operation of an underground railway without the consent of a majority of the owners of property abutting on such streets, and the consent of the local authorities. Such consent is required by chapter 582. of the Laws of 1880, section 1. The Act of 1880 has been heretofore determined by the Court of Appeals to be unconstitutional, in so far as it provides that an order of the general term may be taken in lieu of the consent of local authorities. <em>Matter of </em>N. Y. District Railway, 107 <em>N. Y. </em>54. But, in so far as the act provides that a tunnel and railway may not be built without the consent of property-owners and local authorities, or the order of the general term in lieu of the consent of property owners, it remains unaffected by that decision and the conditions prescribed by it are obligatory upon all railroad companies desiring to construct underground railways. The relator seeks to avoid the application of this statute to its railway by two arguments, namely : First\u2014The relator argues that it has not been formed under any special act of the legislature, or under the general railroad act or any act supplementary thereto or amendatory thereof, and therefore it claims exemption from the provisions of the Act of 1830. The defendants controvert this position as follows : It is conceded that the New York Underground Railway Company, the relator, was formed under the provisions of chapter 469, Laws of 1873, page 724. The Act of 1873 is an act supplementary to and amendatory of the general railroad act of 1850, although its title makes no reference to the last-named act. The provisions of the Act of 1873 originated in chapter 282 of the Laws of 1854, which is entitled \u201c An act to amend the act entitled \u2018 An act to,authorize the formation of railroad corporations and to regulate the same,\u2019 \u201d passed April 2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>1850. Prior to the enactment of the Act of 1854 the difficulty had arisen that individual purchasers of railroad franchises, possessing in themselves no corporate powers, and failing to acquire by the foreclosure sale the right to be a corporation, and to succeed to the corporate life of a former corporation, found themselves in the awkward predicament of owning a property which they could not use, and might not be able to sell. In the People <em>v. </em>Brooklyn, Flatbush &amp; Coney Island Railway Company, 89 <em>N. Y. </em>84, Judge Finch says it was to cure this difficulty that the Act of 1854 and its subsequent amendments were enacted. The Act of 1854 was confined in its operation to railroad corporations. The Act of 1873 is, however, a general act not confined in its operation to railroad corporations, but applicable to all corporations. Its title therefore does not refer to the general railroad act ; it, however, supplements and amends the railroad act, and its provisions are a substitute for and extension of the Act of 1854. The Act of 1873 is therefore supplementary to and amendatory of the existing act in relation to the formation of railroads, and also in relation to other corporations. It is supplementary to both, and is none the less an amendment and supplement of the general railroad act, although its title does not, in terms, recite that act. The character of the act, whether it be amendatory and supplementary to the general railroad act, is determined by its provisions, and not by its title. It is a general act, and therefore might have been enacted without any title. People <em>v. </em>McCann, 16 N. <em>Y. </em>61. It is therefore immaterial whether its title recites the general railroad act or not. In People v. Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island Railroad Company, above cited, the Act of 1873 is enumerated as an amendment of the Act of 1854, which as we have seen, was specifially entitled \u201c act to amend the general railroad act.\u201d The statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>1880 enumerates two kinds of corporations : first, those created directly by act of the legislature ; secondly, those formed or incorporated under the general railroad act or acts supplementary thereto. The relator, as we have seen, is incorporated under the Act of 1873, which is a general act. The act, chapter 582 of the Laws of 1880, imposes the condition of procuring consent of property-owners, and of local authorities, upon all companies desiring to build underground railways, whether theretofore or thereafter formed, under special acts of the legislature, or under the general railroad act, or under acts supplementary thereto or amendatory thereof. Clearly, the relator, incorporated under the Act of 1873, has come into existence by virtue of an act supplementary to the general railroad act. <em>Second </em>\u2014The relator next argues that the Act of 1880 cannot prescribe conditions of the exercise of its\u2019 franchise which it is bound to observe, contending that to impose the condition of procuring assent of property-owners and of local authorities as a condition of exercising a franchise previously granted, impairs the obligations of the contract, and destroys its vested rights. It is clear that this contention cannot be sustained. The corporate powers and franchises to which the relator has succeeded, originated in the Act of 1868, chapter 250 and by section 3 of that act the corporation was subject to the provisions of the general railroad act. Section 1 of the general railroad act provides that the corporations organized thereunder shall be subject to the provisions contained in title 3 of chapter 18, first part of the <em>Revised </em>Statutes, and among the provisions therein contained is this : \u201c The charter, of every corporation that shall hereafter be granted by the legislature shall be subject to alteration, suspension or repeal in the discretion of the legislature \u201d (sec. 8). Section 48 of the general railroad act of 1850, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>also provides : \u201c The legislature may at any time annul or dissolve any corporation formed under this act.\u201d Article 8, section 1, of the Constitution provides : \u201c Corporations may be formed under general laws ; but .shall not be created by special act, except for municipal purposes, and in cases where, in the judgment of the legislature, the object of the corporation cannot be obtained under general laws. All general laws and special acts passed pursuant to this section may be altered from time, to timo or repealed.\u201d The power reserved by these statutory enactments and constitutional provisions is ample to authorize the legislature to impose the additional condition upon the relator requiring it to procure the assent of the property-owners before building its railway. The legislature of a state is authorized to alter the charter of a corporation or interfere with its management, and impose conditions upon the exercise of its powers so far as the welfare and convenience of the public may require. <em>Morawetz on Corporations, </em>\u00a7 1098. The legislature has not undertaken to deprive the corporation of any power. It has simply imposed a condition of the exercise of the power ; and such condition is of a nature calculated to serve the public welfare, and is a proper regulation in respect to the exercise of a franchise affecting the public. Such conditions may be imposed. Mayor <em>v. </em>Twenty-third Street Railway Company, 113 <em>N. Y. </em>311 ; People <em>v. </em>O\u2019Brien, 111 <em>lb. </em>1 ; People <em>v. </em>Hills, 44 <em>Barb. </em>340. Miller <em>v. </em>People of the State of New York, 15 <em>Wall. U. S. </em>478, decides only that the legislature may not destroy rights of third parties, arising under contracts with a corporation by directing the dissolution of the corporation and the sale of its property. The legislature, in the Act of 1880, has not undertaken to impair or destroy the property of third persons secured by contracts with the corporation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>It has only undertaken to impose a valid condition to be observed by the corporation in the exercise of its corporate franchise, as was the case in Tomlinson <em>v. </em>Jessup, 15 <em>Wall. </em>454 ; Sinking Fund Cases, 99 <em>U. S. Reports, </em>700. (See cases cited, 113 <em>N. Y. </em>318.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b474-5\">II. The return to the alternative writ tendered an issue, by a denial that it is the intention of the company in good faith to construct, operate and maintain a railroad on the line mentioned in said writ. The defendants also averred in their return that the relator company does not control sufficient pecuniary means to perform the work proposed, etc. The issues thus tendered are material to the maintenance of any right on the part of the relator to relief at the hands of the court. <em>Matter of the </em>Metropolitan Transit Company, 111 <em>N. Y. </em>599. It was, therefore, the duty of the relator in the case at bar, upon the issue raised by the return, to offer evidence at the trial, and secure a finding that it did, in good faith, intend to build its road and had means therefor. In the absence of such a finding, upon the pleadings before the court, it must be held that the relator has not made out its case, and in the absence of such a finding cannot prevail, and is not entitled to the mandamus.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b474-6\">III. The peremptory writ will not be granted herein because the relator fails to show a clear legal right. People <em>v. </em>Supervisors of Chenango, 11 <em>N.

This motion was founded on the alternative writ of mandamus theretofore granted, on the return and supplemental return thereto, and on the findings of fact. The trial judge denied the application of the relator and closed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>opinion thus : \u201c Upon the whole case, the conclusion is inevitable that the right of the relator to the relief demanded is so doubtful that the application for a writ should be denied. The defendants are, therefore, entitled to a final order or judgment denying the application and dismissing the alternative writ with costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">After a careful examination of the findings, together with the briefs of the respective counsel on this appeal, and of the authorities cited by them, I am convinced that the conclusion arrived at by the learned trial judge is in all respects correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">It is the indisputable rule of law that a peremptory writ of mandamus should never be granted unless in a case where its purpose is to give effect to a clear legal right. People <em>ex rel. </em>Mygatt <em>v. </em>Supervisors etc., 11 <em>N.

The project which the relator in this case seeks to promote by the aid of a writ of mandamus is one which threatens the city of New York with serious disturbance and widespread inconvenience, with results of doubtful advantage. The occasion demands on the part of the court, great circumspection and caution, and thus the dictates of a wise forbearance unite with the principles of law in opposition to the relator\u2019s demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">No reason is apparent why the rights of the relator should not be ascertained and asserted by regular action at law, and no urgent necessity is shown for a resort to the sudden and peremptory interposition by mandamus. The order and adjudication of the trial judge are, in all things, affirmed for the reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>set forth in his written opinion, the relator to pay the respondent\u2019s costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Sedgwick, Ch.

That on the 11th day of January, 1876, a judgment was entered in the Superior Court of the city of New York, in a certain action in said court for the foreclosure of a mortgage on the premises, property and rights of property hereinafter described, in which action Origen Vandenburgh was plaintiff, and The New York City Central Underground Railroad Company, John C. Brown, Jesse Seligman, Henry M. Alexander, and the Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty of the city of New York were the defendants, and duly appeared therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-14\">\u201c 4. That it was adjudged in said judgment, as against the defendants, except the city of New York, that the said company owned certain property and rights of property therein described, namely the right of seizure, occupation and possession, for the purpose of constructing and maintaining an underground double track railway, of certain lands, premises and grounds, in the city of New York, in, on and under which the main line of the said railway is located, and which line extends from the City Hall park to and beyond Forty-fifth street by route described as follows, namely :</p>\n<p id=\"b476-15\">\u201c 5.

That it was adjudged by and in said judgment as against all of the defendants, except the city of New York,' that the said last-named company had the right to enter into and upon the soil of said public grounds, pafcks and places for the purposes aforesaid freely and without molestation; to make such excavations in said streets, avenues, squares and grounds, as might be necessary from time to time; to construct and maintain the proper stations, platforms and buildings on such lands, premises and grounds, at such points along the route as might be most convenient for the ingress and egress of passengers and freight, and necessary for the operation of the company\u2019s railway.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">\u201c 8. That it was adjudged in and by said judgment that said mortgaged premises, franchises and property be sold at public auction according to law and the practice of the court, by or under the direction of a referee appointed in said action for that purpose, and with the several specific uses, rights and powers thereto belonging; and that the purchaser or purchasers on such sale be put into possession of the said premises, franchises and property, with the rights belonging thereto, on production of the referee\u2019s deed for the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">\u201c9.

Lowber Smith, the then deputy commissioner of public works.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">\u201c 16. That the said The New York City Central Underground Railway Company and the said The New York Underground Railway Company have not, nor has either of them, obtained the consent of the owners of one-half in value of the property bounded on the line of the proposed route of said railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">\u201c 17.

That by the route and plans adopted by each of the railroads re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>ferred to, or mentioned in the foregoing findings, it became necessary or proper for the corporations to build a portion, or some portion, of their road underground.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">\u201c Originally the relator company demanded of the commissioner of public works a permit to open the streets along its route, and included therein Broadway, between Seventeenth and Twentieth streets, and to this demand it adhered in its application for an alternative writ. Such writ, when issued, corresponded with the demand. Upon the trial of the issues it was held by the trial judge, that no right to enter upon Broadway was granted to the company, and he therefore directed a finding, defining the route in terms which exclude Broadway. The variance, it is now claimed, is fatal to the application of the relator, for the reason that it is a well established principle of law, that a peremptory mandamus cannot be issued otherwise than in exact accordance with the alternative writ and the demand made upon the officer, whose action is to be coerced.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">\u201cIn the next place it is contended that the franchise granted by the Acts of 1868 and 1869 has been forfeited by non-user and lapse of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\u201c I do not stop to consider either of the two objections referred to. The first is of too technical a character, in view of the other important questions involved and which would have to be met on a new application, and the second is now in course of direct litigation, in the action brought by the attorney-general.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">\u201c A third and more important objection, is that the relator company has not obtained the consent of a majority of the owners of the property abutting on the streets, nor the consent of the local authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">\u201c By chapter 582 of the Laws of 1880, section 1, it is provided that, \u2018whenever, according to the route and plans adopted by any railroad company heretofore or hereafter formed under any special act of the legislature of this state, or under chapter 140 of the Laws of 1850, entitled \u2018 an Act to authorize the formation of railroad corporations and to regulate the same,\u201d and all acts supplementary thereto or amendatory thereof, for the building of its railroad, it shall be necessary or proper to build said road, or any part of the same underground, or to tunnel or bridge any river or waters, it shall be lawful for said company to enter upon, &amp;c., * * * ; provided that whenever such road, or any part of the same, is intended to be built within the limits of any city * * * in this state, and to run by means of a tunnel underneath any of the streets, roads or public places thereof, the said company, before building the same underneath any of the said streets, roads or public places, shall obtain the consent of the owners of one-half in value of the property bounded on the line, and the consent of * * * the proper authorities having control of said streets, roads or public places; or in case such consent of the owners of property bounded on the line cannot be obtained, the general term of the Supreme Court, in the district in which said city * * * is situated, may, upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>application, appoint three commissioners, who shall determine, after a hearing of all the parties interested, whether said railroad ought to be allowed to be built underneath such street, roads and public places, or any of them, and in what manner the same may be so built with the least damage to the surface, and to, the use of the surface by the public, and the determination of said commissioners, confirmed by the court, may be taken in lieu of the said consent of the said authorities and property owners.\u2019 This Act of 1880, has been held by the Court of Appeals to be unconstitutional in so far as it provides that an order of the general term may be taken in lieu of the consents of the local authorities and of the owners of one-half in value of the property bounded on the line. <em>Matter of </em>New York District Railway, 107 <em>N. Y. </em>54. But in so far as the act provides that a tunnel or underground railway shall not be built without the consent of such property owners and local authorities, it remains unaffected by that decision, and the conditions prescribed by it are obligatory upon all railroad companies covered by its provisions. The relator seeks to avoid the application of this statute to its railway by two arguments, namely: (1.) That the relator company has not been formed under any special act of the legislature, or under the general railroad act, or any act supplementary thereto or amendatory thereof, and therefore is exempt from the provisions of the Act'of 1880; and (2.) That the Act of 1880, even if otherwise applicable, is unconstitutional and void as against the relator, because by imposing the condition of procuring the assent of the property owners and of the local authorities as a condition of exercising a franchise previously granted, it impairs the obligation of the contract embraced in the franchise previously granted and destroys vested rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">\u201cIt is conceded that the relator company was formed under the provisions of chapter 469 of the Laws of 1873, which authorize the purchaser or purchasers of franchises and property of corporations sold by foreclosure of mortgage, to associate other persons with them and to form a corporation to which the franchises, powers and privileges sold under the mortgage may be conveyed. In the case at bar Vandenburgh and Sheldon, the purchasers at the foreclosure sale of the property, franchises, powers and privileges of the New York City Central Underground Bailway Company, associated other persons with them, and pursuant to the Act of 1873, created the relator company and conveyed to it all the property, franchises, powers and privileges of the former company so purchased by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">\u201c The answer to the first argument of the relator is, however, that the Act qf 1873 is an act supplementary to the general railroad act of 1850, although its title makes no reference to the last named act. The provisions of the Act of 1873 originated in chapter 282 of the Laws of 1854, which is entitled \u2018 An Act to amend the act'entitled 1 An Act to authorize the formation of railroad corporations, and to regulate the same,\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>passed April 2,1850. In this Act of 1854, provisions were first enacted that the purchasers of railroad franchises under foreclosure judgments might associate with themselves other persons, and thereupon become a corporation possessing the powers, privileges and franchises conveyed by and under the decree of foreclosure. Prior to the enactment of that act, the difficulty had arisen that individual purchasers of railroad franchises, possessing in themselves no corporate powers, and failing to acquire by the decree and sale of foreclosure the right to be a corporation, and to succeed to the corporate life of the former corporation, found themselves in the awkward predicament of owning a property which they could not use and might not be able to sell. It was to cure the difficulty, as was said by Judge Finch in The People <em>v. </em>The Brooklyn, Flatbush <em>&amp; </em>Coney Island Railway Co., 89 <em>N. Y. </em>84, that the Act of 1854, and its subsequent amendments, were enacted. Now it may be said that the Act of 1854 was confined in its operation to railroad corporations, and that the Act of 1873 is a general act applicable to all corporations. The fact, nevertheless, is that the Act of 1873 is, as to railroad corporations, supplementary to the railroad acts. Whether an act is amendatory or supplementary to the general railroad act, is to be determined by its provisions and not by its title. Even if it be conceded, therefore, that the Act of 1873 is not amendatory in the strict legal acceptation of that term, it is sufficient that it is supplementary to the general railroad act, and that the relator company was organized under it, although its right to construct the railroad in question may have been derived from other sources. There is nothing in chapter 10 of Laws of 1860 which, in my judgment, militates against the views so far expressed. But there are additional reasons in support of what has already been said. \u2018 The New York City Central Underground Railway Company, organized under chapter 230 of the Laws of 1868, was, by the third section of said Act, expressly subjected to all the provisions of the Act, entitled \u2018 An Act to authorize the formation of railroad corporations and to regulate the same,\u201d passed April 2d, 1850, and the several Acts amendatory thereof and additional thereto, &amp;c,\u2019 The amendatory Act passed as chapter 824 of the Laws of 1869, made no change in this respect. This being so, and the rule being well settled, that under the foreclosure of a mortgage the purchaser can secure no greater rights than would accrue to him under and by virtue of a deed conveying all the right, title and interest of both the mortgagor and the mortgagee, and that a decree of foreclosure does not affect rights prior and paramount to those of the mortgagor and mortgagee, it is difficult to see how, in the absence of proof of a further and additional grant, the relator company can claim any greater rights than the New York City Central Underground Railway Company possessed. If there was such a further and additional grant, clear and convincing proof of it should be given. But no such proof was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>\u201c The answer to the second argument of the relator is as follows, viz: The corporate franchises, powers and privileges to which the relator has succeeded, originated in the Act of 1868, chapter 230, and by section 3 of that Act the corporation was subject to the provisions of the general railroad act. Section 1 of the general railroad act provides that the corporations organized thereunder shall be subject to the provisions contained in title 3 of chapter 18 of the first part of the revised statutes, and among the provisions therein contained is this: \u2018 The charter of every corporation that shall hereafter be granted by the legislature, shall be subject to alteration, suspension or repeal in the discretion of the legislature.\u2019 (\u00a7 8). Section 48 of the general railroad act of 1850, also provides: 1 The legislature may at any time annul or dissolve any corporation formed under this Act.\u2019 And Section 1 of Article 8 of the Constitution provides: \u2018 Corporations may be formed under general laws; but shall not be created by special act, except for municipal purposes, and in cases where, in the judgment of the legislature, the object of the corporation cannot be obtained under general laws. All general laws and special acts passed pursuant to this section may be altered from time to time or repealed.\u2019 The power reserved by these statutory enactments and the constitutional provision referred to, is ample to authorize the legislature to impose the additional condition upon the relator that, before building its railroad, it should procure the consent either of the local authorities or of the property owners, or both. A different case would be presented if the road had been built upon the faith of the original franchise, and the condition were sought to be imposed subsequently. But as long as work has not been commenced, the legislature does not undertake to deprive the corporation of any power. It simply imposes a condition for the exercise of the power, and such condition is of a nature calculated to serve the public welfare, and is a proper regulation in respect to the exercise of a franchise affecting the public. Thus in the case of The People, <em>ex rel., </em>The New York Electric Lines Company <em>v. </em>Rollin M. Squire as Commissioner, &amp;c., 107 <em>N. Y. </em>593, it appeared that the relator company had acquired the franchise of laying electrical conductors in the streets of the city of New York under resolutions of the common council and Acts of the legislature, and that subsequently chapter 499, of the Laws of 1885, was passed, by which it was provided that such electrical conductors should not be laid except with the consent of a certain board of electrical control created by statute. It was held that the Act of 1885, so far as it affects corporations organized before its passage, is not obnoxious to the constitutional prohibition against laws impairing the obligations of contracts; that it does not annul, destroy, or materially impair or restrict, any franchises or contract rights previously secured, but seeks to regulate and control their-exercise, so that they shall cease to constitute a public nuisance; that regulations of such a character are strictly police regulations, and that the right to exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>this police power is a governmental function which cannot be alienated, surrendered or abridged by the legislature, by any grant, contract or delegation whatsoever. In the ease of The Mayor, etc., <em>v. </em>The Twenty-third Street Railway Co., 113 <em>N. </em>Y. 811, the legislature had required a street railroad corporation to pay into the treasury of the city of New York one per cent of its gross receipts, instead of paying a license fee upon each car as had heretofore been prescribed. The company resisted the payment of the percentage. It was held that while, under the power reserved, the legislature cannot deprive a corporation of its property or annul its contracts with third persons, it may take away its franchises to be a corporation or prescribe the conditions and terms upon which it may live and exercise such franchise, and that consequently the Act imposing the duty to pay a percentage was a valid and constitutional exercise of legislative power. So, a law changing the charter of a railroad company so that the city of Rochester, which as a stockholder had theretofore been entitled to name four directors out of thirteen, became entitled to appoint seven, which gave the control of the company to said city, was adjudged by the Supreme Court of the United States to be constitutional and valid, Miller <em>v. </em>The State, 15 Wall. 478. The cases already referred to are deemed sufficient to illustrate the proposition that the Act of 1880 is not unconstitutional and void for any of the reasons advanced by the relator. It is only the rights of third parties vested in contracts with a corporation, that the legislature cannot destroy by directing the dissolution of the corporation and the sale of its property. The People, etc., <em>v. </em>O\u2019Brien, 111 <em>N. Y. </em>1. The further claim of the relator that the condition imposed by the Act of 1880, requiring the consent of the owners of one-half in value of the property bounded on the line, is itself unconstitutional, because section 18 of article III of the Constitution requires the consent of the owners of one-half in value of the property bounded on that portion of a street or highway upon which it is proposed to construct or operate a railroad, which has been construed in Hilton v. The 34th Street R. R. Co., 1 <em>How. Pr. N. S. </em>453, to mean the owners of one-half of each street, is also untenable, because that constitutional provision did not go into effect until January 1, 1875, and is applicable only to franchises to be thereafter granted, and because the rights and liabilities of the relator derive their origin from a date prior to that time. See <em>Matter of </em>Gilbert El. Ry., 70 N. Y. 361; People <em>v. </em>Brooklyn, F. &amp; C. I. R. R. Co., 89 <em>lb. </em>75.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">\u201c The third objection, which has been sufficiently discussed, should, therefore, be. sustained. But even if there were error in this, there is a fourth objection which is fatal to relator\u2019s case as it stands at present. It is that the relator has shown neither a clear legal right, nor the necessity for the issuance of the writ at the present time.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">\u201c Aside from the question of forfeiture by non-user and lapse of time, on account of which an action has been brought by the attorney-general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>for the dissolution of the relator company, which action is still pending, and from the question of variance, which questions I do not stop to determine, but which nevertheless involve a doubt, the relator\u2019s case is left uncertain by reason of its failure to adduce any proof that it is its intention in good faith to construct, maintain and operate the road on the line proposed, and that it has or controls sufficient pecuniary means to perform the work. The defendants raised and persisted in the objection from the very start. In the <em>Matter of </em>the Metropolitan Transit Co., 111 <em>N. Y. 588, </em>it was held by the Court of Appeals that the application of the company for the appointment of commissioners of appraisal to fix the compensation to be paid by the company to the city of New York for the use of certain streets, was not sufficient evidence of an intent on the part \"of the company to build the road in good faith, and that good faith on the part of the company in that respect is made essential by the Act of 1850 (chap. 140, \u00a7 14). This being so, upon an application for a mandamus to coerce like in the present case, the action of an official who denies the good faith and pecuniary ability of the applicant, it is in the very nature of things part of the case of the applicant to show good faith. Such an application differs materially from an application for the appointment of commissioners to determine whether a road shall be built at. all, and if so, to prescribe and define the character, location and route of the road. For if the mandamus in the present ease were issued and enforced, as it must be presumed it would be, the streets might be excavated, and the work then stopped for want of power to proceed farther, and thus a great public nuisance might be created. The proposed road was laid out largely as an underground road through private land. All the authorities agree that such land has an indefinite extent, downwards as well as upwards, so as to include everything terrestrial under and over it. The legal maxim is \u2018 <em>Oujus est solum, ejus est usque ad coelum.\u2019 </em>The owners of this land are entitled to compensation. This has been conceded on the argument. Why then should not the relator company be compelled to show that, if it were permitted to tear up the streets, no delay would be incurred by the resistance of such owners ? All things considered, it is quite reasonable to require in this case that the relator should show good faith and sufficient ability to proceed with the work with due diligence from the time of the granting of the permit for the excavation of the streets.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">\u20181 Another element of uncertainty arises from the failure of the relator to define the route with sufficient precision. It should have defined the route with such precision, that the commissioner of public works in his permit might have defined the portions of the- streets to- be opened.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\u201cThe Act of 1869 defines a route, touching Mulberry street, between Bayard and Park streets, continuing either east or west of Mulberry street, or through Mulberry street; passing from Seventeenth street <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>to Twenty-third street, either through the blocks between Broadway and Fourth avenue, or through to Madison avneue, if it be extended southerly; and continuing under Madison avenue, or east of the avenue, in whole or in part, to Eighty-sixth street, etc., etc. The description of the route thus given is sufficient for the purpose of incorporating a railroad company which, like the relator or its predecessor, the New York City Central Underground Bailway, is authorized by section 22 of the general railroad act, to define its route within\"the general limits indicated by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\u201cBut preliminary to the commencement of actual work, and especially preliminary to an application for legal assistance in the excavation of the streets, the relator is bound to file a map, by which its route is specifically defined, and by which it is determined and fixed, whether its line is to be within the streets named, or east or west thereof, and at what points its route is to intersect the streets. The findings of the jury contain no such definition or specific determination. Nor does any such definition or specific determination appear anywhere else in the ease. In the absence, therefore, of all proof upon these points, no court will grant a mandamus, compelling the commissioner of public works to issue a permit for the excavation of the streets in general terms. The duty of keeping the streets of the city of New York in order is in a large measure cast by law upon the commissioner, and this involves the duty of being vigilant, to prevent all unnecessary encroachments upon, and obstructions of, the streets. When, therefore, the commissioner is applied to for a permit for the excavation of any part of a street, it is both his right and his duty to insist upon exact information as to the precise point at which the excavation is proposed to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\u201c The considerations stated clearly demonstrate that the relator has \u25a0shown neither a clear legal right to, nor the necessity for, the issuance of the writ at the present time. The, writ lies to give effect only to a clear legal right. The People, etc., <em>v. </em>The Supervisors of Chenango County, 11 <em>N. Y. </em>563, and The People, etc., <em>v. </em>Hawkins, Supervisor, etc., 46 lb. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">There are other questions in the case, but, in view of what has already been said, it is not necessary to examine them.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">\u201cUpon the whole case the conclusion is inevitable, that the right of the. relator to the relief demanded is so doubtful that the application for a writ should be deni\u00e9d. The defendants are, therefore, entitled to a final order or judgment, denying the application and dismissing the alternative writ\" with costs.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
