The action is for personal injuries. I have examined the evidence with care and I fail to see how, considering the nature of the injuries and the amount of pain and suffering endured by the plaintiff, the verdict which is for $7,000, can be held to be excessive. Cases are to be found in large numbers in which larger recoveries have been sustained for similar injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">The judgment and order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
