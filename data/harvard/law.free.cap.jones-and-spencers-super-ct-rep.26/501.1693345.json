De KLYN, Appellant v. SILVER LAKE ICE COMPANY, Respondent.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-6\">\n<em>Rescission of contract\u2014Reinstatement\u2014Letters excluded on the trial should he printed.</em>\n</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-8\">In this ease it was established on the trial, that the contract had been rescinded, by consent of both parties, by letters passing between them March 5th and 15th, 1888. <em>Held, </em>that no action can be maintained upon the contract after such rescission by either party thereto. That proof of deliveries of ice, that was the subject of the contract, by the defendant to plaintiff after .such rescission, could not have the effect of reinstating the contract between'the parties.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-9\">Certain letters were offered in evidence on the trial by the plaintiff, and were excluded, and exception duly taken. These letters were not printed in the case, and consequently it cannot be held that their exclusion on the ground of immateriality constituted error.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b521-10\">Before Sedgwick, Ch.

The claim of the plaintiff that the letter of March 5th should be treated as a mere <em>brutum fulmen </em>cannot be sustained. There having been a rescission, proof of deliveries of ice subsequent to March 17th could not have the effect of reinstating the contract. Such deliveries may have been made at market rates as proposed by the letter of March 5th, but it was not necessary to determine the precise point. The letters excluded are not printed in the case and consequently it cannot be held that their exclusion on the ground of immateriality constituted error. Upon the whole case no sufficient reason appears for disturbing the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The judgment should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Sedgwick, Ch.
