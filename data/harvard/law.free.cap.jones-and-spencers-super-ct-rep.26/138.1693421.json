Assuming that this testimony was incompetent, yet it sufficiently appears from the whole case, that the defendants were not prejudiced by it, for upon testimony which was competent, the trial judge found that during a period of six years there was an actual loss in rental that amounted to $150 each year. It thus fully appears that the award of $2,500 for -loss of fee value, which was made, is a reasonable one under all the circumstances. It bears the usual relation between fee value and rental value at the legal rate of interest.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b158-10\">The testimony admitted as regards the plaintiff\u2019s Eighth avenue property, to the effect that other owners of property in that neighborhood had difficulty in renting their flats after the construction of the railroad, was proper under all the circumstances, for it tended to show the uniform operation of a general cause to produce a loss of rents.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b158-11\">Before Sedgwick, Oh.

The testimony of defendants\u2019 experts seems to have been wholly discarded. Upon the testimony of plaintiff\u2019s experts four times the amount which was awarded as damage to fee value, might have been awarded. Upon testimony which was competent, sufficient and found worthy of belief, the trial judge found during a period of six years an actual loss of rental value amounting to $150 for each year. It thus fully appears that the award of $2,500 foloss of fee value which was made, is a reasonable one under all the circumstances. It bears the usual relation between fee value and rental value at the legal rate of interest. A somewhat similar question was presented to this eoupt in Ross <em>v. </em>The Manhattan Elevated R. R. Co., 57 N. Y. Super. Ct. 412 decided during January, 1890, and it was held no ground for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">The testimony admitted as regards plaintiff\u2019s Eighth 'Avenue property to the effect that other owners of property in that neighborhood had difficulty in renting their flats after the construction of the elevated railroad, was proper under all the circumstances. It tended to show the uniform opera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>tion of \u00e1 general cause \u00e1nd that plaintiff\u2019s loss of rents was not attributable to his own neglect, and consequently it also had a legitimate bearing upon the question of fee value as affected by loss of rents.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The judgment should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Sedgwick, Oh. J., and O\u2019Gorman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
