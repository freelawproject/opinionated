Appeal from order allowing an amendment to the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-13\">The complaint alleged that plaintiff is and was a corporation duly organized ; that Second Avenue between 123d and 129th streets in the city of New York, is a public highway laid out and opened under chapter 86 of the Laws of 1813, entitled \u201c an act to reduce several laws relating particularly to the city of New York into one act,\u201d passed April 9, 1813 ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>that upon-the opening of said avenue the corporation of the city of New York became seized of the fee and certain trusts in the complaint set forth, among others, that the avenue should forever be appropriated and remain open in like manner as other public streets and avenues in said city then were, and of right ought then to have been appropriated and kept open.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-4\">The complaint then alleged, \u201c That at the time of the passage of said act of 1813, none of .the streets or avenues in said city were appropriated or kept open for the use or purposes of a railroad, either surface, underground or elevated. That such proceedings created a valid trust in the corporation of said city, which precluded it from authorizing any other use of the land acquired for' such portion of the said second avenue than that described in said act of 1813. That the said city of New York in effect contracted with all persons who owned land on said avenue, that such abutting owners and their successors might erect buildings upon their lots and open windows overlooking said street, and receive light for their said buildings from said street as a perpetual easement over said street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-5\">\u201c That no use of said street should be permitted \u25a0 which should render the air in said street noxious or unwholesome, or which should obstruct the entrance to buildings erected or to be erected, or which should disturb and annoy the occupants of said buildings by unusual noise, jars, or in any other manner whatever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-6\">\u201c That said avenue, until taken possession of by the defendants, as hereinafter set forth, was only used for the ordinary purposes of a street or avenue, that is to say, for the passage of man and beast and of \"Vehicles drawn or. propelled upon the surface of the same, and for the free admission and use of air and light and access to houses and buildings erected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>and to be erected upon the boundary lines of said street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-4\">\u201c That said use of light, air and access to buildings, is a necessary use indispensable to the enjoyment and ownership of the said premises, and is an easement legally appurtenant to said premises, and is property.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-5\">The complaint then alleged that in 1871, the plaintiff became the owner in fee simple of certain premises situate on Second avenue, between 126th and 127th streets, (particularly described them) and of the buildings thereon, and had ever since been and then was such owner thereof ; that before the acts of the defendants thereinafter set forth said property was of great value; that in consequence of such acts of defendants the use, enjoyment and value of said property was greatly damaged and reduced, and the plaintiff suffered great injury and loss. It then alleged the incorporation of the defendant \u201c The Metropolitan Elevated Railway Company.\u201d It then alleged that in 1880 the said Railway Company took possession of said Second avenue, between said streets, and erected thereon a structure of iron and wood. It then gave a particular description of the structure and the use thereof made by the defendant. It then alleged that since 1880 the railroad has been in possession of and operated by the defendant The Manhattan Railway Company and lessee and agent of the Metropolitan Elevated Railway Company. It then alleged the incorporation of the Manhattan Railway Company. It then proceeded as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-6\">That the defendants by constructing and maintaining said structure in such parts of said Second avenue, deprived the said avenue of the purifying action of the sun in drying the surface, and prevented the former and usual circulation of air, and made the said street damp, dark and unwholesome. Trains of cars were and are run by defendants upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>this structure at intervals of a few minutes all day and until midnight. That this structure and these trains deprived and now deprive plaintiff\u2019s premises of the uninterrupted use of and access by the light and air in said avenue and opposite plaintiff\u2019s said premises, so that this plaintiff could not and cannot have the former or customary use of said light and air in their said premises, but are deprived thereof by the defendants. That the* engines drawing these trains emit into said street and into plaintiff\u2019s said premises and buildings offensive and noxious stenches and cinders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-4\">That said columns obstruct plaintiff\u2019s free use of said street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-5\">That trains in passing said buildings emit sparks, steam, soot and ashes, and water into the street and plaintiff\u2019s said premises, and cause a loud and unpleasant noise and disturbance during their passage past plaintiff\u2019s said premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-6\">That by the construction and operation of said Elevated Steam Railway as hereinbefore set forth, the said defendants deprive the plaintiff of the free and uninterrupted or unimpaired enjoyment of its rights and property, and the lawful use of its said premises, <em>and greatly reduced their value.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-7\">The plaintiff, further says that each and every of the aforesaid injurious acts of the defendants have been done wrongfully, and against the will and consent of the plaintiff. That for the aforesaid wrongs aad injuries which the defendants inflicted upon the plaintiff and the said premises, and upon the rights and interests and easements as above set forth, defendants never made or offered plaintiff any compensation, nor did defendants, by recourse to the right.of eminent domain accorded to them by law, ever take any steps to compensate plaintiff for any of said wrongs and injuries, but on the contrary defendants inflicted said wrongs and injuries, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>imposed said burdens on the plaintiff and the said property without compensation or indemnity during the whole period from, in or about the month of March, 1880, when the said structure was completed, till the present time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-4\">That but for the said unlawful acts of defendants the plaintiff\u2019s said property would be of much greater value, and the rental value thereof would be much greater, and in cofisequence of the continuance of said unlawful acts, the market value and rental value of said premises have been <em>greatly diminished.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-5\">Wherefore plaintiff prays judgment that unless the defendants shall pay to this plaintiff the amount of damages sustained by them through their said unlawful acts up to the time this action was commenced, and which damages in rental depreciation amount to the sum of thirty thousand dollars, and unless they shall also pay to the plaintiff within sixty days after the tender by plaintiff to them of a conveyance of the easements of light, air and access lawfully appurtant to said premises, and now abridged by defendants,- the further sum of forty-five thousand dollars, that an injunction may issue restraining said defendants, and that they be enjoined and restrained from operating and maintaining said struct-ures and compelling them to remove the said railroad structure and station from in front of plaintiff\u2019s said premises and for such\" other and further relief as to the court may seem fit, together with the costs of this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-6\">Issue was joined November 15,\" 1888, by defendants\u2019 answer. The issue thus joined came on to be tried on the 21st and 22nd days of January, 1890. at an equity term as an equity cause before Sedgwick, Ch. J., without a jury. On the trial defendants\u2019 counsel moved to strike the cause of action from the calendar, on the ground that it sets forth no equitable cause of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Thereupon plaintiff\u2019s counsel moved to amend the complaint so as to put in the complaint allegations that the defendants intended and threatened to continue the structure and the operation of the road through the term of its charter ; and asked the court to allow an adjournment in order to apply at the special term for leave to amend. Defendants\u2019 counsel asked that the cause be marked off the term. The court thereupon ruled: \u201c In my judgment the defendants, if an amendment is allowed, will have a right to claim a trial upon the issue as of the time when made by the amendment. I have no power to put this over in contemplation of a new issue being made, for if that new issue be made it will take its place on the calendar of that date ; \u201d and granted the motion to put the cause off the term. Thereafter plaintiff moved at a special term held at Chambers for the hearing of motions for leave to amend the complaint by inserting therein after the words \u201c and greatly reduced their value \u201d above italicized the allegation, \u201c That the said structure and the running of trains thereon and the other acts of defendants hereinbefore alleged are of a permanent, lasting and continuous nature and will be permanent, lasting and continuous,\u201d and by inserting after the words \u201c greatly diminished \u201d above italicized, the allegation \u201c That plaintiff is obliged to seek the equitable assistance and interference of this court in order to prevent a multiplicity of actions.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-4\">The motion was granted and an order dated February 6,1890, entered upon the granting of it, which is sufficiently set forth in the opinion. Defendants appealed to the general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b197-5\"><em>Davies &amp; Rap alio, </em>attorneys, and <em>T. Frelinghuysen C. Demarest </em>of counsel, for appellants, argued:\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-6\">I. The order appealed from should be reversed, because it imposes on the defendants, who were wholly without fault, terms on granting relief to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>plaintiff against the results of a non-observance of the tules of pleading. (1.) The order appealed from provides : \u201c And it is further ordered that, within twenty days after the service of a copy of the complaint, amended as aforesaid, upon the attorney for the defendants, the defendants shall serve their amended answer upon the attorney for the plaintiff.\u201d This was error : \u201c The only pleading, on the part of the defendants is either a demurrer or an answer\u201d (Code Civ. Pro., \u00a7 487). This statute gives the defendant an option, of which a court cannot deprive him, where he asks no favor, and has been guilty of no laches. Fink <em>v. </em>Manhattan R. Co., <em>N. Y Com. Pleas. Gen. Term, Feby., </em>1890, 8 <em>N. Y. Supplement, </em>327 ; Union Bank <em>v. </em>Mott, 19 <em>How. </em>267. (2). The order appealed from provides ; \u201c And it is further ordered, * * * that the issue herein shall remain as of the 15th day of November, 1888.\u201d This was error : (a.) \u201c An agreement to forbear for a time, proceedings at law or in equity, to enforce a well-founded claim, is a valid consideration for a promise\u201d <em>(Parsons on Contracts, </em>7 th ed., 470, and cases cited); and <em>(b.) </em>It is a familiar condition imposed by the courts on opening a defendant\u2019s default in pleading, or on granting to a defendant an extension of time to plead to provide that the issue shall remain as of the date which it would have had in case the default had not occurred or the extension been granted. It follows that (c.) To so antedate an issue, as against an unoffending defendant\u2019s title to demand the observance of the statutory prescription as to the time of his arraignment, is to deprive him, without reason, of a right, without possessing which he could not waive or forfeit it in the cases of default or extension supposed ; and of which right, if existence were not predicable, forbearance could not be purchased by the promise referred to in the last quotation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-4\">II. The order appealed from should be reversed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>because, in accomplishing its only intended object, the substitution of an equitable, for a legal, cause of action, it violates the defendants\u2019 constitutional right to a jury trial of the issue offered by plaintiff and accepted by defendants. Before the amendment allowed by the order appealed from, the complaint set forth a claim for money damages\u2014a legal as distinguished from an equitable cause of action\u2014presenting an issue for trial by a jury, as distinguished from a trial by the court. In the affidavit of plaintiff\u2019s attorney, upon which the order to show cause was based, the affiant pointedly calls the attention of the court to the fact \u201cthat, by the ninth section of defendants\u2019 answer herein, it is admitted that said structure is of a permanent and lasting nature. And it is the fact, that the defendants\u2019 answer to the first-named complaint, <em>i. e., </em>to the complaint as it existed before the order appealed from was made, alleged \u201cthat the said railway was constructed according to law, and with the greatest care and skill, and that the structure, maintenance and operation thereof are permanent.\u201d Here, then, we find both parties insisting on the permanency of the road. The <em>Lcthr </em>case makes the issue, in such a conjuncture, triable by jury, as a question of damages. 104 <em>N. Y. </em>294. The. case at bar is thus brought distinctly within the doctrine announced in Davison v. Associates of the Jersey Company 71 <em>N. Y. </em>333.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-4\">III. The order appealed from should be reversed, because its result is a defective pleading. (1.) \u201c A court has not the discretion to allow a defective pleading to be served as an amendment of the earlier pleading\u201d Pracht <em>v. </em>Ritter, 48 <em>N. Y. Super Ct. </em>509, 510. (2.) The complaint, as permitted to be amended by the order ,appealed from, is defective, because (a.) The allegation,\u2014\u201c that the plaintiff is obliged to seek the equitable assistance and interference of this court in order to prevent a multiplicity of actions,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>is sham, on its face. A \u201c multiplicity of actions\u201d cannot arise, and therefore cannot be prevented between two persons only. <em>Willard's Eq. Jurispr., Potter's ed., </em>326 ; citing Cowper <em>v. </em>Clark, 3 <em>P. Wms. </em>157, and Alexander <em>v. </em>Pendleton, 8 <em>Cranch, </em>468 ; 1 <em>Maddock\u2019s Chancery, 1st Am. ed., </em>140. If, however, it is assumed that the pleader was trying to allege the danger of a necessity of suing repeatedly to collect damages, then <em>(b.) </em>The two amendments are inconsistent, because, as has been seen, the quality of \u201c permanency,\u201d by the <em>Lahr </em>decision, makes the damage recoverable once for all by the verdict of a jury. That inconsistent amendments of a complaint will not be allowed, see Evangel L. Church v. Fingar, 11 <em>N. Y. Week. Dig. </em>460 ; Scheier v. Tyrrell, 23 <em>lb. </em>476.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-4\">IV. The order appealed from should be reversed, because it transcends the broadest limits of the field wherein the courts have exercised their regulative power over pleadings. (1.) Although it is decided that the statute is not the sole source of the power to allow amendments, it is believed that the clause of Code Civ. Pro., \u00a7 723,\u2014which allows of an amendment \u201c by inserting an allegation material to the case,\u201d\u2014suggests a degree of liberality which a court can never find it needful or suitable to exceed. (2.) The allegations inserted in the complaint, in the action at bar, were not material to the ease. Plaintiff had stated a good case. All that was requisite was to properly notice it for trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-5\">V. The order appealed from is appealable to the general term. If deemed discretionary, defendants are entitled to the discretion of the general term. People <em>v. </em>N. Y. C. R. R. Co., 29 <em>N. Y. </em>418 ; Howell <em>v. </em>Mills, 53 <em>lb. </em>322 ; Martin <em>v. </em>Windsor Hotel Co., 70 <em>lb. </em>101 ; Hand <em>v. </em>Burrows, 15 <em>Hun, </em>483.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-6\"><em>Augustus S.

The order of February 6, 1890, allowing certain amendments to the complaint herein is a proper order and should not be disturbed. \u00a7 723 of the Code ; Dennis <em>v. </em>Coman, 61 <em>N. Y. </em>642 ; Van Duzen <em>v. </em>Howe, 21 <em>lb. </em>531 ; Fox <em>v. </em>Hunt, 8 <em>How. </em>12 ; Woolsey <em>v. </em>Trustees, etc., 2 <em>Keyes, </em>603.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-4\">II. The order appealed from being a discretionary one is not subject to review on appeal except it be shown that such discretion was abused. No such claim can be successfully made in the case at bar. Olendorf <em>v. </em>Cook, 1 <em>Lansing, </em>37 ; Gould <em>v. </em>Rumsey, 21 <em>How. </em>97 ; McQueen <em>v. </em>Babcock, 13 <em>Abbott, </em>268 ; Ford <em>v. </em>David, 1 <em>Bos. </em>569 ; Saltus <em>v. </em>Genim 19 <em>How. </em>233 ; Train <em>v. </em>Barger, 24 <em>Barb. </em>614 ; Phincle <em>v. </em>Vaughan, 12 <em>lb. </em>215 ; Iron Works <em>v. </em>Smith, 4 <em>Duer, </em>362.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b201-5\">By the Court.\u2014O\u2019Gorman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajq\">The defendants appeal from an order of the special term of this court, of which the following is a copy :\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u201c Upon reading and filing the affidavit of Augustus S. Hutchins, plaintiffs attorney herein, verified January 29, 1890, and a proposed form of an amended complaint thereto annexed, and the order to show cause granted on said affidavit, returnable February 1, 1890, with proof of due service thereof, and the affidavit of Theodore F. C. Demarest, of counsel for defendants, in opposition' to the motion made by said order to show cause, and the transcript of the minutes of the official stenographer of this court of the proceedings had herein at the equity term of this court, on January 21 and 22, 1890, submitted on the hearing of the motion, and upon all the pleadings and other proceedings herein, and after hearing Agustus S. Hutchins for the motion made by said order to show cause, and Theodore F. C. Demarest in opposition thereto, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">\u201c Ordered, that the complaint herein may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>amended by inserting therein, after the words \u2018 greatly reduced their value,\u2019 in the eighteenth folio, the following allegation : 1 That the said structure, and the running of trains thereon, and the other acts of defendants hereinbefore alleged, are of a permanent, lasting and continuous nature, and will be permanent, lasting and continuous \u2019 ; and also by inserting in the said complaint after the words 1 greatly diminished\u2019, in the twentieth folio, the following allegation : 1 That the plaintiff is obliged to seek the equitable assistance and interference of this court in order to prevent a multiplicity of actions.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\u201c And it is further ordered that within twenty days after the service of a copy of the complaint, amended as aforesaid, upon the attorney for the defendants, the defendants shall serve their amended answer upon the attorney for the plaintiff, and that the issue herein shall remain as of the 15th day of November, .1888.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\u201c This order is made conditional upon the payment of twenty dollars by the plaintiff to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">\u201c And it is further ordered that- the order permitting an amendment of the complaint heretofore entered in this cause, on the first day of February 1890, be revoked ; the foregoing provisions of this order being in lieu and stead of the last-mentioned order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The chief grounds of the defendants\u2019 appeal are\u2014 That the order imposes the terms on the defendants that they shall serve their amended answer on the attorney for the plaintiff, within twenty days after service on them of a copy of the plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Defendants did, in fact, serve such amended answer, but under protest. They do not claim that this order prevented them from demurring to the amended complaint, or that but for the order they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>would have demurred. The defendants also claim that they were prejudiced by the requirement in the order that they should answer within twenty days. That is the statutory time within which an answer must be served after service of summons. Code Civil Procedure, \u00a7\u00a7 418, 422. The court at special term had power to make the order appealed from and it was matter of discretion. Code, \u00a7 723. The defendants, if aggrieved by the order, could have moved for resettlement, and called the attention of the court to such substantial detriment, if any, which they sustained by reason of the order. That would have been the proper and sufficient remedy. Code Civil Procedure, \u00a7\u00a7 723, 724. The other alleged grounds of appeal are without merit. The defendants\u2019 constitutional right to trial by jury, if such right appears on the pleadings to exist, cannot be denied, and defendants are not deprived of the exercise of that right by the order appealed from. It is a right that can be asserted at any time, and before any tribunal, unless waived.
