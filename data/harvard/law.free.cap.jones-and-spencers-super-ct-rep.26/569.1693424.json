To such a state of facts the opinion expressed in Pfaudler Co. <em>v. </em>Sargent, 43 <em>Sun, </em>154, to the effect that the fees of a stenographer for a copy of his minutes are not taxable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>even when procured for the purpose of enabling a party to propose amendments to a case, does not strictly apply. Moreover, the cases cited in support of said opinion are all cases where the fees were sought to be taxed on the entry of the original judgment, and not on appeal. In addition it was shown in the case at bar in opposition to the motion for a retaxation that the defendants had appealed to the court of appeals. This constituted, even under the decision of Pfaudler Co. v. Sargent, a waiver of the right to move for a retaxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Under all the circumstances the learned judge below was right in denying defendants\u2019 motion for a retaxation, and the order app\u00e9aled from should be affirmed, with ten dollars costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
