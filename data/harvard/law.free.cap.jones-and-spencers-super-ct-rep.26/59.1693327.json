Miller, </em>of counsel, for appellant, among other things, argued :\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-8\">The particular or real ground of demurrer urged was and is that the complaint did not allege \u201c that the defendant has used his privilege or any equivalent averment.\u201d The court below seems to have treated the instrument as merely granting an option to defendant to use or not to use the inventions, etc. That is, this would seem to be so from the conclusion arrived at ; and the statement that the contract \u201c merely grants defendant a privilege.\u201d Certainly it does grant a privilege. A privilege is a license. But when one party grants a license or a privilege to another for which the other agrees to pay a fixed sum, is it necessary to a recovery of that sum to allege or prove that the party has actually used his license or privilege ? It is respectfully submitted that such is not the law. Licenses to use patented inventions are often made in such a way as to necessitate the allegation and proof of use, and the extent of such use, in an action for royalties. That is the case where the royalty provided to be. paid is specific and made to depend upon the us\u00e9, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>extent of such use. But licenses of the other kind, such as the one in question, are equally common and lawful. They simply grant the right to use, and the payments or royalties to be paid do not depend upon the use nor the extent of the use. By the \u201c Third \u201d and \u201c Eighth \u201d clauses of the instrument defendant acquired an absolute executed license to use, etc., the inventions, etc., named, not merely an option to use if it elected or chose t\u00f3 do so, and no payment to be made except when used. There is nothing in the writing which will bear such a construction. The only option is in the last part of the clause, that relating to purchase.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-5\">It is submitted that the \"words of the contract are plain and free from uncertainty ; but even if any uncertainty existed, it is a well-settled rule that, \u201c where there is any uncertainty in the words of a contract the court will not adopt that construction which puts one party at the mercy of the other.\u201d Rupell <em>v. </em>Allerton, 108 <em>N. Y. </em>288. \u201cA contract is to be fairly and reasonably construed, with a view of carrying out the intent of the parties.\u201d Crook <em>v. </em>Rindskop, 105 <em>N. Y. </em>476. The only event in which it is specially provided that the license shall cease, etc., is found in the \u201c Tenth \u201d clause of the contract. If it is necessary to allege use by defendant, when and what use and during what time must the use be alleged to have been made ? The complaint does allege that both parties acted upon the entire contract up to March 1, 1888. It may very well be doubted whether the complaint would not have been quite sufficient if it had merely set forth the agreement and that the sum claimed, $1,625, had become due and payable and was unpaid for the Quarter commencing September 1, and ending December 1, 1888. Bogardus <em>v. </em>N. Y. Life Insurance Co., 101 <em>N. Y. </em>337 ; Brown <em>v. </em>Champlin, 66 <em>lb. </em>214. It seems almost useless to refer to authority to sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>tain the proposition that the instrument in question was' an executed license. Reference is made, however, only to <em>Curtis on Patents, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 212, 213, and the same author at section 215, says : \u201cIf, by his agreement, the licensee has admitted that the process or thing which he uses is the patented process or thing, and he is afterwards proceeded against for not complying with, the terms of his agreement, he will not be permitted to show that he did not use that patented process or thing,\u201d etc.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b85-5\"><em>Carter, Hughes &amp; Cravath, </em>attorneys, <em>Paul D. Cravath </em>and <em>John W. Houston </em>of counsel, for respondent, made the following points :\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-6\">I. It cannot be contended that there is an express promise on the part of the defendant to purchase and pay for a license.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-7\">II. There is no promise implied inlaw to purchase the license. There are, properly speaking, but few instances of covenants or promises implied in law. These few instances are where the law has, from the mere use of certain words in an instrument by a grantor, covenantor or promisor, imposed a correlative duty on the part of the grantee, covenantee or promisee to do or perform something on his part. Familiar illustrations are the words, \u201c give,\u201d \u201cgrant \u201d and \u201c demise \u201d in deeds and leases. All of these words have a highly technical meaning, and the rules applicable to them do not apply to the ordinary language used in contracts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-8\">III. It is not neccessary to find an implied promise on the part of the defendant, in order to sustain or give validity to the contract. Hudson Canal Co <em>v. </em>Pennsylvania Coal Co., 8 <em>Wall. </em>276,289.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-9\">IV. The rule which favors construing language as a covenant or promise rather than as a condition has no application to this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-10\">V. The promise of the defendant, if any, must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>be contained in the contract as a necessary inference, just as if it had been set forth expressly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-4\">VI. When a contract, as in this case, is technically and formally drawn, with recitals and separate covenants or promises, no covenant or promise will be implied unless the implication is clear and necessary. This rule is forcibly illustrated in Hudson Canal Co. <em>v. </em>Pennsylvania Coal Co., 8 <em>Wall. </em>276 ; Aspdin <em>v. </em>Austin, 5 <em>Q. B. </em>671 ; Dun <em>v. </em>Sayles, 5 <em>lb. </em>685.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-5\">VII. Even if the words used, standing alone, could, if unexplained, by some means be construed to imply a promise on the part of the defendant, the context clearly shows that a mere offer and nothing more was intended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-6\">VIII. The failure of section eight to fix any time during which the non-exclusive license therein provided for is to continue' shows that no executed license was intended.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b86-7\">By the Court.\u2014Freedman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9q\">In construing the contract between the parties as a whole, the 8th section must be held to provide not for an executed license, but for an option of which the defendant may avail itself upon paying a mentioned sum. The fact that no time is fixed anywhere for the continuation of the so-called non-exclusive license, imperatively calls for that conclusion under all the circum - stances. There is no indication anywhere that it was the intention of the parties that the license should continue for the time the contract would have run, if it had not been terminated, and there is no logical connection between the duration of the license and the time fixed for the duration of the contract. In fact the license was not to come into existence until after the termination of the contract. Another difficulty is that there are quite a number of patents issued at widely different times and which consequently will expire at widely different times, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>and that in the absence of everything showing a meeting, of minds as to a certain period, it is not reasonable to suppose that the defendant agreed to pay $6,500 per year until the expiration of the patent last issued. The most reasonable construction is that section eight gave to the defendant merely the option to use the patents on the payment of the sum of $6,500 per year, and that the time during which such use and such license were to continue, was left for future consideration and negotiation. There being no express or implied promise to pay the $6,500 per year, and no ground for implying one, the plaintiff was bound to show in his complaint that the defendant exercised the option and used the patents, or some of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The judgment and order should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b87-6\">Sedgwick, Ch. J., (concurring).</author>\n<p id=\"AB6\">I agree with Judge Freedman and wish to make a few further observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The rule of construction given in Decker <em>v. </em>Furniss, 14 N. <em>Y. </em>611, should be followed. It is \u201c There is no doubt that the phrase which stands at the commencement of the contract \u2018 William H. Brown sells,\u2019 etc., imports of itself an executed sale. But the books furnish abundant evidence that phrases of this kind are used in a very loose sense and that their literal signification is often overruled by the tenor and purpose of the whole instrument. So a party to a contract may say he agrees to sell and yet the intention be entirely manifest that the title shall pass immediately. Such phrases are quite inconclusive and are often made to yield to other terms of the contract evincing a different design.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">The covenant, leaving out words not involved in the controversy, reads: \u201c It is further mutually agreed, that in the event of the termination of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>agreement, the said company (by reason of the expenditures that shall have been made during the continuance of this agreement) shall have a license (not exclusive) to use all of the inventions that may-have been used in carrying on the business of the company on the payment of $6,500 per year to be paid quarterly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">It appears that the sole consideration of the grant \u2022 of the privilege to use, is indicated in the words \u201cbyreason of the expenditures that shall have been made during the continuance of this agreement,\u201d and the words \u201c on the payment of $6,500 per year\u201d do not refer to the making of the grant. The latter words are a part of the description of the nature of the grant. That grant is a license to use on the payment of $6,500. The general rule is that, nothing else forbidding, words that are relative must be held to refer to the last antecedent, that is, that the payment refers to \u201c to use,\u201d and the further rule is that the antecedent being ascertained, it must be read in the relative clause, that is, that the payment is to be for the use.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">It is not correct in my judgment to suppose that the relative clause refers to \u201c shall have a license,\u201d etc. ; inasmuch as there had been, as has already been said, a consideration appropriated by the covenant to the granting of the privilege or license. This view does not combat the position that a promise to pay the $6,500 was implied, but it is used to show that the payment was to be made for the use. And the further question being was there an implied promise to use, I must say, that there is nothing in the covenant or the rest of the agreement that indicates that the defendant was bound to use the inventions.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b88-7\">'Ingkaham, J., (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"Afp\">I am unable to agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>with my associates in the conclusion to which they have arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"AnD\">This action is brought to recover the amount due for one quarter under an agreement executed by the plaintiff and the defendant. I think that the true construction of this clause of the agreement is, that immediately upon the termination of the agreement of employment, the defendant did have a license to use all the inventions that may have been used in carrying on the business of the company. By operation of the agreement without any further act on the part of either the plaintiff or the defendant, the license was created. No other construction can be given to the clause in question without disregarding the plain obvious meaning of the words used. When an option was given the language used was very different; it was that the company should \u201cbe entitled to purchase \u201d but when a grant was intended the words were \u201c shall have a license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Such being the construction of the contract it is clear that there was an implied obligation to pay the consideration expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">In Booth <em>v. </em>Cleveland Rolling Mill Co., 74 <em>N. Y. </em>21, Allen, J. says: \u201c There is no particular formula of words or technical phraseology necessary to the creation of an express obligation to do or forbear to do a particular thing or perform a specified act. If from the text of an agreement and the language of the parties, either in the body of the instrument or in its recital or reference, there is manifested a clear intention that the parties shall do certain acts, courts will enforce a covenant in the case - of sealed instruments or a promise if the instrument is unsealed for non-performance of which an action on covenant or assumpsit will lie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">In the case of Barton <em>v. </em>McLean, 5 <em>Hill, </em>257, plaintiff agreed to furnish what ore might be wanted in stocking a forge at a price not to exceed $5 per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>toil, and the defendant refused to take any ore. It was held that the defendant was bound to accept and purchase from the plaintiff so much ore as was necessary to stock the defendant\u2019s forge.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">In Richards <em>v. </em>Edick, 17 <em>Barb. </em>263, the plaintiff agreed to sell his farm for and in consideration of $1,700 but there was no express agreement by defendant to buy or pay for the farm. It was held that \u201c when Richards agrees to sell his farm to Edick for $1,700, and two hundred and forty acres of land in Illinois, and Edick signs the agreement, there is a promise to purchase and pay for the farm; the consideration expressed is as clearly implied as though it were expressed in w'ords. It is not merely a promise made by one paity to the other, but it was an agreement made by both and binding upon both by every principle of law and morality applicable to the construction of contracts and this case is cited with approval in Baldwin <em>v. </em>Humphrey, 44 <em>N. Y. </em>615, where the same principle is applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">In the covenant in this case the same words are used.- The clause in question commences.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\u201cIt is further mutually covenanted and agreed.\u201d What ? \u201c that the defendant shall have a license\u201d on payment of $ 6,500 per year. To this covenant the words of Mr. Justice G-bidley in Richards <em>v. </em>Edick apply. \u201c When the defendant signed the agreement there was a promise to pay for the license ; the consideration expressed was as clearly implied as though it were expressed in words.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">The tenth clause of the agreement strongly confirms the view that this construction was the one intended by the parties. It is there provided, that in the \u201c event of the business of the company being terminated by circumstances over which the officers and directors have no control, this contract shall be null and void, and the license to use the inventions above referred to shall cease.\u201d If the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>ant had the option to use the invention or not as it pleased and was only obliged to pay when it used, it, the provision would be entirely unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">I am of the opinion, therefore, that the defendant was liable to the plaintiff whether it used the invention or not, and that the complaint set up a good cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">I think, therefore, that the judgment should be erversed and judgment ordered for the plaintiff as demanded in the complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
