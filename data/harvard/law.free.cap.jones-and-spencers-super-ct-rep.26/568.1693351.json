The plaintiff, who was an attorney, left the court room a short time before the case was called, \u201c leaving some one in attendance at court to answer should the case be called during his, deponent\u2019s, absence.\u201d The plaintiff, was absent from court about fifteen minutes, and \u201c upon his'return he learned that his case was dismissed on motion of defendants\u2019 attorney.\u201d This does not show any excuse. It is vague. It does not assert even that the plaintiff was ready and intended to go to trial. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>does not give the name of plaintiff\u2019s representative in his absence and show what that representative did or the immediate circumstances of the dismissal .of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">The order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
