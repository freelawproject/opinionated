When it appears that the object sought is to obtain information concerning an anticipated defence and other matters beyond the making of the pleading, the order should be denied.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b245-11\">Before Freedman and Truax, JJ.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b245-13\"><em>Decided </em>June, 27, 1890.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-14\">Appeal from order for defendant\u2019s examination.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-15\"><em>Semple &amp; Cahill, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-16\"><em>Jacob E.

The test therefore is whether a necessity was shown for the purpose stated. The proof fails to establish such a necessity. From all that appears by the affidavits on both sides it is evident that the plaintiff has sufficient knowledge of the facts constituting his alleged cause of action and that his object is to obtain' information concerning an anticipated defence and to find out whether the cause of action cannot be extended to other parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The order should be reversed with ten dollars costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Truax, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
