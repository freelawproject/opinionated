He contends that the district court should have reduced his sentence even more than it did because, he argues, his original sentence was based on relevant conduct that he did not admit and that was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt in violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-20\">Daniels did not raise this issue in his motion in the district court; thus, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>596 F.3d 273, 276 (5th Cir.2010). Section 3582(c)(2) gives a district court the discretion to modify a defendant\u2019s sentence in certain cases where the Sentencing Commission lowers the applicable guidelines range after the defendant has been sentenced. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236-37 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). However, motions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) may not be used to challenge the correctness of the defendant\u2019s original sentence, as Daniels attempts to do here. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-21\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b391-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
