Mahasin, a federal prisoner, is currently serving a sentence imposed in 2002 by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri for possession of heroin with intent to distribute, possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense, attempted murder of a federal witness, and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction and sentence. <em>See United States v. Mahasin, </em>362 F.3d 1071 (8th Cir.2004). Mahasin\u2019s motions for rehearing and rehearing en banc were denied on June 4, 2004. On May 26, 2005, Mahasin filed a motion for leave to file a \u00a7 2255 motion out of time; the District Court denied the motion, and Mahasin did not seek review.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">In 2006, Mahasin filed a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 on the grounds that he was \u201cactually innocent\u201d of his weapons convictions and asserting claims for ineffective assistance of counsel. The District Court dismissed the motion as time-barred because it was filed outside of the one year statute of limitations under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(1), and the Court determined that equitable tolling did not apply. The Eighth Circuit denied a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Mahasin filed the instant \u00a7 2241 petition in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, the jurisdiction in which he is confined. Mahasin again seeks to challenge his weapons convictions. The District Court dismissed the petition, and this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its findings of fact. <em>See Vega v. United States, </em>493 F.3d 310, 314 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Generally, the execution or carrying out of an initially valid confinement is the purview of a \u00a7 2241 proceeding, as attacks on the validity of a conviction or sentence must be asserted under \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Hayman, </em>342 U.S. 205, 72 S.Ct. 263, 96 L.Ed. 232 (1952). Despite his arguments to the contrary, Mahasin clearly seeks to attack the validity of his sentence, not its execution. <em>See United States v. Flores, </em>616 F.2d 840, 842 (5th Cir.1980) (petitioner\u2019s appropriate remedy is under \u00a7 2255 and not \u00a7 2241 where alleged errors occurred at or prior to sentencing). He fails to assert claims that fall within the grounds permitted for second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions, as he neither relies on a new rule of constitutional law, nor any newly discovered evidence. Mahasin may not pursue a collateral attack on his sentence by way of \u00a7 2241, however, unless he can show that \u201cthe remedy by \u00a7 2255 motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. It is clear that, under this \u201csafety valve\u201d provision, a prior unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion or the inability to meet the statute\u2019s stringent gatekeeping requirements does not render \u00a7 2255 inadequate or ineffective. <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">Mahasin reasons that he should be allowed to seek relief under \u00a7 2241 because he has been convicted of a \u201cnonexistent crime.\u201d In support of this contention, Mahasin relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>which held that the \u201cuse\u201d of a gun in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) requires proof of actual employment of the fire arm, not merely possession. <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 148, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995). While we have recognized that \u00a7 2241 may be available to present claims where the conduct is no longer deemed criminal, the exception is narrow, limited to a defendant \u201cwho had no earlier opportunity to challenge his conviction for a crime.\u201d <em>Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 251 (emphasis added). Unlike the petitioner in <em>Dorsainvil, </em>Mahasin was convicted after <em>Bailey </em>was decided, and therefore had an opportunity to present his claims during his criminal proceedings and on direct appeal. Mahasin also had the op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>portunity to present his claims in a \u00a7 2255 motion. He waited almost two years after his conviction to file the first \u00a7 2255 motion, and thus it was deemed untimely. Therefore, the District Court properly dismissed the \u00a7 2241 petition as it did not come within \u00a7 2241\u2019s safety valve provision. <em>See Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 539 (3d Cir.2002) (citing <em>Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 251-252) (\u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause \u201cexists to ensure that petitioners have a fair opportunity to seek collateral relief, not to enable them to evade procedural requirements\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Accordingly, because no \u201csubstantial question\u201d is presented as to the dismissal of the \u00a7 2241 petition, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court entered April 24, 2012. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
