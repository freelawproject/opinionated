On appeal, she argues that her sentence is substantively unreasonable. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">A sentence imposed upon the revocation of probation is reviewed for reasonableness, <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006), which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, 551 </em>U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we typically perform two steps. <em>Id. </em>at 1190. First, we \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). This review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d requiring us to determine \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[W]e will not second guess the weight (or lack thereof) that the [district court] accorded to a given factor ... as long as the sentence ultimately imposed is reasonable in light of all the circumstances presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation, alteration and emphasis omitted), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2962, 180 L.Ed.2d 245 (2011). We will \u201cvacate the sentence if, but only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">The party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. While we do not presume a sentence falling within the guideline range to be reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides recommended ranges of imprisonment applicable upon revocation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4. In the case of a revocation based, at least in part, on a violation of a condition specifically pertaining to home confinement, use of the same or a less restrictive sanction is not recommended. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(c)(3). The Guidelines recommend a sentence of three to nine months\u2019 imprisonment for a defendant with a criminal history category of I who commits a Grade C probation violation. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">Here, McCaslin has not shown that her sentence was substantively unreasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the record shows, the district court considered the arguments of the parties and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court said that it considered the large number of violations to be \u201cvery serious.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1),(2) (nature and circumstances of the offense; need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense). The court noted that it had previously imposed a lenient sentence on McCaslin because of her children, but that it regretted doing so. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (history and characteristics of the defendant). After hearing the reasons put forth by McCaslin as to why she violated probation, the court stated that her excuses \u201cdon\u2019t hold together.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) (promote respect for the law). The court also observed that McCaslin had a non-negotiable responsibility as a citizen to abide by the laws. <em>Id. </em>The court took into consideration the mitigating factor that McCaslin had attempted to secure employment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (history and characteristics of the defendant). However, the court ulti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>mately concluded that incarceration was necessary to \u201cteach[ ] a lesson.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a)(2)(A) (reflect the seriousness of the offense; provide just punishment for the offense; afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct). While it appears that the court heavily emphasized the need to promote respect for the law, the weighing of the individual \u00a7 3553(a) factors is left to the sound discretion of the court. <em>Snipes, </em>611 F.3d at 872. Additionally, when asked whether it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing the revocation, the court stated that it had. No further explanation was required. See <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir. 2005) (holding that <em>post-Booker, </em>the district court\u2019s acknowledgement that it had considered the parties\u2019 arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors was sufficient).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">In imposing incarceration, the court specifically found that further home confinement was not warranted. <em>See also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(c)(3). Moreover, the court recognized that the applicable sentencing range was three to nine months, and chose a sentence from within that range. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(3)-(4) (the kinds of sentences available and the applicable sentencing range for probation violations). We normally expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Accordingly, in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, McCaslin cannot meet her burden of showing that the court abused its discretion in sentencing her to 6 months\u2019 imprisonment and 18 months\u2019 supervised release. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-7\">. In revoking probation, the district court should consider the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from future crimes of the defendant, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(2), 3565(a). The sentencing court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the guidelines range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b851-9\">. McCaslin raises no challenge to the procedural reasonableness of her sentence, and accordingly, she has waived any claim in this respect. <em>See United States v. Jemigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003) (holding that issues not raised in an initial brief on appeal are deemed abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
