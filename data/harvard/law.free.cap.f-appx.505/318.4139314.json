She also sought to have the college held vicariously hable for the acts of its employees and asserted state law claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>for both intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Burton now appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of her action in response to the College\u2019s motion under Rule 12(b)(6) for Burton\u2019s failure to state any claim on which relief may be granted. The gravamen of Burton\u2019s argument on appeal is that her reliance on equitable tolling to avoid the otherwise applicable time bars requires more factual development than that which the court had before it within only the four corners of her pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Even though Burton\u2019s contention might have merit under other circumstances, they are unavailing here. As patiently analyzed and explained in considerable detail by the district court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion of June 15, 2012, no additional facts, whether in pleadings or as might be adduced during the course of summary judgment practice, could rescue Burton\u2019s ADA and Title VII claims from the applicable statutes of limitation; neither could they salvage her claims grounded in infliction of emotional distress, whether intentional or negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">For essentially the same reasons the district court set forth in its aforesaid Memorandum Opinion, that court\u2019s dismissal of Burton\u2019s action with prejudice is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b340-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
