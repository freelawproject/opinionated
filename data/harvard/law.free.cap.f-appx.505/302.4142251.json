Plaintiff-Appellant Ellis Dees appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellant United Rentals North America, Inc. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Defendant-Appellant United Rentals North America, Inc. (\u201cUnited Rentals\u201d) is in the business of renting, selling, and servicing construction equipment throughout the United States. In September 2000, United Rentals hired Plaintiff-Appellant Ellis Dees \u2014 an African-American man \u2014 to work at its San Diego, California location. In September 2001, Dees was promoted to service technician. In this position, he maintained and repaired the equipment that United Rentals rented to customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">In Fall 2006, Dees voluntarily resigned and moved to northwestern Florida to be closer to his family. Several weeks after moving, he re-applied to United Rentals for employment at its Gulfport, Mississippi location, and was offered a service technician position in St. Rose, Louisiana. Branch Manager Mike Sauve made the decision to make the offer, which Dees accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Although the first two years of Dees\u2019 employment in St. Rose went smoothly, United Rentals contends that his attitude and work performance deteriorated beginning in 2009. Specifically, it alleges that he began, with increasing frequency, to mark equipment as fit to be rented even though it was not in working order. Dees\u2019 managers \u2014 Sauve and Lee Vincent\u2014 coached him when these incidents occurred, and noted them in his 2009 midyear and full-year performance reviews. Dees was also given written warnings in August 2009, October 2009, February 2010, and March 2010. Dees was given a \u201cfinal written warning\u201d on March 4, 2010, advising him that \u201cthe next incident will result in immediate termination.\u201d Following a further incident six days later, Sauve and Vincent told Dees that he was fired. Dees was sixty-two years old at the time of his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">Dees filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging employment discrimination based on his race and age. After receiving a \u201cright to sue\u201d notice, he filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. United Rentals filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted on March 29, 2012. Dees timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b325-14\">A. Legal Standards</p>\n<p id=\"b325-15\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Ibarra v. United Parcel Serv., </em>695 F.3d 354, 355 (5th Cir.2012). Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a). \u201cA dispute about a material fact is \u2018genuine\u2019 if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Hanchey v. Energas Co., </em>925 F.2d 96, 97 (5th Cir. 1990) (citation omitted). We view all facts and evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>United Fire &amp; Cas. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number><em>Co. v. Hixson Bros. Inc., </em>453 F.3d 283, 285 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Title VII prohibits employers from discriminating based on an individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a). The ADEA makes it \u201cunlawful for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s age.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1). Where, as here, a plaintiff only relies on circumstantial evidence, we apply the framework from <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973) for both Title VII and ADEA claims. <em>Turner v. Baylor Richardson Med. Ctr., </em>476 F.3d 337, 345 (5th Cir.2007) (Title VII); <em>Moss v. BMC Software, Inc., </em>610 F.3d 917, 922 (5th Cir.2010) (ADEA). Pursuant to that framework, Dees first must make a prima facie case of discrimination based on age or race. <em>Vaughn v. Woodforest Bank, </em>665 F.3d 632, 636 (5th Cir.2011); <em>Rachid v. Jack In The Box, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 305, 309 (5th Cir.2004). To establish a prima facie case, Dees must show that he: (1) was a member of a protected group; (2) qualified for the position in question; (3) was subjected to an adverse employment action; and (4) received less favorable treatment due to his membership in the protected class than did other similarly situated employees who were not members of the protected class, under nearly identical circumstances. <em>Wesley v. Gen. Drivers, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers Local 745, </em>660 F.3d 211, 213 (5th Cir.2011); <em>Smith v. City of Jackson, Miss., </em>351 F.3d 183, 196 (5th Cir.2003). As to his age discrimination claim, Dees can satisfy the fourth prong by showing that \u201che was either i) replaced by someone outside the protected class, ii) replaced by someone younger, or iii) otherwise discharged because of his age.\u201d <em>Rachid, </em>376 F.3d at 309 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">If Dees makes a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to United Rentals to \u201carticulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for firing\u201d him. <em>Vaughn, </em>665 F.3d at 636. If it does so, Dees must, as to his Title VII claim, \u201coffer sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact either (1) that [United Rentals\u2019] reason is not true, but is instead a pretext for discrimination (pretext alternative); or (2) that [United Rentals\u2019] reason, while true, is only one of the reasons for its conduct, and another \u2018motivating factor\u2019 is [Dees\u2019] protected characteristic (mixed-motives alternative).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). As to his ADEA claim, Dees \u201cmay show pretext either through evidence of disparate treatment or by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is false or unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Moss, </em>610 F.3d at 922 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Unlike Title VII, it is insufficient under the ADEA to show that discrimination was a motivating factor; Dees must show that age was the \u201cbut for\u201d cause of the challenged adverse employment action. <em>Id. </em>at 928 (citing <em>Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., </em>557 U.S. 167, 173-78, 129 S.Ct. 2343, 174 L.Ed.2d 119 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">B. Title VII and ADEA Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">The district court assumed, without deciding, that Dees established a prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII and the ADEA. The district court then determined that United Rentals had provided extensive evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Dees\u2019 termination \u2014 namely, unsatisfactory job performance. The evidence United Rentals provided included numerous verbal and written warnings, as well as a final written warning that \u201cthe next incident would result in immediate termination.\u201d The evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>dence also showed that an additional incident occurred less than a week after the final written warning when United Rentals delivered a piece of equipment that did not operate as a result of Dees alleged failure to properly service the equipment\u2019s batteries. Because United Rental had submitted a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for discharging Dees, the burden shifted back to Dees to produce evidence that United Rentals\u2019 reason was a pretext for discrimination. The district court concluded that Dees had only made conclusory allegations that he was discriminated against and that United Rentals made the wrong decision in firing him. Taking note of the complete lack of evidence of discriminatory conduct, the district court granted United Rentals\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">On appeal, Dees only argues that the district court (1) incorrectly focused on his entire work record, instead of restricting its analysis to the actual incident resulting in his termination; and (2) erred in characterizing him as challenging United Rentals\u2019 business decision. United Rentals responds that Dees has not submitted evidence that his discharge was motivated by his race or age. United Rentals adds that Dees\u2019 termination was supported by repeated performance lapses. Finally, United Rentals contends that Dees has done no more than argue that he is not guilty of the offense leading to his discharge and that this is insufficient to show pretext.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">We agree with the district court that Dees failed to submit any evidence of discrimination and that this is fatal to his claims under Title VII and the ADEA. As did the district court, we assume that Dees has established a prima facie case of discrimination based on his race or age. We also assume <em>arguendo </em>that the proper focus for our analysis should be the final decision that resulted in Dees\u2019 termination. In so doing, we take note that Dees does <em>\u201cnot </em>dispute the early [Disciplinary] Notices, <em>nor </em>criticize [United Rentals\u2019] business judgment.\u201d Even so, Dees\u2019 claims must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">His termination notice states that he was terminated for failing to follow United Rentals\u2019 policy of ensuring that the batteries in rental equipment were in good working order prior to delivery of the equipment. Dees contends that there was no notice of a policy requiring \u201cdouble checking\u201d or \u201cre-checking\u201d batteries, and that United Rentals\u2019 practice in this area was inconsistent. Although such evidence may show that United Rentals failed to clearly enunciate the steps necessary to perform a final battery check, it does not show that this was not the reason for which United Rentals terminated him. Dees states that he has \u201craised a material issue whether he was responsible for the bad battery,\u201d but whether or not United Rentals\u2019 policy made him responsible for the battery does not show that Sauve and Vincent did not consider him responsible under such a policy. <em>See Turner, </em>476 F.3d at 346 (defendant\u2019s failure to follow own policies is not probative of discriminatory intent under Title VII where plaintiff failed to show that she was treated differently than other non-minority employees). That Sauve and Vincent may have exercised poor judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>ment, or even erred in this regard, is not at issue. <em>See Mayberry v. Vought Aircraft Co., </em>55 F.3d 1086, 1091 (5th Cir.1995) (\u201cThe question is not whether an employer made an erroneous decision; it is whether the decision was made with discriminatory motive.\u201d); <em>Jackson v. Cal-W. Packaging Corp., </em>602 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.2010) (\u201c[Plaintiffs] assertion of innocence alone does not create a factual issue as to the falsity of [Defendant\u2019s] proffered reason for terminating him.\u201d). Consequently, Dees has, at best, only raised a genuine dispute as to a non-material fact, and summary judgment will not be denied on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Additionally, Dees has presented nothing to tie United Rentals\u2019 final termination decision to a discriminatory motive. Dees\u2019 concession that he is not challenging the earlier disciplinary notices constrains the opportunities United Rentals had to discriminate against him. Dees himself describes United Rentals as motivated by an \u201cI ain\u2019t missing no rents\u201d philosophy that encouraged renting out equipment regardless of its readiness. No evidence shows that United Rentals\u2019 philosophy also included discriminating against African-Americans or senior workers. Similarly, no evidence demonstrates that United Rentals\u2019 decision to discharge Dees was motivated by his race or age. Indeed, Dees\u2019 appellant brief does not so much as mention race or age, except for describing his complaint as alleging race and age-based discriminatory discharge. Dees\u2019 subjective belief that United Rentals discriminated against him is clearly insufficient to demonstrate pretext. <em>See Price v. Marathon Cheese Corp., </em>119 F.3d 330, 337 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">For the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in United Rentals\u2019 favor.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b324-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b327-7\">. The parties spar over the applicability of the \"same actor\u201d inference. \"The 'same actor\u2019 inference arises when the individual who allegedly discriminated against the plaintiff was the same individual who hired the plaintiff and gives rise to an inference that discrimination was not the motive behind plaintiff\u2019s termination.\u2019\u2019 <em>Russell v. McKinney Hosp. Venture, </em>235 F.3d 219, 228 n. 16 (5th Cir.2000). The district court did not include the same actor inference as a ground for its decision and we find it unnecessary to address that argument here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
