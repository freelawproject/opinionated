Depalis-Lachaud sued Noel under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violating her rights under the Fourth Amendment. The district court denied Noel\u2019s motion for summary judgment based upon the defense of qualified immunity and granted Depalis-Laehaud\u2019s motion for summary judgment on her Fourth Amendment claims. Noel appeals these rulings. We affirm the denial of summary judgment based upon qualified immunity but reverse the grant of summary judgment to Depalis-Lachaud.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">The incident leading to this case occurred on June 17, 2009. That night, Noel, a deputy sheriff of the Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office, arrived around 10 p.m. to perform an intoxication assessment of a man hospitalized following a car accident. After observing the man, Noel approached the nurses\u2019 workstation and asked Depalis-Lachaud, one of the registered nurses on duty at the time, to obtain a blood sample from the man as evidence of his blood alcohol content. (Florida Statutes \u00a7 316.1933(2)(a) allows only certain individuals, including registered nurses, to draw blood samples from suspects of intoxicated driving following accidents.) The parties offer contrasting descriptions of what happened next. Because we find the difference material, we provide both accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">According to Noel, Depalis-Lachaud \u201cgave [him] a puzzled look\u201d when he requested that she draw blood, and she told Noel that the hospital \u201cd[id]n\u2019t do that.\u201d (R.l-17-1 at 8.) She \u201cthen turned around and started to walk away.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>When Noel explained to her that he was a police officer conducting an investigation that required the immediate collection of blood evidence, she again told him that the hospital did not \u201cdo that[] for law enforcement.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Noel then held out a blood-draw kit and told her that her continued refusal to assist him would violate Florida Statute \u00a7 843.02, which criminalizes obstruction of an officer in the lawful execution of a legal duty. <em>(Id.) </em>Depalis-La-chaud apparently \u201cwas ignoring\u201d him and told him that she had to \u201cmake a phone call ... to some superiors to see whether or not they were going to allow her to draw blood.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Noel told her he could not wait for her to make phone calls or ask superiors, but he said in his deposition that she did not make any calls or have any conversations with superiors anyway. <em>(Id.) </em>Noel then told her that he was \u201cgiving [her] an order\u201d to \u201cdraw this blood or ... be placed under arrest,\u201d and he asked her, \u201cAre you going to draw this blood, yes or no.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 9.) Depalis-Lachaud responded, \u201cNo.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Noel then arrested her and took her to his car in the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-14\">Depalis-Lachaud\u2019s account differs somewhat. She agrees that she told Noel, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>response to his initial request for a blood sample, that \u201cit was against the policy of the V.A. to get the blood.\u201d (R.l-17-5 at 10.) She also told him to \u201cgo call somebody else.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>When he persisted, she said, \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for the doctor. The doctor has to make that decision.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 12.) She then left the workstation and spoke with the doctor on duty that night, Richard Harrison. <em>(Id. </em>at 11, 12.) Harrison told her that he would have to speak with the chief emergency room physician, a Dr. Lammert, so Depalis-Lachaud found the administrator in charge and asked him to call Lammert to get authorization to collect the sample. <em>(Id. </em>at 11.) Depalis-Lachaud returned to the workstation where Noel was waiting and told him that she had just spoken to Harrison, and Harrison would come to the desk to talk to Noel. <em>(Id. </em>at 13.) Noel told her that he needed the blood immediately and would arrest someone if he did not get it. <em>(Id.) </em>When Depalis-Lachaud continued to refuse to draw the blood, Noel arrested her.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">After taking Depalis-Lachaud to his car, Noel returned to the workstation and had another nurse, Linda Denison, collect the blood sample from the man. (R.l-17-1 at 10.) After around thirty minutes, Noel released Depalis-Lachaud from the car and from her handcuffs, and he gave her a notice to appear on an obstruction charge. (R.l-17-5 at 16-17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Following the incident, Depalis-Lachaud filed a seven-count complaint against Noel and Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw, which she later amended to include eight counts. Counts I and III together seek to hold Noel liable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that Noel violated the Fourth Amendment when he arrested De-palis-Lachaud without probable cause. Counts II and IV together seek to hold Noel liable under \u00a7 1983 for violating the Fourteenth Amendment when he treated her, a black woman, differently than hospital employees of different races. Count V seeks to hold both defendants liable under \u00a7 1983 in their official capacities, Count VI seeks to hold Bradshaw liable under \u00a7 1983 for a Fourth Amendment violation, and Counts VII and VIII allege state law negligence claims against Bradshaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">Noel and Bradshaw moved for summary judgment on all counts. Noel\u2019s motion argued that he was entitled to qualified immunity from Counts I and III (the Fourth Amendment claims against him) and made various arguments regarding the other six counts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Depalis-Lachaud responded to the motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on Counts I, III, and V. The district court granted Noel and Bradshaw\u2019s motion on Counts VI, VII, and VIII but denied the rest of the motion, including Noel\u2019s argument that he was entitled to qualified immunity on Counts I and III. In the same order, the court granted Depalis-Lachaud\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Counts I, III, and V. The court allowed Counts II and IV to proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">Noel filed an interlocutory appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of qualified immunity on Counts I and III. He also seeks to invoke our pendent jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Depalis-Lachaud on Counts I, III, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>and V and the court\u2019s denial of Noel\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Counts II and IV. We exercise our appellate jurisdiction over the denial of qualified immunity on Counts I and III, and we exercise our pendent jurisdiction over the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to De-palis-Lachaud on those counts only. We decline to address the remaining issues\u2014 the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Count V and the denial of summary judgment on Counts II and IV \u2014 for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">We thus consider two rulings: (1) the district court\u2019s denial of Noel\u2019s assertion of qualified immunity from Counts I and III, and (2) the court\u2019s consequent grant of Depalis-Lachaud\u2019s motion for summary judgment on those counts. We review a district court\u2019s resolution of a motion for summary judgment de novo. <em>McCullough v. Antolini, </em>559 F.3d 1201, 1202 (11th Cir. 2009). Summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine issue of material fact remains for trial and a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a); <em>Grider v. City of Auburn, </em>618 F.3d 1240, 1246 n. 1 (11th Cir.2010). In reviewing a court\u2019s grant or denial of summary judgment, we resolve all issues of material fact in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Terrell v. Smith, </em>668 F.3d 1244, 1248 (11th Cir.2012); <em>McCullough, </em>559 F.3d at 1202.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">Here, we consider the district court\u2019s resolution of two opposing summary judgment motions. Our review of the district court\u2019s denial of Noel\u2019s motion for summary judgment requires us to resolve all issues of material fact and draw all inferences from the facts in Depalis-Lachaud\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">favor. Our review of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Depalis-Lachaud, however, requires us to do the opposite and resolve all factual issues in Noel\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">The district court ruled that, under any version of the facts, Noel was not entitled to qualified immunity. On that basis, the court denied qualified immunity to Noel and granted summary judgment to Depal-is-Lachaud. Thus, our holding here depends on whether, applying the summary judgment standard separately to each ruling, Noel was entitled to qualified immunity from Counts I and III. We begin with a brief explanation of qualified immunity, and we then address the district court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">Qualified immunity shields a government official sued in his individual capacity from \u00a7 1983 liability when the official\u2019s conduct did not \u201cviolate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Grider, </em>618 F.3d at 1254. The doctrine \u201cprotect[s] from suit \u2018all but the plainly incompetent or one who is knowingly violating the federal law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lee v. Ferraro, </em>284 F.3d 1188, 1194 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">To invoke qualified immunity, an official must first show that he was acting within his discretionary authority when the alleged violation occurred. <em>Courson v. McMillian, </em>939 F.2d 1479, 1487 (11th Cir. 1991).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If he does, the non-moving party must show that the officer is not entitled to qualified immunity by proving that the \u201cofficer\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right\u201d that \u201cwas clearly established\u201d by existing law at the time. <em>Lee, </em>284 F.3d at 1194. In false-arrest cases like this one, the qualified immunity standard requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>the plaintiff to show that the officer lacked both actual probable cause and arguable probable cause for the arrest; thus, if an officer shows that he had either type of probable cause, he is entitled to qualified immunity. <em>See, e.g., Coffin v. Brandau, </em>642 F.3d 999, 1006 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc); <em>Brown v. City of Huntsville, </em>608 F.3d 724, 734-36 (11th Cir.2010). An officer has actual probable cause when \u201cthe facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge, of which he or she has reasonably trustworthy information, would cause a prudent person to believe\u201d that the suspected person \u201cis committing ... an offense.\u201d <em>Williamson v. Mills, </em>65 F.3d 155, 158 (11th Cir.1995). An officer has arguable probable cause when \u201c \u2018reasonable officers in the same circumstances and possessing the same knowledge as the Defendant ] could have believed that probable cause existed to arrest\u2019 the plaintiff! ].\u201d <em>Scarbrough v. Myles, </em>245 F.3d 1299, 1302 (11th Cir.2001). We can analyze the existence of actual or arguable probable cause in either order, and if we conclude that the officer had one type of probable cause, we need not analyze the other. <em>See Coffin, </em>642 F.3d at 1006.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">We turn to the district court\u2019s denial of Noel\u2019s defense of qualified immunity. We will affirm if we conclude, on de novo review and making all factual inferences in Depalis-Lachaud\u2019s favor, that Noel had neither type of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Noel argues that either of two statutes \u2014 Florida Statutes \u00a7 843.02 or \u00a7 843.06 \u2014 provide arguable, if not actual, probable cause to justify the arrest. Construing the record in Depalis-Lachaud\u2019s favor, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">Section 843.02 provides that \u201c[wjhoever shall resist, obstruct, or oppose any officer ... in the lawful execution of any legal duty, without offering or doing violence to the person of the officer, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d In proving a \u00a7 843.02 violation, the state must show that \u201c(1) the officer was engaged in the lawful execution of a legal duty[] and (2) the defendant\u2019s action, by his words, conduct, or a combination thereof, constituted obstruction or resistance of that lawful duty.\u201d <em>C.E.L. v. State, </em>24 So.3d 1181, 1185-86 (Fla.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"AfAv\">We cannot see how Depalis-La-chaud\u2019s account of the encounter leading to the arrest demonstrates obstruction or resistance \u2014 in fact, she actually seems to have assisted Noel more than she resisted him. Her description of events suggests that she responded to Noel\u2019s request by actively and immediately seeking authorization from the appropriate superiors, as she believed the hospital\u2019s policies required. When she returned to the nurses\u2019 workstation, she continued to attend to Noel\u2019s questions by explaining to him that Harrison, the physician in charge, would come up front to speak to him about the matter. Noel arrested her as she insisted that she lacked the required authorization to assist him. No reasonable officer could have believed that \u00a7 843.02 provided probable cause to arrest a nurse who had merely passed an officer\u2019s request to the attending doctor and refused to assist him without required authorization. Noel therefore lacked even arguable probable cause to arrest Depalis-Lachaud under \u00a7 843.02, at least by her account.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">For the same reason, \u00a7 843.06 also fails to provide Noel with arguable probable cause. Section 843.06 provides in relevant part that \u201c[wjhoever, being required in the name of the state by any officer ... neglects or refuses to assist him or her in the execution of his or her office in a criminal case ... shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree.\u201d Again, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>Depalis-Lachaud\u2019s actions, according to her deposition testimony, indicate no neglect or refusal to assist Noel in the execution of his office; she appears to have done all in her power to respond to Noel\u2019s request. No reasonable officer could have believed that \u00a7 843.06 supplied probable cause for the arrest, and Noel lacked even arguable probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">We conclude that the district court properly denied the motion for summary judgment to the extent that it raised the defense of qualified immunity against Counts I and III.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">We also conclude, however, that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Depalis-Lachaud on those counts because, construing the record this time in Noel\u2019s favor, Noel had arguable probable cause for the arrest under either \u00a7 843.02 or \u00a7 843.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">Noel\u2019s account of the events paints a materially different picture than Depal-is-Lachaud\u2019s account. Noel\u2019s deposition transcript and other incident reports suggest that, instead of immediately seeking authority from her superiors, Depalis-La-chaud dismissed Noel\u2019s request initially by unclearly citing hospital policies, ignored his presence when she returned to the nurses\u2019 workstation, prevented him from acquiring assistance by making no phone calls and having no conversations with superiors to seek authorization, and directly refused Noel\u2019s order. Notably missing from Noel\u2019s account of the incident is any indication that he knew that Depalis-La-chaud sought authorization from Harrison or anyone else in response to Noel\u2019s request. On these facts, we conclude that Noel had at least arguable probable cause under \u00a7 843.02 or \u00a7 843.06, which therefore entitles him to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">Section 843.02 criminalizes the resistance or obstruction of an officer engaged in the lawful execution of a legal duty. <em>C.E.L., </em>24 So.3d at 1185-86. That Noel was \u201cengaged in the lawful execution of a legal duty\u201d when he requested or ordered Depalis-Lachaud to assist him is plain. Florida Statutes \u00a7 316.1933(l)(a) provides that, if an officer \u201chas probable cause to believe that a motor vehicle driven by\u201d an intoxicated person \u201chas caused the death or serious bodily injury of a human being,\u201d the officer \u201cshall require\u201d the person to submit to a blood test to determine the presence of alcohol or a controlled substance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 316.1933(2)(a) then says that \u201c[o]nly [certain individuals, such as physicians, paramedics, or registered nurses], acting at the request of a law enforcement officer, may withdraw blood\u201d for the purposes of (l)(a). By its plain meaning, the statute allows an officer to force a suspect of intoxicated driving to submit to a blood test in the wake of a serious accident but limits the class of individuals eligible to physically administer the test. The statute includes this limitation to preserve the health and safety of the suspect<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and not, as the district court believed, to reserve a right of refusal for the tester responding to the officer\u2019s request. It is difficult to see how Noel\u2019s order that De-palis-Lachaud draw blood from the hospitalized suspect does not qualify as a lawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>execution of the legal duty created by \u00a7 316.1933.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Moreover, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to Noel, a reasonable officer could believe that Depalis-Lachaud obstructed, resisted, or opposed Noel\u2019s efforts to obtain the blood sample in violation of \u00a7 843.02 or \u00a7 843.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Relevant case law clarifying the specific type of conduct constituting a \u00a7 843.02 violation is scant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Depalis-Lachaud\u2019s actions, however, could easily fit the plain meanings of the words. For example, by ignoring Noel\u2019s presence and seeking no authorization to draw blood for Noel after she told him she was required to, she arguably hindered \u2014 or obstructed \u2014 Noel\u2019s efforts to obtain a sample, especially given the need to draw a sample while alcohol remained in the suspect\u2019s bloodstream. Moreover, by refusing to assist him or follow his order to draw the blood, she arguably opposed his request. Nothing in the statute or relevant case law suggests that no reasonable officer could believe that Depalis-Lachaud was violating \u00a7 843.02 by refusing to assist Noel in collecting the sample and by neglecting to seek authorization to do so.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Even if \u00a7 843.02 does not supply arguable probable cause, \u00a7 843.06 does. The district court rejected Noel\u2019s \u00a7 843.06 argument because the statute only requires an individual to assist an officer \u201cin his official duties of preserving the peace, apprehending or securing a suspect, or assisting in the rescue or preventing the escape of an arrestee,\u201d and it \u201cdoes not require a person to assist an officer in the collection of evidence.\u201d (R.2-61 at 18 n. 7 (citing <em>State v. Parish, </em>509 So.2d 1365, 1366 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1987)).) We find no conclusive support in relevant case law for the district court\u2019s limited interpretation of \u00a7 843.06, and even the case the district court cites alludes to a broader interpretation. <em>See Parish, </em>509 So.2d at 1366 (recognizing that \u00a7 843.06 \u201cwarn[s] a person of common intelligence that one must not refuse or neglect to aid an officer who asks for assistance\u201d in his official duties, which <em>include </em>preserving the peace, apprehending a suspect, assisting in rescue, or preventing an escape). Nothing in relevant case law suggests that no reasonable officer could believe that \u00a7 843.06 provided probable cause to arrest Depalis-Lachaud under the circumstances, and we conclude, given her actions in response to Noel\u2019s requests for assistance, that a reasonable officer could believe that probable cause existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>We conclude, after resolving all disputes of material fact in Noel\u2019s favor, that Noel had arguable probable cause to arrest De-palis-Lachaud for a violation of either \u00a7 843.02 or \u00a7 843.06. We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Depalis-Lachaud on Counts I and III and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">In sum, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment to Noel on Counts I and III but reverse its grant of summary judgment to Depalis-Lachaud on those counts because the qualified immunity issue cannot be resolved on the record available at the summary judgment stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">We are mindful that the question of qualified immunity should be resolved at the earliest possible stage in litigation. <em>See Crawford v. Carroll, </em>529 F.3d 961, 978 (11th Cir.2008). We also note that, in cases like this one where the question cannot be resolved at summary judgment because of a disputed issue of material fact, the officer may renew his qualified immunity defense with a timely Rule 50(a) or 50(b) motion or by requesting special jury interrogatories on the factual issues underlying the defense. <em>See Cottrell v. Caldwell, </em>85 F.3d 1480, 1487-88 (11th Cir. 1996); <em>Stone v. Peacock, </em>968 F.2d 1163, 1166 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b888-6\">. The motion does not clarify whether Noel intends his qualified-immunity argument to apply against the Fourth Amendment claims (Counts I and III) only or to the Fourteenth Amendment claims (Counts II and IV) as well. We believe, however, that Noel intended to apply his defense of qualified immunity to Counts I and III only. Noel never makes a specific argument that he is entitled to qualified immunity from Counts II and IV, and he argues on appeal that the district court erred in denying qualified immunity only on Counts I and III.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b889-8\">. Neither party disputes that Noel acted within the scope of his discretionary authority when he arrested Depalis-Lachaud.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b891-9\">. No party challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 316.1933(i)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b891-10\">. <em>See Mehl v. State, </em>632 So.2d 593, 594-95 (Fla.1993) (recognizing that \u00a7 316.1933 is intended to allow police to collect blood samples, but it limits the method by which sam-pies are drawn); <em>Robertson v. State, </em>604 So.2d 783 (Fla.1992) (Grimes, J., concurring) (acknowledging that the provision limiting the ability to draw blood to certain individuals was included for the purpose of protecting the health and safety of the suspect).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b892-7\">. Only decisions of the United States Supreme Court, this court, and the highest court of the pertinent state (here, the Florida Supreme Court) clearly establish the law for qualified-immunity purposes. <em>McClish v. Nugent, </em>483 F.3d 1231, 1237 (11th Cir.2007). The several cases from intermediate appellate courts in Florida that are cited in the district court\u2019s order do not bear on whether Noel is entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b892-8\">. The parties give great importance to a letter sent from Palm Beach County State Attorney Barry E. Krischer to all area hospitals in 2007. The letter, apparently responding to increasingly frequent incidents of hospital staff refusing to draw blood for law enforcement officers, advises hospital staffs that \"[a]ny nurse who refuse[s] to draw blood when requested by a law enforcement officer is in violation of Florida Statute \u00a7 843.02 as actively obstructing a police officer in his lawful investigation.\u201d (R.l-17-4 at 2.) The letter is not signed, does not support its interpretation with any case law, and does not respond to the exact incident in this case, and the district court gave the letter negligible weight for these reasons. We agree that the letter\u2019s conclusion appears unsupported and recognize that the opinion of a government attorney cannot, by its own merit, supply probable cause for an arrest. We conclude, however, that Noel had arguable probable cause even without reference to or reliance on this letter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
