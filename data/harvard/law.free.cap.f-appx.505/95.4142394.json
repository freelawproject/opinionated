Turner, a state inmate currently incarcerated at SCI Mahanoy in Frackville, Pennsylvania and proceeding pro se, appeals from orders of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania granting Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss his second amended complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and denying his post-judgment motions. Because this appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Because we write primarily for the parties, we need only recite the facts necessary for our discussion. On July 27, 2010, Turner was transferred to SCI Graterford, refused to be housed with a cell mate, and received a misconduct write-up from Lieutenant Knapp and Sergeant Phipps. After a disciplinary hearing held before Hearing Examiner Canino, Turner pled guilty and received thirty days in disciplinary custody. According to Turner, this write-up and hearing violated his due process and equal protection rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">Turner was released from disciplinary custody on August 12 or 13, 2010 and was returned to the general population, where he was placed in the top bunk of a double cell despite a doctor\u2019s note in his possession stating that Turner was to have lower bunk status. According to Turner, Unit Managers O\u2019Mara and Fanrak violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by placing him in a top bunk. Turner also alleges that he suffered foot and leg injuries and anxiety attacks after being placed in a double cell. Furthermore, he argues that nurses John and Jane Doe failed to take action despite being presented with his doctor\u2019s note and that Wendy Shaylor violated his rights by stating that such a note was not included in his records at SCI Graterford. Finally, Turner alleges that upon his return to SCI Mahanoy, physician\u2019s assistant Inuzzy violated his Eighth Amendment rights by taking away his lower bunk status, thereby causing Turner to fall and suffer a torn rotator cuff.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">On December 29, 2010, Turner filed this civil rights action in the Court of Common Pleas for Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. In March 2011, Appellees filed a notice of removal to remove Turner\u2019s complaint to the District Court. Appellees filed a motion to dismiss Turner\u2019s complaint on March 21, 2011, and approximately a month later, Turner filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint. On May 13, 2011, the District Court granted Turner leave to file an amended complaint and denied Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">Turner filed his first amended complaint on May 24, 2011. In response, Appellees filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted by the District Court on March 20, 2012. However, the District Court gave Turner leave to file a second amended complaint by April 6, 2012. Turner filed his second amended complaint on April 4, 2012. Appellees filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and on June 27, 2012, the District Court granted Appellees\u2019 motion and dismissed Turner\u2019s second amended complaint with prejudice. Turner subsequently filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings relating to summary judgment and a motion pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 59(e) to alter or amend the judgment, both of which were denied by the District Court on August 3, 2012. Turner then timely filed his notice of appeal as to the District Court\u2019s June 27, 2012 and August 3, 2012 orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s dismissal order. <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). To survive dismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), \u201ca complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). This Court affirms a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim \u201conly if, accepting all factual allegations as true and construing the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, we determine that the plaintiff is not entitled to relief under any reasonable reading of the complaint.\u201d <em>McGovern v. City of Philadelphia, </em>554 F.3d 114, 115 (3d Cir.2009). We may affirm the District Court on any basis supported by the record. <em>Brightwell v. Lehman, </em>637 F.3d 187, 191 (3d Cir.2011) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Section 1983 provides private citizens with a means to redress violations of federal law committed by state officials. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. To establish a claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff \u201cmust establish that she was deprived of a federal constitutional or statutory right by a state actor.\u201d <em>Kach v. Hose, </em>589 F.3d 626, 646 (3d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The District Court correctly dismissed Turner\u2019s claims against defendants Attorney General, Moore, MacIntyre, and Wen-erowicz for lack of personal involvement. Liability under \u00a7 1983 cannot be premised on the theory of respondeat superior; instead, each individual defendant \u2018\u201cmust have personal involvement in the alleged wrongdoing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Evancho v. Fisher, </em>423 F.3d 347, 353 (3d Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Rode v. Dellarciprete, </em>845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir.1988)); <em>see also Polk Cnty. v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 325, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981). Here, although Turner names the Attorney General, Moore, Maclnytre, and Wenerowicz as defendants, his second amended complaint fails to establish that they personally directed the alleged violations or had actual knowledge of the alleged violations and acquiesced to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">We further agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Eleventh Amendment provides the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (\u201cDOC\u201d) defendants protection from suit in their official capacities. The Eleventh Amendment protects a state or state agency from a federal suit regardless of the relief sought, unless Congress has specifically abrogated the state\u2019s immunity or the state has waived its own immunity. <em>MCI Telecomm. Corp. v. Bell Atl.-Pa., </em>271 F.3d 491, 503-04 (3d Cir.2001); <em>see also Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 662-63, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974). Section 1983 does not abrogate states\u2019 immunity. <em>See Quern v. Jordan, </em>440 U.S. 332, 340-41, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 59 L.Ed.2d 358 (1979). Furthermore, \u201c[ijndividual state employees sued in their official capacity are also entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity.\u201d <em>Betts v. New Castle Youth Dev. Ctr., </em>621 F.3d 249, 254 (3d Cir.2010). We have previously noted that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has expressly withheld its consent to be sued. <em>See Lavia v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>224 F.3d 190, 195 (3d Cir.2000); <em>see also </em>42 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 8521(b). Because the DOC is a part of Pennsylvania\u2019s executive department, its employees share in Eleventh Amendment immunity to the extent they are sued in their official capacities. <em>See Will v. Mich. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number><em>Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2804, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989); <em>see also Lavia, </em>224 F.3d at 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Turner alleges that Knapp and Phipps violated his right to due process when they denied his request for self-confinement under Pennsylvania Department of Corrections Administrative Directive (\u201cDC-ADM\u201d) 802 and issued him a misconduct for disobeying an order to be housed with a cell mate. He also alleges that Canino violated his due process rights during his disciplinary hearing. Although Turner\u2019s allegations do not distinguish between substantive due process and procedural due process, we consider each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Certain fundamental rights are substantively protected by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause. <em>See White v. Napoleon, </em>897 F.2d 103, 111 (3d Cir.1990). A claim alleging a substantive due process violation requires a showing of behavior that can \u201cproperly be characterized as arbitrary, or conscience shocking.\u201d <em>Cnty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, </em>523 U.S. 833, 847, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998); <em>see also Newman v. Beard, </em>617 F.3d 775, 782 (3d Cir.2010) (\u201cConduct can violate substantive due process if it shocks the conscience, which encompasses only the most egregious official conduct.\u201d). Here, the District Court properly dismissed Turner\u2019s substantive due process claim because Knapp, Phipps, and Cami-no\u2019s conduct was not arbitrary and did not \u201c \u2018shock[ ] the conscience.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chainey v. Street, </em>523 F.3d 200, 219 (3d Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc. v. Twp. of Warrington, </em>316 F.3d 392, 400 (3d Cir.2003)). It was within Knapp and Phipps\u2019 discretion to deny Turner\u2019s request for administrative custody and to issue a misconduct for disobeying an order and within Camino\u2019s discretion to determine whether Turner was in fact guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Procedural due process protection \u201cfor a state created liberty interest ... is limited to those situations where deprivation of that interest \u2018imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u2019 \u201d <em>Griffin v. Vaughn, </em>112 F.3d 703, 706 (3d Cir.1997) (quoting <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995)). No liberty interest is implicated where the state action does not \u201cpresent a dramatic departure from the basic conditions of confinement.\u201d <em>Sandin, </em>515 U.S. at 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293; <em>see also Burns v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>642 F.3d 163, 171 (3d Cir.2011) (\u201c[I]nmates are generally not entitled to procedural due process in prison disciplinary hearings because the sanctions resulting from those hearings do not usually affect a protected liberty interest.\u201d). State regulations, such as those contained in DC-ADM 802, own their own do not create a due process liberty interest. <em>See Griffin, </em>112 F.3d at 708. Here, Turner\u2019s thirty-day confinement in administrative custody does not constitute an atypical or significant hardship. See <em>id. </em>(\u201c[EJxposure to the conditions of administrative custody for periods of as long as 15 months ... did not deprive [the inmate] of a liberty interest and [ ] he was not entitled to procedural due process protection.\u201d). Accordingly, the District Court correctly dismissed Turner\u2019s procedural due process claims against Knapp, Phipps, and Canino.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Turner next alleges that he was denied equal protection of the law when he received disciplinary custody and when he was assigned a top bunk in a double cell. We agree with the District Court that Turner has insufficiently pled this claim because he has not provided evidence that he received treatment different than that received by other similarly situated individuals. <em>Williams v. Morton, </em>343 F.3d 212, 221 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Finally, Turner alleges that defendants Shaylor, Farnak, O\u2019Mara, John Doe, Jane Doe, and Inuzzy<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by not providing adequate medical care even though he possessed a doctor\u2019s note stating that he was to have lower bunk status. Specifically, Turner states that he suffered physical injuries and anxiety attacks because of this inadequate care.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">To plead an Eighth Amendment claim based on medical care, a plaintiff must demonstrate that defendants displayed deliberate indifference to a serious medical need. <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976); see <em>also White v. Napoleon, </em>897 F.2d 103, 108-09 (3d Cir.1990) (quoting <em>Estelle, </em>429 U.S. at 103, 97 S.Ct. 285) (\u201cOnly \u2018unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain\u2019 or \u2018deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs\u2019 of prisoners are sufficiently egregious to rise to the level of a constitutional violation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">With regards to Shaylor, we have previously noted that non-medical officials are entitled to rely on medical professionals\u2019 judgment. <em>See Spruill v. Gillis, </em>372 F.3d 218, 236 (3d Cir.2004) (\u201c[A]bsent a reason to believe (or actual knowledge) that prison doctors or their assistants are mistreating (or not treating) a prisoner, a non-medical prison official ... will not be chargeable with the Eighth Amendment scienter requirement of deliberate indifference.\u201d); <em>Durmer v. O\u2019Carroll, </em>991 F.2d 64, 69 (3d Cir.1993). Turner\u2019s second amended complaint does not plead any facts or present any documentation suggesting that Shaylor was aware of the doctor\u2019s note assigning him to lower bunk status; indeed, he seeks to hold Shaylor liable simply for stating that such a note was not part of his record at SCI Graterford. Accordingly, the District Court properly dismissed Turner\u2019s claim as to Shaylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">While a prison official may violate the Eighth Amendment by \u201cintentionally interfering with [medical] treatment once prescribed,\u201d <em>Estelle, </em>429 U.S. at 105 &amp; n. 12, 97 S.Ct. 285, Eighth Amendment liability cannot be based on simple negligence or lack of due care, <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 835-39, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). \u201cIt is well-settled that claims of negligence or medical malpractice, without some more culpable state of mind, do not constitute \u2018deliberate indifference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rouse v. Plantier, </em>182 F.3d 192, 197 (3d Cir.1999). Here, Turner\u2019s second amended complaint fails to establish that Farnak, O\u2019Mara, John Doe, Jane Doe, and Inuzzy were deliberately indifferent to his health. Notably, while Turner has attached a 1996 doctor\u2019s note assigning lower bunk status that was approved by medical staff at SCI Greene, he himself states that a unit manager informed John Doe that there was nothing in his medical or prison record at SCI Graterford to indicate that he had lower bunk status. Accordingly, the District Court properly dismissed Turner\u2019s Eighth Amendment claims because he did not demonstrate that Farnak, O\u2019Mara, John Doe, Jane Doe, and Inuzzy knew about, let alone disregarded, his lower bunk status.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">After the District Court dismissed his second amended complaint with prejudice, Turner filed a \u201cMotion for Judgment on the Pleadings Relating to Summary Judgment.\u201d Accordingly, the District Court properly denied this motion. Turner also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>filed a \u201c59(e) Motion to alter or Amend Judgment,\u201d alleging that his second amended complaint should not have been dismissed because he had demonstrated that the defendants had caused his injuries and because the District Court had overlooked some of his claims. However, because Turner was requesting relief from the District Court\u2019s final judgment, the District Court properly treated his motion as one pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) and denied it because Turner had not identified the basis for his requested relief. <em>See Ahmed v. Dragovich, </em>297 F.3d 201, 208 (3d Cir.2002) (courts may construe post-judgment motions as Rule 59(e) or Rule 60(b) motions).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">For the foregoing reasons, no substantial question is presented and we will affirm the judgment of the District Court. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6. Turner\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied. <em>See Tabron v. Grace, </em>6 F.3d 147, 155-56 (3d Cir.1993).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b122-6\">. The proper venue for Turner\u2019s claims against Inuzzy and staff at SCI Mahanoy is the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(b). Although the District Court should have dismissed this claim without prejudice to Turner\u2019s re-filing it in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, we conclude that such error is harmless because, as discussed below, Turner's claim has no merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
