However, the complaints do not include a single factual allegation suggesting that any consumer has ever been physically harmed by the weight loss products. As the district court observed: \u201cFailing to achieve weight reduction means the body basically did not change. It does not mean that the body was injured.\u201d R. 1780. Although, as CSAN notes, relief based on bodily injury was available under the statutes relied upon in the complaints, this is irrelevant-the focus is on the factual allegations of a complaint. <em>See, e.g., Farmers Tex. Cnty. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Griffin, </em>955 S.W.2d 81, 82 (Tex.1997). Furthermore, <em>Zurich American Insurance Co. v. Nokia, Inc., </em>268 S.W.3d 487 (Tex.2008), on which CSAN relies heavily, is plainly inapposite. In that case, the plaintiffs in an underlying suit sought recovery based on \u201cbiological injury\u201d and specifically described the ways in which their bodies had allegedly been injured. Here, the plaintiffs in the underlying case alleged that they were financially harmed by purchasing an ineffective product.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Because we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on the ground explained above, we need not reach the issues presented in Chubb\u2019s cross-appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b321-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
