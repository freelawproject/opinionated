Mathis was sentenced as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. On appeal, he concedes the limited scope of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, but urges this Court to review the drug quantity findings at sentencing in the interest of justice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-23\">\u201c[W]e review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may not reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment unless the defendant\u2019s sentence was based upon a sentencing range that the Sentencing Commission subsequently lowered, the district court considers the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-24\">Mathis\u2019s sentence was based on his career-offender enhancement, and Amendment 750 therefore had no effect on his sentencing range under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327 (holding that when a defendant is sentenced as a career offender, the sentence is \u201cbased on\u201d the guideline ranges applicable to career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1, not the levels set forth in \u00a7 2D1.1). Moreover, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>court was not permitted to change any of the original sentencing calculations in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings except those affected by a retroactive guideline amendment. <em>See United States v. </em>Bravo, 203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). Therefore, Mathis is ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and the district court did not err in denying his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b874-18\">. Mathis requests that, in the alternative to granting a sentence reduction, this Court reopen his prior 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, which was denied in 2007. Mathis may not use his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reopen his \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
