Before the district court ruled on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, the state court dismissed the underlying negligence suit with prejudice because it found the plaintiffs had perpetrated fraud on the court, a ruling those plaintiffs did not appeal. State Farm then filed a suggestion of mootness in the federal declaratory judgment action. The district court found the case moot and dismissed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-16\">Thereafter, Coker moved for attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.428(1). The district court granted the request and applied a contingency fee multiplier to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>award Coker $72,555 in attorneys\u2019 fees. State Farm appeals the district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees on two alternative grounds: (1) Coker was not entitled to fees under \u00a7 627.428(1); and (2) even assuming Coker was entitled to fees, the district court erred by applying the contingency fee multiplier. After careful review, we vacate the district court\u2019s order of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of state law <em>de novo. Trans Coastal Roofing Co. v. David Boland, Inc., </em>309 F.3d 758, 760 n. 1 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Section 627.428(1) of the Florida Statutes provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-6\">Upon the rendition of a judgment or decree by any of the courts of this state against an insurer and in favor of any named ... insured ... the trial court ... shall adjudge or decree against the insurer and in favor of the insured ... a reasonable sum as fees or compensation for the insured\u2019s ... attorney prosecuting the suit in which the recovery is had.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajk\">The purpose of this statute is \u201cto discourage the contesting of valid claims against insurance companies and to reimburse successful insureds for their attorney\u2019s fees when they are compelled to defend or sue to enforce their insurance contracts.\u201d <em>Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. Lexow, </em>602 So.2d 528, 531 (Fla.1992). Hence, it permits an award of attorneys\u2019 fees not only when there is a judgment entered against the insurer but also when the insurer \u201cdecline[s] to defend its position,\u201d resulting in \u201cthe functional equivalent of a confession of judgment or a verdict in favor of the insured.\u201d <em>Wollard v. Lloyd\u2019s &amp; Cos. of Lloyd\u2019s, </em>439 So.2d 217, 218 (Fla. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">The district court treated State Farm\u2019s suggestion of mootness as the functional equivalent of a confession of judgment or a verdict in favor of Coker. The court reasoned that State Farm had the right to further pursue the declaratory-judgment action because, if the coverage dispute were resolved in its favor, State Farm could then recover from Coker the costs it incurred for its participation in the negligence suit. Because State Farm chose not to do so, the district court found that the suggestion of mootness was the functional equivalent of a voluntary dismissal that entitled Coker to prevailing party attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 627.428(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">In this appeal, State Farm contends it did not have the right to continue with the declaratory judgment action after the underlying negligence suit was dismissed with prejudice. Because it had not reserved its right to recover costs from Coker, State Farm contends, it could not do so under Florida law. State Farm also argues that, because the negligence suit did not settle but rather was dismissed for fraud on the court, it did not decline to defend its position that it owed Coker no defense or indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">We agree. State Farm was not entitled to pursue attorneys\u2019 fees and costs after the underlying negligence suit had terminated because it did not reserve the right to recover its costs in the negligence suit. <em>See Colony Ins. Co. v. G &amp; E Tires &amp; Serv., Inc., </em>777 So.2d 1034, 1039 (Fla. 1st Dist.Ct.App.2000) (holding that the insurer was entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees from the insured because, among other reasons, it \u201ctimely and expressly reserved the right to seek reimbursement of the costs of defending clearly uncovered claims\u201d); <em>see also Wendy\u2019s of N.E. Fla., Inc. v. Vandergriff, </em>865 So.2d 520, 522 (Fla. 1st Dist.Ct.App.2003) (\u201cBecause [the insurer] expressed no such reservation of rights to attorney\u2019s fees and costs to [the insured] when undertaking its defense, <em>Colony Insurance </em>is inapplicable....\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>Because State Farm had no right to seek those fees, it lacked the right to continue the declaratory judgment action. <em>Cf. Ethredge v. Hail, </em>996 F.2d 1173, 1175 (11th Cir.1993) (\u201cA case is moot when it no longer presents a live controversy with respect to which the court can give meaningful relief\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Nor did State Farm \u201cdecline[] to defend its position\u201d that it had no duty to defend or indemnify Coker in the negligence suit. <em>See Wollard, </em>439 So.2d at 218. The negligence suit was dismissed because the plaintiff perpetrated fraud on the court. Hence, State Farm did not \u201cprovide[] the insured precisely what [State Farm] was contending the insured was not entitled to in the declaratory action\u201d\u2014 namely a defense to or payment of the claim against her in the state court suit. <em>O\u2019Malley v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>890 So.2d 1163, 1164 (Fla. 4th Dist.Ct. App.2004).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Because State Farm could not have further pursued the declaratory-judgment action and did not decline to defend its position, the district court erred when it determined that the suggestion of mootness was functionally equivalent to a confession of judgment or a verdict in Coker\u2019s favor. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 627.428(1) to Coker.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">VACATED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b849-9\">. The district court\u2019s reliance on <em>O\u2019Malley </em>is therefore misplaced. In that case, the court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees to the insured in a declaratory judgment action because the insurer had settled the underlying negligence suit on behalf of the insured. 890 So.2d at 1164-65. Here, by contrast, State Farm did not settle the underlying suit and therefore did not functionally concede a duty to indemnify or defend that was inconsistent with its position in the declaratory-judgment action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b849-24\">. Because we reach this result, we do not consider State Farm\u2019s alternative argument that the district court improperly applied a contingency fee multiplier.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
