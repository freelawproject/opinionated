(Kraft) and Hormel Foods Corporation (Hormel). After <em>de novo </em>review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-9\">Kuenzig filed a putative class-action complaint alleging that Kraft misled consumers into believing its lunch meat products contained fewer fat-calories than they actually did. Kraft achieved this alleged deception by listing caloric amounts and fat-free percentages immediately adjacent to one another on the products\u2019 labels. For example, Kuenzig alleged Kraft\u2019s label proclaiming its Oscar Mayer Honey Ham to be \u201c98% Fat Free \u2022 50 calories per serving\u201d misled consumers into believing ninety-eight percent of those fifty calories were fat free, when in actuality the product contained twenty-two percent fat by calories.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-12\">At issue in this case are two district court orders dismissing Kuenzig\u2019s complaints. In the first order, the district court granted Defendants\u2019 joint motion to dismiss Kuenzig\u2019s complaint for two independently sufficient reasons: (1) his state law claims were preempted by federal law, and (2) Kuenzig\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). First, Kuenzig\u2019s state law labeling claims were preempted because such claims would impose labeling requirements \u201cin addition to, or different than\u201d those set forth under federal law. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 467e, 678. Federal regulations required Defendants to label their percentage fat-free claims based on the number of fat grams compared to the weight of their products. Defendants complied with this requirement. Also, federal regulations relating to the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 451 <em>et seq., </em>and the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 601 <em>et seq., </em>required Kraft and Hormel to submit their labels to the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) for approval prior to using the labels on their lunch meat products. <em>See </em>9 C.F.R. \u00a7 381.182(a), \u00a7 317.4(a). Defendants also complied with this requirement. Because Kuenzig\u2019s state law claims would impose requirements \u201cin addition to, or different than\u201d federal law, they were preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-13\">Second, Kuenzig\u2019s labeling allegations failed to state a claim. According to the district court, Kuenzig\u2019s contentions were \u201cfrivolous with respect to Hormel\u2019s labels, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>and disingenuous at best with respect to Kraft\u2019s labels.\u201d Because the both parties\u2019 labels complied with federal nutrition labeling regulations and passed the FSIS preapproval process, the labels were presumptively lawful and not false or misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">The district court dismissed all of Kuen-zig\u2019s labeling claims with prejudice, but granted Kuenzig leave to file an amended complaint to assert a Little Federal Trade Commission Act claim (Little FTC Act) based on non-label advertising. Kuenzig accepted that invitation, filing an amended complaint alleging that Defendants\u2019 advertisements misled consumers regarding the amount of fat-calories in their lunch meat products.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendants\u2019s advertisements allegedly misled consumers by including pictures of the lunch meat labels and by identifying the products by their fat-free percentages.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">In the second order, the district court granted Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss Kuenzig\u2019s amended complaint for two reasons: (1) the Defendants did not violate Florida\u2019s Little FTC Act, because they were protected under the safe harbor provision of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (FDUTPA); and (2) Kuenzig again failed to state a claim for relief under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). First, pursuant to its safe harbor provision, the FDUTPA does not apply to acts specifically permitted by federal law. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 501.212(1). Defendants\u2019 labels were specifically permitted by federal law. The labels complied with federal regulations regarding the use of percentage fat-free claims and were approved by FSIS prior to their commercial use. Accordingly, Kraft and Hormel could not be liable pursuant to the FDUTPA\u2019s safe harbor provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">Second, the district court also concluded Kuenzig failed to state a claim. Specifically, Kuenzig failed to allege a basis upon which Hormel\u2019s percentage fat-free claim could be considered unfair or deceptive. Because Kuenzig had not shown Hormel\u2019s label was unfair or deceptive on its own, the label could not become unfair or deceptive simply by virtue of being pictured in an advertisement. Accordingly, the district court dismissed the claims in Kuen-zig\u2019s amended complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">In sum, we affirm the dismissal of Kuen-zig\u2019s claims against Kraft and Hormel for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned orders. Kuenzig\u2019s state law labeling claims are preempted by federal law. Alternatively, Kuenzig\u2019s state law labeling claims were properly dismissed for failure to state a claim. Finally, Kuenzig\u2019s Little FTC Act claims are barred by the safe harbor provision of the FDUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b960-10\">. Kuenzig conceded that Hormel does not label caloric amounts near any fat-free percentages. Rather, Kuenzig alleged that because Hormel knew its products would be placed on grocery shelves near Kraft\u2019s products, Hormel\u2019s fat-free percentage claims also misled consumers. Kuenzig also acknowledged that both Kraft and Hormel include a nutrition panel on the back label of their lunch meat packaging, which discloses the number of calories per serving, as well as the number of those calories that come from fat.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b961-7\">. Kuenzig's amended complaint added a second plaintiff and new allegations against Hormel. The district court granted Hormel\u2019s motion to strike the portions of the amended complaint relating to Hormel that exceeded the scope of the leave to amend, as well as the newly added plaintiff. Kuenzig does not challenge these decisions on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
