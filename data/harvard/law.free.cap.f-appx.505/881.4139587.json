On appeal, he ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>gues that, even though he was sentenced as a career offender, he is still eligible for relief under Amendment 750 in light of two district court decisions. Moreover, he has submitted proof of extensive post-conviction activity that he argues should be viewed favorably in considering the purposes of sentencing. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may not modify a term of imprisonment unless a defendant was sentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.... \u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In addressing whether a defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction, a district court is to consider only the effect of the applicable guideline amendment. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir.2000). Thus, <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781 (emphasis in original). Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, made retroactively applicable on November 1, 2011, by Amendment 759, makes permanent the temporary emergency Amendment 748, which revised the crack cocaine quantity tables listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) and the drug equivalency tables in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n,10(D)). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750, Reason for Amend.; <em>id., </em>Amend. 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">In <em>Moore, </em>we addressed whether Amendment 706, which similarly reduced the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses, authorized reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for defendants who had been convicted of crack cocaine offenses, but had been sentenced under the career offender guidelines. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1325. We explained that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only authorizes reductions to sentences that were \u201cbased on\u201d sentencing ranges that were subsequently lowered. <em>Id. </em>at 1327. As Amendment 706 did not lower the career offender offense levels, we concluded that it did not lower the sentencing range upon which a career offender\u2019s sentence had been based. <em>Id. </em>We also explained that the commentary to \u00a7 1B1.10 \u201c[made] clear\u201d that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction was not authorized where an amendment lowered a defendant\u2019s base offense level for the offense of conviction, but not the career offender sentencing range under which the defendant was sentenced. <em>Id. </em>at 1327-28; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)). <em>Moore </em>is binding precedent in this circuit. <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">On November 14, 2012, we decided <em>United States v. Berry, </em>in which we addressed the applicability of Amendment 750 and the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d) in the context of an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. 701 F.3d 374 (11th Cir.2012). Berry was convicted of a crack cocaine offense and sentenced in 2002, and his initial guideline range was 360 months to life imprisonment, which was based on his status as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), not on the drug quantity tables in \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>Id. </em>at 376-77. In addition, because Berry had two prior felony drug convictions, he was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum life sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2009), such that his guideline sentence became life imprisonment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 376-77 &amp; n. 2. Berry filed a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 750, and the motion was denied. <em>Id. </em>at 376. On appeal, we affirmed, holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>that the District Court did not have the authority to grant Berry\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Amendment 750 had no effect on Berry\u2019s initial guideline range of 860 months to life imprisonment or his guideline sentence of life imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">We conclude that the District Court did not err in denying Williams\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Although Amendment 750 would have reduced Williams\u2019s initial base offense level under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), the District Court sentenced him as a career offender who faced a statutory minimum term of imprisonment because that sentence was required by the guidelines. His base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1, therefore, did not affect the calculation of his guideline sentence range or his guideline sentence of life imprisonment, and thus Amendment 750 did not alter the sentencing range upon which his sentence was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
