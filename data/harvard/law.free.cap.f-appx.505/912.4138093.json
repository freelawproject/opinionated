After review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-15\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b935-16\">In 1999, Onyirimba, a native citizen of Nigeria, entered the United States on a temporary work visa. In 2005, Onyirim-ba\u2019s employer filed an I-140 visa petition on Onyirimba\u2019s behalf, with Onyirimba\u2019s first wife Grace Onyirimba, also a Nigerian citizen, as a rider. On February 27, 2006, Onyirimba\u2019s I-140 petition was denied, and his subsequent motion to reopen was denied on April 10, 2006. Less than a month later, Onyirimba divorced Grace on May 2, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-17\">Shortly thereafter, on May 22, 2006, Onyirimba married his second wife, Inez McQueen, a U.S. citizen. In November 2006, McQueen filed an I-130 visa petition on Onyirimba\u2019s behalf based on their marriage. On July 30, 2007, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d) denied the 2006 I-130 petition for failure to establish the <em>bona fides </em>of the marital relationship and to dispel suspicions that the marriage to McQueen was entered into for the purpose of evading the immigration laws. According to the USCIS\u2019s notice of intent to deny the petition, there were numerous discrepancies between McQueen\u2019s and Onyirimba\u2019s interview answers, and public records indicated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>the couple did not share a common home and that Onyirimba still lived in the home owned by his first wife, Grace.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">Less than three weeks later, Onyirimba divorced McQueen, and, a few days after the divorce, on August 25, 2008, Onyirimba married his third wife, Cecilia Watts Bester (\u201cBester\u201d), also a U.S. citizen. On September 9, 2008, Bester filed a new I-130 visa petition on Onyirimba\u2019s behalf. Onyirimba also filed an I-176 petition for employment authorization and an I-485 petition for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">On September 22, 2008, the Immigration and Naturalization Services issued a Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d), charging Onyirim-ba with removability under Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), for overstaying his visa. In April 2009, agency officials assigned to a fraud unit issued a report (\u201cFraud Unit Report\u201d) regarding Onyirimba. The Fraud Unit Report noted the proximity of Onyirimba\u2019s divorces following the denials of relief, and the extremely short periods between Ony-irimba\u2019s divorces and his subsequent remarriages and concluded that Onyirimba\u2019s two marriages to U.S. citizens were entered into in order to gain an immigration benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">In June 2009, Onyirimba admitted the allegations in the NTA and moved to continue his removal proceedings until the pending I-130 visa petition filed by his third wife Bester could be adjudicated. Onyirimba also asked for voluntary departure under INA \u00a7 240B(b), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(b). The IJ denied the continuance request, concluding that ample evidence existed in the record to conclude that Onyirimba\u2019s marriages were entered into for immigration purposes. The IJ noted in particular the Fraud Unit Report and the many discrepancies in the interviews for the prior I-130 petition filed by Onyirimba\u2019s second wife McQueen. The IJ deemed Onyirimba removable, and granted him voluntary departure within sixty days, conditioned upon posting a bond. If Onyirimba remained in the United States after the sixty days, the IJ\u2019s voluntary departure order would become a removal order.</p>\n<p id=\"A8P\">The BIA dismissed Onyirimba\u2019s appeal. The BIA concluded that Onyirimba had not demonstrated good cause for a continuance, as he did not establish that his pending I-130 petition filed by his current wife Bester was <em>prima, facie </em>approvable, particularly given the denial of his 2008 I-130 petition filed by his second wife McQueen. Because Onyirimba had failed to submit proof that he posted the required bond, the BIA ordered him removed to Nigeria.</p>\n<p id=\"AZH\">On July 14, 2011, Onyirimba petitioned this Court for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since then, the USCIS has denied Onyirimba\u2019s pending I-130 petition filed by Bester. Bester has appealed the USCIS\u2019s denial to the BIA, and her BIA appeal remains pending.</p>\n<p id=\"ANc\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AhH\">A. Background</p>\n<p id=\"A-D\">Onyirimba\u2019s petition challenges the denial of his request to continue his removal proceedings in order to wait on the discretionary ruling on his I-130 petition filed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>his third wife Bester.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An IJ has the discretion to grant a motion to continue removal proceedings \u201cfor good cause shown.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1008.29. When an alien has requested a continuance to await adjudication of a family-based I-130 visa petition, \u201c \u2018discretion should, as a general rule, be favorably exercised where a prima facie approvable visa petition and adjustment application have been submitted in the course of a deportation hearing....\u2019 \u201d <em>Bull v. I.N.S., </em>790 F.2d 869, 872 (11th Cir.1986) (quoting <em>In re Garcia, </em>16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 653, 655, 657 (BIA 1978)). However, this is not intended to be \u201can inflexible rule requiring the immigration judge in all cases to continue the deportation proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 872 (quoting <em>Garcia, </em>16 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 657).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">This Court has said that \u201c[i]t clearly would not be an abuse of discretion for the immigration judge to summarily deny a request for a continuance ... upon his determination that the visa petition is frivolous .\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). This Court has also concluded that it is not an abuse of discretion for the IJ to deny a continuance request to await a pending petition when there is only the \u201cspeculative possibility\u201d that the petition will be granted. <em>See Zafar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1357, 1363-64 (11th Cir.2006) (involving a pending request for labor certification, which was needed before the alien could seek adjustment of status). The BIA has stated that the IJ\u2019s focus is \u201con the likelihood of success of the [current] visa petition,\u201d and that, in deciding whether to grant a continuance, the IJ may consider, <em>inter alia, </em>whether past visa petitions by the alien were denied and any evidence of potential fraud. <em>In re Hashmi, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 785, 789, 792 (BIA 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">B. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">We review the denial of a continuance request for abuse of discretion. <em>Zafar, </em>461 F.3d at 1362. \u201cJudicial review of denials of discretionary relief incident to [removal] proceedings ... is limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Garcia-Mir v. Smith, </em>766 F.2d 1478, 1490 (11th Cir.1985) (quotation marks omitted). When, as here, the BIA issued a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, in which case we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Thus, to the extent the BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s reasons for not granting Onyirimba a continuance, we review both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">C. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">Here, the IJ and BIA did not abuse their discretion by denying Onyirimba\u2019s motion to continue his removal proceedings until his then-pending I-130 visa petition could be adjudicated. Given that Onyirimba\u2019s previous I-130 petition filed by McQueen was denied for lack of <em>bona</em>fides regarding that marriage and that the Fraud Unit Report, detailing the suspicious chronology of Onyirimba\u2019s denials of immigration relief, divorces, and remarriages, had concluded that Onyirimba\u2019s marriages to both McQueen and Bester were for the purpose of obtaining an immigration benefit (i.e., fraudulent), it was highly unlikely that Onyirimba\u2019s new I-130 petition filed by Bester would be granted. Indeed, the bases for denying the prior I-130 petition filed by McQueen and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>subsequent Fraud Unit Report constitute substantial evidence supporting the BIA\u2019s finding that Onyirimba could not establish that the then-pending I-130 petition filed by Bester was prima facie approvable. <em>See In re Hashmi, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 789 (explaining that the DHS will approve an I-130 petition if the petitioner established (1) his or her U.S. citizenship, (2) the <em>bona fides </em>of the claimed relationship with the beneficiary, and (3) that the relationship meets the statutory requirements). Under the circumstances, we cannot say the decision to deny a continuance in this case was arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b936-7\">. After filing his petition for review, Onyirim-ba filed a motion for reconsideration with the BIA. We lack jurisdiction to address Onyirim-ba\u2019s post-petition motion for reconsideration, as Onyirimba did not file a subsequent petition for review. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Dakane </em>v. <em>U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b937-7\">. Onyirimba\u2019s brief filed in this Court does not challenge the IJ's ruling as to voluntary departure or the BIA\u2019s final removal order and thus has abandoned these issues. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1249-50 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
