He argues that his sentence is unreasonable because it was imposed without consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. He also contends that, due to the district court\u2019s application of the 16-level crime of violence enhancement of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (2010), his sentence is. greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals of \u00a7 3553(a). He further argues that his sentence violates the Eighth Amendment and results in an equal protection violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-20\">Ordinarily, this court reviews a district court\u2019s sentencing decision for reasonableness under the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). First, this court analyzes whether the district court committed procedural error, then, if the sentence is proeedurally sound, this court considers the substantive reasonableness of the sentence under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d at 764. Additionally, Banda\u2019s within-guidelines sentence is presumed to be reasonable. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 360 (5th Cir.2009). The presumption is rebutted only upon a showing that the sentence does not account for a factor that should receive significant weight, it gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or it represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-21\">Although Banda did not explicitly present to the district court the challenges that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>he presents to this court, the arguments he presented to the district court could be construed to encompass the challenges that he presents to this court. As the following analysis demonstrates that Ban-da cannot prevail even under the less deferential, abuse-of-discretion standard, we need not determine whether the plain error standard of review should govern this appeal. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>528 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Banda\u2019s argument that the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is refuted by the record, which reflects consideration of the sentencing goals set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). Also, this court has concluded that the district court\u2019s decision to sentence a defendant within a guidelines range that includes the crime of violence enhancement is not inconsistent with legitimate sentencing goals. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 359, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009). Moreover, Banda\u2019s sentence, which was at the bottom of'the guidelines range, was not constitutionally disproportionate and therefore does not constitute a violation of his Eighth Amendment rights. <em>See United States v. Cardenas-Alvarez, </em>987 F.2d 1129, 1133-34 (5th Cir.1993). Regarding Banda\u2019s equal protection challenge, application of the 16-level enhancement does not violate equal protection because it treats all persons with qualifying serious prior offenses who commit a \u00a7 1326 offense equally. <em>See id. </em>at 1134. Additionally, the unavailability of fast-track programs in certain districts does not created an unwarranted disparity among similarly situated persons. See <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 562-63 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b319-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
