At his resentencing, the district court sentenced him to 97 months of imprisonment, two years of supervised release, and $4,222 restitution. On appeal, he argues that the district court violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(h) by failing to provide him with notice prior to sentencing him above the advisory guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-25\">Rather than utilizing an upward departure, the district court imposed Mudeku-nye\u2019s sentence through the use of an upward variance. Because Rule 32(h) does not apply to variances, there was no Rule 32(h) violation in this case. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number><em>States v.

The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time in which to file a brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
