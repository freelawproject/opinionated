Agosta argues that \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B), which allows a court to \u201cmodify an imposed term of imprisonment to the extent otherwise expressly permitted by statute or by Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,\u201d gives the district court the authority to reduce his sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B) (2002). Specifically, he contends that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 expressly permits a reduction of his sentence because his sentence was enhanced for a predicate offense that this Circuit later decided is not a crime of violence. The government responds that the district court properly denied Agosta\u2019s motion. Specifically, the government argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction because Agosta did not file his \u00a7 2241 motion in the district of his incarceration. We agree that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider Agosta\u2019s motion and for that reason affirm the district court\u2019s denial of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-19\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>questions concerning the jurisdiction of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Oliver, </em>148 F.3d 1274, 1275 (11th Cir.1998). The authority of a district court to modify a sentence is a question of law that is also subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>597 F.3d 1190, 1194 n. 9 (11th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-20\">\u201cThe authority of a district court to modify an imprisonment sentence is narrowly limited by statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1194-95. Specifically, \u00a7 3582(c) provides that a district court \u201cmay not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed\u201d unless: (1) the Director of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons moves to reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment; (2) a modification otherwise is expressly permitted by statute or Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35; or (3) the defendant was sentenced based on a guideline range that subsequently was reduced by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, and a reduction is consistent with the Commission\u2019s policy statements. <em>See Id. </em>at 1195. When a motion is filed under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), but there is no statutory authority to modify the sentence, a district court lacks jurisdiction to change the sentence. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number><em>States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1316-19 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Here, Agosta argues that \u00a7 2241 confers authority for the district court to modify his sentence. Agosta concedes that \u201c \u00a7 2241\u2019s application is generally limited to the district in which a prisoner is confined,\u201d but contends that this rule is \u201cnot absolute.\u201d However, our precedent instructs that courts outside the district of a petitioner\u2019s incarceration do not have jurisdiction over a petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2241 motion. <em>Fernandez v. United States, </em>941 F.2d 1488, 1495 (11th Cir.1991). The Supreme Court has explained that the habeas corpus provisions, including \u00a7 2241, \u201ccontemplate a proceeding against some person who has the <em>immediate custody </em>of the party detained, with the power to produce the body of such party before the court or judge.\u201d <em>Rumsfeld v. Padilla, </em>542 U.S. 426, 435, 124 S.Ct. 2711, 2717, 159 L.Ed.2d 513 (2004) (quotation marks omitted). Because Agos-ta filed his \u00a7 2241 motion in the Southern District of Florida while incarcerated in the Middle District of Florida, the district court lacked jurisdiction to review the motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">For this reason, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Agosta\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b916-8\">. We are aware that Agosta was released from custody in the Middle District of Florida on November 14, 2012. <em>See </em>Federal Bureau of Prisons, http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/Locate Inmate.jsp (last visited Dec. 17, 2012). We are also aware that his current address is within the Southern District of Florida. Agosta has not raised the question of whether he may re-file his motion in the Southern District of Florida, and we do not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
