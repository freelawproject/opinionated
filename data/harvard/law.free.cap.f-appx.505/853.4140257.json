Whittaker\u2019s offenses occurred in 2009, and he was sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>tenced by the district court on December 14, 2010. In the meantime, the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA) went into effect on August 3, 2010. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. Ill\u2014 120, 124 Stat. 2372 (2010). At sentencing, the district court declined to apply the FSA, and instead considered the applicable sentencing guideline range to be 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. Although the district court stated the FSA did not apply, it mentioned the FSA when explaining Whit-taker\u2019s sentence, along with the fact that Whittaker was uneducated, unable to find employment, and that his prior drug convictions were \u201csmall level.\u201d Accordingly, the district court imposed a downward variance to reach its 188-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">On appeal, Whittaker argues the district court erred in not applying the FSA to his sentence, as required by <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). The Government concedes the district court erred in failing to apply the FSA but maintains the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application of law to sentencing issues. <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>609 F.3d 1250, 1253 (11th Cir.2010). Claims preserved at sentencing are reviewed for harmless error. <em>United States v. Petho, </em>409 F.3d 1277, 1279 (11th Cir.2005). Non-constitutional error is harmless if it does not affect the substantial rights of the parties. <em>Id. </em>Under this standard, we will only reverse if the error resulted in actual prejudice because it had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>The government carries the burden of showing the error did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">The district court erred in refusing to sentence Whittaker under the FSA. The holding in <em>Dorsey </em>applies to Whittaker because he committed his offenses before the FSA\u2019s effective date, but was sentenced after that date. <em>See Dorsey, </em>132 S.Ct. at 2326 (stating the FSA\u2019s \u201cmore lenient penalty provisions apply to offenders who committed a crack cocaine crime before August 3, 2010, but were not sentenced until after August 3\u201d). Moreover, the government has not met its burden of showing the sentencing error was harmless. <em>See Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d at 1277. In this case, the mandatory m\u00e1xi-mums would change, resulting in a lower guideline range for Whittaker as a career offender. While the 188-month sentence was at the bottom of the post-FSA range of 188 to 235 months, it is not clear from the record that the district court would have imposed the same sentence had it begun within that range, and the Government has not cited any binding precedent to support its argument that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
