He was sentenced to a total of 97 months of imprisonment and to concurrent three-year terms of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-18\">On appeal, Robinson argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the anti-kickback counts on the grounds that the Anti-Kickback Statute and the statute\u2019s safe-harbor provision are unconstitutionally vague. He also argues, alternatively, that the statute\u2019s safe-harbor provision should have applied to exempt his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-19\">According to the indictment, Robinson owned and operated Memorial Medical Supply (\u201cMMS\u201d), a company that provided durable medical equipment to Medicare beneficiaries. The indictment alleged Robinson paid kickbacks to Lisa Jones and Shirley Chavis in exchange for Medicare beneficiary information. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal. <em>United States v. Girod, </em>646 F.3d 304, 313 (5th Cir.2011). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Challenges to the constitutionality of a federal statute are also reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Portillo-Munoz, </em>643 F.3d 437, 439 (5th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1969, 182 L.Ed.2d 821 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">\u201cA conviction fails to comport with due process if the statute under which it is obtained fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2705, 2718, 177 L.Ed.2d 355 (2010). We consider whether a statute is unconstitutionally vague \u201cas applied to the particular facts at issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2718-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">The Anti-Kickback Statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b(b)(2), \u201ccriminalizes the payment of any funds or benefits designed to encourage an individual to refer another party to a Medicare provider for services to be paid for by the Medicare program.\u201d <em>United States v. Miles, </em>360 F.3d 472, 479 (5th Cir.2004). Under the safe-harbor provision, the statute\u2019s criminal prohibition does not apply to \u201cany amount paid by an employer to an employee (who has a bona fide employment relationship with such employer) for employment in the provision of covered items or services.\u201d \u00a7 1320a-7b(b)(3)(B). Although Robinson contends that the provision\u2019s definition of \u201cemployee\u201d is vague, the safe-harbor provision relies on 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121(d)(2) for the definition that an employee is \u201cany individual who, under the usual common law rules applicable in determining the employer-employee relationship, has the status of an employee.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 1001.952\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">When a federal statute such as this one refers to the common law definition of employee, the statute incorporates the \u201cgeneral common law of agency.\u201d <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, </em>503 U.S. 318, 323, 112 S.Ct. 1344, 117 L.Ed.2d 581 (1992). The hiring party\u2019s \u201cright to control the manner and means\u201d of the work performed is important to determining whether there is employee status. <em>Id. </em>Relevant factors include the method of payment, \u201cwhether the work is part of the regular business of the hiring party,\u201d and the hiring party\u2019s control over work hours. <em>Id. </em>at 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 1344. No one factor is determinative; \u201call of the incidents of the relationship must be assessed and weighed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 324, 112 S.Ct. 1344.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">The Anti-Kickback Statute provided Robinson with fair notice that the paying of fees and commissions to Jones and Chavis for Medicare referrals was prohibited conduct and, thus, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied in this case. The evidence presented does not support Robinson\u2019s affirmative defense that Jones and Chavis were bona fide employees such that the safe-harbor provision applied to exempt his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-15\">The evidence reflects that both Jones and Chavis were paid either a fee or a commission for each referral of a Medicare beneficiary that they provided to MMS. They did not receive regular paychecks; payments were made for referrals only. There was no evidence that Robinson provided any training or direction to either Jones or Chavis about marketing, nor was there any evidence that either Jones or Chavis ever received any payments from MMS to advertise or market MMS\u2019s products. Moreover, the Medicare referrals were obtained from leads and sources that were not provided by MMS: Jones used her employer\u2019s database to ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>tain referrals, and Chavis relied on her own personal and professional contacts to obtain referrals. There is no evidence that Robinson required Jones or Chavis to keep regular office hours. Indeed, they did not have offices at MMS. Thus, Robinson did not have sufficient control over the manner and means of the work performed by Jones and Chavis to characterize this as a bona fide employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">In light of this and the other evidence presented at trial, we cannot conclude that the district court\u2019s denial of Robinson\u2019s motion was erroneous or that the evidence provided a sufficient foundation for Robinson\u2019s affirmative defense that the safe-harbor exception applies in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
