He argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court imposed a two-year term of supervised release, notwithstanding that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) provides that supervised release \u201cordinarily\u201d should not be imposed \u201cin a case in which supervised release is not required by statute and the defendant is a deportable alien who likely will be deported after imprisonment.\u201d Hernandez-Caballero contends that the district court, in imposing supervised release, relied on the prohibited factor of punishment. Because Hernandez-Caballero did not raise this objection in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 328 (5th Cir.2012); <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-21\">The record reflects that the district court was aware of the provisions of \u00a7 5Dl.l(c). Given the statements that the district court made when it imposed the sentence, which addressed Hernandez-Caballero\u2019s history and characteristics and the need for deterrence and protection, Hernandez-Caballero fails to show that the district court procedurally erred by relying on the prohibited factor of punishment in imposing the term of supervised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>release. <em>See Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d at 329-30. Additionally, given that the district court relied upon the permissible factors of deterrence and protection in imposing the term of supervised release, Hernandez-Caballero\u2019s argument that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it gives significant weight to an \u201cimproper factor\u201d also fails. The judgment of the district court is thus AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b374-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
