Mitchell\u2019s guidelines range was 240 to 293 months due to the operation of a statutory mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). His \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 750, which permanently amended U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 by revising the drug quantity table to reduce offense levels associated with various amounts of crack cocaine. On appeal, Mitchell argues the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because he was sentenced to a statutory mandatory maximum sentence, rather than a statutory mandatory minimum sentence. He also argues the sentencing enhancement he received at his original sentencing was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-17\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). In <em>United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070 (11th Cir.2010), we held that \u201ca sentencing court lacks jurisdiction to consider a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, even when an amendment would lower the defendant\u2019s otherwise-applicable Guidelines sentencing range, when the defendant was sentenced on the basis of a mandatory minimum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1078.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-18\">Mitchell was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum of 240 months pursuant to \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Because his guidelines range was based on a statutory mandatory minimum \u2014 and not the maximum, as he contends \u2014 Amendment 750 did not lower his guidelines range, and Mitchell was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Mills, </em>613 F.3d at 1078; <em>see also United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012) (holding that \u201can amendment that alters the initial calculation of a guidelines range is not to be applied in a case where ... a mandatory minimum would have trumped the initial calculation and dictated the final guidelines range anyway\u201d). Moreover, to the extent Mitchell seeks to challenge the enhancements to his original sentence, the district court lacks authority to revisit that determination in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2694, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010) (holding that because \u201cthe aspects of his sentence that Dillon [sought] to correct were not affected by the Commission\u2019s amendment to \u00a7 2D1.1, they [were] outside the scope of the proceeding authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>by \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and the District Court properly declined to address them\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Mitchell\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
