The district court applied the career offender enhancement of United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.1 (Nov. 2011) based on Jackson\u2019s prior convictions in Florida for burglary of a dwelling with assault or battery and possession of marijuana with intent to sell, both felonies under Florida law. The court\u2019s application of that enhancement together with a reduction for acceptance of responsibility resulted in a guidelines range of 188 to 235 months imprisonment. The district court sentenced Jackson to 188 months imprisonment, six years of supervised release, and an assessment of $800.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Jackson did not object to the district court\u2019s application of the career offender enhancement at his sentencing hearing but challenges it now. He contends that the district court erred by applying the career offender enhancement because the Florida statute under which he was convicted for possession of marijuana with intent to sell is unconstitutional.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Jackson did not make that objection in the district court, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>694 F.3d 1192, 1195 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">A defendant may not collaterally attack at sentencing a state court conviction used to apply a career offender enhancement except when that conviction was obtained in violation of his right to counsel. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>120 F.3d 227, 231 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cCollateral attacks on prior convictions are allowed in federal sentencing proceedings in one narrow circumstance only: when the conviction was obtained in violation of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel.\u201d). Jackson does not allege that his conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to sell was obtained in violation of his right to counsel; he contends only that the statute under which he was convicted is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">Accordingly, the district court did not plainly err by applying the career offender enhancement to Jackson\u2019s sentence. However, the judgment entered in this case does not list a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, which is necessary for the conspiracy offense in Count 1, or a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, which is necessary for aiding or abetting liability in Count 2. We remand for the sole purpose of correcting the judgment to accurately reflect Jackson\u2019s convictions on Count 1, conspiracy to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C), 846 and Count 2, distribution of cocaine \u2014 aiding and abetting, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">Jackson\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED. The case is REMANDED solely for the purpose of correcting the judgment to reflect the crimes for which Jackson was actually convicted and sentenced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-7\">. The United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida held that the Florida statute under which Jackson was convicted is facially unconstitutional in <em>Shelton v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr. (Shelton I), </em>802 F.Supp.2d 1289, 1308 (M.D.Fla.2011). We reversed on other grounds without deciding the constitutionality of that statute. <em>Shelton v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr. (Shelton II), </em>691 F.3d 1348, 1355 .(11th Cir. 2012). After the district court\u2019s decision in <em>Shelton I, </em>but before our decision in <em>Shelton II, </em>the Florida Supreme Court held that the statute under which Jackson was convicted is constitutional. <em>State v. Adkins, </em>96 So.3d 412 (Fla.2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
