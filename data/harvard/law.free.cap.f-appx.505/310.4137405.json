In challenging the supervised release in the light of recent amendments to Guideline \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) (supervised release ordinarily not necessary for deportable alien), Oliva-rez contends his sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court: did not explain its imposition of the supervised release; did not give notice of its intent to depart from the applicable advisory Guidelines sentencing range by imposing it; and did not properly account for the Guidelines\u2019 recommending no supervised-release term be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 48-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-14\">Because Olivarez failed to present his contentions in district court, review is only for plain error. <em>E.g., United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see also United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 327-28 (5th Cir.2012) (use of \u201cordinary\u201d in Guideline \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) considered \u201chortatory not mandatory\u201d; imposing supervised release within statutory and advisory Guideline sentencing range does not trigger departure analysis). To show reversible plain error, Olivarez must show, <em>inter alia, </em>a forfeited error that is clear or obvious. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). He fails to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-15\">Because the imposed three-year term of supervised release was within Olivarez\u2019 statutory and advisory Guidelines sentencing range, the supervised-release term was not a departure. <em>E.g., Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d at 329. When addressing the overall sentence, the district court noted Olivarez\u2019 criminal history and the need for deterrence. It also stated it was imposing the supervised release due to Oliva-rez\u2019 criminal history. In the light of these comments, the district court appropriately exercised the discretion it enjoys under Guideline \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) in determining Oliva-rez\u2019 sentence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
