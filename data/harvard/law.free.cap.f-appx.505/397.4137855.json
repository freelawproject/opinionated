(\u201cUnited Rentals\u201d) dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 suit for personal injury arising out of a fall sustained on equipment rented from United Rentals. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-16\">Plaintiff Shawn Monaghan\u2019s employer, Mechanical Insulation, Inc., rented a scissor-Iift from Defendant United Rentals. While using the scissor-lift to install insulation materials, Plaintiff fell when a handrail failed, apparently because of missing bolts. Scott Miley (\u201cMiley\u201d), the lead foreman and Plaintiffs supervisor, stated that he had inspected the lift on March 11, 2009, when it was received from the Defendant, that it was in good condition, and that he found no missing bolts in the handrail. Upon inspection, he signed a \u201cQuality Condition Report\u201d to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-19\">Plaintiffs accident happened on April 6, 2009, almost a month after the employer received the lift. Miley testified that iron workers borrowed the lift for \u201cpractically a month\u201d and \u201capparently they altered it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-20\">The district court granted summary judgment for Defendant United Rentals because no summary judgment evidence was produced indicating the lift had defects when it left Defendant\u2019s hands, and Defendant produced affirmative evidence that it had no defects when delivered. As the lift was used by other parties for nearly a month after Defendant relinquished control, no inference arises that it was defective when delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-21\">Further, while Plaintiff contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment based on the testimony of Miley because Miley is not credible, the issue presented is not one of credibility, but rather of proof. No evidence presented by Plaintiff contradicted the sworn testimony of Miley or the Quality Condition Report signed by Miley at the time of delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-22\">We agree with the district court that no genuine issue of material fact was presented and summary judgment was proper. For the above reasons and the reasons stated by the district court in its careful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>memorandum ruling of May 10, 2012, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b420-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
