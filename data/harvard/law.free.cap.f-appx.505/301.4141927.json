On appeal, Morales Martinez challenges the district court\u2019s decision to impose a term of supervised release in light of the recent amendments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(c). He contends that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court did not explain why it decided to impose a term of supervised release, did not give notice of its intent to depart from the applicable guidelines range by imposing a term of supervised release, and did not properly account for \u00a7 5Dl.l(c)\u2019s recommendation that no supervised release term be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-24\">Because Morales Martinez failed to present these claims to the district court, we review them for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see also United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 327-28 (5th Cir.2012). To establish plain error, a party must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects the objector\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If the objecting party makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error, but we will do so only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-25\">We conclude that Morales Martinez has not met this standard. As the three-year term of supervised release imposed by the district court was within the applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>statutory and guidelines range, the terms of supervised release assessed was not a departure. -See <em>Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d at 329. During Morales Martinez\u2019s multi-defendant sentencing hearing, counsel for another defendant noted that the amended guideline recommended that the court not impose a term of supervised release, to which the district court responded that it was nevertheless including a term of supervised release. When addressing Morales Martinez\u2019s sentence, the district court specifically noted his criminal history and the need for deterrence. In light of these remarks, Morales Martinez has not met the plain error standard with respect to his term of supervised release. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
