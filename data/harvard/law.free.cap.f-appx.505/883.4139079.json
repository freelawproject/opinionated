The district court declined to exercise jurisdiction over Storick\u2019s declaratory judgment action due to a parallel garnishment proceeding in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware. On appeal, Storick contends the dismissal of his case was improper.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-22\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of a declaratory judgment action for an abuse of discretion. <em>Ameritas Variable Life Ins. Co. v. Roach, </em>411 F.3d 1328, 1330 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[W]e will leave undisturbed a district court\u2019s ruling unless we find that the district court has made a clear error of judgment, or has applied the wrong legal standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-23\">A district court has discretion to determine \u201cwhether and when to entertain an action under the Declaratory Judgment Act, even when the suit otherwise satisfies subject matter jurisdictional prerequisites.\u201d <em>Wilton v. Seven Falls Co., </em>515 U.S. 277, 115 S.Ct. 2137, 2140, 132 L.Ed.2d 214 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>(1995). In fact, the Supreme Court has stated \u201cit would be uneconomical as well as vexatious for a federal court to proceed in a declaratory judgment suit where another suit is pending in a state court presenting the same issues, not governed by federal law, between the same parties.\u201d <em>Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co. of Am., </em>316 U.S. 491, 62 S.Ct. 1173, 1175-76, 86 L.Ed. 1620 (1942). This Court has provided nine non-exhaustive factors to guide district courts in determining \u201cwhether to abstain from exercising jurisdiction over state-law claims in the face of parallel litigation in the state courts.\u201d <em>Ameritas, </em>411 F.3d at 1331 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">Storick cannot establish an abuse of discretion by the district court. The district court thoughtfully applied the guideposts set forth in <em>Ameritas </em>and concluded the overall balance of the factors solidly supported abstention. We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion, and affirm for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s well-reasoned order. We note that although Storick accuses CFG of \u201cprocedural fencing\u201d by obtaining a confession of judgment in Delaware, Storick expressly agreed to allow CFG to confess judgment in Delaware for a long-standing debt he admits he owes.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b905-16\">. Because we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Storick\u2019s amended complaint, we need not consider his argument regarding the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b906-7\">. We deny Storick\u2019s \"Motion to Supplement Record on Appeal,\u201d construed as a motion to take judicial notice of the June 12, 2012, orders filed in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
