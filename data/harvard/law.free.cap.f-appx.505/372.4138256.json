The district court denied Randall\u2019s IFP motion, certifying, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3) and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 24(a)(3), that the appeal was not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-22\">By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Randall is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). To ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>tain permission to proceed IFP, Randall must show that he is a pauper and that he will present a nonfrivolous appellate issue. <em>Carson v. Polley, </em>685 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Randall argues that, prior to filing his \u00a7 1988 action, he was unable to exhaust his administrative remedies due to fear, threats, and constant harassment. The exhaustion requirement is mandatory, and unexhausted claims may not be brought in court. <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 211, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). There is no futility exception to the exhaustion requirement. <em>See Booth v. Churner, </em>582 U.S. 731, 741 n. 6, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001). Moreover, the summary judgment evidence presented below demonstrates that Randall submitted three Step-1 grievances and a Step-2 grievance on an unrelated issue, thus refuting his reasons for failing to exhaust.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Next, Randall argues for the first time that he could not exhaust his administrative remedies because grievance forms were impossible to obtain when he was in solitary confinement and that the grievance forms he managed to submit were obtained from other inmates. This court does not generally consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal, and we decline to do so here. <em>See Jennings v. Owens, </em>602 F.3d 652, 657 n. 7 (5th Cir. 2010); <em>Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Finally, Randall raises arguments regarding the merits of his claim. We need not consider these arguments because he did not exhaust his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Randall has not established that he will raise a nonfrivolous appellate issue. <em>See Carson, </em>689 F.2d at 586. Accordingly, we deny the motion to proceed IFP on appeal, and we dismiss his appeal as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of Randall\u2019s appeal counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Randall is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
