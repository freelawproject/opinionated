The district court sentenced Montoya to 63 months of imprisonment. Montoya argues that his conviction should be reversed because the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument improperly bolstered the credibility of two cooperating witnesses. He concedes that review of this claim is for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">To show plain error, the appellant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If the appellant makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Even assuming that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks constituted obvious error, Montoya has not shown that they had the \u201cprobable effect\u201d of preventing the jury from \u201cjudg[ing] the evidence fairly.\u201d <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 12, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985). The evidence against Montoya was \u201csubstantial and virtually uncontradicted,\u201d <em>id. </em>470 U.S. at 20, 105 S.Ct. 1038 and Montoya points to no reason why the jury should not be presumed to have heeded the district court\u2019s instructions that remarks of counsel are not evidence. <em>See United States v. Gallardo-Trapero, </em>185 F.3d 307, 321 (5th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
