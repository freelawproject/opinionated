Because there exist no unresolved issues of material fact, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-15\">The facts, as synthesized by the district court from the administrative record, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-16\">The record shows that plaintiff received \u201cirregularities statements\u201d in 1970 and 1972 reflecting, in the aggregate, hundreds of violations of legal requirements, including repeated failure to record the acquisition and disposition of firearms and scores of sales of firearms to ineligible purchasers. The record further shows that plaintiff was notified in 1973 that any future violations might be considered willful. Finally, the record shows that a recent investigation of plaintiff\u2019s records revealed additional sales to ineligible purchasers, unreported multiple handgun sales, repeated failure to record the acquisition and disposition of firearms and a loss without reasonable explanation of 200 firearms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-17\">In the district court, Cucchiara admitted that he did \u201cnot take issue with much of the basic factual background presented\u201d in the Bureau\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The district court commented that \u201cplaintiff concedes the essential accuracy of the administrative record\u201d in granting summary judgment to the Bureau \u201con the basis of the uncontroverted evidence.\u201d The district court did not schedule a hearing to receive additional evidence, but did permit Cuc-chiara to introduce a deposition and several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>declarations intended to demonstrate that his conduct was not willful.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">In failing to dispute the factual accuracy of the administrative record, however, Cuc-chiara implicitly admits to hundreds of violations of the Bureau\u2019s legal requirements, after multiple warnings. Although Cuc-chiara sought to augment the record in the district court on the question of willfulness, the district court correctly characterized the additional information as showing only</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ae-dedup-0\">that he is one of the highest volume retail firearms dealers in this District and that he has made costly, good faith efforts to comply with all his obligations as a licensee . .. [and] that his noncompliance was excusable, either because it was inevitable, due to the size and nature of his operation, or merely inadvertent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Under the willfulness standard announced in <em>Perri v. Department of Treasury, </em>637 F.2d 1332, (9th Cir. 1981), this additional information creates no dispute over a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Perri </em>held that willfulness is established \u201cwhen a dealer understands the requirements of the law, but knowingly fails to follow them or was indifferent to them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1336. The fact that Cucchiara has spent a great deal of money trying to correct his faulty re-cordkeeping system, after the violations, for example, is immaterial to the question of willfulness at the time the violations occurred. Cucchiara clearly understood the requirements of the law, as evidenced by the \u201cirregularities statements\u201d and the Bureau\u2019s 1973 warning that future violations might be considered willful. Yet, with this knowledge, he failed to abide by these requirements. In great degree, Cucchiara\u2019s argument on appeal depends on the legal definition of willfulness espoused in <em>Rich v. United States, </em>383 F.Supp. 797, 800-01 (S.D. Ohio 1974) (conduct is willful only if it is purposeful and intentional), a definition rejected in this circuit by the <em>Perri </em>decision.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">It is true that procedurally this case was decided on a motion for summary judgment where technically fact finding is inappropriate and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the party opposing the motion. Nevertheless, because the procedure for review pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 923(f)(3) permits the district court to enter judgment on the basis of the administrative record when no substantial reason to receive additional evidence is present, the practice of the courts has been to grant judgment summarily when the \u201cmaterial facts developed at the administrative hearing, which the court also concludes justify non-renewal\u201d are not substantially drawn into question by the party petitioning for review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">Appellant also claims that the district court denied him an opportunity to be heard and to present additional evidence on the question of willfulness because, although the court permitted the introduction of a deposition and several declarations on this issue, it did not schedule a <em>de novo </em>hearing during its review of the Bureau decision. Under additional standards set out in <em>Perri, </em>however, it is clear that the district court did not abuse its discretion in ruling without an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Perri v. Department of Treasury, </em>637 F.2d at 1335 (9th Cir. 1981), <em>quoting Stein\u2019s Inc. v. Blumenthal, </em>649 F.2d 463, 466 (7th Cir. 1980) (\u201cConsideration of judicial economy suggests that trial anew of factual matters already litigated should be avoided unless substantial doubt infects the agency\u2019s findings of fact.\u201d). As in this case, the district court in <em>Perri </em>had received additional evidence into the record, but ruled without an evidentiary hearing. In a procedure that, for formality\u2019s sake, might well have been followed in this case, the district court in <em>Perri </em>inquired forthrightly \u201cwhether the case was submitted for <em>all </em>purposes: \u2018both the consideration of the summary judgment; and then, if those are denied, consideration of the court\u2019s findings in the matter\u2019.\u201d <em>Perri v. Department of Treasury, </em>637 F.2d at 1335 (9th Cir. 1981).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">Finally, Cucchiara disputes the factual finding of the district court that his records revealed \u201ca loss without reasonable explanation of 200 firearms,\u201d a finding not made by the Bureau. Even if error is assumed, however, the question cannot be considered material, in view of the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>violations of Bureau regulations that Cuc-ehiara has admitted. Thus, under the summary judgment standard, Cuechiara has failed to establish that a genuine issue of material fact remains unresolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b110-6\">.
