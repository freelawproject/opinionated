No. 80 (September 28,1978), directing reinstatement and relief for June Johnson and Hanna Gutmann, discharged employees of the Taft Broadcasting Company in Columbus, Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Upon a review of the record as a whole, the court concludes that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision with respect to Johnson, but agrees with the Administrative Law Judge that there is no substantial evidence to support the claim that Gutmann was discharged because of her union activities. On the contrary, it appears that the reasons for Gutmann\u2019s discharge were related solely to her job performance. The Board\u2019s decision that these reasons were pretextual is without support in the record when viewed as a whole. Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">IT IS ORDERED that the order of the Board is enforced as to Johnson, but enforcement as to Gutmann is denied. No costs, neither party having prevailed in full.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
