Prior to the imposition of the sentence, appellant requested he be sentenced under the Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5005-5026, an Act not expressly made applicable to Guam. The sentencing judge expressly determined that appellant was not a proper candidate for sentencing under the Act, notwithstanding the existence of serious doubt concerning the application of the Act to Guam.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-13\">Appellant argues that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires that the Act be applicable to Guam, that he should have been sentenced under it, and that, in any event, the special parole term was not authorized for violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 963.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-17\">We need not address the appellant\u2019s first argument because no reversible error was committed by the sentencing judge in determining that appellant was not a proper candidate for sentencing under the Act. Under these circumstances we need not address the issue of the application of the Act to Guam. The appellant\u2019s second argument is without merit, of course.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-18\">The appellant\u2019s third argument prevails, however. In <em>Bifulco v. United States, </em>447 U.S. 381, 100 S.Ct. 2247, 65 L.Ed.2d 205 (1980), the Supreme Court held that a court may not impose a special parole term for conspiracy to commit a drug offense under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (1976). Though appellant\u2019s conviction was obtained under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 963 (1976), the wording of that section is identical to that of section 846. <em>Bifulco </em>makes it clear, we think, that the special parole term given in this case was improper. We reverse and remand to the trial court for resentencing in accordance with the authority of <em>Bifulco.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-19\">Affirmed in part, Reversed in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
