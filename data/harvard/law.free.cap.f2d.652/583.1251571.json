Lafourche Parish Police Jury, </em>622 F.2d 133 (5th Cir. 1980). We are of the further opinion that the district court did not abuse its discretion in not remanding the non-removal actions at the time remand was requested, for the reasons more fully stated in the district court\u2019s opinion of July 30, 1980. See <em>Marsh Investment Corporation v. Langford, </em>494 F.Supp. 344 (E.D. La.1980).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nor can we find any abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s grant of Rule 54(b) certification in the entry of the summary judgment. See <em>Curtis-Wright Corporation v. General Electric Company, </em>446 U.S. 1, 9, 100 S.Ct. 1460, 1466-67, 64 L.Ed.2d 1 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-17\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-15\">. We do not pass upon the timeliness of the motion for remand, since we find no abuse of discretion in denying the motion, if timely. Although a majority of the panel further agree with the additional conclusion of the district court that the final judgment on the summary judgment claim entered pursuant to Rule 54(b) was a \u201cfinal judgment\" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. 1447(c) \u2014 so that the motion to remand as improvidently ruled was not timely, not being <em>\u201cbefore </em>final judgment\u201d \u2014 it is unnecessary to pass upon this issue when, in any event, the refusal to remand was proper.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b664-19\">CHARLES CLARK, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AdF\">specially concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b664-20\">I concur in the panel\u2019s affirmance of the judgment of the district court and in all of the opinion except the second sentence of footnote 1. Since we are unanimous that it is unnecessary to pass upon the issue of whether this was a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d within the meaning of 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c), I do not.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
