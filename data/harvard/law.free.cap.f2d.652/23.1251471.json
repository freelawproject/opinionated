Craner\u2019s appeal raises the issue whether this offense is a \u201cserious\u201d one for which the Federal Constitution <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> guarantees a trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">The Supreme Court has accorded constitutional stature to the common-law rule that \u201cpetty\u201d offenses may be tried without the intervention of a jury. <em>See, e. g., Bloom v. Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 194, 210, 88 S.Ct. 1477, 1486, 20 L.Ed.2d 522 (1968); <em>Duncan v. Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 160, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 1453, 20 L.Ed.2d 491; <em>Callan v. Wilson, </em>127 U.S. 540, 557, 8 S.Ct. 1301, 1307, 32 L.Ed. 223 (1888). Traditionally, the Court has looked to the nature of an offense in ranking it \u201cserious\u201d or \u201cpetty.\u201d <em>See District of Columbia v. Colts, </em>282 U.S. 63, 72-73, 51 S.Ct. 52, 53, 75 L.Ed. 177 (1930); <em>Callan, supra, </em>127 U.S. at 552, 555, 8 S.Ct. at 1305-1306. The Court has more recently stressed the maximum authorized penalty as an objective criterion of the gravity of an offense. <em>See Duncan, supra, </em>391 U.S. at 161-62, 88 S.Ct. at 1453-1454. In a recent spate of cases involving criminal con-tempts \u2014 crimes for which the punishment is not set by legislatures \u2014 the Court looked only to the punishment actually imposed to determine defendants\u2019 rights to jury trials. <em>See Muniz v. Hoffman, </em>422 U.S. 454, 476-77, 95 S.Ct. 2178, 2190-2191, 45 L.Ed.2d 319, (1975); <em>Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, </em>418 U.S. 506, 511, 94 S.Ct. 2687, 2690, 41 L.Ed.2d 912 (1974); <em>Taylor v. Hayes, </em>418 U.S. 488, 496, 94 S.Ct. 2697, 2702, 41 L.Ed.2d 897 (1974); <em>Bloom, supra, </em>391 U.S. at 211, 88 S.Ct. at 1487; <em>Cheff v. Schnackenberg, </em>384 U.S. 373, 380, 86 S.Ct. 1523, 1526, 16 L.Ed.2d 629 (1966) (plurality opinion). The importance in these cases of the objective criterion of actual punishment, is, however, limited: the Court recognized that criminal contempt is an offense <em>sui generis. </em>It is \u201cnot a crime of the sort that requires the right to jury trial regardless of the penalty involved.\u201d <em>Bloom, supra, </em>391 U.S. at 211, 88 S.Ct. at 1487; <em>accord, Muniz, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 476, 95 S.Ct. at 2190; <em>Cheff, supra, </em>384 U.S. at 380, 86 S.Ct. at 1526 (plurality opinion). In the quest for objectivity, the Supreme Court has not thrown out the rule that an offense may be serious enough, apart from its assigned penalty, that the Constitution would require that it be tried by a jury. <em>United States v. Sanchez-Meza, </em>547 F.2d 461, 463-64 (9th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">An offense is not \u201cserious\u201d because it is severely punished; it is severely punished because it is \u201cserious.\u201d The severity of prescribed sanctions is regarded as the best objective indication of the general normative judgment of the seriousness of an offense. <em>Baldwin v. New York, </em>399 U.S. 66, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>68, 90 S.Ct. 1886, 1887, 26 L.Ed.2d 437 (1970) (plurality opinion). The extent of possible punishment does not, however, alone determine whether an offense is serious or petty. Although Congress has established the sanctions of six months\u2019 imprisonment or $500 in fines as the bright line between serious and petty offenses, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1(3), the Supreme Court has not found \u201ctalismanic significance\u201d in this formula when determining whether a constitutional right to a jury trial exists. <em>Muniz, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 477, 95 S.Ct. at 2190. Inquiry into the seriousness of an offense does not end where Title 18 begins. Otherwise the constitutional right to a jury trial would exist only at the sufferance of the legislative branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Nothing in the plurality opinion in <em>Baldwin, </em>on which the government particularly relies, is to the contrary. Justice White, writing for three members of the Court in <em>Baldwin, </em>stated that \u201ca potential sentence of more than six months\u2019 imprisonment is sufficiently severe by itself to take the offense out of the category of \u2018petty\u2019.\u201d No member of the Court expressed the view that a lesser potential sentence requires classification of an offense as petty. On the contrary, Justices Black and Douglas, who concurred only in the judgment in <em>Baldwin, </em>thought that the Constitution guaranteed the right to a jury trial of all crimes. <em>See </em>399 U.S. at 74-75, 90 S.Ct. at 1891 (concurring opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">This is not disingenuous interpretation. It is the explanation of <em>Baldwin </em>offered by the Court itself. <em>See Codispoti, supra, </em>418 U.S. at 512 n. 4, 94 S.Ct. at 2691 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Authorized punishment reflects the seriousness of an offense. It does not determine it. To gauge the seriousness of an offense, the Supreme Court has in recent years looked to the authorized penalty <em>and </em>to the \u201crelevant rules and practices followed by the federal and state regimes.\u201d <em>Muniz, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 476, 95 S.Ct. at 2190. <em>See also Duncan v. Louisiana, supra, </em>391 U.S. at 159-61, 88 S.Ct. at 1452-1453.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Without question, the maximum penalty for an offense is usually more important than any other criterion used in characterizing the offense as serious or petty. As a rule, the penalty best shows, or is taken to best show, the public\u2019s measure of the gravity of an offense. <em>Frank v. United States, </em>395 U.S. at 147, 149, 89 S.Ct. 1503 at 1505, 23 L.Ed.2d 162. In the present case, however, Congress, as the public\u2019s surrogate, did not set the six-month, $500 maximum penalty as the appropriate one for the specific offense of driving under the influence (DUI). The Secretary of the Interior did. <em>See </em>36 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.3 (1980). The penalty for drunken driving is the severest one the Secretary may authorize. <em>See </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7 3. It is the same penalty authorized for a myriad of offenses \u2014 from climbing Mount Rushmore (16 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.77 [1980]) to digging for bait in a national park (16 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.13(d) [1980]). <em>See </em>16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.3 (1980). We cannot hazard that the Secretary\u2019s indiscriminate authorization of this penalty for varied offenses, or Congress\u2019s general limitation on the sentences the Secretary may authorize, represents a considered legislative judgment of the gravity of the offense of DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">Craner argues that there is an additional consequence of a DUI conviction beyond the sentence he faced: he could lose his California driver\u2019s license. The government contends that under <em>United States v. Hamdan, </em>552 F.2d 276 (9th Cir. 1977), this Court must refuse to consider \u201ccollateral consequences\u201d of a conviction in determining if the Constitution requires a charge to be tried to a jury. In <em>Hamdan, </em>two defendants were charged with making false statements in documents filed with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The crime was punishable with six months\u2019 imprisonment or a fine of $1,000, or both. A divided panel of this Court held that the possibility of imposition on an individual of a fine greater than $500 automatically takes an offense from the \u201cpetty\u201d class; the court therefore ruled that the defendants were entitled to a jury trial. <em>Muniz, supra, </em>was distinguished: in <em>Muniz, </em>the defendant to a criminal contempt charge was a 13,000-member union. The $10,000 fine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>imposed on the union was paltry when reckoned per capita. Denial of a jury trial was upheld. In <em>Hamdan, </em>the possible fines per capita were $1,000; this court, stressing the need for a standard of seriousness applicable to all individual defendants, adopted 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 l(3)\u2019s $500 figure as the fine beyond which any offense became a serious one. See 552 F.2d at 278-79. The specific holding of <em>Hamdan </em>was that the court would not look to an individual defendant\u2019s ability to pay to decide whether a maximum fine itself rendered a crime serious.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><em>Hamdan </em>does not forbid consideration of the future legal significance of a conviction in deciding whether an offense is a serious one. Although a license revocation is itself a regulatory, not a punitive action, <em>United States v. Best, </em>573 F.2d 1095, 1099 (9th Cir. 1978), the threat of loss of a license as important as a driver\u2019s license, a deprivation added to penal sanctions, is another sign that the DUI defendant\u2019s community does not view DUI as a petty offense. It is irrelevant to the determination of Craner\u2019s rights to a jury trial whether this loss has occurred, will surely occur, or simply could occur. <em>Cf. Duncan, supra, </em>391 U.S. at ISO-GO, 88 S.Ct. at 1452-1453 (possible penalty, not the one actually imposed, is the gauge of a locality\u2019s \u201csocial and ethical judgments\u201d of the gravity of an offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Federal and state precedent and practices counsel ranking DUI as a \u201cserious\u201d crime. In 1930 the Supreme Court held that the analogous offense of reckless driving was a serious offense within the constitutional guarantee of trial by jury. <em>See District of Columbia v. Colts, </em>282 U.S. 63, 51 S.Ct. 52, 75 L.Ed. 177 (1930). The Court in <em>Colts </em>reasoned that reckless driving was both indictable at common law<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <em>malum in se, </em>and hence, serious.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">There is no legally meaningful distinction between the present case and <em>Colts. </em>The government, therefore, understandably argues that <em>Colts </em>is superannuated and, as precedent, abandoned. Yet <em>Colts </em>was cited by Justice White without disapproval in <em>Baldwin </em>\u2014 the very case that supposedly doomed \u201cthe nature of the offense\u201d as the determinant of the right to a jury trial. <em>See Baldwin, supra, </em>399 U.S. at 69 n. 6, 90 S.Ct. at 1888 n. 6 (plurality opinion). This Court has rejected the argument that the <em>Colts </em>line of cases should not be followed; the Supreme Court has never repudiated <em>Colts, </em>although it has had many opportunities to do so. <em>United States v. Sanchez-Meza, supra, </em>547 F.2d at 463-64. <em>See also United States v. Stewart, </em>568 F.2d 501, 503 (6th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Woods, </em>450 F.Supp. 1335, 1342 (D.Md.1978); <em>Brady v. Blair, </em>427 F.Supp. 5, 9 (S.D.Ohio 1976).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>At least seven of the states in this Circuit guarantee the DUI defendant the right to a jury trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This is a better objective gauge of the common perception of the gravity of the offense than the broad formula for classifying crimes found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1. It accords with the relevant state and federal practice that Craner have the jury trial he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">This holding is not an impractical one. Given the comparative rarity of federal DUI prosecutions, the administrative benefits afforded by summary proceedings in these cases are slight, particularly since a high rate of waiver of jury trials may be expected.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We cannot say that as a constitutional matter these benefits outweigh defendants\u2019 interests in being tried by their peers if they so choose.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-11\">. 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.6 (1980) prohibits driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs in park areas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b104-15\">. Article III, governing the federal judiciary, provides: \u201cThe Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury.\u201d U.S. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 2, cl. 3. The Sixth Amendment says that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a ... trial, by an impartial jury. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b106-5\">. A questionable proposition. The Court cited <em>United States v. Hart, </em>26 Fed.Cas. 193 (D.Pa. 1817), which flatly stated that driving a carriage wildly through crowded city streets was a breach of the peace indictable at common law. The Court also cited <em>State v. Rodgers, </em>91 N.J.L. 212, 102 A. 433 (1917), which held that simple DUI (not compounded by noticeably dangerous driving) was not such a breach of the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The utility of applying the standard of \u201cin-dictability at common law\u201d to the present case is doubtful. The phrase \u201cindictable at common law,\u201d standing alone, has little meaning. In the fourteenth century, even the pettiest crimes were indictable at common law. Frankfurter &amp; Corcoran, <em>Petty Federal Offenses and the Right to Trial by Jury, </em>39 Harv.L.Rev. 917, 923 (1926). From Tudor times, Parliament reacted to the problem of overcrowded criminal dockets by excepting specific offenses from jury procedures. <em>Id. </em>at 925-26. <em>(\u201cPlus </em>pa <em>change </em>....\u201d) The Congressional attempt in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 to define the class of petty offenses by a general formula does not follow this traditional model. <em>See id. </em>at 927.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">Even if the era of the adoption of the Constitution is taken as the relevant epoch of the common law, we doubt that there is a common-law analog to the modern offense of DUI. Around the time of the American Revolution, violations of liquor laws and traffic laws were often tried before magistrates alone. <em>Id. </em>at 928. But cars are not horses, and the traffic and speeds of the eighteenth century are not those of the twentieth. Even Frankfurter and Cor-coran, who exhaustively document colonial history, \u201cconclude by saying that history presents a body of experience expressive of the judgment of its time, but does not save Congress nor the Supreme Court from the necessity for judgment in giving past history present application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 982.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b106-11\">. <em>But see, contra, Justiniano Matos v. Gaspar Rodriguez, </em>440 F.Supp. 673, 676-77 (D.P.R. 1976), a reckless driving case in which the district court ruled that <em>Baldwin </em>had, in effect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>overruled <em>Colts. </em>This holding not only mistakes a plurality opinion for a majority one, it also misreads the plurality opinion, which was pointedly narrowed by its author, who wrote: \u201cIn this case, we decide only that a potential sentence in excess of six months\u2019 imprisonment is sufficiently severe by itself to take the offense out of the category of \u2018petty\u2019.\u201d <em>Baldwin, supra, </em>399 U.S. at 69 n. 6, 90 S.Ct. at 1888 n. 6 (opinion of White, J.)</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">Under the court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Justiniano Matos, </em>a legislature could for strategic purposes take universally reprehended crimes, as, for example, rape or child molesting, out of the constitutional guarantees of jury trials by simply reducing the sentences authorized for the offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b107-11\">.

New York, </em>399 U.S. 66, 90 S.Ct. 1886, 26 L.Ed.2d 437 (1970), nor <em>Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, </em>418 U.S. 506, 94 S.Ct. 2687, 41 L.Ed.2d 912 (1974), hold that <em>all </em>offenses with respect to which the authorized prison term is six months or less and the fine $500 or less are \u201cpetty.\u201d Their holdings point the other way, <em>viz., </em>offenses carrying terms in excess of six months and fines of more than $500 <em>must </em>be tried before a jury. The upshot is that the latter type of offense is <em>never </em>\u201cpetty,\u201d while the former <em>usually </em>is. It is also true that this court in <em>United States v. Sanchez-Meza, </em>547 F.2d 461 (9th Cir. 1976), recognized that factors other than the maximum sentence possible are relevant in determining whether an offense is \u201cpetty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-18\">I also agree with the majority that under the circumstances of this case the maximum penalty imposed by the Secretary of Interi- or does not, as the majority observes, represent the considered legislative judgment of the gravity of the offense. Nor does it, in my opinion, represent a considered executive judgment of the gravity. The Secretary could impose no greater penalty; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>range of penalties available to him was too narrow. As a consequence, the DUI offense and digging for bait in a national park are, as the majority point out, given the same maximum penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Under these circumstances it is appropriate to diminish the importance of the maximum penalty in determining whether the DUI offense is \u201cpetty\u201d and focus on the additional consequences that attend conviction of this offense. Under California law these consequences are substantial. <em>See </em>Cal.Veh.Code \u00a7\u00a7 13210, 13352, 13352.5. Their substantiality justifies treating the DUI offense as \u201cserious.\u201d Had the maximum penalty here available reflected considered legislative or executive judgment I would be inclined to treat the DUI offense as \u201cpetty\u201d notwithstanding these consequences. Put another way, a maximum penalty of six months and a $500 fine in the absence of extraordinary circumstances such as are present in this case should indicate the offense is petty.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The flaw I find in the majority opinion is that it is open to the interpretation that the maximum penalty is only one of several possible factors of approximately equal weight to be employed in determining whether an offense is petty. I write to indicate that that interpretation is not my understanding of the law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
