Kelsey, an inmate at the Minnesota Correctional Facility at Stillwater, appeals from the December 2, 1980, order of the district court dismissing his claim brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Kelsey\u2019s complaint, filed <em>pro se </em>on July 18, 1980, sought injunctive, declaratory and monetary relief for violations of his constitutional rights in the medical treatment he received at the Stillwater facility. The named defendant, Dr. James W. Ewing, is a physician at the St. Paul Ramsey Medical Center who has provided services at the Stillwater prison since January 1,1980, pursuant to contract with the Minnesota Department of Corrections. Kelsey alleged that he was not given prompt and adequate treatment for a number of health problems, that medical information was being withheld from him, and that his medical records were improperly disclosed to a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">On October 30, 1980, Dr. Ewing filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) &amp; 12(b)(6). Accompanying Dr. Ewing\u2019s motion was his affidavit in which he summarized his treatment of Kelsey. The motion was assigned to United States Magistrate Brian P. Short who, on November 3, 1980, recommended that the district court dismiss the suit on the ground that it was frivolous. The magistrate had before him Kelsey\u2019s complaint and Dr. Ewing\u2019s affidavit, but held no hearing and offered Kelsey no opportunity to file responsive affidavits prior to making the recommendation. The district court dismissed Kelsey\u2019s complaint based on the recommendation of the magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Kelsey filed this timely appeal from the order of dismissal, arguing that the district court improperly treated the defendant\u2019s motion as a motion for summary judgment without giving him notice and an opportunity to respond as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b) &amp; 56. Furthermore, Kelsey maintains, his complaint was sufficient to raise genuine factual issues which precluded dismissal. Dr. Ewing responds that the dismissal was appropriate because Kelsey\u2019s claim was frivolous and insubstantial, and further argues that the claim for damages is barred by the doctrine of executive immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">We need not agonize over the issues raised by this appeal. The district court clearly erred in dismissing Kelsey\u2019s claim. Even if we assume that it was appropriate for the magistrate to treat the appellee\u2019s motion as one for summary judgment and to consider Dr. Ewing\u2019s affidavit, and even if we assume all statements contained in the affidavit are true, Kelsey\u2019s complaint contains sufficient unrebutted allegations to raise a factual question about whether he was unconstitutionally deprived of medical care while incarcerated at Stillwater.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">Summary judgment is appropriate only when no genuine issue of material fact remains in dispute and the movant is clearly entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Vette Co. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>612 F.2d 1076, 1077 (8th Cir. 1980). For the purposes of summary judgment, uncontested allegations must be taken as true in accordance with the Court\u2019s obligation to view the case in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>See Starling v. Valmac Indus., Inc., </em>589 F.2d 382, 386 (8th Cir. 1979). Here, there are a number of allegations in Kelsey\u2019s complaint that are not addressed by Dr. Ewing\u2019s affidavit, including (1) that Kelsey was still bleeding from surgery incisions when he was returned to prison in April, 1980, (2) that he was kept in lock-up in unhealthful living conditions and was denied a medically prescribed diet because Dr. Ewing refus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>ed to change his medical status following surgery; (3) that he was denied information about a heart condition; (4) that he was refused an examination of his swollen leg following surgery; (5) that he had been given false information by Dr. Ewing concerning \u201can osteo chondroma on his spine;\u201d and (6) that Dr. Ewing had violated the confidentiality of his medical records by disclosing information contained in them. Furthermore, allegations relating to events predating Dr. Ewing\u2019s tenure at Stillwater are unanswered by his affidavit, including that Kelsey had to wait ten years to obtain a pair of bifocal glasses, ten years to have his hernia repaired and six years to obtain surgery on a vein in his right leg.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain proscribed by the Eighth Amendment. <em>See Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104, 97 S.Ct. 285, 291, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976); <em>Cummings v. Roberts, </em>628 F.2d 1065, 1067-1068 &amp; n.3 (8th Cir. 1980); <em>Hall v. Ashley, </em>607 F.2d 789, 791 (8th Cir. 1979). Kelsey\u2019s uncontested allegations, when taken as a whole, are more than sufficient to state such a constitutional claim. Accordingly, the district court erred in dismissing the complaint as frivolous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The order of the district court is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-9\">. Because we conclude that Kelsey\u2019s complaint is sufficient to survive a motion for dismissal even if all the statements in Dr. Ewing\u2019s affidavit are taken as true, we need not determine whether it was reversible error for the magistrate to consider Dr. Ewing\u2019s affidavit without ensuring that Kelsey was given notice and an opportunity to respond. See, e. <em>g., Davis v. Zahradnick, </em>600 F.2d 458, 460 (4th Cir. 1979); <em>Kelsey v. State, </em>565 F.2d 503, 506 n.2 (8th Cir. 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b86-8\">. Kelsey\u2019s complaint names only Dr. Ewing and his agents and employees as defendants. To the extent that certain of Kelsey\u2019s claims arise from events preceding Dr. Ewing\u2019s arrival at Stillwater, Kelsey may not be able to recover monetary damages against the defendants named in his complaint. In his appeal brief, Kelsey asks this Court to grant him an opportunity to amend his complaint. We leave that decision to the district court in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">We also leave to the district court the question of whether Dr. Ewing is entitled to executive immunity from Kelsey\u2019s claim for monetary relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b86-22\">. We note that some of Kelsey\u2019s claims arise from alleged violations of a consent decree issued in <em>Hines v. Anderson, </em>439 F.Supp. 12 (D.Minn.1977), a class action involving prisoners\u2019 medical rights at the Stillwater prison. Although we need not decide the issue, it is possible that some of Kelsey\u2019s monetary claims are barred by the terms of that decree. Because of the complexity of the questions involved, the district court may wish to consider appointing counsel for Kelsey to ensure that any potential <em>res judicata </em>problems arising from the 1977 consent decree are fully addressed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
