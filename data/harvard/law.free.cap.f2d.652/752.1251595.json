Wandler sought enforcement of Internal Revenue summonses, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7604(a) and 7402(b), directed to respondents, Equity Farmers Elevator and Benedict Farmers Elevator, to obtain records of transactions with Robert O. Olson for the purpose of determining the federal income tax liability of Olson for 1977-1979. Following a show cause order issued by the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to respondents December 18, 1980, a timely motion to intervene and motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction filed by Olson January 12, 1981, an order of January 30, 1981, overruling and denying Olson\u2019s jurisdictional challenge, and a show cause hearing held January 30, 1981, the district court on February 20, 1981 ordered the summonses enforced and directed the respondents to comply no later than March 15, 1981. On March 10, 1981 Olson sought a stay pending appeal, but before the time for a response to the stay motion elapsed and on March 13 the respondents complied and the district court thereafter held the motion for stay had become moot. Olson filed the instant appeal, and the government has filed its motion to dismiss the appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-21\">Since all the summoned records have now been produced, there is nothing left to litigate on appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The appeal is moot. <em>United States v.
