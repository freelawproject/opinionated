GORDON, Senior District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1075-11\">This matter reaches us as a result of a denial without hearing of appellant\u2019s motion to vacate judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-12\">Certain facts, by way of background, are required in order to place appellant\u2019s complaints on this appeal in a proper judicial perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-13\">On January 18, 1977, appellant Patterson was indicted and charged with violations of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951, and armed robbery, 22 D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 2901, 3202. On February 7, 1977, a trial date of March 28, 1977, was assigned. Eleven days before trial date, the trial Court received a letter from Patterson requesting substitution of counsel but asserting his right to a speedy trial. The following day defense counsel moved to withdraw. On March 23, 1977, five days before trial date, the Honorable George L. Hart, Jr.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> considered trial counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw together with Patterson\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion to dismiss his trial counsel, and agreed to and did appoint substitute counsel, entering an order postponing the trial to May 16, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"auo-dedup-0\">The trial commenced as scheduled, and, at its conclusion, the appellant was convicted and sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-16\">Subsequently, a timely notice of appeal was filed and counsel for appeal purposes was appointed. Shortly thereafter, appeal counsel moved to withdraw with the assertion that he was unable to find any nonfriv-olous grounds for the appeal. On January 25, 1978, our Court sustained said counsel\u2019s motion and dismissed Patterson\u2019s appeal of his felony convictions, there appearing no meritorious issues to be reached on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-17\">Then came Patterson with the usual motion to vacate, asserting complaints of ineffective assistance of counsel, judicially compelled waiver of his speedy trial rights and judicial misconduct during his trial. The motion to vacate was overruled by the District Judge without hearing and leave denied for appeal <em>in forma pauperis. </em>Thereafter, appellant paid the fees and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-18\">Recognizing that a motion to vacate may be properly denied without hearing under Rule 4(b) if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-19\">... it plainly appears from the face of the motion ... and exhibits and the prior proceedings . . . that the movant is not entitled to relief . . ., the judge shall make an order for its summary dismissal \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 &gt;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1075-20\">we find the first two asserted grounds for relief to be totally without merit. They are rendered baseless and incredible by an examination of appellant\u2019s motion and the original trial transcript and in no way could they be verified on hearing. <em>Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 76, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 1630, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-21\">The motion\u2019s conclusory allegations against trial counsel show upon their face complaints directed toward counsel\u2019s methods of trial preparation and the results achieved, rather than the quality of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>assistance. Examination of the transcript reflects no support of any claim of service \u201cmeasurably below the performance ordinarily expected of fallible lawyers,\u201d which is the test in this Circuit. No counsel, however skillful, could have \u201caffected the outcome\u201d of this case where appellant\u2019s identity was fixed by three eyewitnesses to the commission of the offense and no greater number of unidentified alibi witnesses, more than the three presented, would have prevented the inescapable jury finding of guilt. <em>United States v. Wood, </em>202 U.S.App. D.C. 267, 628 F.2d 554, 559 (1980) <em>(en banc); United States v. DeCoster, </em>199 U.S.App. D.C. 359, 624 F.2d 196, 208 and 214 (1979) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">As to appellant\u2019s \u201chindsight\u201d complaint of judicial compulsion of waiver of speedy trial right, the record attests to its total falsity,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the assertion is an obvious abuse of our system of justice. Appellant\u2019s complaint would now be based on inadequate time for new trial counsel to prepare had the Court not continued the trial date. Appellant is not entitled to have it both ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">Complaint is also made that during the felony trial, Judge Hart questioned defendant\u2019s alibi witnesses and the defendant himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">Important bench marks must be kept in mind as we examine a trial judge\u2019s activity in this regard. A trial judge historically is not just an impartial umpire. <em>Quercia v. United States, </em>289 U.S. 466, 469, 53 S.Ct. 698, 699, 77 L.Ed. 1321 (1933). He carries the affirmative duty to make inquiry to restore order out of confusion in the interest of justice to all parties to the proceeding. It is critical to the inquiry to remember that his actions must always be viewed prospectively. <em>United States v. Liddy, </em>166 U.S.App.D.C. 95, 509 F.2d 428, 440 (1974) <em>(en </em>banc), <em>cert. den., </em>420 U.S. 911, 95 S.Ct. 833, 42 L.Ed.2d 842 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-11\">Naked extrapolation of the trial court\u2019s questions here, lifted out of context, might support an inference of projection to the jury of an inquisitorial attitude or a manifestation of Judge Hart\u2019s disbelief of the alibi witnesses or his disbelief of defendant\u2019s testimony. However, when we analyze the questions prospectively in the context of the trial transcript it becomes clearly apparent that no judicial impropriety occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-12\">The alibi witnesses, though all purportedly testifying as to a <em>common period in time </em>and as to the <em>activities of each other </em>with the defendant at those common periods in time, proffered a jumble of contradictions and confused assertions. Such properly triggered the trial Judge to his obligation to attempt, by his questions, to clarify. The fact that such questions of clarification, in some instances, may be viewed as having resulted in adversely affecting the alibi witnesses\u2019 credibility does not make the act of questioning itself improper. <em>Jackson v. United States, </em>117 U.S. App.D.C. 325, 329 F.2d 893, 894 (1964). Quite to the contrary. The reverse result <em>could have </em>manifested itself and strengthened the credibility of those witnesses. This is why \u201cprospective\u201d analysis is critical.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-13\">Before the answers were given by the witnesses, Judge Hart had no way of knowing what the answers would be, but he did have the duty to obtain the answers in the interest of justice. To those who might be heard to argue that the trial Court should have deduced in advance that the answers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>to be forthcoming would undercut the credibility of the alibi witness, we would respond, if that be so, then the pollution by perjury is and should be properly thwarted by the trial judge. See <em>United States v. Liddy, supra, </em>509 F.2d at 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">The trial Judge likewise questioned the defendant-appellant Patterson specifically as to whether he had reported or paid income tax on certain gambling winnings about which he had testified in explanation of his possession of certain funds. Standing alone this would seem to be a suggestion by the trial Judge of defendant\u2019s possible commission of another offense. However, when analyzed prospectively against the record, it can be seen that had the defendant been able to have answered \u201cyes,\u201d rather than \u201cno,\u201d such would have strengthened his defense. Again, the Court had no way of anticipating the answer, but if a possible beneficial answer lurked undisclosed it was the duty of the Court in defendant\u2019s interest to bring it forward for the jury\u2019s consideration. We find that the circumstances which gave rise to the questions support the propriety of the intervention. <em>United States v. Wyatt, </em>143 U.S.App.D.C. 136, 442 F.2d 858, 861 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">In any event, when the Court\u2019s entire activity is examined, it becomes apparent that, on the worst interpretation, such conduct failed to reach unconstitutional dimensions. Insubstantial claims of this nature are not cognizable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Buekelew v. United States, </em>575 F.2d 515, 518 (5th Cir. 1978). Finally, in this respect, we note that the trial Judge affirmatively and adequately admonished the jury not to consider his actions as any indication of his feeling as to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-9\">When these occurrences are reviewed in the light of our previous holding in <em>United States v. McCord, </em>166 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 509 F.2d 334, 348 (1974) (en <em>banc), cert. den., </em>421 U.S. 930, 95 S.Ct. 1656, 44 L.Ed.2d 87 (1975), it is clearly established that the trial Judge\u2019s intervention met the test of being \u201cin pursuit of justice\u201d and \u201cconsistent with the premises of the limits on intervention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the trial Court\u2019s dismissal, without hearing, of appellant\u2019s motion to vacate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1075-23\">.

Green, </em>429 F.2d 754, 760 (D.C.Cir.1970); <em>United States v. Barbour, </em>420 F.2d 1319, 1321-22 (D.C.Cir.1969).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have been more receptive to a trial judge\u2019s intervention when it is aimed at providing needed clarification, rather than at challenging testimony or initiating new lines of questioning. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Wyatt, </em>442 F.2d 858, 860-61 (D.C.Cir.1971); <em>Barbour, </em>420 F.2d at 1322; <em>cf. Green, </em>429 F.2d at 760. Contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, this was not a case in which the judge\u2019s participation was necessary to alleviate confusion. Moreover, the government had able <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>counsel and hardly needed help from the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">Appellant\u2019s three alibi witnesses \u2014 his mother and two sisters \u2014 testified during direct and cross-examination regarding appellant\u2019s activities during the day of the robbery. But the judge\u2019s questions focused on appellant\u2019s previous and subsequent visits to his family and the events on those days. <em>See </em>Trial Transcript (Tr.) at 170-74, 202-03, 223-25. This was not an attempt to elucidate, but an effort to impeach credibility.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the judge thought that this area of inquiry was a promising one, he should have called both attorneys to the bench or to chambers and made the suggestion. <em>See Green, </em>429 F.2d at 760 (\u201cthe proper procedure\u201d when more than one or two questions are involved); <em>Barbour, </em>420 F.2d at 1322 &amp; n.25. Similarly, the judge\u2019s examination of appellant regarding his failure to file a tax return for his gambling winnings opened a new line of questioning rather than clarified previous ones. <em>See </em>Tr. at 271-72. Although the judge may not have anticipated appellant\u2019s response to all his questions, he should have been aware of the possibility that appellant would answer that he had neglected to file a tax return. The judge should have been sensitive to the potential prejudice of such a response; he should have considered the possibility that a judge\u2019s eliciting such an answer from appellant might well give \u201cundue eminence to matters otherwise irrelevant to the offenses with which the appellant was charged.\u201d <em>Wyatt, </em>442 F.2d at 860.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">Nevertheless, I agree with the majority that any error in the district court\u2019s examination of defense witnesses is insufficient to justify reversal. Appellant has failed to demonstrate that the judge\u2019s conduct was so egregious as to constitute a constitutional violation, and the government had substantial evidence pointing to guilt. But I think that the record clearly evidences over-zealousness on the part of the court below. The judge\u2019s questioning was relatively extensive and opened new areas of inquiry, questions were asked only of defense witnesses, <em>cf. Barbour, </em>420 F.2d at 1322, and defense counsel did object to the judge\u2019s intervention. The proper exercise of discretion would have been to suggest appropriate questions to counsel and to limit substantially the examination actually conducted by the court. We ought not encourage trial judges to be nonchalant about the line between impartial elucidation and prosecution.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1077-7\">. The court explained the relevant considerations quite clearly in Green:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-8\">[Although a federal judge in a criminal case has the power to participate in the examination of witnesses when it is necessary to \u201c[make] the case clear to the jurors,\u201d this power should be sparingly exercised. Particularly when the questioning is designed to elicit answers favorable to the prosecution, \u201cit is far better for the trial judge to err on the side of [a]bstention from intervention in the case.\u201d If more than one or two questions are involved, the proper procedure is \u201cto call both counsel to the bench, or in chambers and suggest what [the judge] wants done. That the judge may be able to examine witnesses more skillfully or develop a point in less time than counsel requires does not ordinarily justify such participation. That is not his function.\u201d As Judge Learned Hand once said, \u201cProsecution and judgment are two quite separate functions in the administration of justice: they must not merge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1077-15\">429 F.2d at 760 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1078-6\">. The jury could quite reasonably have inferred from the nature of the judge\u2019s questions that he found the defense witnesses incredible. In response to one witness\u2019 uncertainty about appellant\u2019s activities during a prior visit, for example, the judge asked, \u201cYou mean your brother visited you and you are not sure whether you told your mother he was there?\" and \u201cYou don\u2019t know who he stayed with?\u201d Tr. at 203, 202. Moreover, in questioning appellant\u2019s mother, the judge queried, \u201cWhat time would he get in, what time would he go, where did he go? You know this on the other date, how about this date?\u201d Tr. at 172-73. These inquiries do not have the qualities of neutral questions aimed at clarification, even when viewed prospectively rather than \u201cin the brilliant glare of hindsight.\u201d <em>Green, </em>429 F.2d at 760.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
