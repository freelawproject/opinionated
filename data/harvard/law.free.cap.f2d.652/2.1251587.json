Hanson, Senior United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b83-7\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">Mobil Oil appeals from the order of the district court 496 F.Supp. 132<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> enjoining it from terminating the one-year trial franchise of service station operator James Clark. We affirm the granting of the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Clark completed Mobil Oil\u2019s dealer training school in 1979 and thereafter entered into a trial franchise agreement with Mobil Oil on May 14, 1979. On February 7, 1980, Mobil notified Clark that his trial franchise would not be renewed. In an effort to comply with the provisions of the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act (PMPA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2804(c)(3), which requires that the notification of nonrenewal \u201cshall contain * * * a statement of intention to terminate the franchise or not to renew the franchise relationship, together with the reasons therefor,\u201d Mobil offered the following explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-13\">The reason or reasons for our non-renewal decision are that Mobil has determined that it does not wish to continue its franchise relationship with you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-14\">Clark filed a complaint in state court alleging that Mobil\u2019s termination of the trial franchise agreement was ineffective under Missouri law. Mobil Oil filed a counterclaim seeking ejectment. Although Mobil subsequently removed the case to federal district court, Clark never amended the complaint to include any federal grounds for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-15\">Following the bench trial, the court issued its Memorandum and Judgment of August 4, 1980. Judge Regan denied relief to Clark on the state common law grounds alleged in his complaint, but found that the so-called \u201creason\u201d given by Mobil for its nonrenewal of the trial franchise did \u201cnot conform to the notification requirements of Section 2804(c)\u201d of the PMPA. Clark was granted equitable relief pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2805 of the PMPA. Mobil\u2019s counterclaim was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-16\">In a post-trial motion for relief from the judgment, Mobil challenged, among other things, the trial court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>interjection of an issue which was not pleaded or contested by the plaintiff, the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the notice requirement of the PMPA and the court\u2019s granting of equitable relief on a legal theory which the plaintiff had failed to raise. Mobil\u2019s contentions were carefully reviewed by Judge Regan and its motion was denied in a Memorandum and Order of September 5, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-17\">We have considered Mobil\u2019s contentions on appeal and have reviewed the record and arguments of the parties. We conclude that the issues raised by Mobil were correctly decided by the district court in its consideration of Mobil\u2019s post-trial motion. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the district court on the basis of the court\u2019s Memorandum and Order of September 5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>1980, pursuant to Rule 14 of the Rules of this court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b83-18\">.
