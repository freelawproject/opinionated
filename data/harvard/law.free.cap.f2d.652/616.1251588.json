The sole issue on appeal is whether the tax court\u2019s findings of fact in support of its decision that the Pickerings were <em>not </em>engaged in farming activity with the primary objective of making a profit are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-13\">It is well settled that the Pickerings have the burden of proof to establish that their intent and purpose in farming was to make a profit. <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>70 T.C. 715 (1978). The Internal Revenue Service has promulgated the following guidelines to aid in the determination of a taxpayer\u2019s intent: (1) the manner in which the activity was conducted; (2) the expertise of the taxpayer or his advisors; (3) the time and effort expended on the activity; (4) the expectation of related asset appreciation; (5) the success of the taxpayer in similar or dissimilar activities; (6) the history of income or loss of the activity; (7) the amount of profits, if any, which are earned; (8) the financial status of the taxpayer; and (9) the presence of elements of personal pleasure or recreation. \u00a7 1-183 \u2014 2(b). Income Tax Regs.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-17\">Upon review of the entire record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 arguments, we hold that the findings of fact to support the tax court\u2019s decision and order are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-18\">Accordingly, the judgment of the tax court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
