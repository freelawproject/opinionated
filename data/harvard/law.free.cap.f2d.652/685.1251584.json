These transactions were approved by the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States. Plaintiffs, three Milwaukee banks and the bank holding companies that own them, filed this action against the Comptroller, First Bank, and First Bank System, Inc., the holding company that owns First Bank. Plaintiffs allege that the Comptroller violated 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 36(c) and Wis.Stat. \u00a7 221.04(l)(j) by permitting First Bank to retain the former Midland office as a branch bank. Plaintiffs also allege that the acquisition of Midland by First Bank was, in reality, an acquisition by First Bank System, and thus, was a holding company acquisition over which the Comptroller had no jurisdiction and which the Comptroller had no authority to approve.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-14\">The district court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 original complaint for lack of standing and failure to state a claim. The district court similarly dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint for lack of standing. We affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b768-16\">The parties disagree as to the facts properly before this court upon review of the district court\u2019s orders dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaints. Plaintiffs have moved to strike portions of First Bank\u2019s brief and appendix on the ground that they incorporate contested factual matters that properly were excluded by the district court in resolving the threshold issues of standing and jurisdiction. In particular, plaintiffs object to defendants\u2019 submission of materials supporting the Comptroller\u2019s finding that emergency measures were necessary in order to prevent the failure of Midland. We agree that only the record established in the district court, and not additional materials submitted by the Comptroller to this court on appeal, are properly before this court. We, therefore, draw no conclusions from the additional materials submitted and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>fine our review to the following uncontested facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">By decision dated July 23, 1977, the Comptroller approved the application of First Bank<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to purchase the assets and assume the liabilities of Midland.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At that time, Midland was the fourth largest bank in Wisconsin. First Bank was considerably smaller, but was and is owned by First Bank System, Inc., of Minneapolis, Minnesota, a bank holding company that controls many banks, with total deposits exceeding $6 billion. The Comptroller\u2019s decision was based upon his finding that, from the fall of 1975 through the spring of 1977, Midland suffered a severe and continuing deterioration in its asset structure, principally due to real estate loan problems. The Comptroller reasoned that the severity of the loan problems, as well as the volatility of the bank\u2019s deposit structure, threatened Midland\u2019s survival unless Midland received a massive injection of capital. The Comptroller considered First Bank\u2019s offer to purchase Midland a good solution that would avoid a bank failure and would insure uninterrupted services to Midland\u2019s customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">Because the Comptroller regarded Midland\u2019s situation as an emergency, the Comptroller, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 181,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> waived the requirement of shareholder approval and waived certain other requirements of bank mergers, pursuant to the Bank Merger Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1828(c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Comptroller also determined that the retention of Midland\u2019s existing office as a branch of First Bank was consistent with Wisconsin\u2019s emergency branch banking statute, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 221.04(l)(j)2, which is made applicable to national banks by 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 36(c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>In January, 1978, plaintiffs filed this action. The original complaint alleged that the Comptroller\u2019s approval of the establishment of a branch of First Bank in Milwaukee violated the applicable statutes which limit the establishment of branches by national banks. The original complaint also alleged that the Comptroller had exceeded his jurisdiction and had violated the Bank Holding Company Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1842, in purporting to approve an acquisition by First Bank which was actually an acquisition by First Bank System, Inc., a bank holding company located outside Wisconsin.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">The initial decision of the district court, dated September 16, 1978, dismissed the branch banking claim in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint without prejudice. The court held that plaintiffs lacked standing with regard to the branch bank issue because they failed to allege \u201cinjury in fact.\u201d The district court dismissed the Bank Holding Company Act claim with prejudice, holding that no private right of action against the Comptroller could be derived from the Bank Holding Company Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint limited to the branch banking issue. By order dated June 30,1980, the district court dismissed the amended complaint for lack of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">We deal first with plaintiffs\u2019 standing to assert the branch banking issues raised in plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint sets forth two alterna-five theories of how the Comptroller violated federal and state branch banking statutes: Count I alleges that allowing First Bank to acquire the former Midland facility as a branch violated 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 36 and the Wisconsin emergency branch banking statute, Wis.Stat. \u00a7 221.04(l)(j)2, because there was no \u201cemergency\u201d at the time the Comptroller acted; Count II alleges that, even if there was an emergency, the Comptroller violated Wis.Stat. \u00a7 221.04(l)(j)2 by failing to first offer plaintiffs the opportunity to acquire Midland.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">As Justice Douglas stated in <em>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 151, 90 S.Ct. 827, 829, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970), \u201c[gjeneralizations about standing to sue are largely worthless as such.\u201d One commentator has noted that the concept of standing is \u201camong the most amorphous in the entire domain of public law.\u201d Hearings on S.2097 before the Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights of the Senate Judiciary Committee, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 465, 498 (1966) (statement of Prof. Paul A. Freund), <em>quoted in Flast v. Cohen, </em>392 U.S. 83, 99, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 1952, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968). In order to avoid confusion and inconsistency in analyzing standing questions, it is necessary to focus on the precise parties, injuries, interests, and statutes involved. Therefore, we must narrow our focus to the specific issue of standing of competitors to challenge agency action which results in allegedly illegal competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>The general test for standing was first articulated by the Supreme Court in three cases involving competitors\u2019 challenges to Comptroller rulings allowing national banks to enter the competitors\u2019 fields. <em>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970) (data processing); <em>Arnold Tours v. Camp, </em>400 U.S. 45, 91 S.Ct. 158, 27 L.Ed.2d 179 (1970) (travel services); <em>Investment Company Institute v. Camp, </em>401 U.S. 617, 91 S.Ct. 1091, 28 L.Ed.2d 367 (1971) (mutual investment funds). The test enunciated in these cases gives meaning to the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s grant of standing to persons \u201caggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute....\u201d 5U.S.C. \u00a7 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">The test has two prongs. The first part of the test requires that \u201cthe plaintiff alleges that the challenged action has caused him injury in fact, economic or otherwise.\u201d <em>Data Processing, </em>397 U.S. at 152, 90 S.Ct. at 829. The second part of the test requires that \u201cthe interest sought to be protected by the complainant is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question.\u201d 397 U.S. at 153, 90 S.Ct. at 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b771-13\">We now consider the first requirement of standing, that there be an \u201cinjury in fact.\u201d This requirement assures satisfaction of the constitutional requirement of a \u201ccase or controversy.\u201d <em>See Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Org., </em>426 U.S. 26, 37-38, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 1923-24, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976). Plaintiffs\u2019 original complaint was dismissed because it did not include any allegations of injury in fact, economic or otherwise. The court refused to construe the complaint as alleging the adverse effect necessary to give plaintiffs standing and, consequently, dismissed with leave to amend.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-14\">In their amended complaint, plaintiffs allege that plaintiff banks and Midland were within a radius of one-half mile of each other and competed actively. Plaintiffs allege damages resulting from \u201cillegally acquired changes in the competitive environment\u201d caused by First Bank\u2019s acquisition of Midland.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The district court held that, although plaintiffs alleged that they and the new First Bank branch at the former Midland location were competitors, \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint still contains no allegation of any concrete or identifiable injury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>whether economic or otherwise, caused them by the defendants\u2019 acts unless competition itself is somehow considered injurious.\u201d <em>Marshall &amp; Ilsley Corp. v. Heimann, </em>No. 78-C-42, slip op. at 4 (W.D.Wis. June 30, 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">The Supreme Court has held, however, that an administrative agency\u2019s authorization of an allegedly illegal competitor or form of competition <em>does </em>constitute injury to competitors for standing purposes. In <em>Data Processing, </em>397 U.S. 150, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970), <em>Arnold Tours, </em>400 U.S. 45, 91 S.Ct. 158, 27 L.Ed.2d 179 (1970), and <em>Investment Company Institute, </em>401 U.S. 617, 91 S.Ct. 1091, 28 L.Ed.2d 367 (1971), the Comptroller gave national banks permission to enter new areas of operation. \u201cInjury in fact\u201d flowed from the economic harm caused by an additional competitor. In <em>Sierra Club v. Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972), the Court reaffirmed the <em>Data Processing </em>holding that harm to competitive position comprises \u201cinjury in fact\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-5\">In <em>Data Processing, </em>the injury claimed by the petitioners consisted of harm to their competitive position in the computer-servicing market through a ruling by the Comptroller of the Currency that national banks might perform data-processing services for their customers. . . . These palpable economic injuries have long been recognized as sufficient to lay the basis for standing, with or without a specific statutory provision for judicial review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">405 U.S. at 733-34, 92 S.Ct. at 1364-65 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Defendants argue that <em>Data Processing </em>and other cases challenging decisions by the Comptroller are distinguishable because, in those cases, competitive injury was readily inferred as a result of the Comptroller\u2019s authorization of <em>new </em>branches or <em>new </em>forms of competition.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Here, plaintiffs challenge the change of ownership of an existing bank. According to the district court, where there is \u201creplacement\u201d rather than \u201cnew\u201d competition, competitive injury cannot be \u201cassumed from the situation itself or inferred from plaintiffs\u2019 allegations.\u201d <em>Marshall &amp; Ilsley Corp. v. Heimann, </em>No. 78 \u2014 C\u2014 42, slip op. at 11 (W.D.Wis. Sept. 18, 1978). But, while the establishment of a new branch bank where there was no bank is certainly a more obvious form of competitive harm than the transformation of an existing bank into a branch bank, we do not find the differences between \u201cnew\u201d and \u201creplacement\u201d competition decisive.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">According to the cases involving \u201cnew\u201d competition, if First Bank had attempted to establish a new branch in Milwaukee, plaintiffs would have standing to challenge the legality of that new branch; competitive injury would be assumed to flow from a new source of competition.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In this case, there can be no doubt that conversion of Wisconsin\u2019s fourth largest bank into a branch of a bank located in a different city and owned by an enormous bank holding company represents a change in the competitive configuration of Milwaukee\u2019s banking community. To hold that plaintiffs would satisfy the \u201cinjury in fact\u201d requirement for purposes of challenging a totally new branch, no matter how small, but that plaintiffs must allege more specific and identifiable harm when the allegedly illegal branch is an acquired bank, would be absurd. We find that the allegations of competitive harm in plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint are sufficient to satisfy the \u201cinjury in fact\u201d prerequisite to standing. <em>Cf. Leuthold v. Camp, </em>273 F.Supp. 695 (D.Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>1967), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>405 F.2d 499 (9th Cir. 1969) (competitor challenge allowed although Comptroller\u2019s action did not increase the number of competitive banking facilities).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">A showing of an injury in fact is a necessary, but not a sufficient, prerequisite for standing. Plaintiffs also must satisfy the second prong of the standing test, the \u201czone of interests\u201d requirement. To satisfy this requirement, plaintiffs must show that the relevant statutes were meant to protect them from the type of competition threatened by defendants\u2019 actions. The \u201czone of interests\u201d requirement is a prudential limitation, which has not been extensively developed by the Supreme Court since <em>Data Processing. </em>For this reason, the district court, in dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 original complaint, held that the requirements for standing are satisfied by a showing of an injury in fact, economic or otherwise, and that plaintiffs need not establish that they come within any \u201czone of interests.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">This circuit consistently has required satisfaction of the zone of interests test for standing. <em>Bradford School Bus Transit, Inc. v. Chicago Transit Authority, </em>537 F.2d 943, 946 (7th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1066, 97 S.Ct. 797, 50 L.Ed.2d 784 (1977); <em>Apter v. Richardson, </em>510 F.2d 351, 353 (7th Cir. 1975). Although the Supreme Court has not elaborated on the zone of interests standard recently, the standard is still referred to by the Supreme Court as an element of the test for standing.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We further are persuaded of the standard\u2019s continuing vitality by the thoughtful and detailed discussion in <em>Control Data Corp. v. Baldridge, </em>No. 80-1143, slip op. at 13-17 (D.C.Cir. March 25, 1981). <em>See also Tax Analysts &amp; Advocates v. Blumenthal, </em>566 F.2d 130, 138-43 (D.C.Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1086, 98 S.Ct. 1280, 55 L.Ed.2d 791 (1978). Therefore, although we find, contrary to the district court, that plaintiffs have alleged a personal stake and interest in the litigation which amounts to an \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d the standing issue is by no means decided. We must also decide whether the particular interest asserted by plaintiffs is arguably protected by the particular statutory provision involved. <em>See Tax Analysts, </em>566 F.2d at 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">We apply the zone of interests analysis separately to each count and each statute involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b773-13\">In Count I of their amended complaint, plaintiffs claim that there was no \u201cemergency\u201d at Midland \u2014 that Midland was not in danger of failing. In order to satisfy the zone of interests test for Count I, plaintiffs\u2019 interests must be protected by the relevant emergency provisions. Only if plaintiffs have standing to dispute the emergency determination, do the particular banking claims in Count I become an issue.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Both state and federal statutory provisions concerning emergency measures that are permitted when a bank is near failure are involved here. While plaintiffs base their standing arguments on the state branch banking law, the federal emergency provisions invoked by the Comptroller also are relevant in determining the interests protected by the emergency branching statute, a</p>\n<p id=\"b773-14\">First, we deal with the federal emergency statutes. The Comptroller may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>waive shareholder approval of the sale of assets and assumption of liabilities of a failing bank and may allow immediate consummation of the transaction pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 181 and 1828(c).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Under each of these statutes, we find that plaintiffs\u2019 interests in preventing illegal competition are not within the zone of interests intended to be protected by the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">The interests protected by 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 181 are clearly those of the shareholders of a bank being liquidated and, in situations where a bank is failing, those of shareholders and bank customers.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The reason for allowing waiver of shareholder approval is to prevent \u201cdelays in rendering financial assistance to national banks in emergency situations.\u201d Hearings on H.R. 6092 and H.R. 6093 before Subcommittee No. 2 of the House Committee on Banking and Currency, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 39 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">From this brief analysis of the statute, it is clear that competitors of an allegedly failing bank, unlike shareholders, are not among those whose interests are protected by 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 181. Plaintiffs, therefore, do not have standing to challenge the Comptroller\u2019s determination of an emergency based on that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The other federal statutory provision involving the Comptroller\u2019s determination of an emergency is 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1828(c). This portion of the Bank Merger Act concerns the antitrust implications of bank mergers. It establishes procedures \u201cfor the review of proposed bank mergers so as to eliminate the necessity for the dissolution of merged banks.\u201d H.Rep.No.1221, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 1, <em>reprinted in </em>1966 <em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News </em>1860. These procedures may be expedited when the responsible agency finds \u201cthat it must act immediately in order to prevent the probable failure of one of the banks involved.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1828(c)(3), (4), (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">Under the Bank Merger Act, the Comptroller\u2019s determination of an emergency eliminates procedures for pre-merger examination of the antitrust implications of bank mergers. In order to fall within the zone of interests of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1828(c), plaintiffs must represent the particular competitive interest addressed by the statute \u2014 the interest in preventing antitrust violations. Here, there is no allegation that First Bank\u2019s purchase of Midland violates any antitrust laws. Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cinterest\u201d is in avoiding competition from an illegal branch. This interest is very different from an interest in avoiding monopolization of the Milwaukee banking community.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-12\">In <em>Control Data Corp. v. Baldridge, </em>No. 80-1143, slip op. at 24-27 (D.C.Cir. March 25, 1981), the court held that plaintiffs are not within the zone of interests of a statute where their competitive interest does not match the particular interest in competition protected by that statute. Here, plaintiffs\u2019 general interest in competition does not match the antitrust interest of the statute. Therefore, we find that plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the Comptrol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>ler\u2019s determination of an emergency under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1828(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">b</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Finally, we reach the question of whether plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the Comptroller\u2019s determination of an emergency is within the zone of interests protected by the Wisconsin emergency branch banking statute, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 221.04(l)(j)2. Wisconsin branch banking law is relevant to the Midland transaction because, according to federal banking laws, the Comptroller may not approve a branch of a national bank unless state law prerequisites to branching are satisfied. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 36(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">In Wisconsin, branch banking is forbidden, except as provided by statute. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 221.04(l)(f). One statutory provision allows branch banking in a \u201cbankless community.\u201d Wis.Stat. \u00a7 221.04(l)(j)l. This statute allows a bank to establish a branch in a municipality that has no bank or branch bank only if there is no bank or branch bank within three miles of the proposed branch and if the home bank is in the same county as the branch, or is in a contiguous county and within 25 miles of the branch.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Wis.Stat. \u00a7 221.04(l)(j)2 provides an exception to \u00a7 221.04(l)(j)l in emergencies.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-8\">2. The limits set forth in subd. 1 may not apply to any emergency situation where the commissioner finds that a bank is failing and that it must be merged or consolidated with another bank and operated as a branch bank for the protection of the depositors of the failing bank and that the opportunity to merge or consolidate with the bank has been offered to and not accepted by all other banks within the geographical limits of subd. 1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">It is important to distinguish the zone of interests protected by the emergency branch banking statute, \u00a7 221.04(l)(j)2, from the zone of interests protected by the ordinary branch banking restrictions, \u00a7 221.04(l)(f), (i), (j)l, and (1). Although plaintiffs do fall within the zone of interests of the ordinary, non-emergency branch banking provisions, we find that plaintiffs do <em>not </em>fall within the zone of interests protected by the Wisconsin emergency branch banking statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">Competitors of a proposed branch generally are considered to be within the zone of interests of state laws restricting branch banking, which are made applicable to national banks by 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 36(c). The purpose of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 36(c) is to place national and state banks on a basis of \u201ccompetitive equality\u201d with respect to branch banking. <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank of Logan v. Walker Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>385 U.S. 252, 261, 87 S.Ct. 492, 497, 17 L.Ed.2d 343 (1966). Thus, both state and national banks that would compete with a proposed branch of a national bank are protected by 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 36(c) from illegally authorized competition.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In fact, in many cases where the Comptroller\u2019s approval of an allegedly illegal branch is challenged by a competitor, standing is simply assumed. <em>See, e. g., State Bank of Rensselaer v. Heimann, </em>619 F.2d 679 (7th Cir. 1980); <em>First Union Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Winamac v.

This language seems to indicate that competing banks are not within the zone of interests protected by the emergency branch banking statute. Attempting to avoid the clear statutory pronouncement, plaintiffs argue that, although the emergency procedures are meant to protect depositors of a failing bank, the threshold decision that the bank is failing may be challenged by competitors if that decision results in establishment of a branch bank that would be illegal in the absence of a failing bank emergency. The problem with plaintiffs\u2019 argument is that the emergency provision, in carving out an exception to the Wisconsin branch banking provisions, also carves out competitors\u2019 standing to challenge the application of the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">There are no Wisconsin cases discussing the zone of interests protected by the emergency branch provision,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> but the provision is comparable to the emergency provisions in federal banking laws discussed earlier, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 181 and 1828(c). The purpose of both the Wisconsin and federal emergency banking provisions is to restructure the assets and liabilities of a failing bank with a minimum of disruption of services to depositors. If other banks were allowed to challenge the Comptroller\u2019s determination of an emergency solely on the basis of their status as competitors, the objectives justifying these emergency procedures could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>thwarted by the purely selfish desires of competitors to keep a new competitor out of the local banking community.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">In addition to evincing an intent to protect depositors of a failing bank, \u00a7 221.-04(l)(j)2 provides that when an emergency requires lifting the general prohibitions against branch banking, banks within the geographical limits of \u00a7 221.04(l)(j)l must be offered the opportunity to merge or consolidate with the failing bank. Consequently, we must examine \u00a7 221.04(l)(j)l to determine: (1) the meaning of the \u201cgeographical limits\u201d referred to in \u00a7 221.04(l)(j)2 and (2) whether plaintiffs fit within those geographical limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">What is meant by the geographical limits of \u00a7 221.04(l)(j)l is not entirely clear from the face of \u00a7 221.04(l)(j)l. But we interpret<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the phrase \u201cbanks within the geographical limits\u201d to encompass those banks that meet all the limitations of \u00a7 221.04(l)(j)l and, therefore, could have acquired the failing bank as a branch, pursuant to \u00a7 221.04(l)(j)l, even without an emergency. This interpretation thus entails geographical limitations on the failing bank, as well as on the acquiring bank. In other words, for the \u201coffer\u201d requirement to apply, the failing bank must be the only bank or branch bank in its municipality; there must be no bank or branch bank within three miles of the failing bank; and the acquiring bank must be either in the same county or in a contiguous county arid within 25 miles of the failing bank. Only the banks within those geographical limits are entitled to an offer pursuant to \u00a7 221.-04(l)(j)2.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">The \u201coffer\u201d provision is an attempt to minimize the exceptions to the general rule on branching. The \u201coffer\u201d provision evinces an intent to have, whenever possible, even in an emergency, a branch bank/home bank relation that would be otherwise allowable under \u00a7 221.04(l)(j)l. We find that only a bank which meets the geographical requirements and which, therefore, could have operated the failing bank as a branch bank, comes within the zone of interests protected by the emergency branch banking statute\u2019s \u201coffer\u201d provision. Thus, only a bank which is entitled to an offer under the statute has standing to challenge the determination of an emergency-</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">The former Midland facility and plaintiffs\u2019 banks are all in Milwaukee and are within a one mile radius of each other. Thus, none of the plaintiffs could have qualified under \u00a7 221.04(l)(j)l to acquire Midland as a branch. Since plaintiffs are not within the geographical limits of \u00a7 221.-04(l){j)l, they do not have standing to challenge the Comptroller\u2019s determination that Midland\u2019s condition warranted waiver of the usual geographical restrictions on branch banking. Consequently, even though plaintiffs are within the zone of interests of the ordinary branch banking statute, they are not within the zone of interests protected by Wisconsin\u2019s emergency branch banking statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">Plaintiffs argue, however, that they have a clear interest in the determination of an emergency since they are injured by the illegal competition that results from an erroneous determination of an emergency. But, as discussed earlier in this opinion, competitive injury alone does not confer standing; the zone of interests test must also be met. The sound policy reasons for requiring satisfaction of the zone of interests test are particularly applicable to challenges based on statutes authorizing emergency action by administrative agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">The emergency provisions allow the Comptroller to act quickly to save a failing bank. Intervention by competing banks could only hamper this effort by causing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>delay and possibly needless exposure of the failing bank\u2019s condition. Such delay and exposure may alarm depositors of the failing bank and may undermine public confidence in the banking system as a whole. The determination that a bank is failing should involve only the failing bank, its depositors and shareholders, and the Comptroller. Competitor banks are strangers to the failure determination, even though their competitive interests might be affected by eventual Comptroller action. We agree with Professor Stewart\u2019s analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqp\">Even in the strongest case for expansive standing \u2014 where the agency acts in flat violation of the governing statute \u2014 a stranger should not be permitted to challenge agency action. . . . The abstract concern for vindicating the bare words of statutes seems too attenuated a justification for disturbing mutually satisfactory arrangements struck by all of the relevant public and private interests. Accordingly, even in the case of plain statutory violations, we should view officials as bearing duties solely to the various interests which the legislature had recognized as entitled to consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AP-\">Stewart, <em>Reformation of Administrative Law, </em>88 Harv.L.Rev. 1667, 1736 (1975). Thus, we conclude that the risk of an erroneous determination of an emergency, and subsequent approval of an illegal branch, does not justify allowing competing banks to disrupt the mechanisms for dealing with failing banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">In Count II of their amended complaint, plaintiffs allege that even if an emergency existed at Midland, the Comptroller violated \u00a7 221.04(l)(j)2 by failing to offer to plaintiffs the opportunity to acquire Midland. But, as just discussed, plaintiffs are not within the geographical limitations of \u00a7 221.04(l)(j)l. Only those banks within the geographical limits of \u00a7 221.04(l)(j)l are entitled to be offered the opportunity to purchase the failing bank and, consequently, have standing to contest the Comptroller\u2019s failure to offer them that opportunity. Therefore, plaintiffs lack standing to contest the failure to give them an offer.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-7\">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no application shall be approved under this section which will permit any bank holding company or any subsidiary thereof to acquire, directly or indirectly, any voting shares of, interest in, or all or substantially all of the assets of any additional bank located outside of the State in which the operations of such bank holding company\u2019s banking subsidiaries were principally conducted on July 1, 1966, or the date on which such company became a bank holding company, whichever is later, unless the acquisition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>such shares or assets of a State bank by an out-of-State bank holding company is specifically authorized by the statute laws of the State in which such bank is located, by language to that effect and not merely by implication. For the purposes of this section, the State in which the operations of a bank holding company\u2019s subsidiaries are principally conducted is that State in which total deposits of all such banking subsidiaries are largest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>In summary, we hold that plaintiffs do not have standing to assert the branch banking claims contained in Counts I and II of their amended complaint. Plaintiffs are not within the zone of interests sought to be protected by the relevant statutes. Therefore, the district court\u2019s dismissal of these claims is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">In addition to the branch banking claims, plaintiffs alleged in their original complaint that the Comptroller had violated the Bank Holding Company Act (\u201cBHCA\u201d) by failing to obtain prior approval of the Midland acquisition from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (\u201cBoard\u201d). Plaintiffs argued that the purchase of Midland by First Bank was, in reality, a purchase by First Bank System, a bank holding company and, consequently, required the approval of the Board. The district court dismissed this claim on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-12\">In order to purchase a bank, a bank holding company must obtain Board approval. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1842(a). Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1842(d)(1), the Board may approve a bank holding company\u2019s purchase of assets of a bank outside the state in which total deposits of the bank holding company\u2019s banking subsidiaries are largest only if acquisition of such assets of a bank by an out-of-state bank holding company is specifically authorized by the statute laws of the state in which the bank is located.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Plaintiffs ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>gue that since (1) Minnesota is the state where the total deposits of First Bank System\u2019s banking subsidiaries are greatest and (2) Wisconsin statutes do not permit the acquisition of banks located in Wisconsin by bank holding companies outside of Wisconsin, First Bank System could not acquire Midland directly. Thus, the purported acquisition of Midland by First Bank was, plaintiffs argue, a sham perpetrated by First Bank System in order to evade the prohibitions of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1842(d).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Initially, we note that the restrictions in \u00a7 1842(d) do not, on their face, apply here. Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1842(a)(4), prior Board approval is only necessary \u201cfor any bank holding company or subsidiary thereof, <em>other than a bank, </em>to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of a bank\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Since the transaction at issue was a purchase of the assets of a bank (Midland) by another <em>bank </em>(First Bank), not by a bank holding company, under the literal language of the statute, no application for approval from the Board was required. <em>See Leuthold v. Camp, </em>273 F.Supp. 695, 702 (D.Mont.1967), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>405 F.2d 499 (9th Cir. 1969); <em>South Dakota v. Nat\u2019l Bank of South Dakota, </em>335 F.2d 444, 448 \u2014 19 (8th Cir. 1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 970, 85 S.Ct. 667, 13 L.Ed.2d 562 (1965) (\u201cThe words in the statute \u2018other than a bank\u2019 clearly show the intention of Congress not to require a bank acquiring the assets of another bank to obtain Board approval\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">But, plaintiffs argue that regardless of the exception in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1842(a)(4) to the requirement of Board approval, the Comptroller should have recognized that he had no jurisdiction to approve the Midland purchase because First Bank System, not First Bank, was the true purchaser of Midland. In other words, plaintiffs argue that we should \u201cpierce the corporate veil\u201d in order to prevent defendants from subverting the Congressional purpose behind \u00a7 1842(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">Defendants argue that the Comptroller does not have jurisdiction to determine whether the BHCA has been violated. They argue that any challenge to a transaction under the BHCA must be presented to the Board, whose decisions may be reviewed only in an appropriate court of appeals pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1848. Therefore, defendants conclude, and the district court agreed, that the district court lacks jurisdiction to decide the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the Midland acquisition was a BHCA violation. We agree. Plaintiffs may bring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>a BHCA claim only before the Board.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> They may not present their BHCA claim in the guise of a challenge to the Comptroller\u2019s discretion and authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">The leading case in this confusing area of allocation of authority between the Comptroller and the Board, with review in the district court or court of appeals respectively, is <em>Whitney Nat\u2019l Bank v. Bank of New Orleans, </em>379 U.S. 411, 85 S.Ct. 551, 13 L.Ed.2d 386 (1965). In <em>Whitney, </em>a national bank in Louisiana wished to expand its operations through a new bank, but state branch banking law prohibited operation of a branch beyond its home parish. The bank attempted to solve its problem by organizing a bank holding company. The existing bank was to be merged into the holding company, which, in turn, would organize two banks, one consisting of the existing bank and the other consisting of the new bank in the neighboring parish. The net result was that the stockholders of the original bank would own the holding company, which in turn would own and operate both the original and new banks. The Board approved the plan over the objection of competing banks. The competitors sought judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1848.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">Meanwhile, after the Board\u2019s approval of the plan, but before the filing of the suit in the court of appeals for review of the Board\u2019s decision, the competing banks filed a declaratory judgment action in the District of Columbia District Court. The competitors sought a declaration that the Comptroller had no power to grant the necessary certificate of authority for the proposed new bank because the bank holding company arrangement violated the BHCA. In that suit, both the district court and the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals held that the new bank would be an illegal branch of the original bank. Consequently, the Comptroller was enjoined from issuing the certificate of authority to the new bank. As a result, the Board\u2019s order was essentially overruled by the action against the Comptroller.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">The Supreme Court reversed, holding that since the BHCA gives the Board exclusive jurisdiction to approve bank holding company arrangements,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>view of Board action must be pursued solely as provided in the BHCA \u2014 in the appropriate court of appeals. The Court, therefore, ordered the suit involving the Comptroller dismissed.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The Court held not only that judicial review of Board action is available only as provided in the BHCA, but also that when the legality of a bank holding company\u2019s action is involved, any challenge must be brought initially before the Board. In other words, when Congress set up an exclusive judicial review procedure for Board determinations under the BHCA, it also evinced an intent that the Board always be the initial judge of BHCA issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-5\">Here the Court of Appeals held that the relationship of Whitney-Jefferson to Whitney-New Orleans would be that of a branch bank notwithstanding the fact that they were organized under a bank holding company arrangement. The District Court found the proposal barred by Louisiana Act No. 275 of 1962. We <em>believe that these are the very types of questions that Congress has committed to </em>the <em>Board, and we hold that the Board should make the determination of the plan\u2019s propriety in the first instance. </em>The soundness of this conclusion is especially evident when it is remembered that the Board has played a vital role in the development of the national banking laws, a role which makes its views of particular benefit to the courts where ultimately the validity of the arrangement will be tested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">379 U.S. at 421, 85 S.Ct. at 558 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">Thus, <em>if </em>there really was a BHCA issue in this case, it could only be brought before the Board, not as a challenge to the Comptroller\u2019s authority to approve the transaction. To hold otherwise would allow a decision regarding the Comptroller\u2019s authority to force a particular interpretation of the BHCA on the Board without the issue being presented in the first instance to the Board.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">For the foregoing reasons we find that the district court correctly dismissed both plaintiffs\u2019 original and amended complaints. The district court\u2019s judgment, therefore, is</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b769-6\">. At the time of this transaction, First Bank was named \u201cNational Bank of Wisconsin in LaCrosse.\u201d After the Midland transaction, the name was changed to \u201cFirst Bank (N.A.).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b769-7\">. According to the affidavit of Robert Bloom, First Deputy Comptroller of the Currency, the Comptroller\u2019s staff was advised of a tentative understanding between First Bank and Midland on July 20, 1977. On July 22, 1977, members of the Comptroller\u2019s staff met with representatives of plaintiff Marshall &amp; Ilsley Bank. Marshall &amp; Ilsley was given until Sunday, July 24, to advise the Comptroller if it had any interest in acquiring Midland. Marshall &amp; Ilsley alleges that the time permitted to consider the acquisition was so unreasonable as to render it a sham offer. The record before us does not allow us to decide the likelihood that Marshall &amp; Ilsley would or could have acquired Midland.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">Meanwhile, on July 23, 1977, Midland and First Bank signed the purchase and assumption agreement. First Bank was to receive all real and personal property and all intangible assets of Midland in exchange for assuming the deposit and other business liabilities of Midland plus paying approximately $13 million in cash. The agreement was contingent on receiving the Comptroller\u2019s approval, which was granted on July 23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b769-9\">. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 181 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-10\">Any association may go into liquidation and be closed by the vote of its shareholders owning two-thirds of its stock. If the liquidation is to be effected in whole or in part through the sale of any of its assets to and the assumption of the deposit liabilities by another bank, the purchase and sale agreement must also be approved by its shareholders owning two-thirds of its stock <em>unless an emergency exists and the Comptroller of the Currency specifically waives such requirement for shareholder approval.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-14\">(emphasis added)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b769-15\">. The Bank Merger Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1828(c), which deals with determination of the antitrust aspects of bank mergers, requires the Comptroller to follow certain procedures, including notice to and solicitation of reports from other agencies and the Attorney General, before allowing a national bank to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another national bank. The Bank Merger Act allows waiver of these requirements if the Comptroller \u201cfinds that it must act immediately in order to prevent the probable failure of one of the banks in-volved____\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1828(c)(3), (4), (6).

The two branch banking claims in plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint were contained in Count I of plaintiffs\u2019 original complaint. Count I of the original complaint was dismissed for lack of standing because plaintiffs failed to adequately allege injury in fact flowing from First Bank\u2019s acquisition of Midland, the operation of the former Midland facility as a branch bank, and the failure to provide plaintiffs with an opportunity to acquire Midland\u2019s operations. <em>See United States v.

The district court found, however, that competitor status, in the absence of \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d was insufficient to confer standing to challenge the Comptroller\u2019s decision.

This new provision would provide for a shareholder vote in such cases, except in emergencies....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-14\">S.Rep.

Other circuits and district courts which have explicitly considered the issue have found standing for competitors. <em>See, e. g., National State Bank of Elizabeth v.

In <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank of Wisconsin Rapids </em>v. <em>M &amp; I Peoples Bank of Coloma, </em>95 Wis.2d 303, 290 N.W.2d 321 (1980), the Wisconsin Supreme Court discussed the zone of interests of the \u201cbankless community\u201d exception to the prohibition against branch banking, \u00a7 221.04(l)(j)l. In <em>Coloma, </em>a competing bank challenged the approval of an application to establish a branch bank. Plaintiff claimed that the branch bank would be more than 25 miles from the home bank, in violation of \u00a7 221.04(l)(j)l. The court held that plaintiff had alleged sufficient injury, but held, without any discussion of the statutory scheme or legislative history, that \u201cthe requirement of sec. 221.04(l)(j)l, Stats., that a branch be no more than 25 miles from the home bank (if in a contiguous county), does not evince an intent to protect competitors.\" 290 N.W.2d at 327. The significance of the court's conclusion is questionable, since the court proceeded with an extensive analysis of plaintiffs standing pursuant to Wisconsin\u2019s quo warranto statute, Wis.Stat. \u00a7 294.04(2). The court held that the quo warranto statute explicitly granted competitor standing. Therefore, plaintiff had standing to bring the quo warranto action even in the absence of a statutory purpose to protect against competitive injury. In a footnote, the court acknowledged that its conclusion regarding standing to protect a competitive interest was contrary to many federal decisions, but declined to clarify the issue because standing clearly was proper under the quo warranto statute. 290 N.W.2d at 327 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-12\">Plaintiffs argue that the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d) authorizes plaintiffs\u2019 standing here just as the quo warranto statute did in <em>Coloma. </em>But the APA does not by itself confer standing. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702 confers standing on persons \u201cadversely affected or aggrieved by agency action <em>within the meaning of a relevant statute\" </em>(emphasis added). Thus, plaintiffs must be within the zone of interests protected by a \u201crelevant statute\u201d other than the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-13\">We find that the <em>Coloma </em>decision does not resolve the question of the zone of interests of the emergency branch banking statute. The bare statement in <em>Coloma </em>that the 25 mile limit does not evince an intent to protect competitors does not aid interpretation of other parts of the Wisconsin branch banking statutes. Therefore, we do not rely on <em>Coloma </em>in our discussion of the zone of interests protected by Wisconsin\u2019s emergency branch banking statute, \u00a7 221.04(1)0)2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b777-7\">. Although \u201cthe federal statute has incorporated by reference the limitations which state law places on branch banking activities by state banks,\u201d <em>First National Bank in Plant City v. Dickinson, </em>396 U.S. 122, 131, 90 S.Ct. 337, 342, 24 L.Ed.2d 312 (1969), the interpretation of those incorporated statutes is a matter of federal law. <em>First National Bank of Fairbanks v.

In support of their charges, plaintiffs allege that as of June, 1977, Midland had total assets of approximately $403,000,000, while First Bank had total deposits, as of December, 1976, of only $54,400,000. Plaintiffs argue that in view of the relative sizes of the banks, in addition to Midland\u2019s loan and capital problems, First Bank as an independent entity could not have acquired Midland or have provided the additional capital which the Comptroller had required Midland to obtain.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">First Bank System, on the other hand, as of June, 1977, had total assets in excess of $7,900,000,000. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of Midland, First Bank System unconditionally guaranteed the performance of all obligations of First Bank under the purchase agreement with Midland; First Bank System provided $10,000,000 of additional capital to First Bank by purchasing additional common stock of First Bank; First Bank changed its name from \u201cThe National Bank of Wisconsin in LaCrosse\u201d to reflect its affiliation with First Bank System; and defendants engaged in an extensive public advertising campaign describing the transaction in terms of Midland becoming \u201cpart of First Bank System.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b779-13\">. Section 1842(a)(4) constitutes an allocation of agency responsibility between the Comptroller and the Board. Acquisition of a bank by a bank subsidiary of a bank holding company must be approved by the Comptroller under the Bank Merger Act, while acquisition of a bank directly by a bank holding company must be approved by the Board under the Bank Holding Company Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b780-5\">. Any party who is a potential competitor has standing to challenge orders of the Board or to intervene in Board proceedings. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1850. Here, there is no Board order for plaintiffs to challenge. But the \u201cBoard order\u201d provision has been interpreted by the Board as permitting a competitor to petition the Board for a formal ruling on an allegation that a bank or bank holding company is violating the BHCA. <em>See </em>\u201cIn re American Security and Trust Company,\u201d 39 Fed.Reg. 40898 (Nov. 21, 1974). Therefore, plaintiffs had an avenue for presenting their argument before the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Plaintiffs argue that it would be futile to attempt to present the issue to the Board because the Board has consistently refused to review this type of transaction. In fact, Marshall &amp; Ilsley informally inquired about the Midland transaction in a letter to the Board. By letter dated August 24, 1977, the Board\u2019s Secretary responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-7\">Although the transition [sic] had the effect of expanding the banking assets of First Bank System, section 3(a)(4) of the Bank Holding Company Act permits a bank subsidiary of a bank holding company to acquire substantially all of the assets of another bank without Board approval under the Bank Holding Company Act. In this case the Comptroller of the Currency approved the transaction after considering essentially the same factors that would have been considered by the Board of Governors, had the transaction required an application under section 3 of the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-11\">We do not believe that the limitations on the expansion of interstate bank holding companies were violated by the acquisition in question. Section 3(d) of the Bank Holding Company Act prohibits expansion of multis-tate bank holding companies only under circumstances in which Board approval would be required to do so. As pointed out above, no application under the Bank Holding Company Act was necessary in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AW4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 App. at 25. But, the Board\u2019s refusal to take any action under the BHCA has no effect upon the district court\u2019s jurisdiction, or lack thereof, over an alleged BHCA claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b780-12\">. In <em>Whitney, </em>as here, both branch banking and BHCA issues were raised. Plaintiffs\u2019 chief contention was that the organization of the bank holding company was unlawful because it allowed the formation of the new bank as a virtual branch of the old bank, contrary to state law. Plaintiffs also argued that state law prohibited subsidiaries of bank holding companies from opening. The Court noted that, with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>spect to both arguments, plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cquarrel is in actuality not merely with the opening of the bank, but rather with its opening as a subsidiary of [the bank holding company].\u201d 379 U.S. at 418, 85 S.Ct. at 556.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b781-7\">. The Court also stayed the issuance of its judgment for 60 days in order to allow the parties to return to the Fifth Circuit, which had reviewed the Board\u2019s order pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1848, to secure a remand to the Board for further consideration of plaintiffs\u2019 claims. 379 U.S. at 425, 85 S.Ct. at 560.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b781-8\">. In some situations, it may be necessary for a court, on review of Comptroller action, to make an initial determination of whether a bank holding company is involved, so that Board involvement is appropriate. Although only the Board has jurisdiction to decide the merits of a BHCA issue, if the court finds that there is a substantial BHCA issue, it may be necessary to take action to preserve the issue for Board review. In <em>American Bank of Tulsa v. Smith, </em>503 F.2d 784 (10th Cir. 1974), the court issued a 60 day stay of the Comptroller\u2019s issuance of a new bank\u2019s certificate of authority to do business in order to allow the parties to present allegations of a BHCA violation to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">But in this case, the relief requested is divestiture by First Bank of the assets acquired from Midland almost four years ago, not merely a stay of the Comptroller\u2019s proposed action. Therefore, even if we found a substantial BHCA problem, it would be inappropriate to offer plaintiffs relief similar to that given in <em>American Bank of Tulsa </em>pending presentation of the BHCA issue to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-14\">We also note that even if some relief by way of a stay by the court was possible, plaintiffs have not raised a sufficiently substantial BHCA issue to warrant such \u201cextraordinary use of court process.\u201d <em>American Bank of Tulsa, </em>503 F.2d at 789. Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation of a BHCA violation is exactly like that rejected in <em>Leuthold v. Camp, </em>273 F.Supp. at 702 (D.Mont. 1967), <em>aff'd, </em>405 F.2d 499 (9th Cir. 1969), that \u201cbecause what is done in terms of real ownership is so like what is prohibited, that what is done likewise should be prohibited.\u201d It is true that defendants First Bank and First Bank System took advantage of a \u201cloophole\u201d in the Bank Holding Company Act. But taking advantage of the loophole is not, by itself, enough to justify piercing the corporate veil. As stated by the court in <em>Leuthold </em>v. <em>Camp, </em>273 F.Supp. at 702:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-15\">The Act itself makes formal and perhaps arbitrary distinctions between asset and stock acquisitions, between bank and bank holding company acquisitions. Under these conditions it is the court\u2019s opinion that it should not, by disregarding the corporate forms, abolish the distinctions that Congress created.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-16\"><em>See also South Dakota v.
