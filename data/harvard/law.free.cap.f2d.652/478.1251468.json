BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"AA4\">Appellant Walter (Hal) Metz stands convicted of a drug conspiracy offense, in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 846, and has been sentenced to twelve years imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He now appeals the trial court\u2019s denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>his motion for new trial, particularly without an evidentiary hearing. <em>See </em>F. R. Crim. P. 33. Metz alleges \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence in his motion for new trial consisting of exculpatory affidavits of Metz\u2019s convicted co-conspirators, in particular that of Ronald Schiller, who was tried jointly with Metz. Prior to trial, Metz filed a motion for severance claiming that Schiller, after acquittal or conviction, would testify in Metz\u2019s behalf. This severance motion briefly outlined that Schiller would testify that (i) he had no contact with Metz despite three visits to his house on December 14, 1977, the day of the bust and, (ii) neither Metz nor his wife ever agreed to or had any knowledge of, use or control over the cocaine. The motion was denied and neither Metz nor Schiller testified at their trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Evidence was introduced at their trial that (i) Schiller visited Metz\u2019s townhouse on three separate occasions on December 14, 1977, (ii) a Drug Enforcement Agent (DEA) saw Metz at the front door on one of these visits, (iii) on December 14, 1977, DEA agents had been negotiating with Schiller for the sale of forty pounds of cocaine, (iv) Schiller had told the agents that the cocaine was at a \u201cstash pad\u201d and Schiller had been seen at Metz\u2019s residence just prior to the time Schiller delivered a pound of cocaine to a DEA agent, and (v) physical evidence consisting of cocaine residue and weighing apparatus was found at Metz\u2019s residence in the kitchen and bathroom areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Subsequently, in two affidavits dated June 9,1980 and July 31, 1980, Schiller now states that he is willing to give certain detailed testimony which would exculpate Metz as a co-conspirator. According to Schiller\u2019s present affidavit, (i) Metz was not present at his townhouse when Schiller was there on December 14, 1977, (ii) Metz knew nothing about the cocaine deal, (iii) the origin of the cocaine was not Metz\u2019s townhouse, (iv) Schiller had carried the cocaine into Metz\u2019s house and had prepared it for sale there without Metz\u2019s knowledge and (v) the purpose of his three visits to the Mertz residence was to go Christmas shopping with Metz\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">A motion for new trial is entrusted to the discretion of the trial judge, <em>United States v. Riley, </em>544 F.2d 237 (5th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 932, 97 S.Ct. 1554, 51 L.Ed.2d 777 (1977); <em>Hudson v. United States, </em>387 F.2d 331 (5th Cir. 1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 876, 89 S.Ct. 172, 21 L.Ed.2d 147 (1968); is not subject to facile reversal, <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>327 U.S. 106, 66 S.Ct. 464, 90 L.Ed. 562 (1946); <em>Lyles v. United States, </em>279 F.2d 358 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>364 U.S. 922, 81 S.Ct. 288, 5 L.Ed.2d 262 (1960), and \u201cwill be reversed only where it is shown that the ruling was so clearly erroneous as to constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Antone, </em>603 F.2d 566, 568 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>559 F.2d 1370 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>433 F.2d 149 (5th Cir. 1970). A new trial, therefore, due to \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence, should be granted only with great caution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">In order to prevail on a motion for new trial, the defendant must satisfy <em>all </em>of the following four prerequisites:</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">(i) the evidence was unknown to the defendant at the time of trial and is in fact newly discovered, (ii) the evidence is material, (iii) the nature of the evidence is such that it would probably produce a different result at a new trial, and (iv) the recent discovery of the evidence is in no wise attributable to a previous lack of diligence on the part of the movant. <em>United States v. Geders, </em>625 F.2d 31, 32-33 (5th Cir. 1980), <em>quoting United States v. Antone, </em>603 F.2d at 568-69 (5th Cir. 1978). <em>See, </em>e. <em>g., United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number><em>States v. Hagerty, </em>561 F.2d 1197, 1200 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Cook, </em>546 F.2d 82 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Riley, </em>544 F.2d at 240; <em>Casey v. United States, </em>522 F.2d 206 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>United States v. Spivey, </em>508 F.2d 1061, 1063 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Rachal, </em>473 F.2d 1338, 1343, 1344 (5th Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. Jacquillon, </em>469 F.2d 380, 388 (5th Cir. 1972); <em>United States v. Stephenson, </em>448 F.2d 768 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">In the present case, it is apparent that Metz has not cleared the hurdle of showing that the evidence was unknown to him at the time of trial. In an affidavit dated August 15, 1980, attached to the present motion for a new trial, Metz\u2019s former trial counsel, William Moran, avers that the entire substance of Schiller\u2019s affidavit is consistent with what Schiller and/or Schiller\u2019s counsel had relayed to him prior to their trial in August 1978. Moran alleges that the specific details and facts in Schiller\u2019s affidavit were disclosed to him in confidence, but that he was precluded from revealing the information absent a granting of severance. Clearly, this evidence cannot be considered \u201cnewly discovered.\u201d Even though Schiller may have been unavailable to testify at their joint trial because he invoked the Fifth Amendment, Metz himself was not precluded from testifying in his own behalf that he (i) knew nothing of the conspiracy, (ii) was unaware of the presence of cocaine in his residence, and (iii) was not at his residence on December 14, 1977, at the time of Schiller\u2019s visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Appellant Metz attempts to persuade us that \u201cnewly available\u201d evidence is synonymous with \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence. He relies on the cases of <em>Newsom </em>v. <em>United States, </em>311 F.2d 74 (5th Cir. 1962), and <em>Ledet v. United States, </em>297 F.2d 737 (5th Cir. 1962), for the proposition that a previously silent co-defendant\u2019s post-conviction willingness to testify constitutes \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence warranting a new trial. A closer analysis of the facts and legal reasoning of these decisions does not warrant the adoption of such a blanket proposition. In <em>Newsom, </em>the co-conspirator who was tried jointly and convicted with the defendant, exculpated Newsom at the sentencing stage of trial rather than <em>after </em>final conviction. Additionally, the case presented problems with an impartial jury panel and the Court there characterized the proof of Newsom\u2019s guilty knowledge as \u201cextremely weak.\u201d <em>Newsom, </em>311 F.2d at 78. Similarly, in <em>Ledet, </em>the Court noted that \u201cit is not unusual for one of two convicted accomplices to assume the entire fault and thus exculpate his co-defendant by the filing of a recanting affidavit. It goes without saying that not every such recanting affidavit requires a new trial of the other defendant for whose benefit it is produced [cites omitted].\u201d <em>Ledet, </em>297 F.2d at 739. Nevertheless, the Court went on to find that in view of all the particular circumstances of that case, which involved ambiguous facts either completely exonerating or absolutely convicting the defendant, a new trial was warranted. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">We do not find the ambiguous fact situation of <em>Ledet </em>or the sentencing situation in <em>Newsom </em>present in our case which would warrant a new trial based on \u201cnewly discovered evidence.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Instead, we find that the Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for new trial since Metz had failed to satisfy one of the required elements. Further, the Court placed this \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence in its proper legal perspective. This Court has previously recognized that a trial judge may consider whether the testimony of a co-defendant is \u201ccontrary to his own penal interest.\u201d <em>United States v. Alejandero, </em>527 F.2d 423, 428 (5th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>844, 97 S.Ct. 124, 50 L.Ed.2d 115 (1977). In <em>Alejandero </em>the co-conspirator/defendant had been \u201ccaught red-handed\u201d and the Court stated: \u201cHis effort to absolve his co-defendant cost him nothing. It is not unusual under such circumstances for the obviously guilty defendant to try to assume the entire guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have a comparable situation here \u2014 Schiller has nothing to lose by now exculpating Metz.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Finally, we address Metz\u2019s contention that the Court erred in denying his motion without an evidentiary hearing. Metz argues that it was necessary for the Court to hear Schiller\u2019s testimony in order to assess the credibility of his exculpation of Metz, without such a hearing there was no factual basis, argues Metz, to support the Court\u2019s finding that Schiller\u2019s proffer was not credible. Generally, a motion for new trial may be decided upon affidavits without evidentiary hearings. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Dara, </em>429 F.2d 513, 514 (5th Cir. 1970); <em>Gurleski v. United States, </em>405 F.2d 253, 267 (5th Cir.), <em>cert.denied, </em>395 U.S. 981, 89 S.Ct. 2140, 23 L.Ed.2d 769 (1968). The action of the District Court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b558-17\">. The conviction was affirmed by the Court and certiorari was denied by the Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Metz, </em>608 F.2d 147 (5th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 821, 101 S.Ct. 80, 66 L.Ed.2d 24 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b559-7\">. Schiller\u2019s conviction was also affirmed in <em>United States v. Metz, </em>608 F.2d 147 (5th Cir. 1979), and he is presently serving eight years imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b559-8\">. We observe that the Second Circuit exercised a high degree of caution in a similar situation in <em>Jacobs v. United States, </em>475 F.2d 270, 286, n.33 (2d Cir. 1973), cert. <em>denied, </em>414 U.S. 821, 94 S.Ct. 131, 38 L.Ed.2d 53 (1973). \u201c[A] Court must exercise great caution in considering evidence to be \u2018newly discovered\u2019 when it existed all along and was unavailable only because a co-defendant, since convicted, had availed himself of his privilege not to testify.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b560-6\">. We also fail to find that the other affidavits which Metz has relied on constitute \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence or are material to the granting of a motion for new trial. Harold Oldham, another co-defendant, in his affidavit states that he did not know Walter or Wanda until they were charged with the offense. Likewise, the affidavit of co-defendant Paul Hodg-son states that he never heard of Walter or Wanda Metz until their trial. The statement of co-conspirator John Bland indicates that he never met with Metz. All of these co-conspirators pleaded guilty and received various sentencing terms.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
