For the reasons stated below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-20\">STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b972-21\">In September of 1972, Edna and Kenneth Ricards (\u201cthe Ricards\u201d) changed their residence from California to Oregon to secure a less expensive base of operations for their cattle ranching business. While residents of California, the Ricards acquired certain California real and personal property, which they held as community property under California law (\u201cthe California property\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-22\">About the time they moved to Oregon, the Ricards sold their California property and reinvested the bulk of the proceeds in Oregon real and personal property (hereinafter \u201cthe Oregon property\u201d). The Ricards took title to the Oregon realty as tenants by the entirety;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> they held the personalty as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>cotenants with a right of survivorship. Oregon is not a community property state.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Kenneth Ricards died on May 11, 1973, a resident of Klamath County, Oregon, and willed his interest in the couple\u2019s Oregon property to Mrs. Ricards. Mrs. Ricards was appointed executrix of Mr. Ricards\u2019 estate; in that capacity, Mrs. Ricards filed an Estate Tax Return on May 18, 1976. Pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2040 et seq.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the return excluded half of the value of the Ricards\u2019 interest in the Oregon property from Mr. Ricards\u2019 gross estate, on the ground that one-half of that property had been purchased with Mrs. Ricards\u2019 share of the proceeds from the sale of the California property. The propriety of that exclusion is not in dispute here. Mrs. Ricards also claimed a marital deduction under IRC \u00a7 2056 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for the half of the property which had been purchased with Mr. Ricards\u2019 share of the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) disallowed the marital deduction claimed under \u00a7 2056 and assessed the decedent\u2019s estate for unpaid federal estate taxes in the amount of $5,148, interest in the amount of $1,255, and delinquency penalties in the amount of $1,287, for a total of $7,690. Mrs. Ricards made an initial payment of $7,027 towards the assessment, leaving an unpaid balance of $663, and filed a claim for a refund of the amount paid. After the IRS denied her claim, she instituted this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-15\">The district court held that the estate was not entitled to claim the marital deduction under \u00a7 2056. The court reasoned that Mr. Ricards\u2019 half interest in the Oregon property, even though his separate property under Oregon law, retained its character \u00e1s community property for purposes of \u00a7 2056, and was therefore ineligible for the marital deduction. Because we conclude that the court\u2019s conclusion was correct, we affirm its judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-16\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b973-17\">Section 2056 was designed to remedy the disparity between the favorable tax treatment accorded marital property in community property states and the less favorable tax treatment accorded marital property in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>common law states.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Prior to the 1942 Revenue Act, the estate tax burden fell heavily on households in common law states in which the decedent was the primary wage earner. In community property states, the surviving spouse possessed a present, vested, one-half interest in the couple\u2019s community property, including income earned by either spouse during the marriage and property acquired with that income. Federal estate tax law recognized the state law characterization of the surviving spouse\u2019s vested, one-half property interest; hence, the surviving spouse\u2019s half-interest in the couple\u2019s community property was excluded from the value of the gross estate for federal estate tax purposes. By contrast, in common law states, the <em>entire </em>value of the adjusted gross estate passing to the surviving spouse was included in the decedent\u2019s taxable estate. The inequity created by the federal estate tax was substantial, since all of the marital property acquired with the deceased spouse\u2019s earnings were included in the taxable estate in common law states, while only half of that property was included in community property states. <em>See </em>S.Rep. 1013 at 26-28. Section 2056 attempts to equalize that disparity by providing a \u201cmarital deduction,\u201d which allows taxpayers in common law jurisdictions to transfer up to 50 percent of the value of their adjusted gross estate to their spouses tax free.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> *Community property is not eligible for the marital deduction under \u00a7 2056.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b974-11\">As appellees point out, the disallowance of the marital deduction for community property creates an estate tax incentive for married couples in community property states to convert their community property interests into separate property interests. By converting community property into separate property a surviving spouse would obtain half of the \u201cconverted\u201d community property as her or his separate property, and <em>also </em>claim the marital deduction on the decedent\u2019s half of the community property, which remains in the decedent\u2019s estate. <em>See Murphy v. CIR, </em>342 F.2d 356, 359-60 (9th Cir. 1965). The ineligibility of community property for the marital deduction could thus be circumvented. To avoid that result, \u00a7 2056(c)(2)(C)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> provides that sepa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>rate property held at death by the decedent which was \u201cconverted\u201d from community property \u201cby one transaction or a series of transactions\u201d is deemed to retain its character as community property for purposes of determining the marital deduction under \u00a7 2056. Thus, \u201cconverted\u201d community property, like actual community property, is ineligible for the marital deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">APPELLANT\u2019S CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"AZu\">Mrs. Ricards does not dispute that the marital deduction does not apply to community property or to \u201cconverted\u201d community property. Her argument, rather, is that her husband\u2019s share of the Oregon property should not be regarded as \u201cconverted\u201d community property under \u00a7 2056. She claims that the Treasury Regulation interpreting \u00a7 2056<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> draws a distinction between community property which is \u201cconverted into non-community property by a transaction or agreement between spouses <em>within the community property system itself\u201d </em>and community property which is transformed into separate property \u201csolely by operation of the applicable property law.\u201d We are told that because Oregon is not a community property state, the conversion of the proceeds from the sale of the Ricards\u2019 California community property into their Oregon non-community property was brought about \u201csolely by operation of the applicable Oregon property law.\u201d Hence, under \u00a7 2056 and its interpreting regulations, the decedent\u2019s share of the Oregon property must be treated as the decedent\u2019s separate property.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">Alternatively, Mrs. Ricards argues that the disallowance of a marital deduction on her husband\u2019s share of the Oregon property violates her right to equal protection of the laws under the fifth amendment. Both of these contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b975-11\">In our view, the district court correctly found that the Oregon property must be regarded as community property for purposes of \u00a7 2056.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-12\">First, the language of \u00a7 2056 is unequivocal: Where community property is \u201cconverted\u201d by \u201cone transaction or a series of transactions\u201d into separate property, the separate property is treated as community property for purposes of the marital deduction. Moreover, \u201c \u2018Conversion\u2019 [in \u00a7 2056(c)(2)(C)] includes <em>any </em>transaction or agreement which transforms property from a community status into a non-community status.\u201d (Emphasis added), Treas.Reg. 20.-2056(c)(2)-(e). <em>See </em>S.Rep. 1013 (Part 2) at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-13\">The sale and purchase of property involved in this case clearly constituted a \u201ctransaction or series of transactions\u201d, as that term is ordinarily understood, and as it is presumably used in \u00a7 2056(c)(2)(C).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Ricards sold their California property and purchased property in Oregon with the sale\u2019s proceeds. The sale and subsequent purchase altered the legal relationship between buyer and seller in each case. The sale and purchase also altered the legal relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Ricards, as it altered the manner in which they held title to their jointly held property. The sale and subsequent purchase were voluntarily undertaken by the Ricards in the context of conducting and enhancing their farm business. These actions bear all the indicia of \u201ctransactions\u201d as that word is commonly understood. Thus, because the Oregon property was converted from community property into separate property through a \u201cseries of transactions,\u201d it must be treated as community property for purposes of \u00a7 2056.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>Nevertheless, Mrs. Ricards suggests that only conversions of property which occur within the community property system itself are within the purview of \u00a7 2056(c)(2)(C). Appellant cites the following portion of Treasury Regulation 20.-2056(c)-2(e) in support of her position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b976-4\">(e) The characteristics of property which acquired a non-community instead of a community status by reason of an agreement (whether antenuptial or post-nuptial) are such that section 2056(c)(2)(C) classifies the property as community property of the decedent and his surviving spouse in the computation of the \u201cadjusted gross estate.\u201d <em>In distinguishing property which thus acquired a non-community status from property which acquired such a status solely by operation of the applicable property law, section 2056(c)(2)(C) refers to the former category of property as \u201cseparate property\u201d acquired as a result of a conversion of \u201cproperty held as such community property.\u201d </em>As used in section 2056(c)(2)(C), the phrase, \u201cproperty held as such community property\u201d is used to denote the body of property comprehended within the community property system. .. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">Under the regulation, separate property which acquires that status \u201csolely by operation of the applicable property law\u201d is considered separate property for purposes of \u00a7 2056. According to appellant, this means that where \u201cthe conversion of the community property into non-community property is by the law of a state <em>which is not within the community property system,\u201d </em>the property in question is not considered \u201cconverted\u201d community property for purposes of \u00a7 2056. In our view, appellant\u2019s interpretation of the regulation is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">First, appellant\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 2056 would create a substantial gap in Congress\u2019 scheme to equalize the estate tax burden on taxpayers in community property and non-community property states. Were we to uphold appellant\u2019s position, taxpayers with community property interests could circumvent the congressional scheme simply by exchanging their community property for separate property in non-community property states. We cannot judicially create such a substantial exception to \u00a7 2056, particularly in light of the Congress\u2019 clearly expressed intent to treat <em>any </em>transformation of community property into separate property as a \u201cconversion\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2056. <em>See </em>S.Rep. 1013 (Part 2) at 21. <em>See generally Muniz v. Hoffman, </em>422 U.S. 454, 469 (1975); <em>Tidewater Oil Company v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 151, 167-68 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">Secondly, appellant\u2019s interpretation is at odds with certain revenue rulings dealing with \u00a7 2056. These revenue rulings, while not dispositive, are nevertheless entitled to consideration in our assessment of whether separate property acquired in a common law state with community property assets is \u201cconverted\u201d community property for purposes of \u00a7 2056.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Under Revenue Ruling 78-391, separate property purchased in a common law state with the proceeds from the sale of community property in a community property state should be deemed to be \u201cconverted\u201d community property, even though the laws of the common-law state regard the property as separate property.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Similarly, Revenue Ruling 68-80 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>holds that community property which is exchanged for property in a common law state is considered \u201cconverted\u201d community property for purposes of \u00a7 2056.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See also Revenue Ruling 67-171, 1967-1 C.B. 274 (1967). These revenue rulings thus also contradict appellant\u2019s argument that only \u201cconversions\u201d of community property occurring within the community property system are within the purview of \u00a7 2056(c)(2)(C).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Finally, appellant argues that \u00a7 2056(cX2)(C) denies her equal protection of the laws. According to appellant, \u00a7 2056 disallows the marital deduction on the separate property willed to her by her husband because it is \u201cconverted\u201d community property, yet allows that same deduction for all other separate property. Appellant suggests that the statute\u2019s unequal treatment of these different categories of separate property invidiously discriminates against taxpayers who inherit \u201cconverted\u201d community property. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">We recognize that the marital deduction does not completely succeed in equalizing the estate tax burden between residents in community property and non-community property states. However, so long as the statute\u2019s classificatory scheme has a rational basis, we must uphold its validity. <em>See United States v. Maryland Savings-Share Insurance Corp., </em>400 U.S. 4, 6, 91 S.Ct. 16, 17, 27 L.Ed.2d 4 (1970).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In this case, the legislative history of \u00a7 2056 affirmatively discloses that Congress had a valid and rational basis for disallowing the marital deduction for both community property and \u201cconverted\u201d community property.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>lant here offered no evidence to support her claim of invidious discrimination beyond the mere fact that the statute treats the two classes of separate property differently. Certainly on the record before us, there is no evidence that the statute\u2019s classificatory scheme is arbitrary and irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b972-13\">. In a community property system, both wife and husband share equally in property acquired as a result of the labor or industry of either during the marriage. Each spouse, therefore, has a present, vested, one-half interest in any income earned by either spouse during marriage, as well as in any property acquired with those earnings. <em>See </em>M. Vaughn, <em>The Policy of Community Property and Inter-Spousal Transactions, </em>19 Baylor L.Rev. 20, 26, 38 (1967) [hereinafter \u201cVaughn\u201d], J. Cribbett, <em>Principles of the Law of Property </em>88-89 (1962).

Some of the inequities created by the marital deduction are outlined in <em>Anderson, The Marital Deduction and Equalization under the Federal Estate and Gift Taxes Between Common Law and Community Property States, </em>54 Mich.L.Rev. 1087 (1956). In particular, \u201conly in the \u2018classic case,\u2019 that is, where the husband owns all the property at common law and he dies first, is equalization achieved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1099. The legislative history of \u00a7 2056 suggests that Congress itself recognized this inequity when the marital deduction was enacted in 1948. <em>See S.Rep. 1013 at 22, </em>26.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b977-11\">. At the time \u00a7 2056 was enacted, Congress assumed that the husband was the sole or primary wage earner in the great majority of households. For example, in discussing the necessity for amending the estate and gift tax portion of the Tax Code, the Senate Report noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-12\">The basic differences between property rights in community-property and non-community-property States have also resulted in geographical inequalities in the effect of the estate and gift taxes. In community-property States husbands and wives have an undivided one-half interest in the community property. Prior to 1942, upon the death of a spouse his one-half interest in the community property, over which he had the power of testamentary disposition, was subject to the estate tax. Similarly, a gift of community property was taxable as though one-half of the value was the gift of the husband and one-half the gift of the wife. On the other hand, in common-law States neither spouse had an undivided interest in the property of the other spouse. Since both estate and gift taxes have sharply progressive rates, with large specific exemptions, the consequence was a substantially lower tax on transfers in community-property States than on transfers of similar size in common-law States, <em>where the usual case was that practically all the wealth of the married couple was the property of the husband.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b977-13\">S.Rep. 1013 at 26, U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1948 at 1188 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>Similarly, in discussing the need for equalizing the income tax burden between community property and common law property states, the Senate Report declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-7\">Under existing law the treatment accorded families earning the same amount of income is very different if they happen to live in States using the community-property system or in States which use common law. <em>Chief\u00edy this is due to the </em>fact that <em>under the community-property system the earnings of a married couple are considered to be one-half the property of each. Income arising out of an accumulation which took place during the marriage is divided in the same manner, and in some community-property States the same division is made of income from assets which are the separate property of one of the spouses. No similar division takes place under common law. The earnings of the husband are his own and taxed to him. The income from his property is his income and is taxed as such.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-8\">Since the rates applied under the income tax are steeply progressive, the same family income divided in two halves by community-property law will be taxed far less severely than in a common-law State where the whole income is apt to be taxed to one spouse. <em>The difference is greatest when the entire earnings of the couple in the common-law State are received by one spouse, </em>and when, under community-property law, none of the income is the \u201cseparate\u201d income of either spouse. Table XIII compares the tax due under these assumptions [i. e., where the husband is the sole wage earner] in community-property and common-law States under present law for incomes of various sizes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-9\">This table shows that the difference between the tax due in community-property and common-law States appears as soon as the income of the couple rises above the first tax bracket, i. e., as soon as the rates become progressive. On a percentage basis the difference increases as the income grows larger. At $10,000 the couple in the common-law State pays a tax which is nearly 10 per cent greater than that paid in the community-property State. At $25,000 the tax in the common-law State is about 41 per cent larger. Thereafter, the percentage begins to decline as the marginal rate approaches the 85.5 per cent maximum. However, even on an income of $150,000 the tax in the common-law State is more than 21 per cent larger than that in the community-property State. At the opposite extreme is the case where in the common-law State incomes of the two spouses are approximately equal. Here, the results under common law and community-property would be similar. <em>However, in the great majority of cases the income of one spouse predominates.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b978-13\">S.Rep. 1013 at 22, U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1948 at 1184 (emphasis added; footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-14\">While Congress\u2019 assumption concerning the percentage of households with two spouses working may have been correct in 1948, it is of questionable validity in 1981. Statistical information compiled by the Bureau of Census &amp; the Department of Labor indicates that the percentage of households with two working spouses was no greater than 22 percent in 1948. <em>See e. g., </em>Bureau of the Census, U. S. Department of Labor, Social Indicators III \u2014 Selected Data on Social Conditions and Trends in the United States, 355-56 (1980) (hereinafter \u201cSocial Indicators III\u201d); U.S. Department of Labor and U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, Employment &amp; Training Report of the President 1980 276-82 (1980) (hereinafter \u201c1980 Training Report of the President\u201d); U.S. Bureau of the Census, U.S. Census of Population: 1950, Vol. II, Part 1, 1-255 \u2014 57 (1953). That percentage had risen to at least 43.7 percent in 1979. <em>See </em>Social Indicators III, <em>supra, </em>at 280. At least one report fixes the 1979 percentage at 55.6 percent. <em>See </em>1980 Training Report of the President, <em>supra </em>at 356. On the limited record presented to us in this case, however, we cannot say that the marital deduction is without rational foundation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
