The Secretary claims the current notice and \u201cpaper hearing\u201d provided by his regulations meet constitutional due process requirements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellants contend, however, that nothing less than a full, formal, oral eviden-tiary hearing, identical to those provided for disputes concerning program benefits of more than $100, will satisfy constitutional due process guarantees. The district court found in favor of the Secretary. 466 F.Supp. 1317. We hold, however, that due process in such disputes requires a procedure that lies somewhere between the two extremes presented by the parties. While we do not find that Congress\u2019 elimination of formal hearing<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> rights for disputes over Medicare benefits of less than $100 renders the Medicare Act (\u201cAct\u201d) itself unconstitutional, we do find that the appellee Secretary of Health and Human Services\u2019 interpretation of the Act presently provides insufficient protection of appellants\u2019 due process rights. We accordingly reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case to it to allow the court, with the assistance of the Secretary and the plaintiffs, to formulate appropriate revisions of the affected regulations which satisfy due process considerations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>DESCRIPTION OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">In 1965, Congress passed the Medicare Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395 <em>et seq., </em>to help assure adequate health care for the elderly. The legislation set up an insurance program to provide reimbursement for the costs of much of the medical care of the aged. Insurance coverage of hospitalization costs, \u201cPart A\u201d of the Act, is funded out of Social Security taxes. \u201cPart B,\u201d in contrast, is a voluntary supplemental insurance program intended to cover most other health costs, for which a beneficiary pays a monthly premium. The $100 \u201camount in controversy\u201d limitation on hearing rights challenged here applies to disputes arising under both parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The determination and review procedures for claims arising under the two parts of the Act are similar. Both are administered primarily through non-governmental organizations, usually insurance companies, pursuant to contracts with the Department.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Claims for payment or reimbursement are submitted to the carrier, which makes an initial determination as to the claim and sends a notice of its action together with any payment to the claimant. If the claimant is dissatisfied, a request for review may be made,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and a different employee of the carrier will examine the determination, together with any additional information the claimant may wish to submit, and notify the claimant of the decision on redetermination.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">For any claimant whose disagreement with the carrier at this stage does not amount to more than $100,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that is the end of the process, according to the Secretary\u2019s procedures. There is no further review, and there is at no time an opportunity to present one\u2019s case personally to the decisionmaker. If the amount in controversy is <em>more </em>than $100, the claimant may request a hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Finally, judicial review is availa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>ble for Part A disputes over $1000; no such review is provided for when the claim arises under Part B.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">THE STATUTE AND THE LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A63\">The dispute resolution procedures are an administrative scheme based upon the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the Medicare Act. The statutes provide, in pertinent part: (1) for use of private carriers to handle the bulk of the administration of the program; (2) for the $100 amount in controversy limitation on formal hearings;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and (3) for the $1000 threshold for judicial review in Part A claims. The statutes do not mandate that any particular procedures be followed when resolving disputes of less than $100; rather, the Medicare statute itself bars only formal hearings, <em>see </em>note 15 <em>supra, </em>and poses no absolute statutory barrier to the provision of informal hearing procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">As the Medicare bill was first reported out of the House Committee on Ways and Means in 1965, there would have been a $1000 limitation on both formal hearing rights and judicial review, but only as to Part A claims. H.R.Rep.No. 213, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 47 (1965).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> When the bill reached the Senate, Senator Edward Kennedy proposed that the amount in controversy requirement be reduced to $100. He emphasized the unprecedented nature of the limitation, the significance of the amounts involved to aged individuals attempting to get by on Social Security benefits and savings, and the value of hearings and appeals in attaining accurate and consistent administration of the new program.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> His amendment was adopted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>the Senate, and in Conference Committee a compromise was struck, providing for hearings if the amount in controversy was $100 or more, and judicial review for disputes of $1000 or more.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">At the time, there were no comparable limitations on Part B claims. So matters stood until 1972, when Congress amended the Act substantially, and in the process extended the limitation on hearings to Part B claims expressly to eliminate the expense and inconvenience of a <em>formal hearing </em>when the amount in controversy is small. As explained by the Senate Finance Committee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">Experience under the program indicates that the holding of a <em>full fair hearing </em>is unwarranted in cases where the amount in controversy is relatively small. Carriers have reported cases involving $5 and $10 claims for which the cost of holding a <em>fair hearing </em>has exceeded $100. Approximately 45 percent of the hearings held since the beginning of the program have involved an amount less than $100. Further regulations require carriers to have a reconsideration review of all denied claims. Such review involves different claims personnel than those who acted on the original claim and should be sufficient protection in small claims cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUe\">S.Rep.No. 1230, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 213 (1972) (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-14\">As it now stands, review of Part A claims is governed by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff(b) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-15\">(1) Any individual dissatisfied with any determination under subsection (a) of this section as to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-16\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-17\">(C) the amount of benefits under Part A of this subchapter (including a determination where such amount is determined to be zero)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-18\">shall be entitled to a hearing thereon . . . and to judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s final decision after such hearing. .. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (C) ... a hearing shall not be available to an individual by reason of such subparagraph (C) if the amount in controversy is less than $100; nor shall judicial review be available to an individual by reason of such subparagraph (C) if the amount in controversy is less than $1000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Administration of benefits under Part B is largely entrusted to the private carriers. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395u(b)(3)(C) provides that the contract between the Secretary and the carrier must require the carrier to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8M\">establish and maintain procedures pursuant to which an individual enrolled under this part will be granted an opportunity for a fair hearing by the carrier, in any case where the amount in controversy is $100 or more ... when the amount of such payment is in controversy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-13\">In neither case does the statute explicitly detail what process is due those persons with disputes concerning benefits of less than $100. However, the Secretary does not argue here that the intent of the statute is to eliminate all rights of these people to any process.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Rather, he argues that the statute reduces the process due to the minimum constitutional requirements for due process. Therefore, the question is whether the Secretary\u2019s current regulations implementing those statutory provisions provide for these minimum requirements; to the extent they do not, the regulations must be deemed to violate the intent of the law and must be overturned.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>THE CASE HISTORIES OF THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">A. <em>Plaintiff Patino</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Wilma Patino suffers from rheumatoid arthritis. In February of 1976, she fell on ice, and had to undergo a four-month series of treatments, 13 in all, for which she was billed $10 per visit. Her first application for Medicare benefits covered eleven of those treatments; her second covered the final two.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">A few weeks after submitting her claims she received partial payment on her first application. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, the carrier for her region, approved payment in full for the first seven of her treatments, and wholly disallowed payments for the next four, with the noted explanation that \u201cMedicare does not pay for: This many services for your condition.\u201d Shortly thereafter, she received her second communication from Nationwide concerning her second application covering her final two treatments. As an example of the type of notice received by Medicare beneficiaries, we set out in the margin the form utilized by Nationwide in explaining its action to Patino.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> On her second submission, Nationwide <em>approved </em>payment for the services rendered, but only in the amount of $8.25 per treatment. She was directed to \u201cItem 5 on back\u201d for an explanation of why she had not received full compensation. According to Item 5, a preprinted paragraph on the back of the form, the carrier had determined <em>either </em>that her doctor did not customarily charge that much, <em>or </em>that the $10 charge was greater than most area physicians would have charged. The form does not specify which was the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">On the back of the form, additional information was provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Patino sought review, submitting a letter from her doctor that the number of treatments was not excessive, considering her age and condition, but Nationwide reaffirmed its initial determination. On her request for a hearing, she was notified by letter that since, after subtracting the deductible, the amount in controversy was only $32,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> she had no right to a hearing, and the determination on review was final. This letter dealt only with her hearing rights (or, more accurately, the lack thereof); it gave no information regarding the reasons for the carrier\u2019s denial of her underlying claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">B. <em>Plaintiff Reiser</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">In 1976, Louis Reiser underwent surgery, and received a bill from the anesthesiologist for $270. Reiser submitted his claim to his regional carrier, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of New York, which allowed only $170 of his claim. Reiser requested review and submitted additional documentation from the hospital, but Blue Cross confirmed its earli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>er reduction of the bill, notifying Reiser that the doctor\u2019s \u201ccustomary fee\u201d was $170. Reiser\u2019s subsequent request for a hearing was denied, again by a letter similar to that received by Patino, because the amount in controversy, after subtracting the deductible, was $80.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">C. <em>Plaintiff Rothfeld</em></p>\n<p id=\"AdK\">In 1975, Jack Rothfeld, suffering from glaucoma and cataracts, was treated by two physicians at a clinic in Boston. He received two bills, in the amounts of $140 and $150. The services were covered by his Part B supplemental Medicare policy, so he submitted his claim for reimbursement to Blue Shield of Massachusetts, the Medicare carrier for his region.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">A few weeks later, Rothfeld received a form, nearly identical to the one received by Patino, entitled \u201cExplanation of Medicare Benefits.\u201d Apparently assuming that the treatment had been for only one eye, Blue Shield paid only $140 of his $290 claim. The \u201cexplanation\u201d for this determination was limited to the same \u201cItem 5\u201d on the back of the form indicating that the bills submitted by Rothfeld were either higher than his doctor\u2019s customary fee, or higher than the fees usually charged in the area for similar services.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">Upon Rothfeld\u2019s request for review, in which he pointed out that his treatment covered both eyes, Blue Shield adjusted his claim by $50. It sent him a second Explanation of Medicare Benefits form indicating the upward adjustment in benefits made; the form did not indicate in any way the reason for the denial of the balance of Rothfeld\u2019s claim. He requested a hearing as to whether the denial of the balance of his claim was proper but, since the amount in controversy was not $100, Blue Shield sent him a letter denying his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES AND THE OPINION OF THE DISTRICT COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">We are thus presented with a case in which the Government has taken <em>final adjud</em>icatory<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> action against the plaintiffs, de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>termining admitted property rights against them, without at any time in the process providing them more than the sketchiest of notice and a \u201cpaper hearing\u201d conducted by carrier employees. In the cases presented, none of the plaintiffs received any precise indication as to why his or her claim was being denied prior to the final decision on review. The positions of the parties are simply stated. The plaintiffs argue that the historical core of due process, adequate notice and the right to a hearing, are fundamental procedural rights which cannot be denied, absent emergency, by the Government in <em>any </em>case when a property or liberty interest which is not <em>de minimis </em>is at stake.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The timing of these rights and additional procedural protections to which an individual might be entitled may vary substantially depending on the stake involved and the Government\u2019s interest in efficient, inexpensive administration, but those core procedural rights of notice and an oral hearing, however informally provided, may not be wholly denied.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">In addition the plaintiffs argue that the notice provided to individual claimants is so cryptic, and the information it contains so unhelpful, that it is virtually impossible effectively to gather documentary evidence to submit in writing in order to rebut the carrier\u2019s initial determination. Furthermore, individuals of advanced age who are confused about their benefits are unlikely to be able to prepare an effective written submission though they might be fully capable of explaining their concerns in person, given a chance to talk to the decisionmaker. Finally, the plaintiffs point out that approximately 50 percent of the formal hearings that are held on claims over $100 result in adjustments of benefits in the claimant\u2019s favor; therefore, they contend, it is clear that a substantial number of errors remain, even after the redetermination procedure, which would be corrected by further oral hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">The Secretary agrees that due process dictates the procedures he must follow in making his determinations, but argues that the right to any particular procedural safeguard is determined by the \u201cflexible\u201d due process test enunciated by the Supreme Court in <em>Mathews v. Eidridge.</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This test calls for a weighing and balancing of three factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-10\">First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">424 U.S. at 335, 96 S.Ct. at 903. When judged by this test, the Secretary contends, the value of oral hearings in this situation is outweighed by their costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The Secretary disputes the alleged inadequacy of the notice, pointing out that the form includes a telephone number to call if the claimant has a problem or question. The Secretary' does not argue, however, that the claimant is given any right to speak directly with a decisionmaker about his claim; indeed, the record belies any such contention.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The confusion that can be engendered by statistics<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> was demonstrated when the Secretary responded to plaintiff\u2019s statistical argument with the fact that the \u201creversal rate\u201d is less than one-tenth of 1 percent. This figure was arrived at by comparing the number of reversals to the total number of all denials of benefits, over 15 million in 1976 alone. This, he claims, shows an impressive record of accuracy and no need for further procedural safeguards. The Secretary also contends that most errors are coding or processing errors, not the sort of factual disputes which a hearing is best suited to correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">The district court\u2019s analysis essentially followed the position taken by the Secretary. First noting that due process is not a fixed technical concept, but is a flexible notion of fair procedure that requires such protections as the particular situation demands, the court went on to conclude that even though the law was clear that \u201csome kind of hearing is required at some time\u201d before a person can be finally deprived of a property interest, that \u201chearing\u201d need not be an \u201coral, evidentiary proceeding\u201d but could be simply an opportunity to submit written material. To decide whether this limited \u201cpaper hearing\u201d was sufficient in this case, the court applied the <em>Eldridge </em>balancing test.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">It concluded first that while there might be \u201cgenuine hardship\u201d in some cases, the amounts of money involved are not large and the Medicare program is not based on financial need. Therefore, as a general matter the private interest at stake is not substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">As for the \u201crisk of erroneous deprivation\u201d and value of additional procedural safeguards, the second factor in the <em>Eldridge </em>test, the district judge agreed with the positions advanced by the Secretary. He observed that \u201cwitness credibility and veracity\u201d are rarely in issue in Medicare proceedings, and concluded that hearings would therefore serve little purpose. He agreed that the Secretary\u2019s method of calculating the risk of error more accurately reflected the adequacy of the protection offered by the reconsideration process, and regarded the form of notice as at least clear enough to enable a dissatisfied claimant to pursue the matter further.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-14\">The district court finally turned to the governmental interests at stake. The estimates of the cost of the present formal evidentiary hearing provided for over-$100 disputes varied from a low of $196 for a Part B hearing to a high of $405 for a Part A hearing. Furthermore, it was assumed that providing <em>full evidentiary hearings </em>for small claims would nearly double the number of hearings held.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Although the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>did not consider the possibility of oral hearings that do not involve full evidentiary proceedings, or the possibility that better written notice might greatly improve the efficacy of paper hearings, it nevertheless concluded that \u201cit is clear that the aggregate additional cost in terms of money and administrative burden in implementing hearings for all claims would be substantial.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">In sum, the district court agreed with the Secretary that the \u201cspeculative benefit of a right to an oral, evidentiary hearing to persons with Medicare claims of less than $100 is outweighed by the cost to the public of requiring the additional procedural safeguard.\u201d Mem.Op. at 17; J.A. 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">THE LEGAL UNDERPINNINGS</p>\n<p id=\"Aq2\">The underlying dispute in this case is over the definition of the phrase \u201cnotice and hearing.\u201d The Secretary does not dispute, and indeed could not dispute, that the claimants here have the right to \u201cnotice and hearing\u201d on their claims, Brief for Appellee at 21; the principle is so ingrained in our notion of due process that it was described most recently by the Supreme Court as a \u201cgeneral due process maxim.\u201d <em>O\u2019Bannon v. Town Court Nursing Center, </em>447 U.S. 773, 780, 100 S.Ct. 2467, 2473, 65 L.Ed.2d 506 (1980).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Indeed, the Secretary cites for us the much-quoted language of <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 557-58, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 2975-2976, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), pointing out that \u201csome kind of hearing is required at some time before a person is finally deprived of his property interests.\u201d The Secretary contends, however, that the Explanation of Medicare Benefits (\u201cEOMB\u201d) form, together with the opportunity to submit written materials, constitute an adequate \u201copportunity to be heard.\u201d The problem is thus definitional. When the Supreme Court has said, so emphatically and repeatedly, that \u201csome kind of hearing\u201d is required before a person may be finally deprived of a property interest, did it contemplate that this sort of abbreviated notice and hearing would suffice in these circumstances? We conclude that it did not. While we do not believe the plaintiffs are entitled to the same \u201cfull fair hearing\u201d provided for those with disputes of over $100, we find that due process requires a procedure that provides more of an opportunity to be heard than the present notice and paper hearing procedures allow. For this reason, we disagree with the balance reached by the district court under the <em>El-dridge </em>test, and are accordingly compelled to reverse its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>A. <em>The Value of Oral Hearings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The appellants\u2019 major criticism of the Secretary\u2019s current procedures is their failure to include any opportunity for an oral hearing. While we do not rule that the Secretary must always provide an oral hearing in under-$100 cases in order to meet due process requirements, we do find that the district court, and the agency, failed properly to weigh the interests to be balanced or properly to acknowledge the full extent of the precedential and policy reasons for providing better notice and/or some form of oral hearing in Medicare disputes, including situations like those involving some of the named plaintiffs here. They also failed to recognize the benefits and the minimal costs of <em>informal </em>oral hearings and they seriously underestimated the inadequacy of the notice here to inform a claimant why benefits were being denied. These failings taken together necessarily undercut the correctness of the court\u2019s overall balance and require its reexamination of what procedures are necessary to assure adequate notice and a genuine opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">1. <em>Due Process Precedents</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">To date, the Supreme Court has never expressly approved as meeting due process hearing requirements a procedure in which a claimant has been finally deprived of the right to government benefits without affording that individual an opportunity to appeal personally and orally to the decision-maker. On the other hand, it must be recognized that claimants have been denied through suspensions the value of the use of such benefits for varying periods of time pending a final decision without opportunity for oral exchange. In this way the Court has in effect permitted a decision to be made without an oral hearing as to which party should pay the costs of delay inherent in the decision-making process.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">In <em>Londoner v. City of Denver, </em>210 U.S. 373, 28 S.Ct. 708, 52 L.Ed. 1103 (1908), for example, the Court explicitly rejected the proposition that an opportunity to submit written comments satisfied the due process requirement of a hearing before tax assessments were finalized as to individual property owners. More recently in <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970),<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> the Court disapproved as inadequate due process a \u201cpaper review\u201d prior to suspension of welfare benefits pending a full evidentiary hearing on the merits of their permanent termination. The Court pointed out some of the underlying practical reasons for insisting on oral process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-11\">Written submissions are an unrealistic option for most recipients, who lack the educational attainment necessary to write effectively and who cannot obtain professional assistance. Moreover, written submissions do not afford the flexibility of oral presentations; they do not permit the recipient to mold his argument to the issues the decision maker appears to regard as important.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 269, 90 S.Ct. at 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">Nonetheless, the <em>Eldridge </em>Court in ruling out the necessity for an oral hearing prior to suspension of disability benefits acknowledged that at least in some situations, written hearing procedures can be structured to overcome the problems set out in <em>Goldberg. See </em>424 U.S. at 345-46, 96 S.Ct. at 907-908. At the same time, the <em>Eldridge </em>Court did not exclude the possibility that in some situations, or without the presence of compensating safeguards, an oral hearing might be a due process requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-14\">Moreover, in several recent decisions discussing hearing rights in an adjudicatory proceeding, the Court found that circumstances warranted some type of oral hearing. For example, <em>Memphis Light, Gas &amp; </em>Water <em>Div. v. Craft, </em>436 U.S. 1, 98 S.Ct. 1554, 56 L.Ed.2d 30 (1978), involved a challenge to a municipal utility\u2019s procedure for terminating service for non-payment of bills. The Court held that the \u201chearing\u201d mandated by due process required, at a minimum, an \u201copportunity for a meeting with a responsible employee empowered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>resolve the dispute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18, 98 S.Ct. at 1565. <em>Goss v. Lopez, </em>419 U.S. 565, 95 S.Ct. 729, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976), required that before suspending a student for alleged misconduct, \u201cthe student be given oral or written notice of the charges against him and, if he denies them, an explanation of the evidence the authorities have and an opportunity to present his side of the story.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 581, 95 S.Ct. at 740. The Court emphasized that no elaborate, formal procedure was required: \u201cIn the great majority of cases the disciplinarian may informally discuss the alleged misconduct with the student minutes after it has occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582, 95 S.Ct. at 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Very recently, in <em>Parham v. J. R., </em>442 U.S. 584, 99 S.Ct. 2493, 61 L.Ed.2d 101 (1979), the Court refused to conclude that a formal, adversary hearing was required in order to institutionalize a child for mental health care but nevertheless held that there must be a personal interview with the child.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQUi\">[Sjome kind of inquiry should be made by a \u201cneutral factfinder\u201d to determine whether the statutory requirements for admission are satisfied.

Yamasaki, </em>442 U.S. 682, 99 S.Ct. 2545, 61 L.Ed.2d 176 (1979), in which Social Security recipients challenged the Secretary\u2019s reliance upon non-oral hearing procedures pri- or to undertaking recoupment measures (consisting of reductions in future benefits) for past overpayments of Social Security and disability benefits. Full evidentiary hearings were available only after the recoupment measures were instituted. The relevant statute, \u00a7 204(b) of the Social Security Act, commanded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqQ\">there shall be no adjustment of payments to, or recovery by the United States from, any person who is without fault if such adjustment or recovery would defeat the purpose of this subchapter or would be against equity and good conscience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The Secretary provided written review procedures both for initial adverse overpayment and recoupment decisions. Though the Court upheld the paper review of the overpayment decisions, describing them as \u201crelatively straightforward matters of computation . . . based on earnings reports [the claimants] themselves submitted,\u201d 442 U.S. at 696, 99 S.Ct. at 2555, the Court pointed out that \u201cwritten review hardly seems sufficient to discharge the Secretary\u2019s statutory duty to make an accurate determination of waiver under \u00a7 204(b) . . . [because it] \u2018. . . is inherently subject to factual determination and adversarial input.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 696, 99 S.Ct. at 2555 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">The list could go on; as we pointed out above, the Supreme Court has thus far not expressly upheld<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> any process finally dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>posing of a liberty or property claim<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> that provided no opportunity for an oral personal exchange at any point in the process.

There seem to be at least three societal goals served by an oral \u201ckind of hear-<em>Wolff v. McDonnell, supra, </em>418 U.S. at 557, 94 S.Ct. at 2975, the desire for accuracy, the need for accountability, and the necessity for a decisionmaking procedure which is perceived as \u201cfair\u201d by the citizens. Most often mentioned by the courts is the notion that an oral hearing provides a way to ensure accuracy when facts are in dispute, especially if credibility is an issue. Justice Frankfurter believed that \u201cno better instrument has been devised for arriving at truth\u201d than the notice and hearing requirement. <em>Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm. </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>341 U.S. 123, 171, 71 S.Ct. 624, 649, 95 L.Ed. 817 (1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring). Even if credibility is not likely to be directly in issue, personal, oral hearings are an effective way to elimimg,</p>\n<p id=\"b241-16\">mg, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>nate misunderstandings and focus issues. Ambiguities which are not readily apparent on the face of a document can be disclosed and clarified with a few moments of oral exchange between the individual and the decisionmaker. For example, in <em>Goss v. Lopez, supra, </em>one of the plaintiffs had been suspended from school without a hearing after she was arrested at a demonstration. The student conceded that she had been arrested, but testified at trial that she had been swept up in a mass arrest and had engaged in no misconduct. A prior opportunity to explain personally the apparently damning arrest could well have avoided a decision based on incomplete or incorrect facts.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The hearing requirement and many of the additional procedural safeguards that due process may require in particular circumstances also serve as an institutional check on arbitrary or impermissible action. Caseworkers, auditors, parole officers and other initial decisionmakers, if required to meet personally with those whose lives they are touching, and justify, however briefly, their decisions to those who are dissatisfied, are faced with a powerful disincentive to arbitrary action.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">[T]he fair process of decisionmaking that [the requirement of notice and an opportunity to be heard] guarantees works, by itself, to protect against arbitrary deprivation of property. For when a person has an opportunity to speak up in his own defense, and when the State must listen to what he has to say, substantively unfair and simply mistaken deprivations of property interests can be prevented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtP\"><em>Fuentes v. Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 81, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 1994, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972). An oral hearing requirement thus serves to ensure that decisionmakers recognize that their decisions affect the lives of human beings, a fact that is often obscured by a jumble of papers and depersonalized identification numbers. We can well believe it is easy for an employee processing an application for a small amount of Medicare benefits to shrug his or her shoulders and conclude that benefits should be denied or reduced, without stopping to gather the information necessary to reach that decision accurately. The situation could well be different if the employee knew that the claimant would have the opportunity personally to challenge that determination and seek an explanation. An employee is particularly vulnerable to the temptation if there are strong external pressures to reduce costs, as a district court has recently found exist in the carrier-administered Medicare program, <em>see </em>note 8 <em>supra; </em>small claims which the employee knows cannot be subjected to the scrutiny of a later hearing would be the most likely to suffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">We do not believe it unwarranted to recognize that human nature frequently leads to careless and arbitrary action when the decisionmaker can retreat behind a screen of paper and anonymity. The principle that those who govern must be accountable to those whose lives they affect in forms not only our representative system of government, but on a broader scale, forms the very essence of what we expect from the Government in its dealings with us. Providing a personal, oral hearing can be one expression of that principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">A third and perhaps most important reason for generally insisting upon an oral hearing is that no other procedure so effectively fosters a belief that one has been dealt with fairly, even if there remains a disagreement with the result. Our system of government is founded on respect for, and deference to, the integrity and dignity of the individual. In the Government\u2019s dealings with individuals \u2014 especially with respect to those individuals\u2019 property rights \u2014 some mechanism must exist to ensure that those values are left intact, even when action is finally taken against the person. In a society like ours, which operates on the assumption of and relies for its continued stability on respect for our institutions and voluntary compliance with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>dictates of the law, it is crucial that its members perceive that their rights and interests are taken seriously and thoughtfully by the officials who are deciding their claims.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> During an oral hearing, the \u201cGovernment\u201d loses its nameless, faceless quality and comes into focus as another human being with whom the citizen can speak, present his or her case, and look to for a responsible decision. To quote Justice Frankfurter again, no better way has \u201cbeen found for generating the feeling, so important to a popular government, that justice has been done. <em>Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm. v. McGrath, </em>341 U.S. 123, 172, 71 S.Ct. 624, 649, 95 L.Ed. 817 (1951) (concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">B. <em>The Mathews v. Eldridge Balancing Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">Despite the impressive number of cases requiring oral hearings as part of due process and the policy reasons supporting such a right, it must be acknowledged that some federal courts<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and learned commen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>tators<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> maintain that there are situations involving final adjudications of rights that do not require oral process. It is suggested that under the Court\u2019s more recent enunciation in <em>Eldridge, </em>an oral hearing is simply one of an arsenal of procedural safeguards whose worth in any overall process must be determined by the formula, laid down in <em>Eldridge, </em>of whether its \u201cprobable value\u201d is outweighed by its \u201cfiscal and administrative burdens.\u201d 424 U.S. at 335, 96 S.Ct. at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><em>Eldridge </em>dealt with the question of what procedural protections are required <em>before </em>the Government may stop paying disability benefits which had been provided on a regular basis. As here, an intermediary made an initial determination that Eldridge was no longer eligible for benefits, though in the case of disability payments, the intermediary is a state agency rather than a private company acting under contract. The agency notified Eldridge of its tentative determination that his benefits should be terminated. The tentative determination included a statement of reasons and a summary of the evidence on which the agency primarily relied. He was entitled to \u201cfull access\u201d to the information relied upon, permitted to respond both initially in writing, and subsequently to submit additional evidence. The decision to terminate was then reviewed by an examiner in the Social Security Administration who once again notified Eldridge of the reasons for his decision, and informed him of his right to <em>de novo </em>reconsideration. Again, he had the opportunity to submit additional written material, and receive a decision on reconsideration with specific reasons for the action taken. At that point, his benefits would be terminated. After termination, he was entitled to demand both a full evidentiary hearing and judicial review; if successful at either level he would receive retroactive benefits. However, he would be without remedy for the loss of interest, or interim use of the benefits withheld. The question for decision in that case, then, was whether the denial of a right to a pretermination full evidentiary hearing denied Eldridge his right to a meaningful opportunity to present his case at a meaningful time.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">The Court considered the four factors, discussed above, to determine the \u201cidentification of the specific dictates of due process\u201d: the private interest affected, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest, the probable value of additional or substitute procedural safeguards, and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail. 424 U.S. at 334 \u2014 35, 96 S.Ct. at 902-903. It concluded that, considering the interests at stake, the \u201cnot insubstantial\u201d costs of conducting pretermination hearings outweighed their likely benefits in light of the other procedural protections already afforded the claimant. <em>Id. </em>at 347\u2014 48, 96 S.Ct. at 908-909.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-13\">This balancing test has been used subsequently by other courts to determine the necessity for a variety of procedural protections normally associated with an adversary hearing<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> even if it is the only hearing the claimant will ever receive. They have justified this expansive use of the test by citation to the Court\u2019s comment at the end of <em>Eldridge </em>that \u201c[t]he judicial model of an evidentiary hearing is neither a required, nor even the most effective, method of deci-sionmaking in all circumstances,\u201d 424 U.S. at 348, 96 S.Ct. at 909, as well as by cases such as <em>Goss v. Lopez, supra, </em>in which the Court, though holding \u201csome kind of [notice and] hearing\u201d was necessary, recognized that very informal and summary dispute resolution procedures would satisfy due process norms even when liberty or proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>ty interests are at stake. Professor Kenneth Davis has concluded in the most recent edition of his Administrative Law Treatise that <em>Goss </em>and <em>Eldridge </em>together may stand for the proposition that \u201c[w]hen a trial is not feasible on an issue of adjudicative fact, a person may have a due process right [only] to a summary of the adverse evidence and a chance to respond informally,\u201d with the \u201cfeasibility\u201d of additional procedures, including an oral hearing, to be determined by the <em>Eldridge </em>balancing test.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Thus courts applying the <em>Eldridge </em>balancing test have, on occasion, held \u201cpaper hearing\u201d procedures to be adequate where in the total context of the process, they are deemed to ensure adequate notice and a genuine opportunity to explain one\u2019s case. For example, in <em>Basciano v. Herkimer, </em>605 F.2d 605 (2d Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 929, 99 S.Ct. 2858, 61 L.Ed.2d 296 (1979), the Second Circuit upheld New York City\u2019s procedures for determining a claimant\u2019s eligibility for disability benefits despite the fact that the City did not provide for oral hearings. Instead, the claimant was examined by two different panels of Board doctors, each of which recommended a decision, and he had the opportunity to submit his medical records as well as any other written statements. It bears noting both that the court carefully limited its holding to the case at hand,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and that the claimant was not totally denied the opportunity for an \u201coral hearing\u201d inasmuch as he had the opportunity to converse with those individuals responsible for recommending the decision \u2014 the agency\u2019s doctors.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\"><em>Goss </em>and <em>Eldridge, </em>then, provide in the opinion of some a valid basis for justifying the elimination of traditionally accepted forms of dispensing \u201cdue process\u201d such as oral hearings when the costs of those forms outweigh their benefits. But no case or commentator suggests that traditional trial-type procedural safeguards may be eliminated at the expense of the core requirements of due process \u2014 adequate notice of why the benefit is being denied and a genuine opportunity to explain why it should not be. In deciding if the totality of a procedure meets these core requirements of due process, no component of a procedure can be analyzed independently of the others. As Judge Friendly wrote, \u201cif an agency chooses to go further than is constitutionally demanded with respect to one item, this may afford good reason for diminishing or even eliminating another.\u201d Friendly, <em>supra </em>note 35, at 1279. In particular, he felt that the better the agency\u2019s notice procedures, \u201cthe more forthcoming the agency has been in disclosing its grounds [for decision], the stronger ... its position in asking curtailment of other procedures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1281.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">Given, then, the fluid and probably still evolving state of the law as to the necessity of oral hearings prior to final determinations of property interests such as these, we do not fault the district court\u2019s use of the <em>Eldridge </em>balancing test to determine what, if any, additional procedural safeguards are necessary here. We do disagree, however, with its conclusion that the Secretary\u2019s present procedures provide adequate safeguards to protect that due process core, as well as with the manner in which it balanced the benefits and costs of the additional safeguards of more adequate notice and/or an informal opportunity to talk to the decisionmaker at some point in the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">C. <em>The Requirements of Due Process in This Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">Whether a procedure such as the \u201cpaper hearing\u201d employed here contains the \u201cessence of due process ... [by providing] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>\u2018a person in jeopardy of serious loss . . . notice of the case against him and opportunity to meet it,\u2019 \u201d <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. at 348, 96 S.Ct. at 909 <em>(citing Joint Anti-Fascist Comm. v. McGrath, </em>341 U.S. at 171-72, 71 S.Ct. at 648-649), must be decided in the context of the entire dispute resolution process, as well as with reference to the characteristics of the group who have to use it. <em>See id. </em>424 U.S. at 349, 96 S.Ct. at 909. We find serious procedural deficiencies in the current process which could be alleviated in great part by the provision of an opportunity for informal oral consultations, although possibly by other alternate procedures such as better notice as well. Without some additional improvements, however, we are unable to hold that the current procedures meet the due process minimum, and we must order the court to reengage in the <em>Mathews v. Eldridge </em>balancing test to ascertain what additional safeguards are feasible and necessary. In doing so, however, it is only fair that we indicate wherein we find its prior balancing at fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">1. <em>The Private Interest at Stake</em></p>\n<p id=\"AeR\">Though the district court recognized that \u201cthe denial of Medicare benefits undoubtedly does inflict genuine hardship upon some claimants,\u201d Mem.Op. at 7; J.A. 206, it minimized the private interest at stake by drawing upon the Court\u2019s distinction in <em>Eldridge, supra : </em>\u201c[eligibility for Medicare benefits, unlike eligibility for public assistance benefits, is not based upon financial need.\u201d Mem.Op. at 7; J.A. 206. We are not so sanguine, however, that the mere difference in eligibility criteria between the two programs is sufficient to support an inference that Medicare recipients do not have a substantial enough stake in being compensated for necessary medical expenses to warrant a more expansive notice and hearing procedure than that afforded here. The relatively small amounts involved (less than $100) in disputed claims may be misleading. A chronic patient could be denied up to $600 per year under Part A and $200 per year under Part B without qualifying for additional protection,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> amounts greater than the cut-off point which Congress felt deserving of a full evidentiary hearing, and close to that it found deserving of judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">Nor can we ignore in any evaluation of the \u201cinterest at stake\u201d the significant percentage of Medicare claimants disadvantaged by disability, illness and poverty, a substantially higher figure than is true of the population at large. Indeed it was because of the special coincidence of medical needs and financial problems among elderly people that the Medicare program was established in the first place. <em>See </em>S.Rep.No. 1230, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 37 (1972) (group characteristics of \u201clow incomes and high medical expenses ... led Congress to provide health insurance for older people\u201d). That unfortunate coincidence is borne out by current statistics which indicate that the elderly still have lower incomes and higher medical expenses than other segments of the population.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Thus, though need is not an eligibility criteria for participation in Medicare, a disproportionately large percentage of elderly recipients hover near the poverty level. Nonreimbursed medical bills of up to $100 represent a substantial loss to them. Although aware that despite evidence submitted to the <em>Eldridge </em>Court that disabled workers\u2019 families also tended to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>on the low end of the income scale, it reached a conclusion that \u201cthe potential deprivation [in disability cases] is generally likely to be less than in <em>Goldberg,\u201d </em>424 U.S. at 341, 96 S.Ct. at 906, we still feel that the trial court here must give some explicit consideration to the unique disability problems and low economic status of large numbers of aged persons when evaluating their need for protections against unjustified denials of modest medical claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Finally, we emphasize that in <em>Eldridge </em>the interest at stake was <em>defined </em>by the court as <em>\u201csolely] </em>[an] interest ... in the <em>uninterrupted </em>receipt of this source of income <em>pending </em>final administrative decision on his claim,\u201d 424 U.S. at 340, 96 S.Ct. at 905 (emphasis supplied), whereas here the interest at stake is a <em>permanent </em>loss of benefits. The trial judge found that critical difference between a temporary and permanent loss to be irrelevant. Mem.Op. at 8-9; J.A. 207-08. We believe that the permanency of the loss of benefits sets this case apart from <em>Eldridge </em>and enhances the relatively low status of the interest at stake accorded by the district court. We feel the court must weigh the very real differences involved in depriving the claimant in a case like <em>Eldridge </em>of the temporary use of benefit monies pending a final decision as to his right thereto against the permanent loss of the reimbursement for medical expenses involved in this case, as well as any temporary loss of the use of that money pending a final determination on review. This situation, unlike <em>Eldridge, </em>does not involve only the allocation of the costs of delay in the decisionmaking process, but the permanent loss of the benefits themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">2. <em>The Risk of Erroneous Deprivation and the Benefit of Additional Safeguards</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The accuracy of the Secretary\u2019s current dispute procedures for claims under $100 was a major source of dispute in this litigation. Each side relied on different statistical measures to measure the reversal rate. All of them are undermined to some degree by what even the agency admits is a deceptively low appeals rate;<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> for a variety of reasons acknowledged by the agency and the district court, including ignorance, confusion and disability, few people challenge adverse claims decisions. At any rate, like the Supreme Court in <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. at 346 n.29, 96 S.Ct. at 908 n.29, we would not feel comfortable in relying too heavily on the elusive statistics proffered by either side to measure the magnitude of the risk of error inherent in the present procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">We must therefore rely on our own judgment, bolstered by evidence from Congressional hearings and client surveys, that the notice accorded to the plaintiffs here by the EOMB form, unsupplemented by any opportunity to communicate personally with the carrier employee responsible for the initial denial, does not give constitutionally adequate notice of why benefits are being denied. We agree with the plaintiffs that \u201cthe reasons for claims denials given in the initial notice [can be] ... so unclear that it is virtually impossible for the average beneficiary to present a well-reasoned argument to the insurance company.\u201d J.A. 94 (Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">Under the Medicare law benefits may be denied either because treatments are deemed unnecessary or because the charges are deemed unreasonable. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(v). The agency-approved notices <footnotemark>43</footnotemark> received by two of the named plaintiffs here failed to specify prior to the final agency review which of these two basically different causes for denial applied; the claimants were referred only to Item 5 on the back of the form. This item in turn states that either the provider has not charged the \u201ccustomary charge\u201d or that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>charges are not \u201cprevailing,\u201d that is, not in the 75th percentile of his provider peers. It says nothing about whether or why the treatment may be deemed inappropriate, although in plaintiffs Patino\u2019s and Roth-feld\u2019s cases, the nature of the treatment was apparently the underlying reason for denial, not the \u201ccharge,\u201d despite the notation on the EOMB form. Thus plaintiffs Patino and Rothfeld were not adequately informed by the \u201cnotices\u201d whether their doctors were allegedly more expensive than others in the locality, or were charging them more than other patients, or whether or why the treatments were deemed unnecessary.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Plaintiff Patino\u2019s confusion was accentuated by the fact that she was given two differing and conflicting reasons for the denial of benefits for identical treatments at different times.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Their experiences cannot be dismissed as isolated ones. Congressional witnesses recently testified in a hearing on Medicare that their elderly constituents on a widespread scale experienced similar confusion as to why expected benefits were being denied;<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> a survey cited to the trial judge by the plaintiffs also showed that the average Medicare recipient did not understand from the notice why his claim was denied or what to do about it.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Unlike the trial judge, we cannot agree that other factors such as age or disability which impede elderly claimants\u2019 efforts to seek reconsideration or review in any way detract from their need for informative notice;<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> in our opinion these other factors only accentuate the need for adequate notice as to the specific basis for denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">It is universally agreed that adequate notice lies at the heart of due process.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Unless a person is adequately informed of the reasons for denial of a legal interest, a hearing serves no purpose \u2014 and resembles more a scene from Kafka than a constitutional process. Without notice of the specific reasons for denial, a claimant is reduced to guessing what evidence can or should be submitted in response and driven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>to responding to every possible argument against denial at the risk of missing the critical one altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">It may be that in some circumstances a lack of precise initial notice of the grounds for denial may be compensated for by ready access to the adverse evidence or a summary thereof. For instance, in <em>Eldridge, </em>the claimant had such ready access to the deci-sionmaker\u2019s entire file on his case. Moreover, he had the opportunity to talk to the examining doctors. Therefore, he had the opportunity to flesh out the notice of denial and determine from the file and conversations with doctors what factual matters, if any, were in dispute even before the <em>preter-mination </em>denial. In this case, however, the cryptic notice on the EOMB form is the sum total of the communication from decision-maker to claimant before a final denial<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> and it comes only <em>after </em>an initial denial has already been made. The claimant has no opportunity to flesh out the notice at any stage by access to the files or informal consultation with either the initial or reviewing decisionmaker before a final and irrevocable denial of benefits is made. Because the reconsideration is a \u201cpaper one\u201d only, he can only write a letter or get his doctor to write a letter that he hopes will address the issue. The lack of adequate notice is in no way offset by a compensating procedure elsewhere in the process. <em>Cf. Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Div. v. Craft, supra. </em>We find the risk of erroneous deprivation encountered in such a process to be substantial enough to require a careful assessment of additional protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Again we refer to the unique characteristics of the group involved here in order to appraise the accentuated effects of these notice defects. Congress, in enacting and amending Medicare, has repeatedly recognized that the elderly, as a group, are less able than the general populace to deal effectively with legal notices and written registration requirements \u2014 Congress itself amended the Medicare Act to automatically include Part A eligibles into Part B because elderly eligibles were failing to enroll due to \u201cinattention or inability to manage their affairs.\u201d S.Rep.No. 1230, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 38 (1972).<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> To countenance granting them less than adequate notice of the reasons for denial of medical benefits would be inconsistent with that Congressional intent, to say the least.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Opportunity for an oral interview or consultation could alleviate some of the problems caused by the inadequate notice, although a conscientious definition of due process would include both specific notice of the factual grounds for denial plus a subsequent opportunity to address these grounds in a way that is accessible to the users of the process. But the chance to talk to someone in charge would at least offer the claimant the opportunity to discover the basis of his dispute with the agency, and, if he has a defense, either answer on the spot or prepare rebuttal material for later submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">In addition, an oral hearing has an independent value in many reviews of this kind which was not taken into account by the trial judge. Oral hearings are peculiarly suitable to advance factfinding on issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>which depend on the credibility and veracity of the claimant. <em>See Califano v. Yamasaki, </em>442 U.S. 682, 696, 99 S.Ct. 2545, 2555, 61 L.Ed.2d 176 (1979). In Medicare review, despite the Secretary\u2019s and the trial judge\u2019s emphasis on the \u201croutine\u201d or computational aspects of most denials, issues involving credibility often do arise. For example, the statute and the regulations provide for a waiver of the \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d test for the payment of assigned claims in certain cases. Specifically, a beneficiary may be reimbursed for any payments made to a provider for treatments deemed not reasonable or necessary if the beneficiary acted under a good faith belief that the expenses were reimbursable. The agency may then recoup these indemnified funds from the provider, but only if the provider did not in good faith believe that the treatments were necessary or appropriate. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395pp.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> As the Medicare Carriers Manual itself recognizes, the interests of patient and provider in such a situation may be adverse and issues of credibility and veracity are involved. Medicare Carriers Manual, Part 3, Claims Process H 7300.4. The Supreme Court has already held in <em>Yamasaki </em>that a determination of a claimant\u2019s good faith or fault requires personal contact between claimant and decisionmaker.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">[A] written review hardly seems sufficient to discharge the Secretary\u2019s statutory duty to make an accurate determination of waiver under \u00a7 204(b). Under that subsection, the Secretary must assess the absence of \u201cfault\u201d and determine whether or not recoupment would be \u201cagainst equity and good conscience.\u201d ... The Court previously has noted that a \u201cbroad \u2018fault\u2019 standard is inherently subject to factual determination and adversarial input.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. W. T. Grant Co., </em>416 U.S. 600, 617 [94 S.Ct. 1895, 1905, 40 L.Ed.2d 406] (1974). As the Secre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>tary\u2019s regulations make clear, \u201cfault\u201d depends on an evaluation of \u201call pertinent circumstances\u201d including the recipient\u2019s \u201cintelligence ... and physical and mental condition\u201d as well as his good faith. 20 CFR \u00a7 404.507 (1978). We do not see how these can be evaluated absent personal contact between the recipient and the person who decides his case. Evaluating fault, like judging detrimental reliance, usually requires an assessment of the recipient\u2019s credibility, and written submissions are a particularly inappropriate way to distinguish a genuine hard luck story from a fabricated tall tale. See <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U.S. at 269 [90 S.Ct., at 1021].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">442 U.S. at 676-77,99 S.Ct. at 2555.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Thus, the overriding benefits of an oral hearing where the claimant\u2019s good faith belief in the coverage of the services is at issue have already been asserted by the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> We cannot, therefore, agree with the trial judge\u2019s conclusion here that \u201cthe nature of [the reviewer\u2019s] inquiry is particularly suited to procedures that afford claimants the opportunity to make written submissions.\u201d Mem.Op. at 15; J.A. 214. While the \u201clargest numbers of denials .. . [may be] \u2018reasonable charge reductions\u2019 which typically turn upon mathematical calculations,\u201d we do not see on what basis he could conclude that most other decisions are \u201c \u2018sharply focused and easily documented\u2019 \u201d by \u201c \u2018routine, standard, and unbiased medical reports by physician specialists.\u2019 \u201d Mem.Op. at 14-15; J.A. 213-14. We can foresee different scenarios in which both the claimants\u2019 and the providers\u2019 credibility may be at issue and their \u201cinterests at stake\u201d not necessarily congruent.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">As a final fillip here, we note that the decisionmaker on review is himself an employee of the very private insurance carrier which previously denied the claim. Moreover, this carrier has a financial interest in the outcome of the proceedings. The possibility of bias inherent in utilizing the employees of an interested private party as administrative decisionmakers has led one court to hold the full fair hearings provided claimants of over $100 under Part B viola-tive of due process. The failure to provide an impartial tribunal, the court concluded, rendered the hearing fatally defective. The district court in <em>McClure v. Harris, supra </em>note 8, reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">If hearing officers are potentially biased in favor of the carriers whose determinations they review, then the availability of an independent, administrative appeal beyond the hearing officer level might well mitigate the harmful effects of such bias. On the other hand, if no independent tribunal is ever to review a hearing officer\u2019s decision, the impartiality must be fully ensured at the hearing officer\u2019s level.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">503 F.Supp. at 414. Without passing on the correctness of the <em>McClure </em>court\u2019s ruling, we do find its balancing equation instructive. In weighing the calculus of whatever process is due Part B claimants who are not entitled to a full fair hearing because their claims are under $100, the court should consider both that (1) the decisionmaker has a financial incentive to keep payments low because the Secretary periodically reviews the Department\u2019s contracts with private carriers,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> (2) the decisionmaker on review is an employee of the same carrier as the person who originally denied the claim, and \u201ccould only rule in the beneficiaries\u2019 favor by directly overturning the carriers\u2019 deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>sion,\u201d <em>id., </em>and (3) there is not only no appeal from the carrier employees\u2019 decisions but also no opportunity for direct contact between the claimant and these decisionmak-ers at any stage of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">In sum, we believe the current procedures allotted to the elderly Medicare claimant, probably disadvantaged by disability and poverty, resemble playing against a stacked deck \u2014 notice that does not adequately inform him of the basis of the denial, no access to files or a summary of the evidence, no opportunity for any direct oral communication with the decisionmaker, a provider and a decisionmaker with possible bias, no appeal of any sort. This combination results in a significant possibility of deprivation. Our concern is that this combination be altered by the addition of some other protections in a way that will assure a claimant minimal due process, /. e., adequate notice and a genuine opportunity to present his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">3. <em>Costs of Additional Safeguards</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Our final problem with the trial court\u2019s balancing under <em>Eldridge </em>is that in weighing the feasibility or costs of additional procedures, it considered only the estimated costs of providing the same full fair hearings for under-$100 claims as are currently provided for over-$100 claims. Since we are interested only in ensuring that a claimant receives adequate notice and a genuine opportunity to answer the factual case against him, whether achieved by means of better notice, opportunity to talk to the decisionmaker and/or see his file, or a combination of both, the cost of these additional procedures, not of full fair hearings, is what is at stake. On remand the court should weigh the much less expensive costs of such informal procedures against their expected benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">As we believe we have made clear, we hold that, where elderly participants in a federally supported insurance program are permanently denied statutory benefits under that program, the \u201cnotice and hearing\u201d requirement of due process mandates that they receive more protection than the present system allows. The present system is flawed by: an inadequate form of notice; a procedure which allows a claimant only a limited opportunity to submit a written reply to an inadequate notice; and a total denial of any opportunity for a claimant to participate in any kind of oral interview or consultation with an individual knowledgeable about and empowered to resolve the dispute. We believe, at a minimum, the claimant should be informed of or have access to the evidence on which the carrier relied in reaching its initial decision to deny the claim and, within a reasonable time thereafter, an opportunity to present evidence (in oral or written form) in support of his or her position. Where factual issues involving the credibility or veracity of the claimant are at stake, particular consideration of a policy granting on request an oral interview before the final denial on reconsideration should be given. At some point after the hearing, the claimant should receive a meaningful explanation of the reasons for whatever action is taken on the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">We are convinced that simplified, streamlined, informal oral procedures are available which would be responsive to the concerns of Congress for efficiency and low cost yet which would provide claimants with the right to participate in decisions affecting their interests in cases where such participation is critical. We are also convinced that the size of that class of cases can be reduced by remedying other defects in the decisionmaking process, such as the lack of adequate notice.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> In order to formulate an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>order which will meet both the dictates of due process and the concerns of Congress, the court needs the assistance of the Secretary and Department, as well as the contribution of the plaintiffs. Thus we must remand this ease for further proceedings. We have indicated above the minimum procedure which, on this record, must be afforded to the plaintiffs; we leave further formulation of the precise contours of the required due process hearing to the district court and the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-11\">.

The defendant Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services does not dispute that the claimants\u2019 interest in receiving the medical insurance benefits for which they have paid a monthly premium is a property interest, and thus that the requirements of due process attach to any final government decision to deny those payments.

Since much of the controversy in this case centers on the definition of the phrase \u201chearing,\u201d we wish to make clear at the beginning what we conceive to be the meaning of this term. A \u201chearing\u201d means <em>any </em>confrontation, oral or otherwise, between an affected individual and an agency decisionmaker sufficient to allow the individual to present his case in a meaningful manner. Hearings may take many forms, including a \u201cformal,\u201d trial-type proceeding, an \u201cinformal discusspon]\u201d as mandated by the Supreme Court in <em>Goss v. Lopez, </em>419 U.S. 565, 582, 95 S.Ct. 729, 740, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975), for student suspension proceedings, or a \u201cpaper hearing,\u201d without any opportunity for oral exchange. In the course of this opinion, we will frequently refer to an \u201coral hearing,\u201d \u201coral process,\u201d or \u201coral communication.\u201d We do not mean by use of these terms to suggest that the procedure referred to has any particular characteristic other than being oral in nature. In particular, we do not mean to suggest any equivalency between an oral hearing and a \u201cformal evidentiary hearing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b228-17\">. Although much of this opinion focuses on the advantages of providing oral hearings in cases such as this, we do not hold that oral process is always due in Medicare review proceedings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Our extensive discussion of oral hearings stems from the way in which the .parties structured their arguments as to the adequacy of the present procedures for review of small claims, and in particular, appellants\u2019 specific claims for relief. However, the appellants argued before both this and the trial court that the need for an oral hearing derived in part from deficiencies in the Secretary\u2019s current notice provisions. Our remand to the district court allows the Secretary to propose changes in this as in other aspects of the present paper hearing procedures; the district court may accept these changes as an alternative to oral hearings if it believes they will cure the deficiencies we have noted in the present procedures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b229-7\">.

The procedures appear to be largely the same, except that there is a 60 day statute of limitations under Part A, while a party has six months to file a request for a Part B review. In each case, a claimant may cumulate denials made within that period in an attempt to meet the $100 requirement.

Essentially the amount in controversy is the actual amount charged the individual for the goods or services in issue, less any payment which the carrier has made and less any deductible or co-insurance applicable to the particular claim. For example, under Part B there is an annual deductible of $60 and Medicare only pays 80% of most claims. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395e (Part A) <em>and \u00a7 </em>1395/(Part B).

The validity of this limitation on judicial review is not an issue <em>per se </em>in this case, though the existence of a right to vindicate one\u2019s rights in court is a relevant consideration in deciding whether a given procedure, as a whole, satisfies due process. Even when no other procedural protections are available, if the courts are open to an individual and able to provide redress, it may be sufficient to satisfy the right to a hearing. <em>See Ingraham v.

Mr. President, under all the laws passed by Congress dealing with public assistance and social welfare Congress has never included any limitation upon the right of a citizen to appeal an administrative decision by the agency involved. In public assistance statutes we have always provided for the right of the beneficiary to question a decision made in his specific case, on the basis that the rules and regulations established to administer such laws cannot account for every possible situation where a real inequity may arise. While it may well be that many appeals will arise under public assistance laws as a result of misunderstanding of the benefits available and their amounts, we have nevertheless considered it important to keep the appeals route open so that valid complaints could be found and heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">I can fully realize the concerns that the Social Security Administration may have over the number of cases that may arise under this new statute, but I am convinced that until the medicare program has been in operation for some time we should not place administrative ease above the rights of our elderly to question adverse decisions. To the majority of the elderly the amount in question may well involve a substantial part of their income or savings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-9\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-10\">Utilization review committees are also provided for in the bill and each hospital must have a review plan. While these wise provisions will be instrumental in controlling the amount of benefits due the patient, there is no doubt that there will be instances of controversy. In fact, Mr. President, it is often the case that the rules and regulations employed to administer such laws are perfected in the long run by the ability of beneficiaries to appeal adverse decisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-11\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-12\">Mr. President, I have asked representatives of the Social Security Administration and other experts to explain the rationale for a $1,000 limitation on beneficiary appeals. The only explanation is one of concern over administrative caseloads as well as concern over the number of cases that may pile up in the courts. 1 have investigated all the other programs under our social security laws and have not found one instance where a beneficiary\u2019s right to appeal has been conditioned upon the amount in question. Under those titles of public assistance where administration is relegated to the States I have found that in each instance it is stated in our laws that the Secretary will only approve a State plan if rights of appeal are provided for, regardless of the amount in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-20\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-21\">These citizens have incomes of only $2,000 a year; a disagreement in benefits of only $200 represents 10 percent of their income. Should they not be able to appeal in this situation involving so much of their income? Could it not be true that the most equitable and worthy case may be one involving only $150?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-22\">I hope that this measure will not be passed with such a built-in inequity. 1 feel that if experience shows us that the administrators of the program do meet an exceptional caseload, we could place a limit on appeals at a later date. But until this is a problem, I am opposed to any provision that places a burden on the elderly rather than on program administrators.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-23\">111 Cong.Rec. 1536 (1965) (remarks of Senator Kennedy).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b231-24\">. <em>See also </em>118 Cong.Rec. 1026 (1972) (unsuccessful attempt by Senator Ribicoff to amend bill on the floor to reduce amount in controversy limitation on hearings to $25).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b232-8\">. <em>See </em>note 2 <em>supra </em>(Secretary concedes statutory benefit is a property interest protected by due process clause).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b232-9\">. A \u201cdue respect for the coordinate branches of government\u201d makes courts reluctant to declare Congressionally-enacted statutes unconstitutional. <em>Califano v. Yamasaki, </em>442 U.S. 682, 692-93, 99 S.Ct. 2545, 2553-2554, 61 L.Ed.2d 176 (1979). The Supreme Court has accordingly adopted the rule that \u201cif \u2018a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which [a serious doubt of constitutionality] may be avoided,\u2019 a court should adopt that construction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693, 99 S.Ct. at 2553 <em>(quoting Crowell v. Benson, </em>285 U.S. 22, 62, 52 S.Ct. 285, 296, 76 L.Ed. 598 (1932)) (citation omitted). This rule is particularly applicable to cases involving due process challenges; the Court has been \u201cwilling to assume a Congressional solicitude for fair procedure, absent explicit statutory language to the contrary.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">The explicit language of the statute challenged here does not prohibit constructions consonant with the due process clause. Though the statute for Part A claims does not provide for any particular process for claimants of less than $100, neither does it prohibit any. Rather, the statutory language is silent on the subject of what process is due. The statute regulating Part B claims, on the other hand, specifically eliminates \u201chearing\u201d rights for claims of under $100. However, the legislative history makes clear that even in the latter case, the Congressional ban was a limited one.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">Congress clearly meant to eliminate the right to a \u201cfull fair hearing.\u201d <em>See </em>text at note 13 <em>supra </em>(Senate Finance Committee report). However, \u201cfair hearing\u201d appeared to be a term of art within HEW at that time; the agency repeatedly used the same phrase in <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970), to describe the formal, evidentiary post-termination hearings held in welfare cases. Thus, a Congressional intent to eliminate the right to a \u201chearing\u201d may merely be equivalent to an intent to deny rights to a \u201cfull fair hearing,\u201d rather than to all possible hearing procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-15\">Indeed, the Senate report suggests that the more limited interpretation of its intent is the correct one in this case. The Committee justified its amendment eliminating statutory hearing rights for claims of under $100 by pointing to the existence of regulations requiring a more limited, written procedure \u2014 the procedure being challenged here \u2014 and opining that it \u201cshould be sufficient protection in small claims cases.\u201d S.Rep.No. 1230, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 213 (1972). Thus, even as it was eliminating the statutory right to a full hearing, the Committee reaffirmed small claimants\u2019 rights to an informal procedure capable of adequately protecting their due process rights. While we disagree with the Committee\u2019s evaluation of the adequacy of the limited hearing provided for by those regulations, we do not doubt that Congress intended that adequate procedures be provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-16\">Thus, it appears that the explicit statutory language forbids only \u201cfair hearings.\u201d Since we find that constitutionally required due process is far less extensive than what has been traditionally held to constitute a \u201cfair hearing,\u201d this court will conclude, pursuant to the Court\u2019s mandate in <em>Yamasaki, </em>that the Medicare Act itself is constitutional because we can \u201cassume a congressional solicitude for fair procedure.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b233-9\">.

At all times in this opinion, we are speaking of due process procedural rights in the context of an adjudicatory determination; <em>i. e., </em>a particularized inquiry which will determine the legal rights and liabilities of a specific individual. While, of course, due process considerations come into play when the Government makes a variety of other sorts of determinations, such as agency rulemaking, see, e. <em>g., International Harvester Co. v. Ruckelshaus, </em>478 F.2d 615 (D.C.Cir.1973), rights to procedural protections are at their height in adjudicatory proceedings. Historically, a distinction has been made between determinations of \u201cadjudicatory\u201d facts, which require hearings as a matter of due process, and \u201clegislative\u201d facts, which normally do not, though the line between the two is by no means bright. Generally, however, the broader and more prospective the Government\u2019s proposed action is, the fewer procedural protections need be ensured to each individual affected. Justice Blackmun, concurring in a recent decision holding that individual residents in a nursing home need not be provided hearings in a Medicare decertification proceeding, relied heavily on this distinction and explained some of the reasons for its existence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">That the asserted deprivation of property extends in a nondiscriminatory fashion to some 180 patients also figures in my calculus. See <em>Dent v. West Virginia, </em>129 U.S. 114, 124 [9 S.Ct. 231, 234, 32 L.Ed. 623] (1889) (legislation comports with due process if, among other things, \u201cit be general in its operation upon the subjects to which it relates\u201d). \u201cWhere a rule of conduct applies to more than a few people it is impracticable that everyone should have a direct voice in its adoption. The Constitution does not require all public acts to be done in town meeting or an assembly of the whole.\u201d <em>Bi-Metallic Co. v. Colorado, </em>239 U.S. 441, 445 [36 S.Ct. 141, 142, 60 L.Ed. 372] (1915)____' When governmental action affects more than a few individuals, concerns beyond economy, efficiency, and expedition tip the balance against finding that due process attaches. We may expect that as the sweep of governmental action broadens, so too does the power of the affected group to protect its interests outside rigid constitutionally imposed procedures. Moreover, \u201cthe case for due process protection grows stronger as the identity of the persons affected by a government choice becomes clearer; and the case becomes stronger still as the precise nature of the effect on each individual comes more determinately within the decisionmaker\u2019s purview. For when government acts in a way that singles out identifiable individuals \u2014 in a way that is likely to be premised on suppositions about specific persons \u2014 it activates the special concern about being personally <em>talked to </em>about the decision rather than simply being <em>dealt </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number><em>with.\u201d </em>L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law, \u00a7 10-7, pp. 503-504 (1978) (emphasis in original). I agree with this general statement and find its \u201cflipside\u201d informative here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADj\"><em>O\u2019Bannon v. Town Court Nursing Center, </em>447 U.S. 773, 799-800, 100 S.Ct. 2467, 2482-83, 65 L.Ed.2d 506 (1980) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b236-6\">. The <em>size </em>of the interest at stake does not determine whether due process attaches to adjudications concerning the interest, the question is rather the <em>type </em>of interest involved and whether it can properly be classified as a liberty or property interest. However, if the amount at stake is truly <em>de minimis </em>procedural rights can be dispensed with altogether. <em>Goss v. Lopez, </em>419 U.S. 565, 576, 95 S.Ct. 729, 737, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The notion of a <em>de minimis </em>interest which is so insubstantial as to justify dispensing with due process altogether is rightly a narrow one, however, and the Secretary does not rely on it here. When monetary interests are at stake, the doctrine has been limited to matters involving a few dollars or less. <em>See Northern v. Nelson, </em>448 F.2d 1266 (9th Cir. 1971) (claim for damages of $1.05 properly dismissed as <em>de min-</em>imis). Even in these inflationary times, the loss of sums of up to $100 to people trying to live on retirement incomes is not only not <em>de minimis, </em>but may indeed be a grievous loss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"Aly\">. In their complaint, the plaintiffs also alleged that the statute and administrative practice violated the equal protection clause because similarly situated beneficiaries \u2014 raising identical factual and legal issues \u2014 were treated differently solely on the basis of the size of their dispute. The district court held that the \u201crational basis\u201d test applied, <em>see Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okl., Inc., </em>348 U.S. 483, 75 S.Ct. 461, 99 L.Ed. 563 (1955), and that the distinctions, drawn to reduce the financial burdens on the Medicare program and the courts, clearly had a rational basis. The plaintiffs have not sought review of that portion of the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b236-13\">. <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976), held that Social Security disability benefits could be terminated without first holding an oral hearing when a formal evidentiary hearing would be available at a later stage in the process and any wrongfully withheld sums would be paid retroactively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b237-9\">. <em>See </em>Appellee\u2019s Petition for Rehearing and Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc at 2 (\u201cNo opportunity to present evidence or argument orally is available.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b237-10\">. For this very reason, the court in <em>Eldridge </em>refused to place much weight on statistical reversal rates, noting that \u201c[b]are statistics rarely provide a satisfactory measure of the fairness of a decisionmaking process.\u201d 424 U.S. at 346, 96 S.Ct. at 908.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b237-16\">.

However, the Court relied heavily on the fact that the student participated in a months-long inquiry into her academic performance, with numerous meetings and discussions with those faculty members who would be making the decision as to her continuation at school, and received advance notification both of her perceived shortcomings and what would be expected of her were she to be permitted to continue. <em>See </em>435 U.S. at 92, 98 S.Ct. at 956 (Powell, J., concurring); <em>id. </em>at 96, 98 S.Ct. at 958 (White, J., concurring); <em>id. </em>at 97, 98 S.Ct. at 958 (Marshall, J., concurring); <em>id. </em>at 108, 98 S.Ct. at 964 (Blackmun, J., concurring).

The determination to be made by the agency was not an individualized, tenant-by-tenant rental rate, but general rents applicable to an entire housing development. When a general determination applies to a number of people, it is more akin to legislative rulemaking than adjudication, and opportunity for written participation may suffice. <em>See </em>note 18 <em>supra.

The plaintiffs had filed a claim for $40 in Medicare payments in small claims court; the defendants removed the case to federal district court, and the Ninth Circuit upheld the district court\u2019s dismissal of the action, relying on the $1000 statutory limitation on judicial review and sovereign immunity.

The Medicare regulations, 42 CFR \u00a7 405.330, provide for payment of some assigned claims that are ordinarily nonreimbursable under \u00a7 405.310(k) because they are not \u201creasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury[.]\u201d Reimbursement can nonetheless be made in such cases where \u201cneither the individual nor the provider knew or could reasonably be expected to know that the expenses incurred were excluded under \u00a7 405.-310(k).\u201d In addition 42 CFR \u00a7 405.331 provides that the individual may be repaid in circumstances where bills have already been paid to the provider if the individual had no reason to know the charges were not covered and the provider did know or have reason to know they were not. 42 CFR \u00a7 405.332 sets out the criteria by which the carrier determines whether the individual or the provider should have known the services were not reimbursable: these include whether the claimant had been told by carrier or provider or had relevant past experience with either from which to conclude that the services were not covered. (The individual is presumed not to have such knowledge.) The intermediary carrier\u2019s duties as set out in 42 CFR \u00a7 405.678(2)(c) include making the determination initially and on reconsideration whether the claimant knew or had reason to know the services were medically unnecessary or clearly improper. <em>See also </em>42 CFR \u00a7 405.803(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Waiver decisions are always made at the reconsideration level.

Even in cases where the claimant\u2019s credibility is not directly in issue, a personal interview between claimant and decisionmaker may ultimately make a crucial difference in the outcome of the dispute over whether the claimant must pay the medical bill.
