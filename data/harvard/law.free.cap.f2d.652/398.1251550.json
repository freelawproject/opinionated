After a trial, the bankruptcy court denied the objection. On appeal to the district court where K.M.A., Inc. was represented by counsel, relief to K.M.A., Inc. was denied. On April 20,1981, the sole stockholder of K.M.A., Inc., a non-attorney, filed a notice of appeal for the corporation from the district court\u2019s adverse holding. He seeks to proceed <em>pro se </em>on behalf of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">The law is clear that a corporation as a fictional legal person can only be represented by licensed counsel. <em>Commercial &amp; Railroad Bank of Vicksburg v. Slocomb, </em>39 U.S. (14 Pet.) 60, 10 L.Ed. 354 (1840); <em>In re Victor Publishers, Inc., </em>545 F.2d 285 (1st Cir. 1976). This is so even when the person seeking to represent the corporation is its president and major stockholder. <em>In re Las Colinas Development Corp., </em>585 F.2d 7 (1st Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">It is not clear, however, whether the filing of the corporation\u2019s notice of appeal by someone who is not an attorney is sufficient to deprive this Court of its jurisdiction to consider the appeal. <em>Compare Strong Delivery Ministry Association v. Board of Appeals of Cook County, </em>543 F.2d 32 (7th Cir. 1976), <em>and In re Highley, </em>459 F.2d 554 (9th Cir. 1972), <em>with DeVilliers v. Atlas Corp., </em>360 F.2d 292 (10th Cir. 1966). We are mindful of the emphasis placed on flexibility and substance rather than form in the appellate rules, <em>see </em>Fed.R.App.P. 3(c), 26(b). Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that General Motors Acceptance Corporation\u2019s motion to dismiss is hereby GRANTED, unless within 30 days of the entry of this order an attorney admitted to practice before this Court files an appearance to represent the corporate appellant, in which event the appeal shall not be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
