In the underlying action, Lavern and Earline Marquardt sued the Company pursuant to section 510 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140. The Marquardts later voluntarily dismissed the suit. The Company claims that, under any standard this court might adopt governing the award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to defendants in ERISA cases, the district court should have awarded attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to the Company pursuant to section 502(g) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g). Furthermore, the Company argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying attorneys\u2019 fees and costs without an explanation of its reasons. On the basis of this argument, the Company asks for a remand to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-15\">We find that, while an explanation by the district court would have been helpful, there is no need for a remand to the district court since we find that the record in this case can only support a denial of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to the Company. Indeed, we find the Company\u2019s delay tactics in this action reprehensible. We are tempted to impose sanctions pursuant to Rule 38 Fed.R. App.P. for a frivolous appeal because it is obvious that an award of fees to the Company would be unjust. But, because this appeal presents an issue of first impression concerning the standard for awarding fees to ERISA defendants, we will not impose the Rule 38 sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b796-17\">On May 31, 1976, the Company closed its Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, facility. At that time, Lavern Marquardt had worked at the plant for approximately 40 years and was 61 years old. The Company claims that Marquardt was offered the option of transferring to one of the Company\u2019s other facil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>ities in Chicago Ridge, Illinois, or Waterloo, Iowa, and that he declined the offer. Mar-quardt contends he was not offered an option to transfer instead of being terminated. Under the terms of the Company\u2019s pension plan, by terminating at age 61 Mar-quardt was entitled to only an actuarily reduced pension, rather than the full pension he would have received had he worked until age 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">The Marquardts instituted this action against the Company, alleging that the Company violated section <em>510 </em>of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Marquardt claims that the Company discriminated against him in order to interfere with his pension rights under ERISA by (1) denying him the option to remain employed with the Company until age 62, and (2) permitting another employee to \u201cage into\u201d pension benefits although he had not yet reached age 60 at the time of the Fond du Lac closure.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The district court never reached the merits of the Marquardts\u2019 complaint because the Marquardts voluntarily moved to dismiss the action with prejudice on the day of trial, July 7, 1980. The court granted this motion. The Company then orally moved for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs pursuant to section 502(g) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g). The court allowed both parties to brief the issue and denied the Company\u2019s motion on September 19, 1980. The Company appeals, arguing that the Marquardts\u2019 action was \u201cbaseless, frivolous, and vexatious,\u201d so that under any standard, the district court abused its discretion by refusing to award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">Section 502(g)(1) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1), provides that \u201cthe court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and costs of action to either party.\u201d This provision commits the decision whether to award attorneys\u2019 fees to the discretion of the district court. Therefore, the district court\u2019s determination should be reversed only for abuse of discretion. <em>Hummel v. S. E. Rykoff &amp; Co., </em>634 F.2d 446, 452 (9th Cir. 1980); <em>Landro v. Glenden-ning Motorways, Inc., </em>625 F.2d 1344, 1356 (8th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">The law is not settled regarding the standards for determining abuse of discretion in denying attorneys\u2019 fees under ERI-SA. Some courts of appeal have found it necessary to remand the case to the district court where, as here, the trial court rendered its decision without giving reasons for its decision. <em>Hummel, </em>634 F.2d at 452-53; <em>Iron Workers Local No. 272 v. Bowen, </em>624 F.2d 1255, 1266 (5th Cir. 1980). In each of these cases, the court listed the following factors that the district court should consider in exercising its discretion under \u00a7 1132(g):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-12\">(1) the degree of the opposing parties\u2019 culpability or bad faith; (2) the ability of the opposing parties to satisfy an award of fees; (3) whether an award of fees against the opposing parties would deter others from acting under similar circumstances; (4) whether the parties requesting fees sought to benefit all participants and beneficiaries of an ERISA plan or to resolve a significant legal question regarding ERISA; and (5) the relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-13\"><em>Hummel, </em>634 F.2d at 452; <em>Iron Workers, </em>624 F.2d at 1266. <em>See also Eaves v. Penn, </em>587 F.2d 453, 465 (10th Cir. 1978); <em>Baeten v. Van Ess, </em>474 F.Supp. 1324, 1332 (E.D.Wis. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-14\">We do not hold that these five factors constitute the only test which the district court can use in deciding whether to award attorneys\u2019 fees under ERISA. We do find, however, that these factors are relevant and useful in our analysis of whether the district court abused its discretion by refusing to award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">First, we consider the first and fifth factors listed above, the Marquardts\u2019 \u201cculpability or bad faith\u201d and the \u201crelative merits of the parties\u2019 positions.\u201d These factors are considered together because the Company argues that the Marquardts\u2019 suit was so frivolous that they should be adjudged \u201cculpable\u201d solely for continuing to litigate their ERISA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Since the underlying ERISA action was dismissed, the merits of the parties\u2019 positions were never adjudicated. In the absence of a decision on the merits, we find that, for purposes of determining defendant\u2019s entitlement to attorneys\u2019 fees, a dismissal by an ERISA plaintiff does not have the same weight as if defendant prevailed on the merits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The weight accorded the Marquardts\u2019 dismissal must also be considered in light of the Company\u2019s dilatory tactics prior to the dismissal. The complaint was filed on June 25, 1979, and the Company was served on June 27. But the Company did not respond until August 17, and then only filed an appearance of counsel. After successfully resisting a motion for default judgment, the Company filed no responsive pleadings until October 1, when it filed a motion to dismiss or in the alternative for summary judgment. The motion was denied on December 18, 1979. The Company finally filed its answer to the complaint on January 11, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">In February, 1980, the Marquardts directed interrogatories and a request for production of documents to the Company. The Company did not respond to these discovery requests. The Marquardts filed a motion to compel on June 12, nearly four months after the requests had been filed and served on the Company. The court ordered the Company to comply with the discovery requests by June 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">The Company\u2019s first and only interrogatories were served on the Marquardts\u2019 counsel by telegram on June 28. Responses were served by telegram on July 5, only five days later. All of the depositions in this action were taken during the two and a half weeks immediately prior to the assigned trial date of July 7, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">The Company argues that the delays in responding to discovery requests can be justified by the geography of the case: the action was filed in Springfield, Illinois; the Marquardts live in Baraboo, Wisconsin; the Marquardts\u2019 chief counsel is from St. Louis, Missouri; and the Company\u2019s counsel is from Chicago. But the distances involved here do not present an unusual or difficult situation. Modern litigation commonly involves greater distances and more parties in different locations than were involved here. Thus, the Company\u2019s failure to cooperate in discovery cannot be excused. Assuming that the Company\u2019s discovery responses contributed to the Marquardts\u2019 decision to dismiss, the Company itself must bear much of the blame for the late date of the Mar-quardts\u2019 voluntary dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b798-12\">The next factor we consider is the parties\u2019 ability to pay. Lavern Marquardt is a retired man in his sixties. He receives an actuarily reduced pension from the Company, and the record does not show that he has any significant alternative source of funds. The Company argues that Mar-quardt\u2019s union has financed this action, and that defendant will not be required to personally satisfy an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. But, the union is not a party here. Any award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs would be against the Marquardts personally. We cannot assume that the union would finance any fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-13\">A party\u2019s ability <em>personally </em>to satisfy a fee award, especially that of a plaintiff of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>limited means, has been held, in and of itself, to be an adequate basis for denying a defendant\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Wooten v. New York Telephone Co., </em>485 F.Supp. 748, 762 (S.D.N.Y.1980) (Title VII action); <em>Doe v. Mundy, </em>441 F.Supp. 447, 452 (E.D.Wis.1977) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action). We agree that a plaintiff\u2019s ability to personally satisfy a fee award is an important factor. In this case, it would have been unjust had the district court ordered Mar-quardt to sacrifice even a part of his modest pension to the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">The remaining factors to consider in determining whether the district court abused its discretion by refusing to award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs are: (3) whether an award of fees would deter other parties from acting under similar circumstances and (4) whether the party requesting fees sought to benefit all participants and beneficiaries of an ERISA plan or to resolve a significant legal question regarding ERISA. We consider these factors together because they are both more appropriate to a determination of whether to award fees to a plaintiff than a defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Furthermore, we find that, in this case, these factors do not support an award of fees to the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Regarding the third factor, deterrence, an award of fees would have little value in deterring other potential plaintiffs in the Marquardts\u2019 position. There were only two other employees at the Company\u2019s Fond du Lac plant. One is now deceased and the other had reached retirement age and had announced his retirement before the plant shutdown. Furthermore, even if we wished to use a fee award to deter ERISA plaintiffs from waiting until the day of trial to dismiss, this would not be the case to do so because of the Company\u2019s dilatory tactics.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">The fourth factor is whether the party sought to benefit ERISA beneficiaries or sought to resolve a significant legal question. It is undisputed that the Company did not benefit ERISA plan beneficiaries in this action. The Company might argue, however, that it has attempted to resolve a significant legal question regarding ERISA \u2014defendants\u2019 entitlements to awards of fees pursuant to \u00a7 1132(g)(1). But an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs for the litigation of only the \u00a7 1132(g)(1) issue would be wholly inappropriate since we have soundly rejected the Company\u2019s analysis of this issue. For the foregoing reasons, we find that the Company has fallen far short of establishing that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b799-13\">Because of the compelling facts of this case, it is unnecessary for us to reach the question of when a district court\u2019s denial of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to a prevailing defendant would constitute an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We emphasize, however, that refusal to award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to ERISA defendants, even \u201cprevailing\u201d defendants, would rarely constitute an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the five factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>used as guidelines above do not explicitly differentiate between plaintiffs and defendants, consideration of these factors will seldom dictate an assessment of attorneys\u2019 fees against ERISA plaintiffs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">First, the \u201cculpability\u201d of a losing plaintiff significantly differs from that of a losing defendant. A losing defendant must have violated ERISA, thereby depriving plaintiffs of rights under a pension plan and violating a Congressional mandate. A losing plaintiff, on the other hand, will not necessarily be found \u201cculpable\u201d, but may be only in error or unable to prove his case. This distinction also applies to the fifth factor \u2014 the relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions \u2014 since a plaintiff\u2019s culpability is determined by the lack of merit of his suit, while a defendant\u2019s culpability is determined by actions prior to suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">Second, when an employee sues an employer, the employer often will be in a position to pay its own legal fees while the employee will be hard pressed to pay both his own and the employer\u2019s fees. This is especially true where, as here, a retired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>employee sues his former employer for a higher pension. Thus, the \u201cability to pay\u201d factor will rarely weigh in favor of an award of attorneys\u2019 fees to a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Similarly, the third factor, deterrence, generally will not justify an award of attorneys\u2019 fees to defendants. Although an assessment of attorneys\u2019 fees against a plaintiff certainly would be a strong deterrent against bringing a frivolous action, it generally is sufficient that plaintiff bears his own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to deter institution of a frivolous or baseless suit. Deterrence is achieved against employers, on the other hand, because they will have added incentive to comply with ERISA, rather than facing suits for compliance, if they know that they may have to pay plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees, in addition to the costs of compliance and their own legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Finally, the benefit of the suit to all participants in an ERISA plan or the resolution of a significant legal question under ERISA is also primarily relevant only to whether plaintiffs should be awarded attorneys\u2019 fees. Plaintiffs will have added incentive to bring suits that benefit all plan beneficiaries and to enforce the policies behind ERISA if their attorneys\u2019 fees will be paid by defendants. Of course, sometimes a defendant may establish an interpretation of ERISA that clarifies the law or benefits ERISA plan beneficiaries, if not the plaintiff. But, in general, the fourth factor is significant in determining the benefits conferred in a suit brought by ERISA plaintiffs, rather than the benefits of dismissing a meritless ERISA suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">In summary, we find that although \u00a7 1132(gXl) does not explicitly differentiate between plaintiffs and defendants, a court will seldom abuse its discretion by refusing to award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to a defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"abi-dedup-0\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the district court denying attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to the Company is</p>\n<p id=\"A4d\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-9\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140 provides in pertinent part: It shall be unlawful for any person to discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline, or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which he is entitled under the provision of an employee benefit plan, ... or for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right to which such participant may become entitled under the plan, this subchapter, or the Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act. . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b798-8\">. Section 1132(g) provides that the court may award attorneys\u2019 fees to either party. There is no requirement that a party must \u201cprevail\u201d in order to receive an award pursuant to \u00a7 1132(g). But, as a practical matter, we recognize that a court is more likely to find appropriate an award to a prevailing party than an award to a non-prevailing party. Here, in light of the Company\u2019s dilatory tactics and other relevant factors, however, we would find no abuse of discretion in denying attorneys\u2019 fees even if defendant had prevailed on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b799-8\">. <em>See </em>part III of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b799-9\">. In <em>Landro </em>v. <em>Glendenning Motorways, Inc., </em>625 F.2d 1344, 1355-56 (8th Cir. 1980), the Eighth Circuit construed \u00a7 1132(g) to require an award of attorneys\u2019 fees to a prevailing plaintiff, unless the defendant could demonstrate special circumstances that would render such an award unjust. But the court specifically limited its discussion to prevailing plaintiffs. The court explicitly declined to discuss whether a prevailing defendant may be awarded attorneys\u2019 fees absent a showing of plaintiffs bad faith. 625 F.2d at 1356 n.18. <em>But see Central States S. E. &amp; S. W. Areas Pension Fund v. Hitchings Trucking, Inc., </em>492 F.Supp. 906 (E.D. Mich. 1980), discussed in note 5, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b799-15\">. In <em>Central States S. E. &amp; S. W. Areas Pension Fund v. Hitchings Trucking, Inc., </em>492 F.Supp. 906, 909-10 (E.D.Mich.1980), the court rejected a multi-factor test similar to the one used here for the simpler \u201cgeneral rule\u201d that fees should be awarded to prevailing parties unless the particulars of the case would render such an award unjust. The court consequently awarded attorneys\u2019 fees to plaintiff, a pension fund, for the issue at trial upon which it prevailed, the employer\u2019s liability for pension fund contributions. But, the court found plaintiffs position after trial regarding the amount of defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>ant\u2019s liability to be \u201ctotally without merit,\u201d 492 F.Supp. at 908, and, therefore, awarded attorneys\u2019 fees to the defendant employer for the latter phase of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">First, we note that because of the discretionary nature of \u00a7 1132(g), the opinion in <em>patch-ings Trucking </em>does not suggest that it would have been an abuse of discretion to <em>deny </em>the award of fees to defendant in that case or in this case, even if we adopted the \u201cprevailing party\u201d test. Second, to the extent that <em>patch-ings Trucking </em>holds that success on the merits entitles a defendant to attorneys\u2019 fees, we disagree. As discussed above, a reasonable exercise of discretion necessitates treating plaintiffs and defendants differently. Moreover, we do not find that the result in <em>patchings Trucking </em>conflicts with our holding here. The court in <em>patchings Trucking </em>did not rely solely on the defendant\u2019s success on the damages issue, but specifically found plaintiffs position to be totally meritless. In addition, plaintiff was a pension fund, not an individual employee, as here. It may well be that for an individual plaintiff, the court would have concluded that an award of fees to the \u201cprevailing\u201d defendant would have been unjust.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b800-7\">. In <em>Christianburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978), the Supreme Court set the standards for awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to defendants in Title VII actions. The attorneys\u2019 fee award provision of Title VII allows attorneys\u2019 fees only to a prevailing party, and has been interpreted to <em>require </em>an award of attorneys\u2019 fees to prevailing <em>plaintiffs </em>in all but special circumstances. 434 U.S. at 417, 98 S.Ct. at 698. But, the Court found that different considerations govern an award of fees to defendants, and that, therefore, a district court may exercise its discretion to award attorneys\u2019 fees to a prevailing defendant only \u201cupon a finding that the plaintiffs action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith.\u201d 434 U.S. at 421, 98 S.Ct. at 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">The Court then stated its reasons for treating plaintiffs and defendants differently for purposes of awarding attorneys\u2019 fees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-11\">No matter how honest one\u2019s belief that he has been the victim of discrimination, no matter how meritorious one\u2019s claim may appear at the outset, the course of litigation is rarely predictable. Decisive facts may not emerge until discovery or trial. The law may change or clarify in the midst of litigation. Even when the law or the facts appear questionable or unfavorable at the outset, a party may have an entirely reasonable ground for bringing suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-12\">434 U.S. at 422, 98 S.Ct. at 700-01. The Court recognized that in civil rights actions, plaintiffs act as \u201cprivate attorneys general\u201d in vindicating national policy. Although this factor is not as strongly applicable in ERISA cases, the reasons for the policy discouraging assessing attorneys\u2019 fees against plaintiffs is applicable to ERISA cases. In both instances, the reason for awarding fees to defendants is to discourage frivolous suits, and in both instances it is important not to punish plaintiffs whose actions fail even though they seemed reasonable at the outset.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-13\">The Fifth Circuit, in <em>Iron Workers, </em>indicated that it would not apply the <em>Christianburg Garment </em>distinction between prevailing plaintiffs and defendants to claims for attorneys\u2019 fees under ERISA. 624 F.2d at 1266 n.24. But, we do not find that our analysis of attorneys\u2019 fees under ERISA differs significantly from the Fifth Circuit\u2019s. The Fifth Circuit in <em>Iron Workers </em>adopted the five-factor test for deciding the appropriateness of awarding attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to \u00a7 1132(g). We merely express the view that, using the five-factor test, prevailing plaintiffs are more likely to be awarded attorneys\u2019 fees than prevailing defendants. We recognize, as did the Fifth Circuit, that \u00a7 1132(g) differs from civil rights attorneys\u2019 fees provisions. But we believe that, although civil rights and ERISA plaintiffs may differ, some of the same factors militate against assessing attorneys\u2019 fees against plaintiffs in both types of cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b801-8\">. We emphasize that we do not decide here under what circumstances a district court would abuse its discretion by awarding or refusing to award fees to plaintiffs. We also do not decide under what specific circumstances fees may be properly awarded to defendants. We only decide that it was proper to decline to award fees here and that weighing of the relevant factors seldom will justify assessment of attorney\u2019s fees and costs against plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
