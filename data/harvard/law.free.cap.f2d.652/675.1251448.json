The case concerns the propriety of the government\u2019s recapture under the provisions of Section 47(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 of a $9,867.97 investment tax credit taken by the Longs on their 1972 joint income tax return under Section 38 of the Code. On appeal, the primary issue raised concerns the validity of Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.47-3(f) under the authority of which the Commissioner of Internal Revenue acted in imposing the recapture tax. This Regulation defines the \u201cmere change in form\u201d exception of Section 47(b) to the recapture requirements of Section 47(a). The district court held the regulation invalid as applied to the \u201cparticular facts\u201d of this case, which was necessary for it to do in order to grant relief to the taxpayers. For the reasons which follow, we disagree as we hold that the regulation was valid and accordingly reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Charles and Ruth Long were the sole shareholders of Long Construction Company, a \u201cSubchapter S\u201d corporation engaged in the sand and gravel business. During the fiscal year ending October 31, 1972, the corporation purchased certain pieces of equipment which qualified as \u201csection 38 property.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cSection 38 property\u201d is defined in Section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code and refers, <em>inter alia, </em>to new or used (\u201cused section 38 property\u201d) deprecia-ble or amortizable tangible personal property and certain other tangible property used predominantly in the United States as an integral part of manufacturing, production or extraction. Under Section 38 of the Code, the purchaser of \u201csection 38 property\u201d is entitled to an investment tax credit, the amount of which is determined under Section 46 of the Code, which may be applied against the purchaser\u2019s income tax liability for the year of purchase. Where the purchaser, however, is a Subchapter S corporation, Section 48(e) of the Code provides that the investment credit shall be apportioned pro rata among the shareholders. Charles and Ruth Long therefore claimed the corporation\u2019s investment tax credit of $9,867.97 on their 1972 joint income tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">At the end of its 1972 fiscal year, the Long Construction Company was liquidated under Section 331(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The corporate assets, including those that had qualified for an investment credit, were distributed to the shareholders, Mr. and Mrs. Long, in exchange for their stock. The business once conducted by the corporation was continued by the Longs as a proprietorship, where the section 38 property was used as it had been used by the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">After an audit of the Longs\u2019 1972 return, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that the 1972 distribution in liquidation constituted an \u201cearly disposition\u201d of section 38 property which rendered the Longs liable for a recapture tax equal to the full amount of the investment credit under Section 47(a) of the Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Longs paid the $9,867.97 additional tax assessed by the Commissioner. Their claim for a refund was disallowed, and the Longs then commenced the instant action in the district court seeking a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">In the district court, the inquiry focused upon the applicability of section 47(b). Section 47(b) of the Code provides two specific exceptions to the recapture tax triggered by an \u201cearly disposition\u201d of section 38 property: \u201c(1) a transfer by reason of death, or (2) a transaction to which section 381(a) [relating to carryovers in certain corporate acquisitions] applies.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Sections 47(b)(1) and (2). Section 47(b) further excepts from a recapture tax transactions which involve a \u201cmere change in the form of conducting the trade or business ...\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under Treas. Reg. Section 1.47 \u2014 3(f)(l)(ii), the \u201cmere change in form\u201d exception is applicable only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">(a) The section 38 property ... is retained as section 38 property in the same trade or business,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-6\">(b) The transferor (or in a case where the transferor is a partnership, estate, trust, or electing small business corporation, the partner, beneficiary, or shareholder) of such section 38 property retains a substantial interest in such trade or business,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-11\">(c) Substantially all the assets (whether or not section 38 property) necessary to operate such trade or business are transferred to the transferee to whom such section 38 property is transferred, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-12\">(d) The basis of such section 38 property in the hands of the transferee is determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of such section 38 property in the hands of the transfer- or ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-13\">In the instant case, it is undisputed that the first three of these conditions were satisfied. It is also conceded that the final condition was not.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court was therefore called upon to determine the validity of Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.47-3(f)(l)(ii)(d). The court\u2019s conclusion that this final condition of the regulation was invalid as applied to the facts of the case rests on two determinations. First, after characterizing the liquidation of the Long Construction Company and continuation of the business as a proprietorship\u2019 as a \u201cclassic example of a mere change in the form of a business,\u201d the court determined that application of the regulation was inconsistent with language of the Code. Second, the court determined that the application of the regulation to these facts was inconsistent with the purpose of the recapture tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">As noted, Section 47(b) of the Code excepts from a recapture tax early dispositions of section 38 property which involve no more than the \u201cmere change in the form of conducting the trade or business.\u201d The Longs have argued that this language, when given its plain meaning, includes transactions such as the one involved in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We have recently been reminded by the Supreme Court, however, that the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 is \u201canything but plain.\u201d <em>Fulman v. United States, </em>434 U.S. 528, 532-33, n. 7, 98 S.Ct. 841, 845 n. 7, 55 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978). Indeed, it is for this reason that Congress has delegated to \u201cmasters of the subject\u201d the primary task of interpreting this complex Code. <em>National Muffler Dealers Association v. United States, </em>440 U.S. 472, 477, 99 S.Ct. 1304, 1307, 59 L.Ed.2d 519 (1979). In any event, we believe the Longs\u2019 argument misconceives the nature of our review of the challenged regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">All parties to this appeal agree that Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.47-3(f)(l)(ii)(d) is a legislative regulation which was issued pursuant to a clear congressional delegation of rule making authority.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Our review of the regulation as a consequence is limited in scope. In cases of this sort, \u201c[t]he rule of the judiciary . . . begins and ends with assuring that the Commissioner\u2019s regulations fall within his authority to implement the congressional mandate in some reasonable manner.\u201d <em>Bates v. United States, </em>581 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>575, 580 (6th Cir. 1978) quoting <em>United States v. Correll, </em>389 U.S. 299, 307, 88 S.Ct. 445, 450, 19 L.Ed.2d 537 (1967). Our task, therefore, is to determine only whether the regulation is clearly in conflict with the statute\u2019s language and purpose. If it is not, we must uphold it, even were we to believe the Longs\u2019 interpretation of Section 47(b) the better. <em>Buczynski v. General Motors Corp., </em>616 F.2d 1238, 1243 (3rd Cir.), aff\u2019d <em>sub nom., Alessi v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., </em>448 U.S. 911, 101 S.Ct. 25, 65 L.Ed.2d 1141 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The government contends that the expression \u201cmere change in form\u201d is not unique to the recapture tax provision of the Code. In other contexts, the government argues, the expression has been used to describe certain transactions not treated as taxable exchanges. Since such exchanges result in a continuity of basis in the transferred assets, the regulation\u2019s requirement that the basis of the section 38 property \u201cin the hands of the transferee [be] determined ... by reference to the [property\u2019s] basis in the hands of the transferor\u201d is therefore consistent with the \u201cmere change in form\u201d language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The legislative history of Section 47(b) provides little help in determining what precisely Congress intended by the \u201cmere change in form\u201d language. The single reference at all helpful indicates only that a \u201cmere change in form\u201d could be effected \u201cthrough incorporation, the formation of a partnership, or otherwise.\u201d S.Rep.No. 1881, 87 Cong., 2d Session; U.S.Code &amp; Adm. News, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. p. 3453 (1962). Nonetheless, what is instructive of this brief reference is that both examples can entail a tax-free transfer of property and a carryover basis for that transferred property. Specifically, Section 721 of the Code provides for the tax-free treatment of contributions of property to a partnership in exchange for partnership interests, and, under Section 723, the property contributed inherits the basis of the property in the hands of the transferor. Likewise, Section 351 of the Code treats as a nontaxable exchange the transfer of property to a controlled corporation in exchange for the stock or securities of the corporation, and, under Section 362(a), the basis of the property transferred is determined with reference to its basis in the hands of the trans-feror.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">Such transfers have often been described as transactions in which there is but a \u201cmere change in form.\u201d <em>See e. g., Kamborian\u2019s Estate v. Commissioner, </em>469 F.2d 219, 221 (1st Cir. 1972); <em>Hempt Brothers, Inc. v. United States, </em>354 F.Supp. 1172, 1176 (M.D. Pa.1973), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>490 F.2d 1172 (3rd Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 826, 95 S.Ct. 44, 42 L.Ed.2d 50 (1974); Bittker &amp; Eustice, <em>Federal Income Taxation of Corporations and Shareholders, </em>H 3.01 at 3-7 (4th ed.). <em>See also, Helvering v. Cement Investors, Inc., </em>316 U.S. 527, 533, 62 S.Ct. 1125, 1128, 86 L.Ed. 1649 (1942); <em>American Compress &amp; Warehouse Co. v. Bender, </em>70 F.2d 655, 657 (5th Cir. 1934); <em>Portland Oil Co. v. Commissioner, </em>109 F.2d 479, 488 (1st Cir. 1940); <em>Barker v. United States, </em>200 F.2d 223, 228 (9th Cir. 1952). Indeed, it is the congressional recognition that the transfers described in the provisions work only a change in form, not in substance, which largely explains the decision by Congress not to tax such transactions. <em>See Kamborian\u2019s Estate v. Commissioner, </em>469 F.2d at 221. A similar recognition underlines the congressional decision of Section 361(a) not to tax a corporate reorganization, described in \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F) as \u201ca mere change in identity, form, or place of organization, however, effected.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Movielab, Inc. v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number><em>States, </em>494 F.2d 693, 698 (Ct.Cl.1974). As is the case with the tax-free transfer of property to a partnership or to a controlled corporation, property transferred in connection with such a plan of reorganization inherits a carryover basis under Section 362(b) of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Thus, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue has consistently taken the position that the expression \u201cmere change in form\u201d refers only to nontaxable exchanges which thus result in a carryover basis. For instance, in Section 50A(c)(2)(B)(ii) of the Code,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which concerns a tax credit for work incentive expenses, where Congress has used the expression \u201cmere change in form of conducting the trade or business,\u201d the Commissioner, in Treas.Reg. Section 1.50A\u2014 4(g)(l)(ii)(d) has interpreted this language requiring that the \u201cbasis of [the assets] . . . in the hands of the transferee [be] determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of such [assets] ... in the hands of the transferor.\u201d Similarly, Treas.Reg. Section 1.167(a)-ll(b)(7)(ii), issued pursuant to Section 167(m) of the Code which concerns depreciation based on the class life system, requires as a necessary condition for a \u201cmere change in the form of a trade or business,\u201d that the \u201cbasis of such property in the hands of the transferee [be] determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of the property in the hands of the transferor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">In contrast with these types of nontaxable exchanges are transactions such as the one involved in the instant case. Though in a sense the Longs have \u201conly changed the fashion in which [they] hold title to the assets,\u201d the Internal Revenue Code regards a liquidating distribution under Section 331 as a change in substance and treats it in the same manner as a sale or exchange of stock would be treated.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Bittker &amp; Eustice, Federal <em>Income Taxation of Corporations and Shareholders, </em>1111.01 at 11 \u2014 4 (4th ed.); <em>Cf. Kind v. Commissioner, </em>54 T.C. 600 (1970) (Distribution of assets from corporation in liquidation under Section 331(a) to shareholder who operated business as proprietorship and then transferred assets to new corporation was a change in substance and hence not entitled to tax-free treatment under Section 368(a)(1)(F)). As a consequence of that treatment, the property is given a new basis under Section 334(a) equal to the fair market value. The recipient of a liquidating distribution by a partnership is similarly taxed under Section 736 of the Code. Having arranged for and accepted the liquidating distribution, the Longs cannot now avoid the consequences of Section 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">It is therefore not surprising that the Commissioner, in Treasury Regulations issued under a number of Code provisions, has contrasted liquidations with \u201cmere changes in form.\u201d For instance, the Commissioner has provided that the expression \u201csold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of\u201d would encompass \u201cthe surrender of a stock certificate for corporate assets in complete or partial liquidation of a corporation pursuant to section 331 . . . [but would] not, however, extend to transactions which are mere changes in form.\u201d Treas.Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 520.2032-l(c)(l); 20.6166-3(e)(2); 1.1015-5(a)(l)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">We conclude from the foregoing that the requirement of Treas.Reg. Section 1.47-3(f)(l)(ii)(d) that the basis of transfer-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>red section 38 property must be determined with reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor is not plainly inconsistent with the \u201cmere change in form\u201d language of Section 47(b). We further conclude that the regulation\u2019s requirement is not in conflict with the purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The legislative history of Section 47 is clear that one of the primary purposes for imposing a recapture tax was to \u201cguard against the quick turnover of assets by those seeking multiple credit.\u201d S.Rep.No. 1881. 87 Cong., 2d Sess.; U.S.Code &amp; Adm. News, 87th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 3320 (1962). <em>See also, Charbonnet </em>v. <em>United States, </em>455 F.2d 1195, 1199 (5th Cir. 1972). One of the reasons giving rise to a multiple credit problem is that an investment credit is allowable both for \u201cnew section 38 property\u201d, as defined in Section 48(b), and \u201cused section 38 property,\u201d as defined in Section 48(c). Under Section 48(c), a credit for \u201cused section 38 property\u201d is permitted where such property is \u201cacquired by purchase.\u201d The word \u201cpurchase\u201d is defined in \u00a7 48(c)(3)(A) as having the same meaning assigned to the term by \u00a7 179(d)(2) of the Code, which broadly defines the term to include \u201cany acquisition of property\u201d where \u201cthe basis of the property in the hands of the person acquiring it is <em>not </em>determined ... in whole or in part by reference to the adjusted basis of such property in the hands of the person from whom acquired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">It is thus apparent that Treas.Reg. Section 1.47-3(f)(l)(ii)(d) effectively limits the \u201cmere change in form exception\u201d of Section 47(b) to transactions which cannot constitute \u201cpurchases\u201d of \u201cused section 38 property\u201d. At the same time, the regulation excludes from the \u201cmere change in form\u201d exception those transactions which do qualify as \u201cpurchases.\u201d One such category of transfers is the distribution of assets in a liquidation of a corporation not involving a carryover basis. <em>See Smyers </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>57 T.C. 189, 191\u2014194 (1971); Rev. Rul. 73-761, 1973-2 Cum.Bull. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">Not every transaction involving the assignment of a new basis will necessarily qualify for an investment credit for the \u201cpurchase\u201d of \u201cused section 38 property.\u201d The definition of the term \u201cpurchase\u201d in Section 179(d) of the Code excludes transfers between certain related parties where their relationship would result in the disal-lowance of losses under Section 267 or Section 707(b). The definition further excludes transactions between members of an affiliated group. Likewise, Section 48(c) itself excludes from being treated as \u201cused section 38 property\u201d property used \"by a person who used such property before such acquisition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">In the instant case, it appears that the Longs would not be entitled to another investment credit given the attribution rules of Sections 267(c)(2) and (4) and the definition of \u201cused section 38 property\u201d in Section 48(c), though the latter is problematic. <em>See, Holloman </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>551 F.2d 987 (5th Cir. 1977). We think, however, this fact irrelevant to the question of the regulation\u2019s validity. <em>See, United States Steel Corp. v. Commissioner, </em>617 F.2d 942, 954 (2nd Cir. 1980). The draftsman of regulations is necessarily forced to consider the need for blanket rules which can easily be applied and consulted by taxpayers looking for guidance in planning their affairs. As such, it may indeed be impossible to draft regulations which, when applied, will in every instance actually further the legislative purpose. This is especially so in \u201cthis area of limitless factual variations\u201d. <em>United States v. Correll, </em>389 U.S. at 307, 88 S.Ct. at 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">Though the application of the challenged regulation to the facts of this case may not actually further the legislative purpose, we cannot conclude that its application is in conflict with that purpose, and it is only this question with which we are concerned. We note in this regard that since the challenged regulation became final on October 9,1967, Congress has amended Section 47(a) no fewer than six times<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and Section 47(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>once.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Even were the regulation\u2019s relationship to Section 47(b) not so readily apparent, we would be reluctant to conclude that the regulation is inconsistent with congressional intentions. Regulations of longstanding under Code sections which Congress has thereafter frequently amended may be viewed as reflecting the approval of Congress. <em>See Lykes v. United States, </em>343 U.S. 118, 127, 72 S.Ct. 585, 590, 96 L.Ed. 791 (1952); <em>United States v. Correll, </em>389 U.S. at 305-06, 88 S.Ct. at 448-A49.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b756-9\">.

Section 47(a)(1) of the Code provides that where \u201csection 38 property\u201d is \u201cdisposed of, or otherwise ceases to be section 38 property . . . before the close of the useful life which was taken into account in computing the credit under section 38,\u201d the tax for the year is to be increased by the difference between the amount of the credit originally claimed and the credit that would have been allowed taking into account a useful life ending on the date of the \u201cearly disposition.\u201d In the instant case, it is undisputed that the Longs were subject to a recapture tax of $9,867.97 in 1972, assuming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>the distribution in liquidation was an \u201cearly disposition\u201d of section 38 property and none of the exceptions to the recapture tax provisions are applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b757-8\">.

Under \u00a7 334(a) of the Code, the basis of property received in a liquidation to which \u00a7 331 applies is its fair market value at the time of the distribution, and as such is not determined by reference to its basis in the hands of the corporation.

The Longs have also argued that there can be no investment credit recapture because no section 38 property was \u201cdisposed of, or otherwise cease[d] to be section 38 property\u201d, <em>i. e. </em>the distribution in liquidation of the Long Construction Company\u2019s section 38 property was not an \u201cearly disposition\u201d under \u00a7 47(a) of the Code. Simply put, they contend that because the investment credit of a Subchapter S corporation is passed through to the shareholders (who, under \u00a7 48(e) are \u201ctreated as the taxpayers] with respect to such investment.\u201d), the liquidating distribution of the corporation\u2019s section 38 property represent, in effect, a \u201ctransfer\u201d to themselves of their own assets. Thus, where the entity generating the investment credit is a Subchapter S corporation, there can be a disposition under \u00a7 47(a) only where the shareholders \u201cdispose\u201d of their shares. It is not altogether clear whether this argument was raised below; it certainly was not considered by the district court. At any rate, we believe the argument to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">The legislative history of the investment credit provisions of the Code makes it plain that a shareholder of a Subchapter S Corporation \u201cwill be subject to the provisions of section 47\u201d if \u201cthe <em>corporation subsequently disposes of such property </em>[section 38 property], or if the shareholder disposes of his stock in such [Subchapter S] corporation.\u201d S.Rep.No. 1881, 87 Cong., 2d Sess., U.S.Code &amp; Adm.News, 87th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 3304, 3464-65 (1962) (emphasis added). This view is reflected in Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.47-4(a), which provides that a shareholder of a Subchapter S corporation is subject to \u00a7 47 of the Code if the corporation \u201cdisposes of any section 38 property ...\u201d The Longs have not challenged the validity of this regulation (in fact, they have not seen fit to even allude to it in their brief), and, as a legislative regulation, we must give effect to it. <em>See </em>note 7, <em>infra. </em>The Longs\u2019 argument is thus reduced to the question of whether the corporation \u201cdisposed\u201d of its section 38 property when it distributed such property in liquidation. Here, however, the parties are agreed that a distribution in liquidation constitutes a \u201cdisposition\u201d under \u00a7 47(a). <em>Ramm v. Commissioner, </em>72 T.C. 671 (1979). <em>See also, </em>Rev.Rul. 73-515, 1973-2 Cum.Bull. 7; S.Rep.No. 1881, 87 Cong., 2d Sess.; U.S.Code &amp; Adm.News, 87th Cong., 2d Session, p. 3450 (1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b758-11\">. Section 38(b) of the Code provides that the \u201cSecretary [of the Treasury] or his delegate [the Commissioner of Internal Revenue] shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purpose [of the investment credit provisions of the Code].\u201d It has been held that regulations issued pursuant to this section are legislative. <em>Yellow Freight System v.

In contrast, an interpretive regulation is not binding on this court. Nonetheless, we customarily defer to an interpretive Treasury Regulation issued under \u00a7 7805(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, unless the regulation is \u201cunreasonable and plainly inconsistent with the revenue statutes.\u201d <em>Fulman v.

Of course, \u00a7 368(a)(1) includes other types of reorganizations in addition to those which are \u201cmere changes in form.\u201d The transfer of section 38 property in connection with these other types of tax-free reorganizations would in many instances also be excepted from the recapture tax of \u00a7 47(a) under the specific exception of \u00a7 47(b)(2). As noted, \u00a7 47(b)(2) excepts from recapture tax \u201cA transaction to which section 381(a) applies.\u201d In other words, \u00a7 47(b)(2) would except from \u00a7 47(a) tax-free liquidations of subsidiaries governed by \u00a7 332 and tax-free organizations under \u00a7 368(a)(1)(A), (C), (D) and (F), all of which of course involve carryover basis under \u00a7\u00a7 362(b) and 334(b)(1). It should be noted that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>exception of \u00a7 47(b)(2) thus does not apply to similar transactions for which a carryover basis is not provided for under \u00a7 334; namely, liquidations, to which the basis provisions of \u00a7 334(b)(2) apply. We think it difficult to imagine that Congress would specifically decide in \u00a7 47(b)(2) to subject to recapture tax a liquidation of a subsidiary and at the same time have intended that other liquidations would be excepted from recapture tax under the general \u201c. .. mere change in form\u201d exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"aul-dedup-0\">.
