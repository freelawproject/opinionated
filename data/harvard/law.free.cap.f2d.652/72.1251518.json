SKELLY WRIGHT, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b154-20\">These appeals are the most recent stage in a process beginning in 1966, during the course of which the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has nurtured a dynamic new medium: domestic satellite communication. The order under review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>In Re Satellite Business Systems, </em>62 FCC2d 997 (1977), <em>reconsideration denied, </em>64 FCC2d 872 (1977), granted Satellite Business Systems (SBS) authority to construct three domestic satellites and four fixed domestic satellite earth stations; it also gave SBS authority to operate channels of communications over the new system as a common carrier. SBS is a partnership among Comsat General Business Communications, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of an affiliate of Communications Satellite Corporation, Information Satellite Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IBM Corporation, and Aetna Satellite Communications, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-22\">At present, domestic satellite communications services are provided by RCA Global Communications (RCA), Western Union Telegraph Company, American Satellite Corporation (a subsidiary of Fairchild Industries, Inc., leasing a part of the Western Union system), and a joint venture between American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) and General Telephone &amp; Electronics Corporation (GTE) (leasing the COM-STAR Domestic Satellite system from Com-sat General). These companies may be joined by a recently-formed joint venture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>between American Satellite and Continental Telephone Company,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and by a system proposed by Xerox Corporation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The AT&amp;T/GTE venture apparently has the potential to dominate the new field, by virtue of the overwhelming market position of its parents in the terrestrial specialized communications field. The Commission therefore restricted the AT&amp;T/GTE venture from full competition as a common carrier for a three-year period, so that other firms would have time to establish a competitive foothold in the industry.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Now that FCC-imposed restrictions on their satellite operations have lapsed, the telephone companies will be able to lower the per unit cost of their satellite services by routing part or all of their switched telephone network traffic (WATS or MTS) via satellite. This will spread the fixed costs of the system over a larger number of units, thereby enabling the venture to price its satellite channels below the price of its competitors, who do not have the benefit of such a large arbitrarily-adjustable monopoly demand base.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, since satellite communication services will be in direct competition with terrestrial services \u2014 a field dominated by AT&amp;T \u2014 AT&amp;T\u2019s potential market dominance in the overall specialized communications industry is considerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The SBS entry into this concentrated industry would provide a significant increase in capacity of a highly technologically innovative sort. It would be the first system to integrate voice, data, and image transmission service in a largely digital format, to make available small earth stations at customers\u2019 premises, to make more efficient use of the available spectrum through a \u201ctime division multiple access\u201d and demand assignment technology, and to operate in the 12 and 14 GHz frequency bands.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For purposes of this appeal, appellants concede that the SBS entry would provide a significant and beneficial new public service. Although SBS lacks the competitive advantages of AT&amp;T and GTE described above, the combined expertise of Comsat in satellites and IBM in data processing \u2014 a major expected use for the domestic satellite system \u2014 offers the promise, as the FCC has repeatedly emphasized during the course of this proceeding, of challenging the expected market dominance of AT&amp;T.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If all goes well, SBS satellites could be in the air by early 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-16\">Twelve parties \u2014 six competitors of SBS, two computer or communications equipment manufacturers\u2019 associations, two states, and two federal agencies<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u2014 opposed the grant of a license to SBS on various grounds in the proceedings before the Commission. Four of these parties \u2014 American Satellite, Western Union, AT&amp;T, and the United States Department of Justice \u2014 appeal the Commission\u2019s final order.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> They argue principally that the FCC erroneously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>denied an evidentiary hearing into the possibilities of anticompetitive consequences resulting from the joint venture of Comsat and IBM.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> They ask this court to reverse and remand to the FCC for such an eviden-tiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">The Commission argues that evidentiary hearings are not required by statute for all disputed issues, and that such hearings would not prove useful in evaluating the competitive conditions in a changing and experimental industry such as this one. Moreover, the Commission asserts that SBS\u2019s entry into the concentrated domestic satellite industry would interject strong and immediate competition, and that delay of SBS entry for the purpose of holding evi-dentiary hearings would not be in the public interest. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The Commission\u2019s policy over the past ten years has been to develop the domestic satellite communications industry by permitting limited open entry and encouraging technological competition. Entry is limited only by legal, technical, and financial fitness qualifications.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In its <em>First Report and Order (Domsat I), </em>22 FCC2d 86 (1970), issued after four years of study and public comment, the FCC concluded that satellites could play an important role in the field of domestic communications, but that the risks and uncertainties involved in the development of the industry were substantial. The Commission invited potential applicants to submit concrete system proposals for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">In its <em>Second Report and Order (Domsat II), </em>35 FCC2d 844 (1972), the Commission rejected the suggestion that it should restrict entry to one or a small number of licensees. It reached this conclusion partly on the basis of comments submitted by the Department of Justice detailing the delay, expense, and disutility of comparative hearings to select licensees. The Commission stated that \u201c[t]he presence of competitive sources of specialized services, both among satellite system licensees and between satellite and terrestrial systems, should encourage service and technical innovation and provide an impetus for efforts to minimize costs and charges to the public.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, it adopted the multiple entry policy, permitting firms to enter the industry singly or jointly, subject only to a basic fitness determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">In adopting this policy, the FCC was aware that <em>every one </em>of the potential applicants for entry presented possible antitrust problems. All were satellite or communications equipment manufacturers, satellite users, broadcast networks, or major firms in related industries.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Each potential applicant would be in a position to use its market power in a related field to affect the domestic satellite communications market. Nevertheless, the FCC decided, at the urging of its staff and the Department of Justice,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> that none of the potential appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>cants should be disqualified. It reasoned that only a company with experience in a related industry would be able to compete successfully in the market.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Moreover, FCC and the Department of Justice agreed that the Commission\u2019s powers to impose restrictions and take other remedial action would suffice to minimize anticompetitive abuses or to cure them should they occur.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Commission specifically approved the formation of joint ventures, which offer the advantages of risk sharing and pooling of technical and financial resources.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">To obviate the anticompetitive consequences of entry by certain of the applicants, the FCC imposed restrictions on some satellite companies. Among the restricted companies was Comsat, which was required to form a separate corporate subsidiary to enter the domestic satellite industry. That subsidiary was required to choose between operating as a carrier\u2019s carrier on behalf of AT&amp;T or others, and providing communications services directly to customers.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Later, on reconsideration, the FCC substantially modified these restrictions.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">Following the <em>Domsat II </em>policy, the FCC approved domestic satellite communications license applications without evidentiary hearings on antitrust consequences. In separate orders issued the same day in 1973, the FCC approved applications by AT&amp;T <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and by GTE<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> to construct and operate earth stations and to provide domestic communications services. In 1975, however, the Commission granted permission to the two telephone companies to combine their satellite operations in one joint venture.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The FCC was fully aware of the possible antitrust consequences of this decision: in granting GTE\u2019s earlier separate application the Commission had noted that GTE\u2019s separate entry \u201ccould also lessen AT&amp;T\u2019s dominance and economic influence in the domestic communications field.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Despite this elimination of actual competition between the two firms, neither the Department of Justice nor the Federal Trade Commission objected, nor did any party request or receive an evidentiary hearing on antitrust consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">On that same day in 1973 the FCC approved applications by RCA,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Hughes Air<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>craft Company,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and American Satellite<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> for authority to construct and operate domestic satellite facilities. The Network Project, an unincorporated association that favored government ownership of satellite systems, opposed the applications, partly on antitrust grounds, and asked for an eviden-tiary hearing. The FCC denied an eviden-tiary hearing and granted all three applications. The Department of Justice did not oppose the grant of the applications or the denial of an evidentiary hearing. This court affirmed the Commission in <em>Network Project v. FCC, </em>511 F.2d 786 (D.C.Cir.1975).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Because of its precedential importance to this case, it is worth quoting the <em>Network Project </em>opinion at some length.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">In answer to the Network Project\u2019s antitrust arguments the court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">We need not speculate whether the arrangement will in fact some day so operate as to create antitrust problems. It is enough that the proposals are not <em>per se </em>a violation, * * * and that the Commission reasonably concluded that a violation would not occur. Indeed, the Commission found that competition would be enhanced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 796 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">In response to the Network Project\u2019s argument that an evidentiary hearing was erroneously denied,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">[A] hearing is not necessary where the Commission\u2019s decision is based on inferences and conclusions drawn from undisputed facts. Petitioner does not dispute any of the material facts on which the Commission\u2019s conclusions rest, but asserts only that insufficient facts were adduced to make a public interest finding. * * * The Commission was faced with a situation in which it determined that the new and increased services would be beneficial but, unlike the usual common carrier case, was unable to define with assurance the precise scope or content of all aspects of the proposals. In this unique and experimental situation, we believe that the Commission rationally determined, on the basis of all necessary factual investigation, that the grant of the applications, subject \u2014 as the Commission recognizes\u2014 to continuing supervision and evaluation, is in the public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 796-797 (footnote omitted). The court specifically noted \u201cthat the Commission acted reasonably in taking cognizance of the fact that, in these special circumstances, considerable lead time is required for preparation of a system, and in determining that the public interest required avoidance of any unnecessary delay.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 797 n.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-14\">II. HISTORY OF THE COMSAT/IBM VENTURE</p>\n<p id=\"b158-15\">As we have noted above,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> the FCC initially decided in <em>Domsat II </em>to prevent Com-sat from operating both as a carrier\u2019s carrier for AT&amp;T or others and as a multipurpose carrier serving customers directly.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In its <em>Reconsideration Order, </em>38 FCC2d 665 (1972), the FCC relaxed this restriction, subject to the following conditions: (1) Comsat would have to be a minority participant in a joint venture, and would have to seek prior FCC approval before increasing its ownership above a one-third interest or acquiring <em>de facto </em>control in any fashion; (2) no AT&amp;T officer or director could serve as a director of Comsat; and (3) Comsat would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>be required to establish a separate corporation to operate its domestic system, and this separate corporation could not include any representatives of AT&amp;T. <em>Id. </em>at 684-685 1142, 44, 45. Under this modified policy the Commission declared a joint venture between Comsat, Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, and MCI Communications Corporation (to be called CML Satellite Corporation) eligible for further consideration to become a domestic satellite communications licensee. Subsequently, for financial reasons, Lockheed and MCI withdrew from the CML venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">A. <em>The CML Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"AGU\">On July 15, 1974 Comsat, in conjunction with IBM, applied <em>for </em>approval of changes in the structure of the CML venture. As proposed, Comsat General would have owned 45 percent, and IBM 55 percent, of the operating company. Some seventeen parties filed written submissions concerning the proposed entry,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and the Commission set the matter for oral argument <em>en banc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Opponents of the Comsat/IBM entry made three principal objections to it. First, they argued that IBM could dominate the satellite transmission of data communications by offering a packaged end-to-end data processing communications service compatible only with IBM equipment. Second, they argued that IBM could promote its satellite services to its computer and data processing customers, possibly by offering discounts or other advantages to customers for using both IBM equipment and IBM satellite services. Finally, they argued that IBM and Comsat, both of which do business with AT&amp;T, would refrain from competing with AT&amp;T in the voice and image communications market, and would concentrate instead on the data communications market.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">In February 1975 the FCC released its <em>CML Decision, </em>51 FCC2d 14 (1975),<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> disapproving the specific proposal, but delineating the circumstances under which entry by Comsat and IBM would be considered. The FCC decided not to hold evidentiary hearings on the antitrust issues, noting that they were substantially similar to issues already considered and decided in the earlier <em>Domsat </em>proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 43-44, 1147-48. Nevertheless, the Commission imposed restrictions on the Comsat/IBM entry to reduce the likelihood of anticom-petitive effects. To prevent IBM\u2019s abuse of its dominant position in the computer and data processing industries, the FCC required the venture to provide for interconnection of its customers\u2019 data processing and communications systems on reasonable terms and without discrimination, and required it to submit a detailed description of such arrangements to the FCC in advance of its application. Moreover, the Commission required IBM to create a separate corporate entity to operate its satellite system.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> This entity was forbidden to market IBM equipment, and IBM was forbidden to market satellite communications services except through the separate entity. To ensure that the venture would compete vigorously with AT&amp;T,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> the FCC required that Comsat and IBM adopt one of three permissible forms of business organization. One of them, called the \u201cbalanced CML option,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>provided the framework for the plan now under review. The FCC described the option in this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\">Comsat General and IBM may choose to participate as partners in CML with another corporate partner(s) upon condition that no partner in CML shall have less than a 10% ownership interest or more than a 49% ownership interest or otherwise be in a position whereby it could exercise <em>de facto </em>control.!<footnotemark>36</footnotemark>!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-5\"><em>CML Decision, </em>51 FCC2d at 38. In addition, the FCC stated its intention to employ its continuing authority to impose additional restrictions should the Comsat/IBM venture later cause serious anticompetitive effects. <em>Id. </em>at 44, 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Subject to these restrictions, the FCC determined that IBM, backed by its extensive financial resources and its experience concerning the usages and needs of customers in communications and data processing, offered the prospect of a strong and innovative competitor to AT&amp;T. Moreover, in view of the formidable barriers to entry into the industry, the Commission concluded that requiring Comsat and IBM to enter the field separately might well deprive the industry of one or both as competitors. Therefore, the FCC adopted the policy that is now being challenged in this case: to permit a Comsat/IBM joint venture, subject to protective conditions. SBS, <em>ne\u00e9 </em>CML, is the product of that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">B. <em>The Order Under Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"AEB\">Following the <em>CML Decision, </em>IBM and Comsat found a third partner to pursue the \u201cbalanced CML option\u201d: Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company, through its subsidiary, Aetna Satellite Communications, Inc. Under the. agreement each partner has committed $55 million to the enterprise, and may provide additional funds if needed.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> During the pre-operational phase of the system the three partners will exercise equal control. When the system becomes operational Aetna will have the choice to retain its one-third equity interest in SBS, or to convert a part of that investment to debt. In no event may Aetna\u2019s equity interest fall below 15 percent. Major decisions will require the unanimous consent of the partners.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">In December 1975 SBS organized as a partnership and applied to the FCC for a license. Opponents of the license<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> made many objections,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> but for purposes of this appeal only the antitrust-related objections are significant. In summary, the most important such objections are:<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> (1) that the SBS joint venture eliminates the actual competition that would occur were IBM and Comsat to enter the field individually, or the potential competition that would occur if one of the firms were to enter and the other to be perceived by the industry as a strong potential entrant; (2) that the combined strength of Comsat and IBM would be so great as to raise barriers to entry and to chill competition in the industry; and (3) that IBM could engage in predatory conduct in the satellite industry, the data processing industry, or both.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">The FCC denied an evidentiary hearing into the various objections by SBS\u2019s oppo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>nents, and granted the license in a lengthy opinion released on February 8, 1977. It explained its reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-4\">In sum, we have chosen to dispose of SBS\u2019 Applications without a trial-type ev-identiary hearing because (1) the benefits to the public of a more rapid institution of service far outweigh any possible benefits of such time-consuming procedures; (2) \u201cfacts\u201d which lend themselves to ad-duction by oral testimony would not be forthcoming in such proceedings; (3) in ten years of rulemaking and application comment proceedings the issues now before us have been explored in detail and no new material is sought to be placed before us through trial-type evidentiary procedures; (4) we have assumed for the purposes of analysis that the parties\u2019 contentions are correct and drawn appropriate inferences therefrom; and (5) in view of the conditions and limitations we are imposing herein, as well as our continuing regulatory supervision and the remedies available to us, we can and will assure that the SBS proposal will serve the public interest. The domestic satellite field remains experimental, and speculation about its future is as tenable through the notice and comment procedures which we have adopted, as it would be in trial-type evidentiary proceedings. In this unique environment, SBS\u2019 future actions and conduct, under our close regulatory supervision, will be far more determinative than would speculation in an evidentiary proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-5\"><em>SBS Decision, </em>62 FCC2d at 1068 f 199, JA 1591. With appropriate restrictions,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> mod-elled on those in the <em>Domsat II </em>and <em>CML </em>decisions, the FCC granted the proposed construction and operating authority to SBS. The Commission emphasized, however, that \u201c[i]f, for any reason, we deem it in the public interest to revisit any of these matters, we will not hesitate to do so. And we so condition our action today.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1044-1045 1122, JA 1567-1568. Reconsideration was denied, 64 FCC2d 872 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">American Satellite, Western Union, AT&amp;T, and the Department of Justice have appealed the FCC order to this court. The appeal was first heard by a panel of this court, which released on August 29, 1978 a <em>per curiam </em>opinion reversing the Commission. The panel held: (1) that the FCC employed the wrong legal standard in balancing the public interest benefits of the SBS entry against the alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and (2) that the FCC did not adequately justify its failure to hold an evidentiary hearing on the antitrust question in the case. Because of the importance of the issues raised, we voted to rehear the appeal <em>en banc, </em>and vacated the panel opinion.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> All parties and the <em>amicus curiae </em>have submitted supplemental briefs to assist the <em>en banc </em>court. At our request, their briefs primarily addressed two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-10\">(1) Whether the case law and the legislative history of Section 11 of the Clayton Act (a) constrain the Court to interpret that provision as imposing \u201can absolute enforcement responsibility\u201d on the FCC; or (b) warrant the interpretation of subsection 11(a) as a grant of discretionary enforcement authority, and the interpretation of subsection 11(b) as defining the procedures to be followed whenever such enforcement authority is exercised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-11\">(2) Whether, and in what respects, the validity of the FCC\u2019s licensing determination is affected by the failure to conduct a full evidentiary hearing on the possibility of an antitrust violation and to review and analyze in depth such considerations.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">III. THE ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE FCC</p>\n<p id=\"AW\">More than ten years ago this court made clear that \u201ccompetitive considerations are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>an important element of the \u2018public interest\u2019 \u201d standard which governs federal agency decisions. <em>Northern Natural Gas Co. v. FPC, </em>399 F.2d 953, 961 (D.C.Cir.1968). We therefore required such agencies to \u201cmake findings related to the pertinent antitrust policies, draw conclusions from the findings, and weigh these conclusions along with other important public interest considerations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 961.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">No party to this proceeding denies that the FCC must make the appropriate findings and conclusions. Western Union and American Satellite, however, urge us to adopt a more demanding standard for the enforcement by the FCC of the Clayton Act. They argue that under Section 11 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 21 (1976), the FCC has an \u201cunwaivable and unwavering\u201d obligation to enforce the Clayton Act, and that this obligation \u201ccannot be limited absent total frustration of the FCC\u2019s regulatory scheme * * <footnotemark>46</footnotemark> In other words, they argue that if a proposed entry would violate the Clayton Act the FCC must reject the proposal, no matter how important it might otherwise be to the public interest.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The FCC employed a different legal standard in reaching the decision under review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">[T]he Sherman and Clayton Acts assume that the public interest is served by competition, in and of itself. Under the statutory fabric of regulation and of the Communications Act, however, we are required to decide where the public interest lies, and competition is but one element of a determination of the public interest. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-8\"><em>SBS Decision, </em>62 FCC2d at 1069 H 204, JA 1592. In other words, the FCC asserts that it has \u201cprosecutorial discretion\u201d with respect to antitrust enforcement. In this contention the FCC is joined not only by SBS, but also by the Department of Justice and the FTC.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">The position urged by American Satellite and Western Union would seem to be foreclosed by our recent statement in <em>Home Box Office, Inc. v. FCC, </em>567 F.2d 9, 40 n.67 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 829, 98 S.Ct. 829, 54 L.Ed.2d 89 (1977): \u201cWe do not agree with the suggestion of some petitioners that the [Federal Communications] Commission must demonstrate that the means it has chosen have the least impact on competition consistent with achievement of the Commission\u2019s purposes. * * * Anticompetitive factors are also only one of a number of factors to be considered under the Communications Act * * *.\u201d (Citations omitted.) However, as the original panel opinion pointed out,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> neither <em>Home Box Office </em>nor any other reported decision of this or the Supreme Court has specifically addressed the responsibility of the FCC under Section 11 of the Clayton Act.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> We do so now, and find the interpretation suggested by Western Union and American Satellite unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-14\">A. <em>The Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-15\">Section 11 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 21 (1976),<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> provides in subsection (a) that authority to enforce certain substantive provisions of the Clayton Act, including Section 7,15 U.S.C. \u00a7 18 (1976), is vested in the FCC \u201cwhere applicable to common carriers engaged in wire or radio communication or radio transmission of energy[.]\u201d Identical authority is vested in the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Civil Aer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>onautics Board, and the Federal Reserve Board with respect to their regulatory jurisdictions, and in the FTC with respect to other lines of commerce.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Subsection (b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-5\"><em>Whenever </em>the Commission or Board vested with jurisdiction thereof <em>shall </em>have reason to believe that any person is violating or has violated any of the [enumerated] provisions * * *, it <em>shall </em>issue and serve upon such person and the Attorney General a complaint * * *. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">(Emphasis added.) The remainder of the subsection spells out the procedures to be followed.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Western Union and American Satellite argue that the emphasized words of the statute, <em>\u201cwhenever,\u201d \u201cshall,\u201d </em>and <em>\u201cshall,\u201d </em>must be interpreted to mean that the Commission has no discretion in the matter; that it must take positive action when it has reason to believe that Section 7 has been violated.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">This is by no means a necessary reading of the statute. The grant of enforcement authority in subsection (a) contains no mandatory language. Such language is used only in subsection (b), the subsection devoted to procedural protections. One plausible reading of the statute is that the Commission has discretion with respect to whether it will enforce the Clayton Act,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> but that it has no discretion with respect to the procedural protections to be afforded once the decision to enforce has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">Contrary to the assertion of Western Union and American Satellite, this reading of the Act does not render the section superfluous. Rather, the section makes three changes in the law: it displaces the FTC by the FCC as the enforcement agent of the Clayton Act within the regulatory jurisdiction of the latter, it gives the FCC additional authority for enforcement of its antitrust responsibilities, and it protects the regulated businesses by prescribing their procedural rights during a Clayton Act enforcement proceeding. In the light of the legislative history, interpretation by the Supreme Court, and purpose of the statute, we find this interpretation compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">B. <em>Legislative History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">Both sides in this controversy have sought, and purport to have found, support for their positions in the legislative history of Section 11 of the Clayton Act. Our review of that history reveals nothing conclusive. However, we can state with assurance that nothing in the legislative history establishes any clear intention on the part of Congress to make the FCC\u2019s Clayton Act enforcement mandatory, whereas a great deal in that history indicates the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">1. <em>Original passage of the Clayton Act. </em>The Clayton Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act, passed within a few weeks of each other in 1914, both included grants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>of enforcement authority to the FTC.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> During much of the time the Clayton Act was debated the enforcement provisions of the two bills were identical. In fact, the Senate committee that reported the Clayton Act proposed language in the bill stipulating that, once a complaint had issued, \u201cthereupon such proceedings shall be had as are provided for in section 5 of the [FTC] act.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Section 5 of the FTC bill then provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">Whenever the commission * * * shall have reason to believe that any person * * * is violating any of the provisions of * * * this act it shall issue and serve upon such person * * * a complaint * *. * * * [<footnotemark>57</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">Senator Newlands, the principal sponsor of the FTC bill and Chairman of the Interstate Commerce Committee, interpreted the bill to mean that \u201c[a]nyone who felt himself injured * * * could, of course, apply to this commission. It would then be <em>in its discretion </em>as to whether it would grant a hearing.\u201d <footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Since the FTC bill had not yet been passed, however, the committee decided it would be inappropriate to refer specifically to that Act in the Clayton Act. It therefore substituted for the formulation quoted above the actual language of Section 5 of the FTC bill as it then existed.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> This language was ultimately adopted as Section 11(b) of the Clayton Act and is with us still.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">Subsequently, however, the language of Section 5 of the FTC bill was amended to make it clear that the FTC would have the discretion not to institute enforcement proceedings in unimportant cases.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> The amendment added new language to the grant of authority, here italicized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-15\">Whenever the commission shall have reason to believe that any such person * * * has been or is using any unfair method of competition in commerce, <em>and if it shall appear to the commission that a proceeding by it in respect thereof would be to the interest of the public, </em>it shall issue and serve upon such person * * * a complaint * * *. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-16\"><em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1142, 63d Cong., 2d Sess. 3 (1914). In this form the FTC bill was passed, and is unchanged today.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> There is no indication in the legislative history of the Clayton Act that that Act was intended to vest any less discretion in its enforcement agencies than the FTC Act vested in the FTC. On the contrary, the express purpose of using the language \u2014 as it was at the time \u2014 of Section 5 of the FTC bill was to ensure that the enforcement provisions of the Clayton and FTC Acts would be exactly the same.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> In order to carry out that intention, we must interpret Section 11 of the Clayton Act as vesting prosecutorial discretion in its enforcement agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-17\">2. <em>The Communications Act of 1934. </em>Section 11 of the Clayton Act was amended by Section 602(d) of the Communications Act of 1934<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> to include the FCC as one of the Clayton Act enforcement agencies. This amendment, listed among the \u201cMiscellaneous Provisions\u201d of the Communications Act, was plainly not intended to alter the discretion of the enforcement agencies under Section 11; rather, its sole purpose was to allocate Clayton Act enforcement authority over the communications industry to the newly-created FCC. Both the Senate and the House Reports\u2019 sole explanation of Section 602(d) was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>The latter section also makes certain changes in other law, including the Clayton Act, made necessary by the setting up of the new commission and conferring upon it jurisdiction over communications.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">3. <em>Later developments. </em>Since the passage of the Communications Act of 1934, the enforcement agencies other than the FTC have seldom attempted to enforce the Act. Congress has been informed of this lack of enforcement,<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> and has never expressed any dissatisfaction. In 1938 bills were introduced in both houses of Congress that would have amended Section 313 of the Communications Act by adding a new paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">It is hereby declared to be the intention and policy of the Congress to prevent monopoly and to encourage competition in direct foreign radio telegraph communication; and for the purposes of this act, in considering application for licenses * *, the Federal Communications Commission shall consider competition in such communication to be in the public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALh\">S. 3875, 75th Cong., 3d Sess. (1938); H.R. 10348, 75th Cong., 3d Sess. (1938). These bills were introduced in response to the holding of this court in <em>Mackay Radio and Telegraph Co. </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>97 F.2d 641, 643 (D.C.Cir.1938), that the public interest standard of the Act \u201cdoes not apply to the radiotelegraph business the policy of free competition * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> Hearings on the bills were held, but no report ever issued; the bills were not adopted. Senator White, a major participant in the hearings, expressed his view of the policy of Congress toward competition in the communications industry: \u201cI would say that this encouragement of competition and the prevention of monopoly are only one of the elements or one of the factors that the Commission would take into consideration in passing on an application.\u201d <footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">In 1959 an amendment to Section 11 was introduced that would have made cease and desist orders under that section final.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> In supporting this amendment Congressman Patman remarked: \u201cThis bill will not require better enforcement of the Clayton antitrust law, but it will make it possible for the Federal Trade Commission better to enforce the law if it cares to do so.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AWX\">Congressional inaction and statements by individual congressmen are not strong evidence of congressional intention, and if there were evidence to the contrary we would disregard them. However, this legislative history, meager as it is, does indicate that Congress did not make the FCC\u2019s Clayton Act enforcement authority mandatory when it had the opportunity to do so. It would not be the place of this court to impose such mandatory responsibility with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>out congressional authorization, even if we thought it desirable.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">C. <em>Supreme Court Precedent</em></p>\n<p id=\"AUM\">The Supreme Court thoroughly addressed the relation between the public interest determination and the antitrust policy of the United States for the first time in <em>McLean Trucking Co. v. United States, </em>321 U.S. 67, 64 S.Ct. 370, 88 L.Ed. 544 (1944). There the Court held that the ICC\u2019s responsibility to enforce the antitrust laws is but one part of its overall public interest determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An3\">In short, the Commission must estimate the scope and appraise the effects of the curtailment of competition which will result from the proposed consolidation and consider them along with the advantages of improved service, safer operation, lower costs, etc., to determine whether the consolidation will assist in effectuating the overall transportation policy. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"az-dedup-0\"><em>Id. </em>at 87, 64 S.Ct. at 381.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> The Court treated the issue similarly in <em>Seaboard Air Lines R. Co. v. United States, </em>382 U.S. 154, 86 S.Ct. 277, 15 L.Ed.2d 223 (1965), a case that specifically addressed the ICC\u2019s responsibilities under Section 11 of the Clayton Act. The ICC had approved a railroad merger; a three-judge District Court reversed and remanded for a determination of whether the merger violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act. The Supreme Court reversed the lower court, reminding it that the ICC was obligated to determine whether the proposed merger is in the public interest and that, if it is, \u201c[i]t matters not that the merger might otherwise violate the antitrust laws[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156-157, 86 S.Ct. at 278.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">In the communications field the Court has followed a parallel course. In <em>FCC v. RCA Communications, Inc., </em>346 U.S. 86, 73 S.Ct. 998, 97 L.Ed. 1400 (1953), the Court squarely rejected the theory that Clayton Act antitrust principles govern the antitrust component of the public interest determination. The Court emphasized that the competitive consequences of proposals before the FCC \u201cmust be read in the light of the special considerations that have influenced Congress to make specific provision for the particular industry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98, 73 S.Ct. at 1006.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">American Satellite and Western Union seek support for their view in language in <em>Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad v. United States, </em>387 U.S. 485, 87 S.Ct. 1754, 18 L.Ed.2d 905 (1967). The <em>Denver </em>case concerned ICC approval of the issuance of a large block of stock in a railroad express company to a major bus company. The opinion said that the agencies listed in Section 11 of the Clayton Act have an \u201caffirmative duty * * * to enforce the Act\u2019s provisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496 n.7, 87 S.Ct. at 1761. The Court also said that the \u201cobligation to enforce the Clayton Act is the rule,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 497, 87 S.Ct. at 1761, and \u201cthe Clayton Act is prohibitive, and imposes a positive obligation upon the [agency] to act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502, 87 S.Ct. at 1764. American Satellite and Western Union interpret <em>Denver </em>to mean that an enforcing agency under Section 11 must disapprove any proposal that violates the Clayton Act, no matter how strong the public interest in the proposed service might otherwise be.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>This interpretation of the <em>Denver </em>opinion stretches its words too far. It must be remembered that the question decided by the Court in <em>Denver </em>was \u201cwhether the Interstate Commerce Commission complied with its statutory responsibilities under \u00a7 20a of the Interstate Commerce Act when it approved <em>without consideration of control or anticompetitive consequences\" </em>the proposed stock issuance. <em>Id. </em>at 487, 87 S.Ct. at 1756 (emphasis added; footnote omitted). In reversing the ICC the Court required \u201cat least <em>some degree of consideration </em>of control and anticompetitive consequences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 492, 87 S.Ct. at 1759 (emphasis added). Any contention that Clayton Act considerations must outweigh other aspects of the public interest is belied by the Court\u2019s statements that the Commission is required to \u201cconsider^ ] * * * all important consequences including anticompetitive effects,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 492, 87 S.Ct. at 1759, that the Commission has the responsibility \u201cto weigh anticompetitive consequences,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 494, 87 S.Ct. at 1760, and that \u201cthe Commission is, of course, required to consider anticompeti-tive issues under the public interest standard,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 501, 87 S.Ct. at 1764.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> The <em>Denver </em>decision stands for the principle, not different from this court\u2019s holding in <em>Northern Natural Gas, </em>that the agency is required to consider anticompetitive consequences as one part of its public interest calculus. Neither <em>Denver </em>nor any other</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">authority we have found makes the antitrust component of that calculus conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">D. <em>Statutory Policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">A holding that the FCC\u2019s enforcement of the Clayton Act is mandatory would clash with decisions holding that the FTC and the ICC have prosecutorial discretion in enforcing that Act,<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> since the enforcement authority of all three agencies derives from Section 11. Moreover, it is well established that the Department of Justice has prosecu-torial discretion with reference to criminal laws of the United States.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> These include the Clayton and Sherman Acts, despite seemingly mandatory language in those statutes.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> There is no reason we can discern that the FCC, alone of these agencies, should retain no discretion over its antitrust enforcement actions.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">More fundamentally, the inflexible interpretation urged by American Satellite and Western Union runs counter to the purpose of industry regulation. As this court has observed before: \u201cThe whole theory of licensing and regulation by government agencies is based on the belief that competition cannot be trusted to do the job of regulation in that particular industry which competition does in other sectors of the economy.\u201d <em>Hawaiian Telephone Co. v. FCC, </em>498 F.2d 771, 777 (D.C.Cir.1974).<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Since \u201cthe basic goal of direct governmental regulation through administrative bodies and the goal of indirect governmental regulation in the form of antitrust law is the same \u2014 to achieve the most efficient allocation of resources possible,\u201d <em>Northern Natural Gas Co. v. FCC, supra, </em>399 F.2d at 959, we have insisted that the agencies consider antitrust policy as an important part of their public interest calculus. But the agencies are not \u201cstrictly bound by the dictates of [the antitrust] laws,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 961; rather, they are entrusted with the responsibility to determine when and to what extent the public interest would be served by competition in the industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">The agency\u2019s determination about the proper role of competitive forces in an industry must therefore be based, not exclusively on the letter of the antitrust laws, but also on the \u201cspecial considerations\u201d of the particular industry.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court has said, resolution of the sometimes-conflicting public interest considerations \u201cis a complex task which requires extensive facilities, expert judgment and considerable knowledge of the * * * industry. Congress left that task to the Commission * * <em>McLean Trucking Co. v. United States, supra, </em>321 U.S. at 87, 64 S.Ct. at 381.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> We therefore reject American Satellite\u2019s and Western Union\u2019s attempt to constrict the FCC\u2019s discretion within the parameters of the antitrust laws. We hold that the requirements of Section 11 of the Clayton Act and Section 309(a) of the Communications Act are satisfied when the Commission seriously considers the antitrust consequences of a proposal and weighs those consequences with other public interest factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">IV. THE COMMISSION\u2019S DISCRETION TO DECIDE WHETHER TO CONDUCT AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING</p>\n<p id=\"Ag_\">Appellants argue that the <em>SBS Decision </em>must be reversed because of the FCC\u2019s failure to conduct evidentiary hearings on the antitrust issues. We must therefore decide whether the agency has the discretion to refuse to conduct such evidentiary hearings and, if it has, by what standard we must evaluate the exercise of that discretion. Then we must judge whether the FCC erred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">We begin with the statute. Section 309(e) of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(e) (1976), specifies the hearing procedures to be followed in a licensing proceeding: \u201cIf * * * a substantial and material question of fact is presented or the Commission for any reason is unable to make the finding [of public convenience and necessity] * * *, it shall formally designate the application for [a] hearing * * *.\u201d The required hearing is described as a \u201cfull hearing in which the appellant and all other parties in interest shall be permitted to participate.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> The hearing requirement therefore is triggered in one of two ways. First, a party may raise factual questions in his petition to deny. Second, the Commission may lack sufficient infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>mation on which to make an informed judgment. <em>See Citizens Committee to Save WEFM v. FCC, </em>506 F.2d 246, 259 (D.C.Cir. 1973) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Section 309(d) describes the burden <em>on an </em>opponent of a license in submitting a petition to deny :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">The petition shall contain specific allegations of fact sufficient to show that * * * a grant of the application would be prima facie inconsistent with subsection (a) of this section. Such allegations of fact shall, except for those of which official notice may be taken, be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">This provision, which was added to the Act by amendment in 1960, was intended to require \u201ca substantially stronger showing of greater probative value\u201d than had been required before. S.Rep. No. 690, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1959). The allegations must be of specific evidentiary facts, not \u201cultimate, conclusionary facts or more general allegations * * *.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-16\">American Satellite and Western Union each submitted a petition to deny supported by three affidavits. The allegations in these petitions consisted largely of generalized and unsupported criticisms of the SBS venture, or of undisputed facts derived from the SBS application and prior FCC statements. These were supplemented by legal and economic conclusions concerning market structure, competitive effect, and public interest.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> The Department of Jus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>tice submitted neither petition nor affidavits; even in its briefs on appeal it did no more than suggest avenues for FCC investigation. JA 1518-1519.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> Since these petitions and supporting affidavits manifestly do <em>not </em>contain \u201cspecific allegations of fact sufficient to show that * * * a grant of the application would be prima facie inconsistent\" with the public interest standard, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(d) (1976), the Commission was not obligated to schedule an evidentiary hearing on that ground. <em>See Columbus Broadcasting Coalition v. FCC, </em>505 F.2d 320, 323 \u2014 324 (D.C.Cir.1974). Appellants\u2019 principal argument must, therefore, be based on the second ground necessitating a hearing under Section 309(d): that the FCC lacked sufficient data on which to make an informed decision.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">There is no clear answer to the question whether there was enough evidence to make a decision. The Department of Justice has admitted that \u201cthe nature of the \u2018full hearing\u2019 required by Section 309(e) turns on the type of factual questions raised,\u201d <footnotemark>85</footnotemark> and has commended the FCC for not holding evidentiary hearings on some of the antitrust objections to the SBS entry.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> Someone must decide when enough data is enough. In the first instance that decision must be made by the Commission \u2014 not by the Department of Justice or the FTC, not by the parties to the proceeding, and not by the courts. West <em>Michigan Telecasters, Inc. v. FCC, </em>396 F.2d 688, 691 (D.C.Cir.1968).<footnotemark>87</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>To allow others to force the Commission to conduct further evidentiary inquiry would be to arm interested parties with a potent instrument for delay. The sad truth about agency decisionmaking and evidentia-ry inquiries is that they take time; and time often works to the advantage of one party over another. Although evidentiary hearings and other procedural devices are useful \u2014 and sometimes indispensable \u2014 they may also be exploited for unworthy purposes. For that reason this court has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atq\">[T]he decision of whether or not hearings are necessary or desirable is a matter in which the Commission\u2019s discretion and expertise is paramount. We must examine the Commission\u2019s statement of reasons for denial, and if the Commission\u2019s action was not arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable, we must affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-5\"><em>Columbus Broadcasting Coalition v. FCC, supra, </em>164 U.S.App.D.C. at 217, 505 F.2d at 324 (footnote omitted). In the context of another administrative agency we have said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">[A]n agency is not required to hold hearings in matters where the ultimate decision will not be enhanced or assisted by the receipt of evidence. And as to interventions raising anti-competitive issues we see no objection in law to a disposition without [a] hearing that is accompanied by an explanation, supported in the record, that the intervenor\u2019s contentions are too insubstantial or barren to indicate the existence of substantial anticompetitive issues * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-8\"><em>City of Lafayette v. SEC, </em>454 F.2d 941, 953 (D.C.Cir.1971), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom. Gulf States Utilities Co. v. FPC, </em>411 U.S. 747, 93 S.Ct. 1870, 36 L.Ed.2d 635 (1973) (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>88</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">These holdings are fully consistent with recent holdings of the Supreme Court. In <em>Gulf States Utilities Co. v. FPC, supra, </em>411 U.S. at 762, 93 S.Ct. at 1880, the Court held that the agency\u2019s responsibility to consider the antitrust implications of its actions does not entail holding a hearing on antitrust objections in every case, or fully investigating every allegation regardless of its facial merit. The Court noted that \u201c[s]o strict a rule would unduly limit the discretion the Commission must have in order to mold its procedures to the exigencies of the particular case * * *.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court reaffirmed its earlier statement that where the agency has disposed of antitrust objections summarily, the reviewing court must \u201cclosely scrutinize\u201d the decision. 411 U.S. at 763, 93 S.Ct. at 1880, <em>citing Denver, supra, </em>387 U.S. at 498, 87 S.Ct. at 1762.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">We recognize that the Commission\u2019s discretion to dispose of significant antitrust issues without an evidentiary hearing is not unlimited. This court has pointed out that questions about \u201cprobable competitive behavior and its probable effects\u201d require knowledge of the factual context and expert evaluation, and that they should not be \u201cdetermined exclusively by reasoning in the abstract, based upon logical speculation.\u201d <em>United States v. CAB, </em>511 F.2d 1315, 1326 (D.C.Cir.1975). Since no evidentiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>hearing was conducted, we must examine the agency\u2019s conclusions with particular care. <em>See Nat\u2019l Air Carrier Ass\u2019n v. CAB, </em>436 F.2d 185,195 (D.C.Cir.1970). Nevertheless, our inquiry is limited to two questions: (1) Was the Commission\u2019s decision not to conduct evidentiary hearings reasonable, and not arbitrary or capricious? <footnotemark>90</footnotemark> and (2) given the absence of an evidentiary hearing, was the conclusion of the Commission otherwise supportable under the applicable standard of review? We turn now to those questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">V. THE REASONABLENESS OF THE COMMISSION\u2019S PROCEDURES</p>\n<p id=\"A9z\">All parties to this appeal agree that some sort of hearing was needed to investigate the antitrust consequences of the SBS entry; the disputed question is what particular kind of hearing was needed. The FCC, on two different occasions, invited interested parties to submit whatever written material they wanted the Commission to consider, and on one occasion heard oral argument <em>en banc </em>on the antitrust issues of the SBS venture. All of the business parties to this case, and others, participated in the argument,<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> and the submitted materials were voluminous. Appellants, however, argue that notice, comment, and oral argument were insufficient; they demand a trial-type evidentiary hearing, complete with discovery, witnesses, and cross-examination. No one can predict how long such a proceeding would take; at the least, it would surely take several months, and it would be more likely to take over a year. The Commission decided not to conduct an evidentia-ry hearing because it concluded that the benefits of such a hearing would be outweighed by the delay and attendant costs.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">In evaluating that judgment we observe at the outset that the FCC has consistently acted without evidentiary hearings during the course of the domestic satellite communications decisions. Each of the appellants has been either a proponent or a beneficiary of this policy.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> Throughout the proceedings the FCC has emphasized the importance of getting satellite communications systems under way without procedural delay. This court has approved this FCC policy when it was challenged before. <em>Network Project v. FCC, supra, </em>511 F.2d 786. In view of this consistent policy, suggested by the Department of Justice,<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> adopted by the FCC,<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> and affirmed by this court,<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> appellants bear a heavy burden of explaining why a change is in order now.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>A. <em>The Usefulness of an Evidentiary Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">As the FCC has pointed out,<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> the domestic satellite communications industry is in its highly risky and experimental phase. The field is rapidly changing technologically and economically. As a result the Commission\u2019s determinations must necessarily \u201cdepend to a greater extent upon policy judgments and less upon purely factual analysis.\u201d <em>Industrial Union Department, AFL-CIO, v. Hodgson, </em>499 F.2d 467, 474 (D.C.Cir.1974). As the Supreme Court has said, where agency decisions are \u201cof a judgmental or predictive nature,\u201d <em>FCC v. National Citizens Committee for Broadcasting, </em>436 U.S. 775, 813, 98 S.Ct. 2096, 2121, 56 L.Ed.2d 697 (1978), \u201ccomplete factual support in the record for the Commission\u2019s judgment or prediction is not possible or required; \u2018a forecast of the direction in which future public interest lies necessarily involves deductions based on the expert knowledge of the agency,\u2019 * * <em>Id. </em>at 814, 98 S.Ct. at 2122.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Only a few years ago there were no firms in the industry; soon there will be half a dozen; in ten years there might be many more. On the other hand, technological developments and resultant economies of scale might make the FCC\u2019s present policy of limited open entry obsolete; conceivably there might emerge a natural monopoly. We are in similar ignorance about the extent of the demand for satellite services: it might be immense or it might be limited to a relatively small class of specialized users. We do not know, and months of hearings and witnesses and cross-examinations will not enable us to divine, the future course of the industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">Even the economist solicited by Western Union as an expert witness to urge further hearings admitted in his affidavit that \u201cwe are not dealing with a static or settled product line, like cement or steel or even transportation service, but with a rolling, sometimes galloping, technology, creating new markets and new ways to serve old ones as it goes along.\u201d JA 1489. The best this expert could claim was that \u201cat <em>any given time </em>the \u2018reasonable interchangeability\u2019 of services can be identified and \u2018relevant submarkets\u2019 delineated * * <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). But the FCC\u2019s decision cannot be based on competitive conditions \u201cat any given time\u201d; it must be based on a reasonable prediction of future conditions. The FCC has concluded that the attempt to resolve these speculative matters through adversary proceedings would be futile. We believe that conclusion is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">Merely stating the problem exposes the formidable obstacles to obtaining probative evidence in a case such as the one at bar.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> The first step is to decide what markets or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>submarkets exist that might be affected by the joint venture. Essentially, the appellants attempt to identify a communications submarket that does not yet exist, made up of data processing customers, large users, or some other subgroup. Once an industry pattern emerges it will become possible to talk of \u201creasonable interchangeability\u201d and \u201ccross-elasticity\u201d and the other economic concepts that are used to define relevant markets and submarkets. In the meantime, the Commission can do little more than analyze suggested submarkets and make an informed guess about their future characteristics. This the Commission has done. We accept its judgment that expert witnesses and cross-examination would not add appreciably to its already-expert knowledge of the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">But even if it were possible to delineate relevant markets and submarkets more precisely, there would remain the difficulty of predicting whether, if the SBS venture were disallowed, IBM and Comsat would enter separately, or whether the presence of one of them on the fringes of the industry would exert a pro-competitive effect. Appellants seek to procure testimony from IBM officers about their intentions, and from actual and potential competitors about their reactions to hypothetical competitive situations. Unfortunately, such subjective evidence of the intentions and perceptions of the companies involved is often misleading and unreliable. Even disregarding the ever-present tendency of interested witnesses to adapt the facts to their courtroom strategy, corporate decisionmaking processes are too decentralized and too much the product of compromise to yield clear answers about corporate intentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">This difficulty is greatest when the subject of the inquiry is purely hypothetical: What <em>would </em>IBM have done <em>if </em>the SBS venture had not been available? How <em>would </em>RCA and Western Union behave competitively <em>if </em>IBM or Comsat were \u201cwaiting in the wings\u201d? The uncertainty of subjective evidence on such questions has led observers and courts to suggest principal reliance on objective, not subjective, evidence.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court has said, \u201cPotential competition cannot be put to a subjective test. It is not \u2018susceptible of a ready and precise answer.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>101</footnotemark> In view of this, the suggested cross-examination of IBM and other corporate officers might well be considered futile. We cannot fault the FCC for making such a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">Moreover, we observe that the basic information needed for the SBS Decision was in the possession of the FCC.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> The hard facts concern the economic power and capability of IBM and Comsat, the nature of the proposed services, the characteristics of the competition, and the capacity of IBM and Comsat to enter the field. All else is inference or speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">Finally, even though the FCC concluded, based on the limited available information, that Comsat and IBM were unlikely both to enter the field separately, it analyzed the merits of the venture on the assumption that the anticompetitive effects charged by the opposing parties would occur.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> Even granting that assumption, the FCC concluded that the technological advance, efficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>operation, and competitive nudge to AT&amp;T that the SBS venture offers would outweigh the assumed harms.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> There remained no material issue of disputed fact on which to hold an evidentiary hearing, because the FCC was able to conclude that the SBS license should be approved even if the appellants are correct in their factual speculations. An evidentiary hearing would be a mere waste of time, since it \u201cwould not aid in, nor change,\u201d the result.<footnotemark>105</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">Appellants challenge the FCC\u2019s use of this assumption, quoting the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>United States v. Third National Bank, </em>390 U.S. 171, 183, 88 S.Ct. 882, 890, 19 L.Ed.2d 1015 (1968):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">Because the District Court erroneously concluded that the merger would not tend to lessen competition, its conclusion upon weighing the competitive effect against the asserted benefits to the community is suspect. To weigh adequately one of these factors against the other requires a proper conclusion as to each. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Appellants infer from this statement that a court or agency may not conduct a balancing of competing factors without first reaching conclusive factual findings based on an evidentiary hearing. We do not read <em>Third National Bank </em>that way. In <em>Third National Bank </em>the District Court erred in its assessment of both competitive consequences of the challenged merger and the public benefits resulting from it. In contrast, in this case we expressly affirm the FCC\u2019s substantive conclusions regarding the competitive consequences and public benefits from the SBS venture.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> Moreover, the hypothetical balance struck here by the FCC was not based on its <em>actual </em>conclusions about the competitive consequences of the SBS venture, but rather on the <em>assumed </em>consequences posed by appellants. The ultimate balance reached is therefore not subject to the same suspicion as was that reached by the District Court in <em>Third National Bank.</em><footnotemark><em>107</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">The position urged by appellants is directly contrary to the expressed intent of Congress that, in its pre-grant procedures, the FCC \u201cshould be guided by rules applicable to a motion for summary judgment * * S.Rep. No. 690, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 4 (1959). In deciding whether to grant summary judgment a court is not required to reach full factual findings on every issue; if, granting the inferences and assumptions of the party opposing summary judgment, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, then the court must grant the motion. The FCC did as much here.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">B. <em>The Need for Expedition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-14\">Ever since the decision in <em>Domsat II </em>the FCC has designed its procedures to minimize delay in developing the domestic satellite communications industry. This court has specifically approved that approach. <em>Network Project v. FCC, supra, </em>511 F. 2d at 797 n.13. In this dynamic and technologically innovative industry, a proposed venture may become obsolete in just a few years. Even without regulatory delay, a satellite firm is faced with the daunting prospect of time-consuming research and construction, which entail advance planning and risky lead time \u2014 and which may lead to naught. To delay a proposed project six months will increase capital cost and diminish technological advantage; to delay it a year or more may destroy its attractiveness as an investment. Unless this proceeding is further delayed, an SBS satellite will be operating in early 1981. If it is remanded for trial-type hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>ings, the SBS launching will be much delayed, if not precluded altogether.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> We recognize that the need for expedition will not justify an agency\u2019s failure to carry out its statutory responsibilities,<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> but the relative urgency of a decision is a thoroughly appropriate factor for an agency to consider when crafting its procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Under the circumstances of this proceeding, we cannot find the FCC\u2019s decision not to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the antitrust issues to be arbitrary or capricious; indeed, we recognize that an eviden-tiary hearing would less promote reasoned decisionmaking in this case than it would delay and impede technological progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">VI. THE FCC\u2019S SUBSTANTIVE FINDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\"> We now reach the ultimate issue in this appeal: whether the decision of the FCC to grant construction and operating authority to SBS comports with the \u201cpublic convenience and necessity\u201d standard of Section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 214 (1976). The scope of our review in this type of case was exhaustively described by this court in <em>Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC, </em>444 F.2d 841, 850-853 (D.C.Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>403 U.S. 923, 91 S.Ct. 2229, 29 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971). In summary, we cannot interfere with the agency\u2019s \u201clatitude not merely to find facts and make judgments, but also to select the policies deemed in the public interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 851. Our substantive review is satisfied if we find that the agency has \u201creally taken a \u2018hard look\u2019 at the salient problems, and has * * * genuinely engaged in reasoned decision-making.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). As we have noted,<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> the absence of evidentiary hearings requires that we examine the supporting findings and assumptions with especial care, but we cannot substitute our judgment for that of the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">A. <em>The Conclusion That the SBS Venture Would Not Be Anticompetitive</em></p>\n<p id=\"ALU\">The FCC has concluded that the entry of the SBS venture would not be anti-competitive in its effect. This conclusion rests on specific technical conclusions regarding relevant markets and submarkets, the effect of the joint entry, the possible entrenchment of SBS in the market, and the potential for predatory competitive behavior by SBS. We will consider the agency\u2019s analysis of each of these points in turn. But first, we note that the general conditions of the domestic satellite communications industry are such that the FCC\u2019s ultimate conclusions are highly plausible. The overriding fact about the SBS entry is that it introduces a strong new competitor into a concentrated industry dominated by a giant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>firm, AT&amp;T. Entrenchment and predatory conduct theories aside, the essential objection to the SBS entry is not that it is anticompetitive, but that <em>it is not as pro-competitive as some other entry might be.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Even that argument is difficult to believe in light of the posture of the parties to this case: AT&amp;T, Western Union, and American Satellite have a natural interest in inhibiting future competition and delaying future competitive entry. Their protestations in favor of vigorous competition ring hollow, especially considering that the immediate result of their victory would be to block the entry into the industry of a strong and technologically innovative competitor. Of course, these corporate giants have the right to pursue whatever litigious strategies the law may sanction, and this court has an obligation to ensure that the FCC seriously considers their arguments and reaches a reasoned conclusion. But we observe at the outset that there is great commonsense merit in the FCC\u2019s decision to permit one strong competitive entry now, rather than to hope for two such entries in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">1. <em>Definition of relevant market. </em>The FCC concluded that the \u201cmajor market\u201d to be considered is the \u201centire private line voice/data/image domestic telecommunications market.\u201d The market includes both satellite and terrestrial specialized communication services. <em>SBS Decision, </em>62 FCC2d at 1075 11223, JA 1598. In reaching that conclusion the FCC recognized that \u201c[t]hat market is composed of products that have reasonable interchangeability for the purposes for which they are produced \u2014 price, use and qualities considered.\u201d <footnotemark>111</footnotemark> The FCC found that \u201cas a technical matter\u201d \u2014 that is, considering the channel bandwidth, noise potential, speed, need for related equipment, error rate, and cost \u2014 \u201cvirtually all channels of point to point communication are substitutable between those points.\u201d <em>SBS Decision, </em>62 FCC2d at 1077 H 228, JA 1600.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-14\">The FCC reviewed two purported differences between satellite and terrestrial communications that might indicate that they are not \u201creasonably interchangeable.\u201d It rejected both. First, it noted that the end-to-end time interval for satellite communications is fixed, and longer than the typical end-to-end interval in ground communications. The FCC did not, however, consider this difference very important, because it primarily affects only the efficiency of certain high-speed bidirectional data communications, and because it might be possible to offset the difference by using the higher bandwidth channels available on satellites. The second purported difference is the greater facility of satellites to generate simultaneous transmissions to multiple receivers. Even this service, however, is provided by terrestrial systems as well.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-15\">The FCC observed that present satellite carriers are able to shift customers from terrestrial to satellite channels, and that competition between the two media is already under way.<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> From this, and from its technical analysis, the Commission concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-16\">Users will, in the final analysis, choose the facility or mix of facilities which is most efficient for their individual purposes. In any event, satellite channels present no clearcut advantage which would create a separate relevant domestic satellite market for purposes of our analysis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-17\"><em>SBS Decision, </em>62 FCC2d at 1080 1 236, JA 1603.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-18\">Appellants have called this major market analysis \u201csuperficial\u201d and \u201carbitrary,\u201d<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> but do not seriously attempt to argue that satellite and terrestrial systems do not compete. On the record, and judging by this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>lack of analysis by appellants, we are inclined to agree that the existence of such competition is \u201cinarguable.\u201d <footnotemark>115</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 more serious point is, not that the FCC misconstrued the major relevant market, but that it failed to recognize certain relevant <em>submarkets.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">A shift in the focus from the major market to the relevant submarkets is vital to appellants\u2019 argument, because the terrestrial communications field is so dominated by one supplier, AT&amp;T,<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> that even the Department of Justice was constrained to admit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">The entry of IBM into the domestic communications field could inject an aggressive, well-financed new entrant into a market too long dominated by a monopoly supplier. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Reply Comments of the Department of Justice, JA 1509. Only when focusing on smaller submarkets where AT&amp;T is not (yet) dominant does one gain the luxury of exchanging immediate and obvious pro-competitive entry for the potential advantages of multiple entry in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">The FCC carefully considered a number of possible submarkets, and rejected each as a basis for competitive analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">(a) <em>Satellite Communications. </em>As discussed above,<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> the FCC considered the purported differences between satellite and terrestrial communications systems, and concluded that the two media are reasonably interchangeable, and thus that satellite communications do not comprise a distinct submarket.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">(b) <em>Data communications. </em>Technical differences between data and facsimile transmissions, which generally employ digital signals, and voice transmissions, which generally employ analog signals, might serve to divide the communications market into two distinct submarkets. Appellants suggest that SBS, concentrating in data and facsimile transmission, and AT&amp;T, concentrating in voice transmission, might effectively divide the market and create a duopoly.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">The FCC considered this possibility in its order. <em>SBS Decision, </em>62 FCC2d at 1080\u2014 1082 HI 237-245, JA 1603-1605. It first noted that, as a technical matter, analog channels of communication and digital channels can be rendered compatible. The proposed SBS system offers an integrated service, transmitting data, facsimile, and voice signals. Similarly, terrestrial systems offer both analog and digital channels for data transmission purposes. The FCC observed that \u201cvirtually every communications common carrier that we regulate, both terrestrial and satellite,\u201d serves the data transmission market, but that AT&amp;T has by far the largest number of channels open for such purposes.<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> Thus the FCC concluded \u2014reasonably, in our view \u2014 that the data communications market is not separate from the overall communications market, and that even if it were, the entry of SBS would serve to mitigate the dominant and growing position of AT&amp;T.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-14\">(c) <em>Large users. </em>The FCC found \u201c[s]ome historical support\u201d for the argument that large users, such as the federal government and certain large corporations, have special communications needs, and may constitute a separate submarket.<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> Recent developments have, however, blurred the distinction between large and small users. In particular, the <em>Resale Decision, </em>60 FCC2d 261 (1976), <em>amended on reconsideration, </em>62 FCC2d 588 (1977), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom. AT&amp;T v. FCC, </em>572 F.2d 17 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>U.S. 875, 99 S.Ct. 213, 58 L.Ed.2d 190 (1978), permitted smaller users to reach private sharing agreements that would make available to them the advantages of aggregate communications offerings formerly attractive only to large users.<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> Of course, as the Department of Justice has pointed out, this \u201cshared user\u201d decision does not eliminate all differences between large and small users: not all small users will choose to join a sharing agreement.<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> But as the FCC observed, the main difference between the two classes of users is not technical, but economic. They use essentially the same type of services, but the greater bulk of demand gives large users an economic advantage.<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> Under the \u201cshared user\u201d decision, that advantage is lessened, if not eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">(d) New, <em>emerging uses. </em>The principal objection by the Department of Justice to the FCC\u2019s relevant submarket analysis was that \u201cthe Commission failed to consider the possibility that there may well be new, emerging uses for satellites for which, as a practical matter, terrestrial channels do not offer a realistic alternative.\u201d Dep\u2019t of Justice brief at 28. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">It would be anomalous to hold that SBS could be guilty of <em>lessening </em>competition in a submarket which it will <em>create. </em>As the FCC observed, its mandate does not require it \u201cto penalize innovation and ignore the public interest benefits resulting from such innovation by declaring each new and innovative service offering or operating mode a discrete submarket subject to unique regulatory and/or antitrust treatment.\u201d <em>SBS Decision, </em>62 FCC2d at 1086 It 258, JA 1609. Nevertheless, the FCC in its order analyzed no fewer than six characteristics of the proposed SBS system that might tend to create distinct submarkets.<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> However, in each instance the FCC identified terrestrial systems with similar, albeit not identical, characteristics, and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-12\">[Wjhile SBS\u2019 package of characteristics may, in the aggregate, be different in degree from competitive offerings today, in our judgment, it is not <em>so </em>different in degree as to lose its reasonable interchangeability with alternatives, and therefore establish a separate relevant market and/or submarket. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-13\"><em>SBS Decision, </em>62 FCC2d at 1086 1 258, JA 1609 (emphasis in original). Significantly, appellants do not attempt to refute the FCC\u2019s judgment on this score, or to prove that what appears to be reasoned decision-making for some reason falls short. Appellants\u2019 response is to ignore the FCC analysis, to assert that the Commission \u201cfail[ed] to evaluate a new demand for which SBS-type technology would be, for a short time, the only supplier,\u201d<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> and to ask us to reverse for this \u201carbitrary\u201d failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-14\">This court lacks the technical and economic background to second-guess the FCC\u2019s conclusions on relevant submarkets. The Commission has apparently taken a \u201chard look\u201d at the possibilities and has explained its reasons for rejecting them. Appellants have complained that the FCC\u2019s analysis is insufficient, but have offered no competing reasoning for us to evaluate. Perhaps relevant submarkets will emerge in the future, but the Commission\u2019s responsibility today under Section 7 of the Clayton Act is to deal with \u201c \u2018probabilities,\u2019 not \u2018ephemeral possibilities.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Marine Bancorporation, </em>418 U.S. 602, 623, 94 S.Ct. 2856, 2870, 41 L.Ed.2d 978 (1974) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number><em>(quoting Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, </em>370 U.S. 294, 323, 82 S.Ct. 1502, 1522, 8 L.Ed.2d 510 (1962)). Accordingly, we decline to interfere with the Commission\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">2. <em>Potential competition. </em>The FCC considered the possibility of a diminution in potential competition under the doctrine of <em>United States v. Penn-Olin Chemical Co., supra, </em>378 U.S. 158, 84 S.Ct. 1710, 12 L.Ed.2d 775. Under that theory the SBS venture might be thought to be anticompet-itive because it would preclude the separate entry of both Comsat and IBM into the industry. In the alternative, it might reduce competition even if only one of the parent firms entered alone, because the other would remain \u201cin the wings\u201d exerting a pro-competitive influence. The Commission concluded that IBM and Comsat were unlikely to enter the industry alone, and that little pro-competitive effect would result from a firm remaining \u201cin the wings.\u201d <footnotemark>125</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">(a) <em>Double entry. </em>The Commission supplied two major reasons for its belief that IBM and Comsat would not enter the market alone. First, the barriers to entry are unusually steep. The technology is new and risky, fixed development and start-up costs are high, and it is likely to be years before the entrants will begin to earn a profit. This situation, in the FCC\u2019s view, makes the likelihood of entry by any given firm quite low. Second, IBM and Comsat would begin at a decided disadvantage in the industry. By the time they would be able to enter the industry the other firms will already have established a position. Moreover, each of those firms is also a terrestrial communications carrier, capable of switching traffic from ground lines to satellite channels and thereby lowering its per unit costs of satellite service.<footnotemark>126</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Neither IBM nor Comsat has such an advantage. Their sole source of traffic would be new customers won over from the current satellite or terrestrial carriers. Needless to say, this substantially increases the risks Comsat or IBM would face, and decreases the prospects of eventual gain. Therefore, the Commission concluded that \u201cit would be most difficult for either IBM or Comsat General to enter into providing domestic satellite services alone.\u201d <em>SBS Decision, </em>62 FCC2d at 1091 H 278, JA 1614. In the FCC\u2019s view, these disadvantages are offset by the combination of IBM and Com-sat in a single joint venture: their unique capabilities and resources may well enable them to overcome their other disabilities.<footnotemark>127</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">We are by no means certain that the FCC was correct in this conclusion. In a dynamic field such as satellite communications, it seems to us that the technological resources of IBM might well be sufficient, even without Comsat\u2019s contribution, to make entry attractive to IBM.<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> And Comsat has in the past sought approval for satellite ventures with partners other than IBM. If we were making the decision <em>de novo, </em>we would think the likelihood of separate entry a close question. Nevertheless, we affirm. Our task is not to judge whether the opponents of the joint venture have stated a <em>prima facie </em>case under the antitrust laws; rather, we are reviewing the agency\u2019s decision that the SBS license conforms to the public convenience and necessity. In that role, we could not overturn the FCC\u2019s findings, even if we preferred another conclusion. The FCC has here considered all of the evidence and reasoning presented by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>the interested parties, has recognized the necessarily speculative nature of its inquiry, and has concluded that it is not likely that IBM and Comsat would enter the field alone.<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> Under the applicable standard of review, we cannot reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">(b) <em>The \u201cin the wings\u201d effect. </em>As the Supreme Court said in <em>United States v. Marine Bancorporation, supra, </em>418 U.S. at 624, 94 S.Ct. at 2871:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">Unequivocal proof that an acquiring firm actually would have entered <em>de novo </em>but for a merger is rarely available. Thus * * * the principal focus of the [potential competition] doctrine is on the likely effects of the premerger position of the acquiring firm on the fringe of the target market. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Here, where there is certainly no unequivocal evidence about the separate entry of Comsat and IBM, it is particularly important to analyze the possibility that their joint venture may have eliminated the competitive pressure that one of the firms would have exerted on the domestic satellite industry by its continuing threat to enter.<footnotemark>130</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">In this analysis, we are reminded by the Supreme Court that \u201cease of entry on the part of the acquiring firm is a central premise of the potential-competition doctrine,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 628, 94 S.Ct. at 2873, and that we must \u201caccord full weight to * * * federal and state regulatory barriers to entry * * *.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This focus on ease of entry is vital because the pro-competitive effect from a firm \u201cin the wings\u201d is entirely produced by the perceptions of the current competitors. Only if they perceive the fringe company as a likely entrant will they respond in a competitive fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">In the domestic satellite communications industry, we have observed that barriers to entry are steep. If Comsat or IBM took over full operation of the SBS venture, the remaining firm would have to obtain large amounts of capital, either in the capital markets or from a replacement joint ven-turer, in order to enter the field. The new entrant would have to begin development of a system anew, and would take a minimum of three to five years, in the FCC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>estimation, to become an actual competitor.<footnotemark>131</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Thus the current satellite firms will have distant advance notice that a new entry is forthcoming, and more than enough time to alter their competitive behavior to meet that threat. In the meantime, they have little to fear from the firm \u201cin the wings.\u201d Moreover, the regulatory hurdles in the face of IBM or Comsat entering are high. Comsat first proposed entering the field in 1972, and has only now received authority to do so. IBM\u2019s entry, even alone, will be staunchly opposed by many parties, just as its entry has been opposed in the present order. Ironically, if the <em>SBS Decision </em>is reversed, then entry by IBM, Comsat, or any other major competitor would be much less likely; potential entrants would have to overcome more stringent regulatory obstacles before being granted a license. Reversing the <em>SBS Decision </em>might well decrease the potential competition now resulting from other fringe firms that might take advantage of the present open entry policy.<footnotemark>132</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">We thus believe that the FCC reasonably concluded that \u201cit is unlikely that the non-entrant would ever enter, or realistically ever be perceived as a threatening potential competitor.\u201d <em>SBS Decision, </em>62 FCC2d at 1091 1280, JA 1614.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">3. <em>The Entrenchment Theory. </em>The FCC also considered the argument that the SBS venture would be anticompetitive under the \u201centrenchment theory\u201d as expounded in <em>FTC v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Co., </em>386 U.S. 568, 87 S.Ct. 1224, 18 L.Ed.2d 303 (1967). Under this theory SBS might be thought to have advantages from its connection to IBM that would enable it to dominate the relevant market<footnotemark>133</footnotemark> and to drive out actual or potential competitors. As explained by Western Union in its reply comments, \u201cData processing customers are the likely principal users of domestic satellite service, and IBM\u2019s well-established and loyal data processing customer base inevitably will provide extraordinary competitive advantages to any satellite carrier affiliated with IBM.\u201d JA 1475-1476 (footnote omitted). Acceptance of this argument would lead to the conclusion that IBM should not be permitted to enter the domestic satellite communications field, with or without Comsat.<footnotemark>134</footnotemark> Any advantage IBM may have it can exploit as easily alone as in a joint venture. Unlike the potential competition theory, therefore, the entrenchment argument is not predicated on the joint venture character of SBS, but on the identity of one of the SBS partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">We consider below <footnotemark>135</footnotemark> the related argument <footnotemark>136</footnotemark> that IBM may engage in predatory practices such as cross-subsidization. Here we consider the theory that IBM\u2019s expertise, aggressiveness, size, or efficiency may overwhelm Western Union, RCA, American Satellite, and their fellows in the domestic satellite communications market. In this we are reminded of the Supreme Court\u2019s warning that the antitrust laws exist to protect <em>\u201ccompetition, </em>not <em>competitors </em>* <em>Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, supra, </em>370 U.S. at 320, 82 S.Ct. at 1521 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>The purpose of the entrenchment doctrine as it has developed in the courts is not to exclude strong or even potentially dominant firms from entering a new market, but instead to require them to do so by internal expansion or toe-hold acquisition rather than by merger with firms already established in the market. For example, in <em>FTC v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Co., supra, </em>386 U.S. 568, 87 S.Ct. 1224, 18 L.Ed.2d 303, the leading case on entrenchment, the doctrine was applied to prevent Proctor &amp; Gamble from entering the household bleach market through acquisition of the leading bleach firm, Clorox; the FTC would have welcomed independent entry by Proctor &amp; Gamble. Appellants have cited no precedent for their remarkable attempt to extend this doctrine to prohibit a strong firm such as IBM from entering a promising new market out of a fear that it might come to dominate the field. Their suggestion turns the purpose of the antitrust laws on its head.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">For reasons already discussed, the Commission concluded that SBS will be at a substantial competitive disadvantage when it enters the field.<footnotemark>137</footnotemark> We see no reason to dispute the FCC\u2019s conclusion that SBS will not be in a position to dominate the domestic satellite communications field or to raise entry barriers within the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">4. <em>Predatory Practices. </em>More troublesome is appellants\u2019 objection that IBM may be able to use its dominant position in the computer and data processing field to gain unfair advantage in the domestic satellite communications market. We observe that each of the entrants into the domestic satellite industry has presented some possibility of similar competitive abuse. For example, similar concerns about AT&amp;T were responsible for the FCC\u2019s decision to place major restrictions on AT&amp;T\u2019s satellite venture.<footnotemark>138</footnotemark> The FCC does not deny that IBM\u2019s participation presents prospects for predatory behavior that must be obviated. The dispute in this case is over the adequacy of the FCC\u2019s response to the problem as perceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">To prevent IBM from using its position in the computer industry as a lever to gain control of the satellite communications field, the FCC placed certain restrictions on IBM\u2019s and SBS\u2019s operations. It prohibited advertising or promotional assistance by IBM to SBS,<footnotemark>139</footnotemark> joint or cooperative sales presentations between SBS and IBM,<footnotemark>140</footnotemark> packaged end-to-end data communications services,<footnotemark>141</footnotemark> and price discrimination by SBS in favor of users of IBM equipment.<footnotemark>142</footnotemark> It required that all financial or procurement dealings between IBM and SBS be conducted at arm\u2019s length,<footnotemark>143</footnotemark> and that IBM remain a minority and noncontrolling partner in SBS.<footnotemark>144</footnotemark> It also promises to impose additional restrictions or take other action if these do not suffice.<footnotemark>145</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-15\">Appellants have not attempted a precise refutation of the adequacy of the FCC\u2019s restrictions. The Department of Justice does not challenge the FCC on this point at all. Western Union merely says that the FCC\u2019s conclusion was \u201cwithout the aid of factual analysis,\u201d and that \u201ccertain of the Commission\u2019s restrictions\u201d had been thought unworkable by SBS.<footnotemark>146</footnotemark> American Satellite argues that \u201cit cannot be deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>mined how effective, if at all,\u201d the FCC\u2019s restrictions may be.<footnotemark>147</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">After considering the FCC\u2019s analysis and response to the problem, and the arguments of appellants, we conclude that the Commission\u2019s disposition of the predatory practices argument was acceptable for the purpose of this review.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">B. <em>The Conclusion That Other Public Benefits Will Outweigh Any Possible Anticompetitive Effects</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">In reviewing the FCC\u2019s conclusion that the public benefits from the SBS venture outweigh any possible anticompetitive effects from it \u2014 even assuming that those effects could be established \u2014 we bear in mind that the Commission\u2019s overriding responsibility is not to foster the maximum level of competition in the industry it oversees, but to promote the public interest. <em>FCC v. RCA Communications, Inc., supra, </em>346 U.S. 86, 73 S.Ct. 998, 97 L.Ed. 1470; <em>Hawaiian Telephone Co. v. FCC, supra, </em>498 F.2d 771. The principal advantages to be gained from competition in this heavily regulated industry are two. First, the presence of a large number of competitors and a large capacity may prevent supracompetitive price pressures that the Commission might not be able to perceive or control. Second, the increased competition may spur firms in the industry to greater technological advances and more efficient operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Given the rapid increase in the number and size of the satellite systems,<footnotemark>148</footnotemark> supra-competitive price pressures are unlikely to occur, since such pressures are caused by an artificial restriction in the supply of the service. Moreover, under the circumstances, the entry of an innovative force such as SBS is as likely to spur as to stifle technological competition. This suggests that a mere incantation of the words \u201canticompet-itive consequences\u201d in this case may not suffice to prove damage to the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">1. <em>Service benefits. </em>We have already reviewed the technological advances that the SBS proposal embodies: small earth stations at the premises of customers, integrated voice/data/image transmission service in a largely digital format, new demand assignment formulas to promote more efficient use of the spectrum, and use of the 12 and 14 GHz bands.<footnotemark>149</footnotemark> These developments have touched off other technological advances on the part of SBS\u2019s competitors. The public is the beneficiary of these advances; new services will enable communications users to transmit messages, data, and images with greater ease and flexibility, and the increased efficiencies will lower cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-13\">Significantly, none of the parties to this appeal \u2014 save AT&amp;T<footnotemark>150</footnotemark> \u2014 denies that the SBS proposal will provide the public valuable new services. We observe, moreover, that partially as a result of the FCC\u2019s decision not to undertake time-consuming evi-dentiary hearings on the antitrust issues in this case, the public will enjoy the benefits of the SBS system in early 1981. As the Department of Justice has admitted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-14\">The Commission has already approved the joint venture\u2019s technological approach, finding it to be a \u201ctechnologically innovative approach\u201d with the potential to afford significant benefits to the public. We have no reason to doubt that assessment and believe that the public should be afforded the option to utilize that service without undue delay. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYK\">Department of Justice supplemental brief at 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-15\">2. <em>Competitive benefits. </em>Even assuming that the identified anticompetitive consequences of the SBS venture will occur, the FCC concluded that the SBS entry would promote the public interest by en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>hancing competition in communications.<footnotemark>151</footnotemark> In particular, the Commission observed that SBS would challenge AT&amp;T\u2019s hegemony in the specialized communications market, and would impede the achievement by the AT&amp;T/GTE venture of a dominant position in the satellite segment of that market.<footnotemark>152</footnotemark> The Commission further concluded that this competition would be enhanced by the participation of both Comsat and IBM in the joint venture, because of their combined technical and financial resources,<footnotemark>153</footnotemark> and also because of their joint control, which will promote more vigorous competition with AT&amp;T.<footnotemark>154</footnotemark> Finally, the FCC opined that even an additional entry by IBM alone would be of little additional practical value in promoting competition because such an entry would take many years to develop.<footnotemark>155</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">These conclusions are sharply challenged by appellants, who assert that SBS and AT&amp;T will not compete with each other, but will rather create a duopoly, with AT&amp;T controlling voice service and SBS controlling data service. Western Union reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-6\">This result [duopolization] was predicted for several reasons: First, because satellite service offers particular promise for high speed data communications * * *, a field of great importance to IBM because of its predominant position in the data processing industry; second, because of AT&amp;T\u2019s present dominance in voice communications; and third, because IBM and AT&amp;T have a history of deferring to each other in fields in which only one company has an established position. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-16\">Western Union brief at 52-53 (citation to record omitted). Appellants\u2019 reasoning is not persuasive. Admittedly, IBM has a great interest in the data communications field, and may be expected to compete vigorously in it; but, as Western Union has itself pointed out,<footnotemark>156</footnotemark> AT&amp;T has heretofore dominated that market. Thus, even if IBM were to confine itself to data transmission, it would enhance competition. AT&amp;T is not expected to withdraw from this lucrative segment of the market after having invested, with GTE, in a satellite venture that should improve its position.<footnotemark>157</footnotemark> In the voice segment of the industry, any contribution SBS might make to the market would help to break AT&amp;T\u2019s predominant control; SBS proposes to provide full satellite communications services, including voice transmission.<footnotemark>158</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-17\">Finally, a history of cooperation between IBM and AT&amp;T (and appellants have also suggested such a history with respect to Comsat and AT&amp;T) may provide cause for concern; but we do not understand how excluding IBM, or Comsat, or the SBS joint venture, from the domestic satellite communications industry will <em>stimulate </em>competition. Surely, SBS will compete more vigorously against AT&amp;T if it is granted a license than it will if that license is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-18\">In its <em>CML Decision </em>the FCC carefully considered the problem of cooperation between AT&amp;T, Comsat, and IBM, and designed the \u201cbalanced CML option\u201d to obviate the problem by denying both Comsat and IBM a controlling interest in SBS. In the Commission\u2019s judgment, the presence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>a third partner and the minority status of Comsat and IBM would make it difficult for either of the latter to curry favor with AT&amp;T at the expense of vigorous competition by SBS.<footnotemark>159</footnotemark> Appellants may not consider this solution to be adequate, but they have not carried their burden in this court of showing that the Commission\u2019s decision was wanting in reason or care.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">3. <em>The FCC\u2019s continuing oversight </em>Finally, the FCC has explicitly declared itself prepared to exercise its continuing authority under Section 214 of the Communications Act to prevent anticompetitive behavior as it may occur.<footnotemark>160</footnotemark> Although the provisions of Section 7 of the Clayton Act are intended to stop anticompetitive arrangements in their incipiency, <em>see Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, supra, </em>370 U.S. at 317-318 &amp; n.32, 82 S.Ct. at 1520 &amp; n.32, this court has recognized that continuing supervision by a regulatory agency may accomplish the same end, where \u201c[t]he serious anticompetitive effects, if they arise at all, will do so only after full implementation begins.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Regulatory Utility Comm\u2019rs </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>525 F.2d 630, 638 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 992, 96 S.Ct. 2203, 48 L.Ed.2d 816 (1976).<footnotemark>161</footnotemark> The power of the FCC to employ a full range of remedies, including restrictions, conditions, nonrenewal of licenses, or divestiture, makes the antitrust problems in this case less immediate, and more controllable, than appellants would suggest.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">VII. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"As9\">Freedom of entry is the single most important guarantor of competition in a concentrated industry, because so long as other firms can enter, the firms already in the industry are forced to price their products and services at a level close to the competitive price. As this case illustrates, however, other competitive concerns sometimes come into conflict with freedom of entry. Here the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and several private corporations have argued that preventing the entry of a firm, SBS, into the domestic satellite communications field would promote competition. The FCC, which has been delegated the authority to decide this question, disagreed: it concluded that the SBS venture is unlikely to produce significant anticompetitive effects and that, even if it did, the public benefits from the entry would be so substantial as to outweigh those effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">In making this judgment, the FCC remained true to its established policy of permitting open entry into the domestic satellite field, subject only to basic competency requirements. Without cumbersome evi-dentiary proceedings that would delay or even prevent the entry of otherwise worthy firms, the FCC has granted licenses to each of the corporate appellants in this case: to AT&amp;T, to Western Union, and to American Satellite. When a joint venture composed of IBM, Comsat, and Aetna applied to join the concentrated pack, the FCC did not deviate from its limited open entry policy; it examined submitted data, heard oral argument, took a hard look at suggested antitrust problems, and granted the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">The earlier entrants now ask this court to require the FCC to change its policy. They would have us place the hurdle of an evi-dentiary hearing, which could take a year or more, in the way of SBS\u2019s entry; they defend their position by proclaiming the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>benefits of competition. We are inclined to ask who in this case is truly promoting the policy of competition: the FCC, which granted a license to a new and potent competitive force, or those who invoke the cry of \u201ccompetition\u201d in the interest of restricting entry. Our function in this case is limited. In review both of the procedures used by the FCC and of the ultimate conclusion, we must defer to the Commission\u2019s judgment in the absence of legal error. The order under review is</p>\n<p id=\"Am-\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">SPOTTSWOOD W. ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge, with whom WILKEY, Circuit Judge, joins, dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">As a member of the panel considering this litigation when it first reached the court, I was then of the view that the licensing decision at issue had to be reversed on each of two independent grounds. First, I felt that the dual responsibilities of the Federal Communications Commission (sometimes FCC) under the Communications <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Clayton Acts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> required it to deny a construction permit or station license to anyone whom it found to be in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> irrespective of public benefits that might otherwise accrue, unless the Commission could in no other way discharge its function under Section 309(a) of the Communications Act of regulating to serve the \u201cpublic interest, convenience, and necessity.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because FCC clearly had not hewed to a standard of that caliber, a remand for further proceedings seemed necessary. Additionally, review of the procedures followed by the agency persuaded me that in any event it had not conducted the full evidentiary hearing required by Section 309(e) of the Communications Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">Rehearing by the court <em>en bane </em>has been accompanied by more exhaustive exploration of relevant legislative history and prec-edential materials. I remain firmly convinced that principled application of the Communication Act\u2019s mandate made an evi-dentiary-type hearing obligatory in the circumstances of this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> I have, however, modified my position respecting the standard by which the Commission must appraise anticompetitive effects that rise to the level of Clayton Act transgressions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> I find myself now in agreement with the conclusion today reached by the court that \u201cthe requirements of Section 11 of the Clayton Act and Section 309(a) of the Communications Act are satisfied when the Commission seriously considers the antitrust consequences of a proposal and weighs those consequences with other public interest factors.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Since, however, I arrive at this result in somewhat different fashion than does the court, I set forth my reasoning separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">I. STATUTORY DYNAMICS</p>\n<p id=\"AJk\">My starting point is the statutory language delineating FCC\u2019s responsibilities when, during the licensing process, it encounters activity impinging upon the Clayton Act. Under Section 309(a) of the Communications Act, the Commission is empowered to grant applications for construction permits and station licenses if the \u201cpublic interest, convenience, and necessity [would] be served\u201d thereby.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is by now indisputable that in reaching a determination under this criterion, the agency must give serious consideration to conduct portending substantial anticompetitive consequences, in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>eluding activity proscribed by the Sherman <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and Clayton Acts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In addition to this task, the Clayton Act itself, in Section 11, increases the Commission\u2019s regulatory range as well as its arsenal of regulatory weapons by empowering it to enforce compliance with designated portions of that Act insofar as they apply to communications common carriers.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">I do not quarrel with the court\u2019s position that, despite the presence of mandatory language in Section 11,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the statute tolerates an agency exercise of normal prosecutorial discretion in deciding when and against whom to institute enforcement proceedings pursuant to that provision.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But we are not faced with the question whether FCC may refrain from taking affirmative steps when confronted by evidence that a carrier subject to its jurisdiction has acted in defiance of the law. Here the Commission embarked upon an inquiry pursuant to its responsibilities under the Communications Act, and undertook as an essential part of that process to weigh the anticompetitive consequences of granting SBS\u2019s license application.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The issue, then, is whether the nature of that inquiry and the otherwise broad discretion granted FCC to act in the public interest,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> are changed because Congress has given the agency a dual role in regulating communications common carriers. Normal concepts of prosecutorial discretion are irrelevant to resolution of this problem. Instead, the call is to determine how the Communications and Clayton Acts interrelate in defining the parameters of the decision whether or not to license. I have been particularly concerned by the need to identify accurately the reason why Congress allotted antitrust-enforcement authority to FCC, and what intention that bespoke with respect to the agency\u2019s other duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Preliminarily, I will review the legislative history of both the Clayton and the Communications Acts, seeking insights into congressional attitudes respecting the relationship between these two competing regulatory schemes.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It is true, as the court writes, that the history \u201creveals nothing conclusive,\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> but I do find some guidance in the legislative action and pronouncements that the court does not mention. I will then consider subsequent interpretations placed on these statutes, particularly by the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">A. <em>The Statutes and Their Legislative Histories</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">1. <em>The Clayton Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-14\">The Clayton Act was passed in 1914 to supplement the antitrust protection afford<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>ed by the antecedent Sherman Act.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In a major departure from the earlier approach, the Clayton Act placed enforcement responsibility in the first instance in administrative agencies.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> As first passed by the House of Representatives the bill specified criminal penalties for violation,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> just as the Sherman Act had.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It was in the Senate, upon recommendation of the committee to which the bill had been referred, that the administrative enforcement scheme was added.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">It is at least clear why Congress preferred administrative over criminal enforcement of the new provision. \u201cThis was done,\u201d the Senate committee explained, \u201cbecause it was thought best, especially in view of the experimental stage of this legislation, that the harshness of the criminal law should not be applied but that the enforcement of the section should be given to the Federal Trade Commission.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Repeated attempts to amend the bill to make violation a misdemeanor were all rejected.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> For similar reasons of flexibility in regulation of this new field, committee members favored leaving the prohibition of discriminatory pricing and tying contracts to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in its exercise of authority to regulate unfair business practices, to be granted under pending Federal Trade Commission legislation.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The provisions of the Clayton Act dealing with these two subjects were deleted from the antitrust bill on the floor of the Senate,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> but both were later restored.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">Though it thus is apparent that agencies were designated as enforcement mechanisms in part to provide some kind of prose-cutorial discretion, it is much less clear why Congress separated the regulation of common carriers and banks from FTC\u2019s otherwise comprehensive jurisdiction and granted oversight instead to the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) and the Federal Reserve Board (sometimes FRB). The purpose in doing so has great significance here, for it was from ICC\u2019s initial Clayton Act responsibility that FCC\u2019s parallel authority was later carved.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Moreover, it seems likely, at least in the absence of any contrary indication, that in each instance Congress had similar reasons for placing authority elsewhere than in FTC.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-13\">Unfortunately, no ready-made explanations are recorded in the committee reports or debates, and no consistent pattern emerges from congressional treatment of the transportation and banking industries, overall supervision of which had already been established in federal agencies that would now have antitrust regulation added to their jurisdiction. One can, however, discern some tentative congressional concerns that form a basis for consideration of later amendments to the scheme initially constructed in the Clayton Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>First, Congress clearly intended that common carriers and banks, despite the intense federal supervision to which they were subject, would in general be accountable under the antitrust laws as well. Two of the Clayton Act prohibitions \u2014 barring discriminatory pricing to force a competitor out of business <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and the use of tying contracts by sellers to prevent purchasers from dealing in another\u2019s product<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> \u2014 were applicable to all persons engaged in interstate commerce. Section 8, which forbade interlocking directorates, did expressly limit coverage of banks to those of substantial size,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> but this is a de minimus exception and if anything reflects a desire to ensure liability under most circumstances. A paragraph that some believed would sanction meetings among common-carrier officers that otherwise might violate the Sherman or Clayton Acts <footnotemark>34</footnotemark> was removed for that reason, despite language making clear that any resulting agreement would require ICC approval.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Aside from the general intent to apply antitrust concepts to regulated industries, there are also indications that many viewed those industries as materially different from others because there existed bodies of law specifically aimed at their control, and consequently that the proscriptions of the Clayton Act belonged more appropriately in the legislation specially governing them. Thus the Senate attempted to remove any reference to interlocking bank directorates on the theory that \u201csuch legislation . . . more properly belongs to the domain of banking rather than of commerce and such additional regulation of bank directorates as may be wise and just\u201d should come by way of amendments to the banking laws, with enforcement authority in the Federal Reserve Board and the Comptroller of the Currency.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The final bill, however, reinstated the particularizing of bank coverage <footnotemark>37</footnotemark> but also added the FRB to those with administrative enforcement power.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Additionally, the House bill left most of the prohibition on interlocking common-carrier directorates to later amendment of the Interstate Commerce Act.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-14\">A third theme that can be discerned from the legislative history was a reluctance to remit entirely to agency discretion the decision on whether particular actions violate the spirit of the antitrust laws. The House rejected two amendments that would have permitted bankers to serve as corporate officers of more than one institution and would have left it to the Federal Reserve Board to decide whether to forbid the practice in individual instances where restraint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>of trade resulted.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> One opponent suggested that \u201cin the course of a very short time, [the Board will perhaps] need regulating as badly as do the directors of banks now.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> This kind of concern might also explain why the Clayton Act provided for two means of enforcement in addition to the authority granted FTC, ICC and FRB. Both the Attorney General and private parties were granted leave to bring suit in a federal district court to enjoin violation of any of the Clayton Act provisions.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> One exception to this is noteworthy: no private suit was permitted against common carriers subject to ICC supervision,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> perhaps further reflecting a view that more flexibility was desirable in a field so densely regulated.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> This special immunity was withdrawn from communications common carriers, however, when they were later transferred from ICC to FCC control.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Finally, there was also substantial recognition that exemptions from the general rule disfavoring anticompetitive conduct were necessary, particularly for common carriers. Proposed amendments to the Interstate Commerce Act to forbid interlocking common-carrier directorates would also have given ICC authority to \u201cprovide for relief in extreme cases. ...\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The section actually passed allowed approval of such directorates upon a finding \u201cthat neither public nor private interests will be adversely affected thereby.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> ICC was also empowered to permit certain mergers that otherwise would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> and, upon approval, those transactions became immune from any other attempt to enforce the antitrust laws.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The Clayton Act itself dealt with interlocking directorates between common carriers and their suppliers. The House version had forbidden such connections entirely,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> but the Senate removed the ban so long as all purchases from related corporations were made through formal bidding under ICC supervision.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> This was another manifestation of the perceived need for flexibility in applying the antitrust laws to a regulated field.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">It thus appears that Congress assigned great importance to strengthening the antitrust laws to protect all forms of commerce, but also favored some degree of accommodation with possibly conflicting regulatory regimes. It went so far as expressly to confer agency discretion to sanction anti-competitive activity in particular instances, and thereby to immunize that activity from prosecution. But I have been unable to find a definite expression of intent regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>ing the appropriate accommodation between antitrust and other regulatory goals when no such immunity is available. Under express statutory terms, a violator of the Clayton Act remains liable to public or private suit regardless of agency action. But neither the Act itself nor its legislative history instructs us whether that perceived need for flexibility in heavily regulated industries means that an agency entrusted with enforcement of the Act can overlook its violation in pursuit of the remainder of its regulatory mandate. I turn, then, for enlightenment to the legislation that established this mandate for FCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">2. <em>The Communications Act of 1934</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The Communications Act of 1934 added FCC to Section 11 of the Clayton Act and allotted to it enforcement power over \u201ccommon carriers engaged in wire or radio communication or radio transmission of energy . ...\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> As the court correctly intimates,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> no interpretive assistance can be gleaned from the legislative comments, which assigned to this amendment merely the housekeeping function of transferring jurisdiction over such common carriers from ICC to the newly created FCC.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Because, however, the court limits its inquiry narrowly to the issue of prosecutorial discretion, it does not look to the relevance of other provisions of the Communications Act and their history.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">The Act combined in FCC jurisdiction over both communications common carriers <footnotemark>55</footnotemark> and radio broadcasters,<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> but contained important differences between the groups in scope of coverage, particularly with respect to antitrust considerations. The Commission\u2019s primary authority over broadcasters arose from its control over licensing to use the Nation\u2019s airwaves,<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> and it has become well established that in exercising this function the Commission must give serious attention to any alleged anti-competitive activity.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> This responsibility derives directly from the agency\u2019s charge to license for \u201cthe public interest, convenience, and necessity . . .,\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> and is underscored by expressions, found throughout the congressional debates, of dismay at the prospect of monopolistically controlled airwaves.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Even more positively, the pertinence of the antitrust laws to the communications industry was explicitly declared in the Act,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> and was supplemented by a provision permitting the courts to penalize those convicted of civil or criminal violations of the Sherman or Clayton Acts by revoking previously-granted licenses.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Indeed, once a court orders revocation, the Commission is forbidden subsequently to issue a station license or construction permit to the guilty party \u201cor to any person directly or indirectly controlled by such person. ...\u201d <footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-14\">All of these provisions apply whenever anyone, broadcaster or common carrier, seeks a license or permit, but communica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>tions common carriers are subject to additional forms of FCC supervision. First and foremost, of course, are the special powers the Commission has under the Clayton Act to order a regulated carrier to cease and desist from activities found by the agency to violate any of the Act\u2019s prohibitions.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Beyond that, FCC is authorized to approve consolidations and mergers of telephone and telegraph companies that otherwise would contravene Section 7 of the Clayton Act.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> FCC may also allow interlocking directorates if \u201cneither public nor private interests will be adversely affected thereby.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">The crucial question to be asked is whether this variation in treatment between broadcasters and common carriers sheds any light on how Congress intended FCC to accommodate its Clayton Act jurisdiction over communications common carriers and its more generally applicable licensing authority. Since the decision here under review was made pursuant to a statutory provision covering both of the groups subject to Commission control, the question becomes whether the \u201cpublic interest\u201d standard there specified means one thing for issuance of construction permits and station licenses to broadcasters but, because of the nature of FCC common-carrier responsibilities, means something else when the permit is to be issued to such a carrier. As with the Clayton Act, there are no express statements in the legislative history to answer these queries. But several things do combine to how suggest to me that Congress did not mean to compel FCC to refuse to license a carrier, any more than a broadcaster, solely on the ground that the applicant is an anticompetitive consolidation in contravention of Section 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">The first is a consideration of the source of what became the Communications Act, and what that indicates about how Congress viewed the legislation it was writing. As previously described,<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> the Act granted FCC two distinct functions \u2014 common carrier supervision and broadcast licensing\u2014 largely to be exercised over two distinct groups, and did so by transferring authority from two unrelated statutory schemes \u2014 the Interstate Commerce Act and the Radio Act of 1927.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Common carrier provisions derived from the former,<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> and the licensing provisions, including the one at issue here, from the latter.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Very importantly, consolidation of federal authority over these two forms of communication was intended primarily to centralize these functions, not to make any significant change in the substance of the law.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Although the new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>agency might thereafter consider under its station-licensing authority a grant to an entity over which it had additional supervisory power pursuant to the common carrier provisions, this compounding of functions was not alone to alter the agency\u2019s responsibilities under either branch of its mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Any conclusion that the decision whether to license SBS would be obviated by an FCC finding of a Clayton Act violation, however, would have to depend upon just such an implied alteration of functions. Under the Radio Act, the Radio Commission had no supervisory power over communications common carriers and so, as with broadcast license determination today,<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> need not have given disproportionate or decisive value to antitrust considerations. After the most exacting review of the origins of FCC\u2019s regulatory authority, I now believe Congress did not intend a change when it gave FCC jurisdiction over both broadcast licensing and common carrier regulation, a panoply of authority that includes also the Clayton Act enforcement powers. Any other view would suggest the anomalous result that in the field of broadcast regulation, where Congress expressly declared competition to be of major significance,<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> FCC could find that other public interest factors outweigh anticompetitive conduct, while it could not do so when dealing with common carriers, which operate in an environment where competition is less important as a controlling device.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">This reading of the legislative history leads to another helpful conclusion. By. analyzing the separate sources and the resulting disjunctive nature of FCC\u2019s responsibilities, the purpose in granting it Clayton Act enforcement authority becomes plainer. Under the Radio Act and the provisions derived from it, a license applicant must establish his good character,<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> and thus any anticompetitive conduct may, in the absence of contravening factors, warrant refusal of a license.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> Moreover, a license may be revoked at any time \u201cbecause of conditions coming to the attention of the Commission which would warrant it in refusing to grant a license or permit on an original application.\u201d <footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Under such a scheme the Commission has the ability to coax, if not directly order, a potential licensee to cease violating the antitrust laws. The addition of Clayton Act authority thus adds only in abstract, not practical, terms to FCC powers to win compliance from broadcasters.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">The Commission\u2019s common carrier supervisory powers, however, are more cumbersome to use in this manner. For example, although anticompetitive conduct is clearly relevant to review of rates, in order to punish antitrust violations in that context the Commission would have to find that the carrier\u2019s actions made its charges unjust or unreasonable, and hence unlawful.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> While this might easily be done where the illegal behavior is price discrimination under Section 2 of the Clayton Act,<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> a cause-and-effect relationship presumably would be harder to establish when the proscribed deed is, for instance, intercorporate acquisition.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Similar difficulties would seem likely in adapting such other Commission duties as the issuance of certificates of public conve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>nience and necessity<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> to the task of preventing harmful anticompetitive conduct. Here, consequently, the addition of Clayton Act authority has some significance. The Commission is elsewhere given authority under special circumstances to <em>approve </em>mergers<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> and interlocking directorates,<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> but without Section 11 of the Clayton Act it would in many instances lack sufficient power to halt such activities even when it finds that they infringe the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Additional light is shed by the history of the section of the Communications Act that governs agency response after a licensee is convicted in court of antitrust violations. That history shows a steady progression from considering a Clayton or Sherman Act conviction conclusive proof that a permit applicant is unfit, to a view that his guilt is only one of many factors to be weighed in the licensing decision. The section\u2019s roots were in the Radio Act, which took a relatively harsh line by compelling the Radio Commission to refuse a license to one who previously had been judicially adjudged guilty of conduct in contravention of any of the antitrust laws.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> There was, to be sure, considerable sentiment at that time for stiffening the law by permitting or even requiring license denials, even in the absence of a court conviction, if the agency found that the applicant was guilty of monopolizing radio communications,<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> but moves thus to amend the bill were defeated.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> When adopted in the Communications Act, the penalty for anticompetitive conduct was further eased; only if the convicting court itself revoked the party\u2019s license would the Commission be required to refuse further licensing,<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> and otherwise FCC could, but need not, deny future licenses to the party previously adjudged guilty.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> The Senate committee report explained that under these circumstances \u201cthe Commission can determine whether or not public interest will be served by the granting of a license.\u201d <footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">In a 1952 amendment to the section, Congress removed the clause stating that the Commission could in its discretion withhold licenses because of past court convictions.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> The Senate Report made it clear that the Commission retained its authority to consider antitrust violations, and could deny licenses solely because of such infractions if in its judgment they affected the applicant\u2019s character so adversely as to warrant that action.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> Nonetheless, Congress did not want the Commission to have the power to penalize a licensee by revocation if a court had not already so ordered.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">Because this provision of the Communications Act deals with punishment for past acts, and not with the importance of ongoing antitrust violations, it does not decisively answer the question we face here. Moreover, there are indications in the legislative history of the 1952 amendment that Congress viewed the section as referring only to Sherman Act violations,<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> though the lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>guage plainly is broader.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> It may be that the Commission\u2019s Section 11 responsibilities were overlooked,<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> which would hardly be surprising since agencies other than FTC have rarely if ever exercised this power.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> Nevertheless, by reaffirming FCC\u2019s general charter to weigh antitrust matters in making its public interest balance, while at the same time deemphasizing the singular importance of the antitrust consideration alone<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> \u2014 even after a court conviction\u2014 Congress bolstered the view that the Commission\u2019s role in licensing was not changed by the addition of Clayton Act enforcement authority.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">3. <em>Regulatory Policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">Before proceeding to a discussion of the gloss placed on the statutory provisions by subsequent judicial interpretation, one last word seems warranted on the overall nature of FCC responsibilities and how the Clayton Act authority conforms to it. The court suggests that to make Clayton Act considerations determinative in licensing decisions is to contravene the central concept of governmental regulation that \u201c \u2018competition cannot be trusted to do the job of regulation in that particular industry which competition does in other sectors of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the economy.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>99</footnotemark> While this may be true, it is a choice that Congress was entirely free to make, and our task here is to ascertain whether it did so, not to make an independent selection of what we deem to be better policy.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> Of course, in the absence of clear statutory language or legislative intent, we must draw upon such general considerations as regulatory purpose and consistency, and here the court is correct in assessing their implications.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> But if I did not find a similar conclusion emanating from the legislative history, I would be hard pressed to rest a holding in this case solely on those grounds because the statute itself, when considered only on its face, commends the contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">B. <em>Supreme Court Precedent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The relevant statutory texts and the legislative history thus indicate that the Communications and Clayton Acts are best reconciled by construing the latter as the addition merely of a separate antitrust enforcement tool and not as an antitrust mandate essentially changing the Commission\u2019s task as a licensing agency. I now move on to an examination of such judicial interpretations as there are. The court correctly concludes that none of the cases inexorably demands that antitrust considerations be elevated above other public interest factors when the agency proceeds to make a licensing decision.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> Yet I find the cases less easily dismissable than does the court and for this reason feel it necessary to review them independently.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Indisputably, FCC and other federal agencies must consider anticompetitive conduct under their broad mandates to promote the public interest.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> And there are, as the court points out, numerous cases holding that responsibility to enforce the antitrust laws is but one aspect of the public interest determination, and may be outweighed by other considerations appropriate to the regulatory decision.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> But close analysis of these opinions reveals that they are not precisely applicable to the statutory scheme now before us, and consequently could not dictate the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Both <em>McLean Trucking Co. v. United </em>States,<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> and <em>Seaboard Air Line Railroad v. United States,</em><footnotemark><em>106</em></footnotemark><em> </em>upon which the court relies, plainly declare that the public interest standard to be applied by ICC encompasses more than simply a policy favoring competi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>tion.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> And because that agency, like FCC, has Clayton Act enforcement responsibilities, one might conclude, as the court apparently does,<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> that these decisions indicate the proper result for the instant suit as well. Both <em>McLean </em>and <em>Seaboard </em>reviewed, however, not licensing decisions under a completely neutral public interest test, but ICC approval of possibly anticom-petitive consolidations under Section 5(2) of the Interstate Commerce Act,<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> a provision clearly choosing to subordinate antitrust concerns to other policies that are embodied in that legislation.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> This legislative choice is reflected also in Section 5(11), which expressly grants immunity from the antitrust laws to mergers so authorized.<footnotemark>111</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The court declines to distinguish these cases on this ground because the Supreme Court found in <em>McLean </em>that \u201c \u2018[t]he history of the development of the special national transportation policy suggests, <em>quite apart from the explicit provision of \u00a7 5(11), </em>that the policies of the antitrust laws determine \u201cthe public interest\u201d in railroad regulation only in a qualified way.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>112</footnotemark> This the court takes as presumably demonstrating that all ICC determinations under the public interest standard, not just determinations that could confer antitrust immunity, must involve balancing in this manner.<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> The <em>McLean </em>Court was careful to point out, however; that the agency\u2019s principal mandate may be affected by other statutes that bear upon its regulatory field; the amount it varies will depend on \u201cthe extent to which Congress indicates a desire to have [those conflicting] policies leavened or implemented in the enforcement of the various specific provisions of the legislation with which the [agency] is primarily and directly concerned.\u201d <footnotemark>114</footnotemark> In its decision the Court indulged Section 5(11) a significant role at this point, demonstrating conclusively the congressional intent to subordinate antitrust to other considerations in balancing under Section 5(2).<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> Whatever effect Section 11 of the Clayton Act, to which the <em>McLean </em>Court never referred, might have had was thus overridden by the more evident choice indicated by Section 5(11). In the case at bar, however, there is no external congressional statement lending that measure of clarity or influence, so we are returned to the original question \u2014 whether by giving FCC Clayton Act authority Congress evinced an intention to put antitrust considerations above others in the public interest balance. With this issue neither <em>McLean </em>nor <em>Seaboard </em>is of assistance.<footnotemark>116</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Nor is much help to be gained from the decisions reviewing FCC attention to antitrust problems. These cases either dealt with regulation of broadcasters,<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> over whom the Commission has no Clayton Act authority,<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> and hence no conflicting regulatory policy to be reconciled, or presented only .the question whether encouraging competition could be used as the sole basis for granting a license.<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> The only guidance available is afforded by <em>Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad v. United </em>States,<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> and even that is far from clear. Several of the appellants find in that opinion support for their view that Clayton Act considerations should have governed the licensing decision here,<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> but the court claims that the suggested interpretation \u201cstretches its words too far.\u201d <footnotemark>122</footnotemark> Yet it was just this reading of the <em>Denver </em>opinion that formed the sole basis of one of the dissents filed therein,<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> an indication of at least some facial plausibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">An understanding of the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Denver </em>necessitates an awareness of the statutory context in which it arose. ICC was asked to review a stock issuance, by Railway Express Agency to Greyhound Corporation, pursuant to agency authority under Section 20a(2) of the Interstate Commerce Act to approve issuance upon a finding that it \u201cis for some lawful object . . . and compatible with the public interest. . ..\u201d <footnotemark>124</footnotemark> ICC gave its endorsement, but only after deferring consideration of two matters; whether this undertaking would have anticompetitive consequences rising to the level of a Clayton Act violation <footnotemark>125</footnotemark> and whether acquisition of the stock by Greyhound would constitute \u201ccontrol\u201d of Railway Express and thus require endorsement under Section 5(2).<footnotemark>126</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-16\">After first approving postponement of \u201ccontrol\u201d questions, the Court held that the antitrust issues could not be held in abeyance,<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> distinguishing between the two inquiries on the ground that Section 5 sets forth a carrier-initiated procedure while Section 11 of the Clayton Act imposes its obligations upon the agency, and is in this sense \u201cmandatory.\u201d <footnotemark>128</footnotemark> It is in this context that most of the Court\u2019s language suggesting that the Clayton Act function is nondis-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>cretionary is to be found.<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> While hardly dicta, the Court\u2019s statements focused on a question decidedly different from the one presented here, and cannot safely be read as establishing Section 11 as unalterably mandatory for all purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">The Court went on to imply, however, that the legislative scheme did compel ICC to forbid under Section 20a stock acquisitions that transgress the Clayton Act, though it may under Section 5(2) allow mergers and consolidations that otherwise would break the law.<footnotemark>130</footnotemark> Here I agree with the court that, because the <em>Denver </em>Court was actually deciding only the question whether ICC should have deferred consideration of antitrust consequences, its discussion cannot be regarded as binding precedent on the nature of proper agency handling on remand.<footnotemark>131</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The judicial precedents, then, do not provide a reliable solution to our question. In the absence of persuasive decisional authority, I must rely upon my reading of the legislative materials. I thus conclude that the law is satisfied when FCC adequately explores and seriously considers antitrust consequences in making the public interest determination incumbent upon license applications and that it need not reject an applicant solely because of a Clayton Act violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">II. SECTION 309</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">An agency impermissibly exceeds the bounds of administrative discretion when it fails to adhere to procedures specifically mandated by statute; judicial deference to the agency is neither required nor warranted in such circumstances.<footnotemark>132</footnotemark> This is precisely the sort of administrative intransigence facing the court with respect to the second fundamental issue in this case: whether the Commission was justified in refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing on the anticom-petitive aspects of the SBS entry. By adopting this stance, the Commission has frustrated the intent of Section 309(e) of the Communications Act,<footnotemark>133</footnotemark> thus leaving as the only proper disposition of this case a remand for further proceedings. That course the court has elected to avoid at an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>appalling cost in terms of compromising the relevant legal principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">A. <em>The Statutory Scheme</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_6\">My analysis begins with a resume of the salient features of the Act. Section 308 empowers the Commission to award construction permits and station licenses subject to designated conditions.<footnotemark>134</footnotemark> Section 309(a) provides broadly that \u201cthe Commission shall determine, in the case of each application [therefor] filed with it .. ., whether the public interest, convenience, and necessity will be served by the granting of such application. . ..\u201d<footnotemark>135</footnotemark> Section 309(d)(1) opens that inquiry to public participation by authorizing interested parties to petition the Commission for denial of the application.<footnotemark>136</footnotemark> Section 309(d)(2) requires the Commission to deny the petition and grant the application upon a finding \u201cthat there are no substantial and material questions of fact and that a grant of the application would be consistent with [Section 309(a)]. ...\u201d <footnotemark>137</footnotemark> That section warns, however, that \u201c[i]f a substantial and material question of fact is presented or if the Commission for any reason is unable to find that grant of the application would be consistent with [Section 309(a)], it shall proceed as provided in [Section 309(e)].\u201d <footnotemark>138</footnotemark> The latter, which is critical in this litigation, in pertinent part specifies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">If, in the case of any application to which [Section 309(a)] applies, a substantial and material question of fact is presented or the Commission for any reason is unable to make the finding specified in such subsection, it shall formally designate the application for hearing on the ground or reasons then obtaining. ... Any hearing subsequently held upon such application shall be a full hearing in which the applicant and all other parties in interest shall be permitted to participate. The burden of proceeding with the introduction of evidence and the burden of proof shall be upon the applicant, except that with respect to any issue presented by a petition to deny or a petition to enlarge the issues, such burdens shall be as determined by the Commission.<footnotemark>139</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">The import of this language is plain. Whenever, in the course of reviewing a petition to deny an application or in considering the application itself, the Commission is confronted with a material factual dispute or it finds itself unable, for any reason, to determine whether a grant of the requested permit or license will serve the public interest, a hearing <em>must </em>be held \u2014 a <em>full hearing </em>in which all parties must be permitted to participate. The remainder of Section 309(e), by referring to introduction of evidence and assignment of burdens of proof, leaves no room for doubt that the \u201cfull\u201d hearing demanded is a trial-type evidentiary proceeding.<footnotemark>140</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">1. <em>Application of the Full Hearing Requirement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">In entertaining the petitions to deny the SBS license application, the Commission ignored the explicit directive of Section 309(e) and proceeded to employ only those procedures it deemed necessary and appropriate in light of its own view of the requisites of the licensing process. An oral argument was held before the Commission <em>en banc </em>and on two occasions written materials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>were solicited from interested parties,<footnotemark>141</footnotemark> but the agency consistently maintained that a full hearing was unnecessary. Invoking its alleged \u201cprocedural flexibility under the Communications Act,\u201d<footnotemark>142</footnotemark> the Commission held forth the argument and written submissions as an acceptable means of gathering data on the SBS entry without \u201cthe detriment to the public of undue delay which necessarily would occur if . .. further proceedings ... of a trial-type eviden-tiary nature\u201d were instituted.<footnotemark>143</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">I do not denigrate the usefulness of either oral or written presentations, for these measures are frequently of considerable value as investigatory tools in the preliminary stages of dispute resolution, and in some cases such streamlined procedures may be both appropriate and desirable as a means of achieving a final disposition. When, however, the procedural format of a matter is governed by a statute such as Section 309, the agency <em>must </em>take the actions prescribed once the conditions set forth therein arise. Thus, I cannot subscribe to the court\u2019s assertion that \u201c[a]ll parties to this appeal agree that some sort of hearing was needed to investigate the antitrust consequences of the SBS entry [, therefore] the disputed question is what particular kind of hearing was needed.\u201d<footnotemark>144</footnotemark> If there were material facts in dispute concerning the SBS venture or the Commission was unable adequately to appraise the public interest on the basis of the record as it then stood, a full hearing was required. Anything less than that would have been lawful only if, after completion of the preliminary steps undertaken here, no material fact remained in controversy and the agency possessed all the information reasonably necessary to assess the public interest properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-15\">Similarly unsupportable is the Commission\u2019s attempt to justify its procedural disposition of the SBS application on the basis of the decisions of the Supreme Court in <em>Gulf States Utilities Co. v. </em>FPC<footnotemark>145</footnotemark> and the Third Circuit in <em>Bell Telephone Co. v. </em>FCC.<footnotemark>146</footnotemark> The statutes at issue in those cases <footnotemark>147</footnotemark> direct that the relevant public interest determinations shall be made after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>\u201copportunity for hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>148</footnotemark> This language imposes a far lighter burden on an agency than Section 309(e)\u2019s mandate that upon satisfaction of the conditions specified the matter involving it \u201cshall formally designate the application for hearing.\u201d <footnotemark>149</footnotemark> The phrase from the Third Circuit opinion employed by the Commission to conclude its dissertation on this point aptly demonstrates its failure to comprehend the essential point. Quoting from <em>Bell Telephone </em>Co.,<footnotemark>150</footnotemark> the Commission stated that, \u201c[i]n the absence of a per <em>se </em>statutory directive, the type of procedure chosen must be related to the kinds of issues involved.\u201d <footnotemark>151</footnotemark> A <em>\u201cper se </em>statutory directive\u201d is precisely what is supplied by Section 309(e).<footnotemark>152</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-14\">The Commission cannot, therefore, escape the dictates of Section 309 by the expedient of weighing the nature of the questions involved in a particular matter against the pros and cons of other available procedural devices to reach a decision on the disputed license application. Congress itself struck that balance in 1960;<footnotemark>153</footnotemark> the Commission has no choice other than to abide by this legislative command. Shortcut procedures, no matter how desirable from the Commission\u2019s perspective, will not satisfy the requisites of Section 309.<footnotemark>154</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-15\">2. <em>The Need for Expedition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-16\">Just as foreshortened procedural dispositions are not legally sufficient when disput<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>ed issues of fact or doubts about where the public interest lies arise in Section 309 proceedings, the requirement of a full hearing \u2014 an evidentiary hearing \u2014 cannot be circumvented on grounds of an alleged need for expedition. On its face the statute contains no provision for dispensing with the hearing to avoid potential delays,<footnotemark>155</footnotemark> and nothing in the legislative history suggests that Congress intended such an exception.<footnotemark>156</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">The language now codified as subsection (e) was added to Section 309 of the Communications Act in 1960. Until then, an objection to a license application was registered by means of a protest filed by an interested party after the Commission had determined to issue the license.<footnotemark>157</footnotemark> The 1960 amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>ment resulted in displacement of this system by the current pre-grant petition process.<footnotemark>158</footnotemark> The Senate Report accompanying the bill proposing this change explained that then \u201cexisting mandatory protest procedures [left] the Commission little discretion to dispense with useless or even frivolous proceedings;\u201d<footnotemark>159</footnotemark> Congress was \u25a0 concerned that \u201c[p]rotest hearings [had] created immeasurable delays in bringing service to the public, but [had] resulted in few final reversals of grants.\u201d<footnotemark>160</footnotemark> Moreover, this arrangement placed a heavy burden</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXY\">on the Commission and on successful applicants by requiring unnecessary and lengthy proceedings, after grants [were] made, to vindicate the grants in situations where there [was] no substantial basis for attacking them. At the same time the protest procedure failfed] to give real assurance to protesting parties in interest that legitimate objections to a grant [would] be given timely and adequate consideration by the Commission.<footnotemark>161</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"alh-dedup-0\">These passages illustrate that Congress was disturbed by the inefficiency of a scheme that frequently resulted in prolonged time lags prior to the issuance of licenses and effectively delayed the granting of applications benefiting the public interest, but seldom succeeded in screening out those to which significant objections were made. Accordingly, Congress revamped the old protest system and created the present pre-grant petition process.<footnotemark>162</footnotemark> This new device enabled the Commission to prevent the needless delay inexorably resulting from frivolous objections to license applications, while simultaneously ensuring that substantial complaints would not be dismissed by the Commission before they had been accorded the degree of consideration Congress thought necessary \u2014 a full evi-dentiary proceeding. As the House Report stated, \u201c[t]he purpose of this language is to make it <em>absolutely clear </em>that the application will be designated for hearing before a grant in any case where a substantial and material question of fact is presented and not disposed of.\u201d<footnotemark>163</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Given this clear legislative directive, it is evident that an attempt by the Commission to justify its refusal to hold a hearing in the SBS matter on the ground that an exception to the requirements of Section 309(e) is permitted because of a supposed overriding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>need for expedition would be wholly devoid of merit. Apparently cognizant of the in-defensibility of that position, the agency has not attempted to explain the absence of a hearing on the basis of this theory.<footnotemark>164</footnotemark> Instead, the Commission asserts that \u201cthe benefits to the public of a more rapid institution of service far outweigh any possible benefits of such time-consuming procedures.\u201d<footnotemark>165</footnotemark> The court jumps on the bandwagon along with the agency because it supposes \u201cthat an evidentiary hearing would less promote reasoned decisionmak-ing in this case than it would delay and impede technological progress.\u201d<footnotemark>166</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The most obvious inquiry is how this premature balancing of what the agency and the court take to be the public interest was permitted to creep into the decisionmaking process in the first place. A second question that must be asked is why the agency has been allowed to continue to cling tenaciously to such a faulty analysis despite discerning judicial scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The naked proposition that an agency may choose to disregard procedures prescribed by statute has repeatedly been given short shrift by this court and others.<footnotemark>167</footnotemark> Surely the Commission\u2019s effort to disguise that offense here by clothing it in the habiliments of a factor to be included in weighing the public interest is a thinly-veiled effort that should not succeed. While the public likely would benefit in the short run from expedited service from new satellites,<footnotemark>168</footnotemark> Section 309 gives the Commission no authority to consider the public interest in deciding whether a hearing must be conducted pursuant to subsection (e). In framing Section 309 as it now stands, Congress itself made that decision; in its view, a full hearing is necessary to ensure adequate consideration of the issues involved in licensing proceedings whenever material facts are disputed or the public interest is in doubt for some other reason. The potential for delay inherent in evidentiary hearings was balanced against the public interest in expedition when Section 309(e) was enacted, and Congress concluded that whatever time lags such a hearing may entail are worth the cost.<footnotemark>169</footnotemark> It is not for the Commission to reject that determination and proceed to make its own; however camouflaged, an agency\u2019s attempt to override Congress cannot be permitted to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-13\">My position on this point does not mean that I quarrel with the court\u2019s view that delays in providing service to the public are regrettable. Neither does it imply that I favor abusive use of the procedures required by Section 309 and similar statutes by parties who seek to latch on to these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>measures simply as a means of promoting their own economic welfare. I agree with the court that compliance with such provisions may sometimes \u201carm interested parties with a potent instrument for delay,\u201d<footnotemark>170</footnotemark> and that \u201c[although evidentiary hearings . .. are useful \u2014 and sometimes indispensable \u2014 they may also be exploited fot unworthy purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>171</footnotemark> There are two sides to this coin, however. Unlike the court, not only would I hold the Commission to the procedure specified in Section 309(e) \u2014 because it is congressionally mandated \u2014 but I would also give full value to evidentiary hearings and recognize that even when not indispensable they can have great utility in complex and important cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Ventilation of issues, for example, is a solid reason to hold hearings when material facts are in controversy or the public interest defies summary resolution. When decisions are made hastily, without adequate consideration of all of their ramifications, important long run consequences are often obfuscated by concentration on immediate problems and by the natural desire to reap immediate benefits. A communications' license is a broad grant of power and economic advantage, and Congress rather obviously viewed it as too important to approve without ensuring thorough investigation \u2014 a degree of scrutiny that only an evidentiary-type hearing can provide in cases where significant controversies arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">This is not a situation in which the public is on one side and self-seeking would-be oligopolists are on the other; the potential licensee and those opposing the application all seek economic benefits. The interaction of these adversaries would not only ensure that license privileges will be allocated fairly, but would also serve to illuminate issues vital to the public interest determination. Moreover, in addition to SBS\u2019s competitors for the license, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission were drawn into this litigation by the threatened anticompetitive effects of the proposed SBS entry. The Commission should not be allowed to conclude lightly that its institutional bent for advancing communications interests at the expense of other national policies inevitably coincides with the welfare of the public. Indeed, antitrust problems could cause severe consequences for the very industry the Commission is charged with regulating.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">The delay involved in resolving the SBS matter has been lengthy, but the reasons for it lie partly in the way Congress designed the statute and the Commission\u2019s desire to litigate in the hope of escaping the dictates of Section 309 instead of honoring them. The time lapse is certainly regrettable, but the court\u2019s willingness to allow the agency to ignore the law is even more unfortunate.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">B. The <em>Material Facts in Controversy and the Determination of the Public Interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">Once it is understood that neither the Commission\u2019s shortcutting procedures nor its assertion of an imperative need for speed can override the requirements of Section 309, the pivotal issue in this case is clear: whether there were material facts in controversy concerning the anticompetitive effects of the SBS venture or, if not, whether the Commission for any reason was unable adequately to determine the public interest without further inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">1. <em>Disputed Issues of Fact</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">There allegedly were four classes of material facts in dispute<footnotemark>172</footnotemark> with respect to the SBS application: (1) how to define the relevant market and submarkets;<footnotemark>173</footnotemark> (2) the effect a licensing of the joint venture would have on potential competition in the domestic satellite industry \u2014 encompassing such questions as the likelihood of independent entry by IBM and Comsat, and the potential \u201cin-the-wings\u201d consequences if either or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>both were to remain on the fringes of the market;<footnotemark>174</footnotemark> (3) the possibility that SBS, once established, could become entrenched to an extent that would inhibit future competition in the industry;<footnotemark>175</footnotemark> and (4) the danger that SBS might engage in predatory practices at some future time.<footnotemark>176</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">2. <em>Statutory Affidavit Requirements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The court begins its endeavor to justify the Commission\u2019s actions in the SBS proceeding by seizing on a technicality. Section 309(d)(1) of the Act provides that a petition to deny a license application</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahe\">shall contain specific allegations of fact sufficient to show that ... a grant of the application would be prima facie inconsistent with [Section 309(a)].<footnotemark>177</footnotemark> Such allegations of fact shall, except for those of which official notice may be taken, be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof.... <footnotemark>178</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Referring to the legislative history of this 1960 addition to Section 309,<footnotemark>179</footnotemark> the court emphasizes that it \u201cwas intended to require \u2018a substantially stronger showing of greater probative value\u2019 than had been required before,\u201d <footnotemark>180</footnotemark> and that \u201c[t]he allegations must be of specific evidentiary facts, not \u2018ultimate, conclusionary facts or more general allegations.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>181</footnotemark> The court then proceeds to employ these statements as the predicate for the rather startling conclusion that the Commission was not obligated to consider the fact issues recounted above \u2014 assertedly because they were not properly raised by opponents of the license application. The court says Section 309(d) requires <em>affidavits </em>detailing factual allegations, and it finds the requisite specificity lacking in the affidavits accompanying the Western Union and American Satellite petitions.<footnotemark>182</footnotemark> The thesis of this analysis is that the Commission may ignore issues tendered by petitions accompanied by affidavits having that fault, regardless of the factual specificity of the petitions themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-19\">The court is correct that the affidavits in support of the petitions opposing SBS\u2019s application are neither lengthy nor abounding in detail,<footnotemark>183</footnotemark> but the conclusion that they are insufficient to satisfy Section 309(d) is erroneous. Even a cursory reading of the section reveals that its demand is that \u201c[t]he <em>petition,\u201d </em>not the affidavit, \u201cshall contain .specific allegations of fact.\u201d<footnotemark>184</footnotemark> In complete compliance with this rule, the <em>petitions </em>submitted by Western Union and American Satellite set forth allegations that indisputably are specific in nature.<footnotemark>185</footnotemark> In light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>this fact, it would be pointless to require the affidavits to repeat every detail contained in the petitions, and Section 309(d) does not dictate that this be done. Rather, the only condition the section places on the <em>affidavits </em>is that, \u201cexcept for [facts] of which official notice may be taken,\u201d they must be based on \u201cpersonal knowledge.\u201d<footnotemark>186</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ad-dedup-0\">The \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d language is the key to the change Congress intended Section 309(d) to effectuate in the prior statutory provisions on demonstrating support for objections to license grants.<footnotemark>187</footnotemark> Formerly, protests to approval of applications could be based on information and belief.<footnotemark>188</footnotemark> Consequently, \u201callegationfs] of ultimate, conclusionary facts or mere allegations on information and belief, supported by generalized affidavits\u201d<footnotemark>189</footnotemark> deluged the Commission with frivolous complaints. Often the filings consisted of \u201cill-founded protests with allegations based not on known facts, but on suspicion or less.\u201d <footnotemark>190</footnotemark> Congress sought to ensure that the new pre-grant petition process would not acquire a similar handicap when it specified that the allegations of the petitions must be specific, while the supporting affidavit need only be supplied by someone with personal knowledge of the facts set forth in the petition. That is precisely what Western Union and American Satellite did here.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">After explaining the above change, the section of the Senate Report addressing the proposal to amend Section 309(d) stated that \u201c[i]n considering a petition to deny, the Commission should be guided by rules applicable to a motion for summary judgment,\u201d <footnotemark>191</footnotemark> and it is well settled that a verified pleading may serve as an affidavit for summary judgment purposes. Professors Wright and Miller tell us that \u201c[a] verified pleading may be treated as an affidavit and used in any way in which an affidavit would be suitable.\u201d<footnotemark>192</footnotemark> Professor Moore observes that \u201c[i]f facts are clearly stated in a pleading as true to the affiant\u2019s own knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>edge, and are not so interspersed with generalized allegations or allegations based on information and belief that it cannot be readily ascertained what facts are sworn to, then the pleading ought to be equivalent to an affidavit relative to the facts set forth.\u201d<footnotemark>193</footnotemark> The court\u2019s position on this point is thus weak, especially given the Commission\u2019s ready acceptance of the Western Union and American Satellite petitions.<footnotemark>194</footnotemark> That the argument is made at all suggests the court\u2019s lack of confidence in its ability to defend the Commission\u2019s failure to hold a hearing in the face of the acknowledged existence of disputed questions of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">3. <em>Known Obstacles to the Public Interest Determination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Even stranger than its concern over the Western Union and American Satellite affidavits, however, is the court\u2019s emphasis on the absence of affidavits from the Department of Justice.<footnotemark>195</footnotemark> I am unable to grasp the court\u2019s point since the Department did not file a petition to deny the SBS application; instead, both the Department and the Federal Trade Commission submitted comments to the Commission sharing the same types of concerns advanced by Western Union and American Satellite.<footnotemark>196</footnotemark> It is far from clear from the language of Section 309(e) that these comments were not an acceptable alternative vehicle for the presentation of material factual disputes triggering the evidentiary hearing requirement. In any event, they certainly put the Commission on notice that there were serious antitrust problems with the SBS entry, and thus alerted it to a reason why a trial-type hearing was required to determine the public interest, as dictated by the second prong of the Section 309(e) test. This court has already</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-13\">point[ed] out that the Federal Communications Commission was intended by Congress to function as far more than a mere referee between conflicting parties. Regardless of the formal status of a party, or the technical merits of a particular petition, the FCC \u201cshould not close its eyes to the public interest factors\u201d raised by the material in its files. We have noted that, as a general matter, the federal regulatory agencies should construe pleadings filed before them so as to raise rather than avoid important questions. They \u201cshould not adopt procedures that foreclose full inquiry into broad public interest questions, either patent or latent.\u201d <footnotemark>197</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>A hearing was therefore necessary regardless of the final product of the court\u2019s pedantic reliance on technicalities with respect to material fact questions. This, conclusion clashes violently with the court\u2019s claim that the only review called for in this case is an examination to see whether the Commission has \u201creally taken a \u2018hard look\u2019 at the salient problems, and has * * * genuinely engaged in reasoned decisionmak-ing.\u201d <footnotemark>198</footnotemark> Here the agency failed to observe the hearing requirement of Section 309(e), ignoring the will of Congress, and however hard its look or reasoned its decisionmaking there is no excuse for its flat disregard of a procedure mandated by statute.<footnotemark>199</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">C. <em>The Usefulness of </em>a <em>Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"ADq\">With the hearing requirement of Section 309(e) triggered, the Commission\u2019s decision can withstand judicial scrutiny only if an evidentiary inquiry would have served no useful purpose.<footnotemark>200</footnotemark> The agency advances four arguments to this effect, but none I consider satisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">1. <em>The Commission\u2019s Factual </em>Assumptions</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">The Commission\u2019s first and most significant thesis is that it \u201cassumed for the purposes of analysis that the ... contentions [of the SBS license opponents were] correct and [drew] appropriate inferences therefrom.\u201d<footnotemark>201</footnotemark> In some cases the Commission may be at liberty to adopt this approach\u2014 acting, as it may, analogously to a court addressing a motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>202</footnotemark> But whether confronting an administrative agency or a court, an antitrust dispute may be peculiarly unsuited to that methodology, as we have recognized.<footnotemark>203</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>This is due, at least in part, to the intrinsic nature of alleged anticompetitive effects; they are not black and white, but vary across an infinite spectrum in terms of magnitude and severity. It is thus nearly impossible to \u201cassume\u201d anticompetitive effects in a meaningful fashion.<footnotemark>204</footnotemark> It is not simply a matter of factoring the occurrence of an antitrust problem into a decision; the extent of the potential damage to competition must be determined, and it may be impossible even to estimate the significance of the potential dangers without an eviden-tiary proceeding. The Department of Justice believes that just such a situation exists in the instant case, and so do I. The Department has aptly stated that \u201c[w]e lack sufficient information to make such a judgment. So does the Commission, but it has refused to admit as much.\u201d <footnotemark>205</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">The difficulty of mere assumptions of anticompetitive effects is compounded when the product of the assumption must be taken into account in attempting to balance the pejorative influence of antitrust elements against other considerations. What weight is to be given the factors assumed? The answer is as elusive as evaluation of the significance of an object that is known to be present but cannot be seen, touched or heard. What can be done with it? It cannot be used properly, yet it cannot be ignored. As the Supreme Court has declared in vacating conclusions of a district court based on a blind \u201cbalancing\u201d of potential anticompetitive effects against alleged benefits to the community of permitting a bank merger, \u201c[t]o weigh adequately one of these factors against the other requires a proper conclusion as to each.\u201d <footnotemark>206</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">The Commission seeks to avoid these complications by asserting that it has assumed the worst with respect to each dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>puted fact and still the public interest favors granting the SBS license.<footnotemark>207</footnotemark> We cannot probe the minds of administrative deci-sionmakers <footnotemark>208</footnotemark> but it is not necessary to do so in order to discern the inaccuracy of this statement. It is evident that the agency could not have viewed the facts in the light most favorable to the opponents of the SBS license; the Commission\u2019s opinion is replete with examples. In discussing the loss of benefit from the independent entry of either IBM or Comsat, combined with the influence on competition derived from the in-the-wings effect of knowledge that the other would remain just outside the market, the Commission stated that \u201ceven assuming the validity of the arguments which claim that one or the other would enter individually, <em>it must be recognized that the non-entering entity would exert little or no competitive influence from the fringes.\"</em><footnotemark><em>209</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Similarly, in addressing specific anticompet-itive effects, the Commission expressed its \u201cview [that] <em>SBS will not have any significant advantage in the domestic satellite or major telecommunications markets </em>by virtue of IBM\u2019s participation therein, notwithstanding IBM\u2019s alleged domination of various computer and data equipment markets,\u201d<footnotemark>210</footnotemark> and subsequently reflected on its opinion that predatory conduct by SBS is unlikely to occur.<footnotemark>211</footnotemark> Even the Commission\u2019s own conclusions destroy any doubt that it \u201cassumed the worst\u201d and construed the disputed facts against SBS: \u201cIn sum, the anti-competitive effects which might arguably flow from SBS\u2019 entry in satellite communications (e. g., loss of potential competition, of increased barriers to entry, future illegal conduct of SBS in restraint of trade) are not likely to occur.. . .\u201d<footnotemark>212</footnotemark> Obviously the agency\u2019s assumption-of-facts theory is baseless.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">2. <em>The Commission\u2019s Fallback Theories</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-14\">The remaining arguments<footnotemark>213</footnotemark> in support of the Commission\u2019s refusal to hold an evi-dentiary hearing are (1) that the facts are legislative in nature and thus inappropriate subjects of an adjudicative hearing, (2) that they are incapable of definite ascertainment, and (3) that to the extent these facts can be determined they are so far within the agency\u2019s expertise that it needed no assistance in evaluating them. These attempted justifications, in my view, deserve the same fate as the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-15\">In defending its assertion that the matters in controversy herein are legislative facts, the Commission cites Professor Davis\u2019 treatise on administrative law<footnotemark>214</footnotemark> \u2014 a very useful place to begin. Professor Davis defines the concepts in the following way: \u201cLegislative facts do not usually concern the immediate parties but are the general facts which help the tribunal decide ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>tions of law and policy and discretion.\u201d <footnotemark>215</footnotemark> In contrast, \u201c[ajdjudicative facts usually answer the questions of who did what, where, when, how, why, with what motive or intent. .. ,\u201d<footnotemark>216</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">It is evident that the controversy in the SBS proceeding is limited to the immediate parties. The issue is whether the partnership formed by IBM, Comsat and Aetna should be granted a license, not whether the licensing of earth stations is a good idea, or to what extent competition should be encouraged in the industry.<footnotemark>217</footnotemark> No new policies are at stake; the positive and negative aspects of the SBS entry are the focus of concern.<footnotemark>218</footnotemark> The disputed facts relate wholly to economic power, motives and services of specific companies. Mere assertions to the contrary cannot transform them into legislative facts.<footnotemark>219</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-12\">The final points pressed by the Commission are interrelated and should therefore be considered together. First, the agency asserts that the facts at issue are incapable of definite ascertainment.<footnotemark>220</footnotemark> The court agrees, stating, \u201c[w]e do not know, and months of hearings and cross-examinations will not enable us to divine, the future course of the industry.\u201d <footnotemark>221</footnotemark> What would IBM and Comsat do without the joint venture? How do other potential entrants and established competitors perceive SBS? To what extent would the advent of SBS deter subsequent entries into the industry? How competitive are terrestrial and satellite services? The court\u2019s statement that no final answers can presently be found to these questions may be correct. Few future facts are ever known definitely, especially when they deal with economic behavior or questions of motivation and intent,<footnotemark>222</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>but this is not a reason to dispense with all inquiry into antitrust problems. The more careful the analysis and the exploration, the more likely it becomes that accurate predictions and sound decisions will result. To say that something is \u201cincapable of definite ascertainment\u201d is not to justify the absence of an informed estimate; and lack of obedience to Section 309(e) would be excused only if it could be shown that an evidentia-ry-type proceeding would not have been useful \u2014 that it would not have shed further light on the problem. Both the Commission and the court have yet to demonstrate that this is so.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Finally, the Commission tells us that it is so expert in handling these types of questions that it would derive no benefit from a hearing. This is difficult to believe, for more reasons than one. Concededly, considerable deference must be given to agency expertise,<footnotemark>223</footnotemark> but expertise \u201ccan[not] substitute for the adequate evidentiary basis upon which the Commission\u2019s finding[s] must rest,\u201d <footnotemark>224</footnotemark> nor can it excuse a failure to hold a hearing in a Section 309(e) proceeding unless that hearing would be pointless. Even experts can garner substantial assistance from testimony and cross-examination of those who not only are conversant in the particular field of knowledge but also with the particular facts of the case. Nonexpert witnesses \u2014 company officers, for example\u2014 can shed light on the motivation behind a firm\u2019s actions and on industry perceptions of disputed issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">There is, too, the further question whether FCC's area of expertise does extend to the controversy before us.<footnotemark>225</footnotemark> This is neither a dispute over the needs of the communications industry nor a controversy concerning the technological feasibility of a potential licensee\u2019s proposal. Given the proportion of its time that must be spent on these and a multitude of other matters, it is surprising that the Commission has also become expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>in the antitrust field. Neither the Department of Justice nor the Federal Trade Commission lay claim to that sort of fame; indeed, both have found themselves unable to evaluate the potential antitrust impact of the SBS entry on the basis of the record before the Commission.<footnotemark>226</footnotemark> FCC undoubtedly is intimately acquainted with the communications industry, but I daresay there are others far more learned on the effects of barriers to entry, perceived potential competitors, the role of technological, cost, and risk elements in corporate decisionmaking, and other antitrust factors at issue in this case.<footnotemark>227</footnotemark> Even if there are no certain answers to questions concerning the SBS application, the Commission\u2019s decision surely would have rested on a much firmer foundation with the aid of an evidentiary hearing. The point simply is not whether the decision was rational and substantially supported by the administrative record. The linchpin of this court\u2019s analysis should be whether the decision was predicated upon the type of searching inquiry and complete record Congress intended to ensure in Section 309(e) proceedings, and clearly it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The absence of an evidentiary hearing should be fatal to the Commission\u2019s decision to grant the SBS license application. Although some sections of the Communications Act <footnotemark>228</footnotemark> allow the agency discretion to choose the methods to be employed in proceedings thereunder, Section 309 sets forth specific statutory requirements which must be followed by the Commission in determining whether to grant a given license. Where, as here, material issues of fact remain in controversy or the direction in which the public interest lies is unclear, the Commission is required to designate the matter for a hearing \u2014 a full evidentiary proceeding. Both the Commission and the court have failed to demonstrate why we should not hold the agency bound by the mandate of Section 309. Consequently, I would reverse the Commission\u2019s decision and remand this case for a full hearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-14\">. Reprinted in the Joint Appendix (JA) at 1522.

Our examination of these documents, however, reveals a detailed legal and economic analysis, but little in the way of \u201cspecific allegations of fact.\u201d Indeed, Judge Robinson\u2019s three selected illustrations of purportedly specific factual allegations in the petitions underscore this conclusion. <em>See id., </em>note 185. The first illustrative allegation \u2014 Western Union\u2019s statement concerning the principal customers for domestic satellite <em>service </em>\u2014 is essentially undisputed. Disputed is the <em>inference </em>that might be drawn: for example, whether these principal customers so dominate SBS\u2019s potential clientele, and are so separate an economic unit, as to constitute a relevant submarket for purposes of antitrust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>analysis. The second and third examples\u2014 concerning entry requirements and IBM\u2019s 1975 statement that it had considered separate entry \u2014 were supported by citations to the <em>CML Decision, supra </em>note 35, 51 FCC2d 14, and statements by IBM. These \u201callegations\u201d were not disputed, nor did they contribute anything not already known to the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">The disagreements among the parties are not genuinely factual; rather, they concern the appropriate public interest determination on the antitrust and communications issues.

In this case, though the Department\u2019s submissions have been more detailed and sophisticated, they still fall short of the \u201cspecific allegations of fact\u201d required of petitions to deny by \u00a7 309(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"84\">\n<p id=\"b170-7\">. The Department of Justice has in effect admitted that the allegations of fact in the petitions to deny were in themselves insufficient to trigger the hearing requirement of \u00a7 309(e): \u201cWe lack sufficient information to make such a judgment.

It is even more puzzling when compared to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Columbus Broadcasting Coalition v. FCC, supra </em>note 81, in which Judge Robinson joined. In that case the court upheld an FCC licensing decision against the challenge that an evidentiary hearing under \u00a7 309(e) had been erroneously denied. The <em>Columbus Broadcasting </em>petitioner had submitted a petition to deny relying on four substantial alleged deviations of the licensee from the public interest standard. The petition alleged facts more specific, more disputed, and more within its personal knowledge than any in the present case. Nevertheless, the court recognized that the FCC\u2019s decision not to hold a hearing was within its discretion and expertise. Following a similar standard in this case, we must affirm the Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"85\">\n<p id=\"b170-12\">.

Thus, our dissenting colleague\u2019s professed adherence to a congressional decision to require hearings in cases such as this, <em>see </em>opinion of Judge Robinson, text and notes at notes 156-169, is misplaced. Section 309(e) does <em>not </em>\u201cg&gt;ve[] the Commission no authority to consider the public interest in deciding whether a hearing must be conducted!.]\u201d <em>Id., </em>text following note 168.

Section 309(e) requires an evidentiary hearing <em>if </em>a substantial and material question of fact is presented, or if the FCC is unable to reach a determination on the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>interest. Contrary to our colleague\u2019s mechanical approach, these determinations require <em>judgment. </em>The substantiality and materiality of purported issues of fact, and the need for further information, are issues to be evaluated in the first instance by the Commission in the light of its public interest responsibility. This court\u2019s oversight role is quite limited. <em>Columbus Broadcasting Coalition v. FCC, supra </em>note 81; West <em>Michigan Telecasters, Inc. v. FCC, </em>396 F.2d 688 (D.C.Cir.1968). Of course, this does not mean that the FCC may \u201cignore\u201d or \u201cdisregard\u201d the requirements of the Communications Act.

We observe that the appellants and <em>amicus curiae </em>as a group offer or imply at least seven purported grounds for distinguishing <em>Network Project. </em>The Department of Justice had offered three: (1) that the satellite industry is no longer experimental, brief of Dep\u2019t of Justice at 53; (2) that <em>Network Project </em>involved only inferences from undisputed facts, supplemental brief of Dep\u2019t of Justice at 32; and (3) that <em>Network Project </em>involved vertical integration or anticompetitive behavior susceptible of alleviation by FCC restrictive orders, reply brief of Dep\u2019t of Justice at 11 n.4. In its main brief American Satellite offered two grounds for distinguishing the cases: that <em>Network Project </em>involved no disputed material facts, and that it involved the question whether the FCC could impose a <em>per se </em>disqualification on all entries posing vertical integration problems. Brief of American Satellite at 38 n.2. In its reply brief American Satellite offered a third: that in this case \u2014 unlike the original license proceeding\u2014 there are carriers operating in the field that deserve protection from a new entrant. Reply brief of American Satellite at 2-3. The FTC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>suggests that <em>Network Project </em>did not involve a balancing of anticompetitive and other factors, and that the present case, unlike <em>Network Project, </em>presents a <em>prima facie </em>Clayton Act violation. Brief of FTC at 31 n.66; supplemental brief of FTC at 9 n.8. We do not consider any of these grounds for distinction persuasive. If anything, this appeal presents a clearer case for affirmance than did <em>Network Project, </em>because the factual record is more complete and the analysis of the antitrust issues more careful. We especially reject American Satellite\u2019s argument that once several firms are granted entrance into the field the rules should be changed to block competition from additional entrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Our dissenting colleague also attempts to distinguish <em>Network Project, on </em>the ground that the petitioner in that case \u201cdid not dispute any of the material facts upon which the determination was predicated, but asserted only that those facts were insufficient to underpin a pub-lie-interest finding.\u201d This he calls \u201conly a legal question, on which a hearing was obviously unnecessary.\u201d Opinion of Judge Robinson at note 144. In the case at bar, however, appellants have not disputed any of the material <em>facts, </em>but have concentrated instead on the ultimate conclusion, just as the Network Project did. Here, as in <em>Network Project, </em>appellants primarily assert that insufficient facts have been adduced to make a public interest finding. <em>See text </em>and notes at notes 82-84 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"98\">\n<p id=\"b173-13\">. <em>SBS Decision, </em>62 FCC2d 1063-1064 j| 186, JA 1586-1587; <em>id </em>at 1099 j| 305, JA 1622.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"99\">\n<p id=\"b173-14\">.

The Department of Justice has charged that the FCC\u2019s conclusion that IBM is not likely to enter the domestic satellite communications industry alone is contradicted by a statement in the earlier <em>CML Decision. </em>According to the Department\u2019s supplemental brief at 46, the FCC had \u201cfound it \u2018likely\u2019 that IBM would enter if denied the opportunity to engage in a joint venture with Comsat. 51 FCC2d at 39.\u201d The baselessness of this charge is revealed by quoting the cited language of the <em>CML Decision </em>in context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">It is, of course, <em>possible </em>that both IBM and Comsat General would seek independent entry as domestic satellite applicants if we forbid their joint entry in any manner whatsoever. Indeed, our decision herein implicitly acknowledges as much in providing them with the option of doing so in the event they find this preferable to the balanced CML and leasing options set forth herein. But in arriving at a determination on the Section 7 allegations of the various parties we must pragmatically acknowledge the fact that the financial barriers to both IBM and Comsat General entering independently are formidable indeed. On a conservative estimate, entry into the domestic satellite field requires a capital investment well in excess of $100 million. Considering this enormous capital investment cost, in light of the present difficulties in raising capital and the very uncertain nature of the demand for satellite communications services * * *, we cannot indulge in the same assumptions about the [ejase of entry that might be appropriate for other industries * * * Given IBM\u2019s resources we might well suppose it likely that it would proceed alone if necessary, but if it did so, could we suppose it is equally likely that Comsat General would enter \u2014 in competition with IBM and the other domestic satellite carriers such as AT&amp;T, Western Union and RCA satellite carriers? Reasonable men can debate at length over the probabilities of independent entry by both IBM and Comsat General, but the debate cannot be resolved simply by recitation of antitrust decisions dealing with assorted other industries and other circumstances. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-14\"><em>CML Decision, supra </em>note 35, 51 FCC2d at 39 j[ 40 (emphasis in original; citations omitted).

The Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 <em>et seq., </em>was amended in several respects in 1960. Section 309 was revised in an effort to provide more efficient and meaningful Commission review of objections to license applications filed pursuant to \u00a7 308(a). See text <em>supra </em>at notes 155-163. The 1960 amendments resulted in the replacement of the prior mechanism for registering such objections with a new procedure. Prior to 1952, \u00a7 309 required the Commission to grant a license application if it found it in the public interest to do so. If the Commission was unable to make such a finding, it was to notify the applicant and provide an opportunity for a hearing on the matter. In 1952, the section was amended to allow parties in interest to protest any license granted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Commission within 30 days of this action. Protestants were required to include in their pleadings statements demonstrating their interest in the matter, and they were to specify, on the basis of information and belief, see note 188 <em>infra, </em>facts evidencing the impropriety of granting the license. The Commission was required to rule on protests within thirty days, and to designate a hearing on a license with respect to which a sufficient protest had been filed. In 1956, \u00a7 309 was again amended, in order to permit the Commission to dispense with the hearing requirement where no ground for setting aside the license grant existed, even if the facts were as alleged in the petition. The 1960 amendments also altered the notice requirements devised in 1952. See note 169 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"158\">\n<p id=\"b205-6\">. The current statutory scheme works as follows. Pursuant to subsection (a), the Commission is directed to grant any application whenever the grant would serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity. With a few special exceptions provided in subsection (c), however, the Commission is directed by subsection (b) to hold each application for at least 30 days following the issuance of public notice by the Commission of the acceptance of the application for filing. Subsection (d) provides the means by which parties may object to license applications. Combined with subsection (e), which sets forth the evidentiary hearing requirements, subsection (d) sets forth the new pre-grant procedure devised in 1960. See text <em>supra </em>at notes 134-139. Subsection (f) provides temporary emergency authorization power, see note 156 <em>supra; </em>subsection (g) provides that the Commission must adopt reasonable classifications for applications and amendments; and subsection (h) provides for the form and condition of station licenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"159\">\n<p id=\"b205-10\">.

It will be the first domestic satellite system that utilizes: (1) small-sized earth stations available in most instances at the customer\u2019s premises; (2) integrated voice/data/image transmission service utilizing a largely digital format; (3) A TDMA and demand assignment technology which allows more efficient use of the spectrum than present use allows; and (4) the 12 and 14 GHz band. The most important aspect of this proposal is not the possible advancement in technology, although that is significant, but the fact that these advancements are directly related to the carrier being able to provide more efficient and better service at a more efficient cost.

Both petitions begin with specific allegations charging that the SBS joint venture in its current form fails to comply with the conditions prescribed by the Commission in its earlier decisions on the matter. With respect to the antitrust problems with the joint venture, the following illustrations serve as examples of the specificity of the petitions. One part of Western Union\u2019s petition alleges that the relevant markets must be defined. After making several legal arguments, Western Union states that its \u201cmarketing experts and the SBS Applications recognize that the principal customers for domestic satellite service will be large corporations and the federal government. These organizations presently generate almost three-quarters of the interstate private line communications revenues.\u201d App. 1043-1044 (footnote omitted). This statement is supported both by the affidavit of an officer of Western Union, H. R. Johnson, and a quote from one of SBS\u2019 applications. App. 1043 &amp; n.34. On the basis of these allegations Western Union proceeds to state its reasons why the relevant markets must be defined, specifying its views about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>cross-elasticity of demand for satellite and terrestrial services and other relevant considerations. These allegations support the material issue Western Union raises over the accuracy of the ultimate factual conclusion, accepted by the Commission, that there is only one market because all forms of telecommunications \u2014 both terrestrial and satellite \u2014 are reasonably interchangeable. Similarly, with respect to its allegations concerning the question of the effects of the SBS entry on potential competition, Western Union cites, among other sources, the Commission\u2019s own findings \u2014 a proper subject of official notice \u2014 that IBM has the economic and technical resources required for independent and sustained entry into the domestic satellite industry. See <em>Approval of Changes in Corporate Structure of CML Satellite Corporation (CML), 51 </em>F.C.C.2d 14, 26, 27, 39-41 (1975) [hereinafter cited as CML]. American Satellite also alleges that the entry of SBS will result in elimination of potential competition, citing IBM\u2019s own concession at the oral argument in the CML proceeding \u2014 again a proper subject of official notice \u2014 CML, <em>supra, </em>at 30 (Nov. 25, 1975) (transcript of oral argument). IBM stated that it had considered independent entry, and that it likely would proceed alone if necessary. App. 1113.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">To some extent the petitions also rely on legal arguments, citing Supreme Court and other federal cases requiring evidentiary hearings in proceedings of this type, see, e. <em>g., </em>App. 1041-1042, and they include considerable economic analysis. There is no question that through citation to specific facts in their possession and reference to sources of which the Commission may take official notice, combined with legal and economic analysis, Western Union and IBM raised substantial disputed issues of fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"186\">\n<p id=\"b209-10\">. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(d) (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"187\">\n<p id=\"b209-11\">.

Moreover, in attempting to make such an assumption, the Commission must give the antitrust laws the full consideration to which they are entitled.

Co., </em>378 U.S. 158, 174, 84 S.Ct. 1710, 1717, 12 L.Ed.2d 775, 787 (1964), to the effect that, \u201c[potential competition cannot be put to a subjective test. It is not \u2018susceptible of a ready and precise answer.\u2019\u201d Maj.Op., text at note 101. In <em>Penn-Olin, </em>however, this statement was made by the Court in rejecting a District Court\u2019s finding that no reason existed to conclude that a firm formed by the merger of two corporations would be a less effective competitive force than the two separate entities, even if only one actually entered the market and the other remained in the wings. The Court concluded \u201cthat a finding should have been made as to the reasonable probability that either one of the corporations would have entered the market ... [or] the other would have remained a significant potential competitor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175-176, 84 S.Ct. at 1719, 12 L.Ed.2d at 788. The Court went on to note generally criteria which the District Court could take into account in assessing the potential anticompetitive effects:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak3\">[T]he number and power of the competitors in the relevant market; the background of their growth; the power of the joint ventur-ers; the relationship of their lines of commerce; the competition existing between them and the power of each in dealing with the competitors of the other; the setting in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>which the joint venture was created; the reasons and necessities for its existence; the joint venture\u2019s line of commerce and the relationship thereof to that of its parents; the adaptability of its line of commerce to noncompetitive practices; the potential power of the joint venture in the relevant market; an appraisal of what the competition in the relevant market would have been if one of the joint venturers had entered it alone. . .; the effect, in the event of this occurrence, of the other joint venturer\u2019s potential competition; and such other factors as might indicate potential risk to competition in the relevant market.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 177, 85 S.Ct. at 1720, 12 L.Ed.2d at 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\"><em>Penn-Olin </em>thus does not stand for the proposition that further inquiry need not be undertaken where the disputed facts are \u201cincapable of definite ascertainment.\u201d To the contrary, the Court required that such an inquiry be carefully conducted. Similarly, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Falstaff Brewing Corp., </em>410 U.S. 526, 93 S.Ct. 1096, 35 L.Ed.2d 475 (1973), also cited by the court, see Maj.Op. at note 101, the court\u2019s criticism of the District Court\u2019s dependence on the testimony of corporate officials was made in the context of assigning error to the District Court\u2019s assumption that because Falstaff would never have entered the market <em>de novo, </em>it could in no sense be considered a potential competitor. The outcome of <em>Falstaff </em>was a decision by the Supreme Court that the District Court should have considered whether the corporation was a potential competitor exercising influence on the market from its fringes. Again this is a directive to undertake study of antitrust questions carefully, especially where such issues are not readily susceptible to absolute proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">Moreover, if all facts incapable of definite ascertainment could be determined without benefit of evidentiary proceedings, hearings would never be held in cases where violations of \u00a7 7 of the Clayton Act were alleged, because \u00a7 7 looks toward future economic behavior and \u201ccan deal only with probabilities, not with certainties.\u201d <em>FTC v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co., </em>386 U.S. 568, 577, 87 S.Ct. 1224, 1229, 18 L.Ed.2d 303, 309 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"223\">\n<p id=\"b215-13\">. <em>Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Div. v.

The Commission claims that the SBS proceeding is distinguishable from trials of antitrust issues before federal district courts, noting its familiarity with the communications industry and past experience in dealing with questions such as those presented in the instant case. See <em>Satellite Business Sys., supra </em>note 141, 62 F.C.C.2d at 1064. While the Commission is certainly on more intimate terms with the communications industry than the federal courts, it is not necessarily more expert in handling the antitrust matters. Even if the Commission were expert in all aspects of the antitrust field, however, this would still not excuse its failure to hold an evidentiary hearing as required by statute where disputed questions of material fact existed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"228\">\n<p id=\"b216-21\">.
