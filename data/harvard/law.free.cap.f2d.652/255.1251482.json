Pennsylvania, </em>447 U.S. 715, 100 S.Ct. 2432, 65 L.Ed.2d 458 (1980), has implicitly reversed the decision of this Court in <em>Fusco v. Perini North River Associates, </em>622 F.2d 1111 (2d Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1131, 101 S.Ct. 953, 67 L.Ed.2d 119 (1981) <em>(Fusco II). </em>Because we believe that <em>Sun Ship, Inc. </em>has not undermined <em>Fusco II, </em>we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>deny the petition for review and uphold the decision of the Benefits Review Board (Board).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">This claim arose as a result of an injury occurring in the course of the construction of the North River Pollution Control Project, a massive undertaking described at length in <em>Fusco v. Perini North River Associates, </em>601 F.2d 659, 661-62 (2d Cir. 1979), <em>vacated and remanded, </em>444 U.S. 1028, 100 S.Ct. 697, 62 L.Ed.2d 664 (1980) <em>(Fusco I). </em>Petitioner Raymond Churchill is a dock-builder foreman and has been a member of the dockbuilders\u2019 union for more than 20 years. At the time of the accident, Churchill was responsible for the work performed on one of the \u201ccrane barges\u201d which carried the huge \u201ccaissons\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the construction site. On October 9, 1974, Churchill was injured when, in the course of supervising the unloading of a caisson, a line snapped against his leg, pitching him into the air.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">On December 4, 1978, Administrative Law Judge Julius Johnson denied Churchill\u2019s claim for compensation under the LHWCA, ruling that \u201cclaimant\u2019s employment was not maritime in [the] traditional sense, but was customary construction work.... Mere construction over navigable water ... does not magically convert his work ... into maritime employment.\u201d (A. 106). On October 81, 1980, the Board affirmed, with one judge dissenting.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The majority held that Churchill failed to satisfy the status requirement of \u00a7 902(3), ruling that mere proximity to navigable water is not sufficient to convert the work of a construction worker into maritime commerce. Rather, the Board held, the work must have a \u201crealistically significant relationship to maritime activities involving navigation and commerce over navigable waters.\u201d (A. 113). Rejecting Churchill\u2019s argument that unloading the barge was \u201cindisputably\" a longshoring activity, the Board held that Churchill \u201cwas a construction worker whose task of unloading the [caisson] was an incidental function to his job of constructing the substructure.\u201d (A. 115). Churchill now petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-15\">Churchill advances in this Court the argument of Appeals Judge Miller in his dissent below: (i) the claim would have been covered under the LHWCA before the 1972 Amendments, see <em>Calbeck v. Travelers Insurance Co., </em>370 U.S. 114, 82 S.Ct. 1196, 8 L.Ed.2d 368 (1962); <em>Davis v. Department of Labor, </em>317 U.S. 249, 63 S.Ct. 225, 87 L.Ed. 246 (1942), (ii) the 1972 Amendments were not meant to remove pre-existing coverage, and (iii) <em>Sun Ship, Inc. v. Pennsylvania, supra, </em>proves that pre-1972 cases allowing coverage for injuries on navigable waters are still good law. The first two arguments are precisely those made in <em>Fusco I </em>and rejected in <em>Fusco II. </em>The question before us, therefore, is whether <em>Sun Ship, Inc. </em>should cause us to reformulate the standard recently adopted in <em>Fusco II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-16\">In <em>Sun Ship, Inc. </em>the Court held that a state \u201cmay apply its workers\u2019 compensation scheme to land-based injuries that fall within the coverage\u201d of the LHWCA. 447 U.S. at 716, 100 S.Ct. at 2432. After reviewing the events leading up to the enactment of the original version of the Act in 1927, the Court stated that Congress, in expanding shoreward the coverage of the Act, did not intend to diminish the sphere of permissible state compensation coverage in the \u201ctwilight zone\u201d of coexistent state and federal jurisdiction. Thus, the Court reaffirmed the \u201cregime of concurrent jurisdiction\u201d established by <em>Davis v. Department of Labor, supra, </em>and <em>Calbeck v. Travelers Insurance Co., supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-17\">Absent any contradicting signal from Congress, the principles of <em>Davis v. Department of Labor, supra, </em>and of <em>Calbeck </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number><em>v. Travelers Insurance Co., supra, </em>direct the conclusion that the 1972 extension of federal jurisdiction supplements, rather than supplants, state compensation law. Given that the pre-1972 Longshoremen\u2019s Act ran concurrently with state remedies in the \u201cmaritime but local\u201d zone, it follows that the post-1972 expansion of the Act landward would be concurrent as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><em>Sun Ship, Inc. v. Pennsylvania, supra, </em>447 U.S. at 719-20, 100 S.Ct. at 2436. The Court therefore held that Pennsylvania could properly apply its state compensation system to injuries occurring in the expanded situs of the LHWCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Churchill now argues that the reaffirmation of <em>Davis </em>and <em>Calbeck </em>renders unnecessary any application of the \u201csitus and status\u201d test of <em>P. C. Pfeiffer Co. v. Ford, </em>444 U.S. 69,100 S.Ct. 328, 62 L.Ed.2d 225 (1980), whenever the injury occurs in the course of employment on navigable waters. In other words, an employee engaged in construction on the water is necessarily engaged in \u201cmaritime employment\u201d within the meaning of the Act, and no inquiry into his status is necessary. Thus, Churchill would have us apply the \u201csitus and status\u201d test of <em>Ford </em>where the injury occurs in the expanded contiguous zone described in \u00a7 903(a) and a simpler \u201csitus\u201d test where the injury occurs in the course of a job on navigable waters, as it did in <em>Davis </em>and <em>Calbeck.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">While the question is certainly not free from doubt, we decline to read <em>Sun Ship, Inc.\u2019s </em>reaffirmation of <em>Davis </em>and <em>Calbeck </em>as creating such a dramatic change in the analytical framework set forth in <em>Ford </em>less than a year earlier. Indeed, Justice Brennan, writing for the Court in <em>Sun Ship, Inc., </em>stated that \u201c[t]he line that circumscribes the jurisdiction of the LHWCA\u201d is a \u201ccompound of \u2018status\u2019 and \u2018situs\u2019.\u201d 447 U.S. at 725, 100 S.Ct. 2439, 65 L.Ed.2d 458. <em>Sun Ship, Inc. </em>held only that nothing in the 1972 Amendments precludes a state from offering compensation to an employee who is admittedly covered under the expanded si-tus of the Act. The distinct question of <em>which </em>employees are covered under the Act is controlled by the analysis set forth in <em>P. C. Pfeiffer Co. v. Ford, supra, </em>and applied by this Court in <em>Fusco II. See also Weyerhauser Co. v. Gilmore, </em>528 F.2d 957 (9th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 868, 97 S.Ct. 179, 50 L.Ed.2d 148 (1976). We do not read <em>Sun Ship, Inc. </em>as suggesting that the <em>Ford </em>analysis should not apply to injuries occurring on the water itself. We therefore adhere to our reasoning in <em>Fusco II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">We have carefully reviewed the substantive contentions of Churchill and the Solicitor of Labor and have concluded that each argument is foreclosed by the decision of this Court in <em>Fusco II. </em>Since we do not feel that <em>Sun Ship, Inc. </em>has eroded the validity of <em>Fusco II, </em>the petition for review is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-10\">. Under the LHWCA, a claimant must first satisfy the \u201cstatus\u201d test by demonstrating that he is an \u201cemployee,\u201d defined in \u00a7 902(3) as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALP\">any person engaged in maritime employment, including any longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring operations, and any harborworker including a ship repairman, shipbuilder, and shipbreaker ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">The term \u201cmaritime employment\u201d is not specifically defined in the Act. The Supreme Court recently stated that the term \u201crefers to the nature of a worker\u2019s activities\" and is \u201can occupational rather than a geographic concept.\u201d P. C. <em>Pfeiffer Co. v. Ford, </em>444 U.S. 69, 78, 79, 100 S.Ct. 328, 335, 336, 62 L.Ed.2d 225. In <em>Fusco v. Perini North River Associates, </em>622 F.2d 1111, 1113 (2d Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1131, 101 S.Ct. 953, 67 L.Ed.2d 119 (1981), we read the <em>Ford </em>opinion \u201cas precluding any application of the LHWCA ... to an employee whose activities do not bear a significant relationship to navigation or to commerce on navigable waters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-19\">Once a claimant has shown that he is an \u201cemployee,\u201d he must show that his injury occurred within the \u201csitus\u201d defined in \u00a7 903(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-20\">Compensation shall be payable under this chapter in respect of disability or death of an employee, but only if the disability or death results from an injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States (including any adjoining pier, wharf, dry dock, terminal, building way, marine railway, or other adjoining area customarily used by an employer in loading, unloading, repairing, or building a vessel).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b337-8\">.
