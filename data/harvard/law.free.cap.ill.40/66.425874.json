Same\u2014means of information required of the party applying. Upon an application by the State\u2019s attorney for a writ of certiorari in a criminal case, upon a suggestion of diminution of the record, it is enough that the State\u2019s attorney, who supported his application by his own affidavit, acquired his knowledge of the contents of the record in the court below, from the circuit judge who tried the cause, the record coming from a county not within the circuit of the State s attorney.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b67-7\" pgmap=\"67\">3.

Subsequently, Mr. Casey filed his affidavit, setting forth that he is informed and believes that the record filed in this cause is incomplete\u2014that it does not show that the indictment upon which the plaintiff in error was tried, was returned into open court by the grand jury finding the same, or that the indictment was indorsed a true bill by the foreman of the grand jury, both of which facts affiant is informed do appear on record in the office of the clerk of the Circuit Court of Randolph county; that the affiant derives his information on the subject from the presiding judge of said Circuit Court: and moved that a writ of certiorari be awarded.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b68-5\" pgmap=\"68\">Mr. Allen,</attorneys><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApK\" pgmap=\"68\">in opposition to the motion, contended that, while it would be proper in a case where the transcript is certified to be a \u201c complete record,\u201d to award the writ upon motion supported by affidavit, positive in its terms, that the record is incomplete, yet in this case the rule would not apply because the affidavit is insufficient\u2014it does not aver the record to be incomplete, only from information obtained from the circuit judge.</p> <opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b68-6\" pgmap=\"68\">Per Curiam :</author> <p id=\"A7g\" pgmap=\"68\">The writ of certiorari must be awarded.

It is enough that the State\u2019s attorney acquired his knowledge of the contents of the record in the court below, from the circuit judge who presided on the trial of the cause, the record coming from a county not within his circuit.</p> <p id=\"b68-8\" pgmap=\"68\">It appearing that the plaintiff is in prison, the writ will be made returnable at as early a day as practicable during the present term.</p> <p id=\"b68-9\" pgmap=\"68\">Certiorari awarded.</p> <p id=\"b68-10\" pgmap=\"68\">Hr.
