Specifically, Petitioner requested that he receive fifty-nine percent of the net proceeds and that Respondent receive forty-one percent-in order to correspond with Petitioner's contribution of $145,000.00 to the purchase of the Property compared with Respondent's $100,000.00 contribution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Clerk agreed with Petitioner that the net proceeds from the sale of the Property should be divided in proportion to the contributions made by Petitioner and Respondent\n   toward the purchase of the Property.

Both Petitioner and Respondent agreed to partition of the Property by sale pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 46-22(a). Respondent does not challenge any part of the\n   <em>\n    sale\n   </em>\n   of the Property.
