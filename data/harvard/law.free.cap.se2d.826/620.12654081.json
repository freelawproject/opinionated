The circuit court\n   found that the petitioners were not entitled to summary judgment because there are genuine issues of material fact concerning the excessive force, deliberate indifference, and supervisory liability claims brought against them by the respondent (plaintiff below), Miguel Delgado, an inmate at MOCC (\"Inmate Delgado\"). The circuit court further found that if it is ultimately determined that the petitioner officers violated the Eighth Amendment\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   through use of excessive force and deliberate indifference, Inmate Delgado's tort claims were also viable. Following our review of the briefs, the arguments of counsel, the appendix record submitted, and the applicable law, this Court finds no reversible error and affirms the circuit court's denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Shortly before midnight on May 23, 2015, Nurse Joyce Coleman, accompanied by Officers McCourt and Brandon Mooney,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   was distributing medications to prisoners in the Quilliams II Unit (\"Unit\"), a segregation unit at MOCC, which is a state correctional facility located in Mt. Olive, West Virginia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Medications are dispensed to inmates through what is sometimes referred to as a \"bean hole,\" which is a narrow slot in the solid steel cell doors through which food trays and medications are passed. Inmate Delgado alleges that during this particular \"pill pass,\" he repeatedly told Nurse Coleman that he had a question. When she did not respond, he asked Officer McCourt, one of the officers accompanying Nurse Coleman, to tell the nurse that he had a question. Inmate Delgado states that Nurse Coleman then approached his cell door and asked, \"What is it? I'm busy.\" He responded that he had a question to which she replied she was busy dealing with a thousand other inmates. According to Inmate Delgado, after further discussion with Nurse Coleman, he became frustrated and threatened to report her to the board of nursing, prompting her to shout the address of the nursing board through his cell door. Inmate Delgado replied that he already had the board's address, adding \"if you don't care, quit your job, go home, and kill yourself.\" Officer McCourt interjected, warning Inmate Delgado that he was getting close to a \"write-up,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Delgado responded, \"listen, I don't care. You go home too and kill yourself.\" The officers and Nurse Coleman then left his cell door to complete the pill pass, after which they exited the Unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Inmate Delgado alleges that after Nurse Coleman and the officers left his cell door, he lay down on his bed, put on his headphones, and listened to music. He states that approximately ten minutes later, Officers McCourt, Mooney, and Maddox returned to his cell door to re-engage with him. He contends that Officer Mooney told him that he was \"tired of my smart mouth and my attitude with the nurses,\" that they were \"fed up with it,\" and that I was \"going to get a write-up.\" Inmate Delgado responded, \"[w]rite it up, write it up,\" after which Officer Mooney said, \"you got a smart mouth. I'm going to spray you[,]\" referring to Oleoresin Capsicum pepper spray (\"OC\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Inmate Delgado avers that he replied, \"[g]o ahead, spray me. If that's what you want to do, go ahead and spray me.\" He then spun around to place his lower back against the slot in his cell door to try to block the spray from dispersing throughout his\n   cell.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   He states that he was not quick enough, and the first spray\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   went along the wall of his cell; however, the second spray struck his lower back, soaking his clothing. Inmate Delgado contends that the rest of the Unit was quiet during this entire incident and that the only disturbance was the one created by the correctional officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Upon being sprayed with OC, Inmate Delgado states that he immediately began to suffer from burning eyes and skin and restricted airways causing him to feel as if he could not breathe. After deploying the OC spray, the officers closed the slot in the cell door and departed. Inmate Delgado used the sink in his cell to splash water on his face and hands in an attempt to lessen the burning effects of the OC spray but, within minutes, the officers shut off the water to his cell. Inmate Delgado states that when he asked why his water had been shut off, Officer Allen told him they had done it \"so you won't decontaminate yourself.\" Approximately ten minutes later, Officers McCourt, Allen, and Mattox returned to Inmate Delgado's cell to take him to the recreation yard for decontamination. Inmate Delgado testified that his hands were cuffed behind his back in a twisting fashion that caused him so much pain in his shoulder that he fell to his knees while the officers simultaneously disregarded his protestations that they were hurting him. Other than an inmate yelling to ask why his water had been shut off,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Inmate Delgado states that the rest of the Unit continued to remain quiet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Once they arrived in the recreation yard, Inmate Delgado states that Officer Allen turned on the water in a large sink. When he asked how the decontamination would proceed when he could not remove his clothing that was soaked with OC spray as he was handcuffed, he contends that Officer Allen accused him of refusing decontamination. Another officer told Inmate Delgado to go ahead and remove his clothing, but refused to remove his handcuffs, at which point the officers again accused him of refusing decontamination. Thereafter, Inmate Delgado was taken to see Nurse Coleman for a medical evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Inmate Delgado states that he was seated at a table in a multipurpose room with Officers Mattox and Allen on either side of him when Nurse Coleman approached him, asking him what was wrong. He told her about his shoulder pain caused by the officers twisting his arm and wrist at an awkward angle before cuffing him and that his buttocks and back were on fire because of the pepper spray. Inmate Delgado alleges that Nurse Coleman neither touched nor examined him but, instead, walked to the other side of the table, sat down, and began reading a book.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Approximately one hour after the OC spray was deployed into his locked isolation cell, Inmate Delgado was allowed to shower. He was then returned to his cell, which had been decontaminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Offering a different account of these events, Officers McCourt and Mooney filed incident reports in which they stated that Inmate Delgado became verbally combative with Nurse Coleman, telling her to \"go kill yourself,\" but also threatening, \"im [sic] going to kill you bitch,\" the latter of which Inmate Delgado denies. These officers also reported that Inmate Delgado told them \"fuck you CO\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   as they escorted Nurse Coleman away from his cell following his verbal exchange with her. As for their reason for later returning to Inmate Delgado's cell, these officers reported that they did so to attempt to \"deescalate\" or \"calm\" him. According to the reports of the petitioner officers and Officer Mooney, Inmate Delgado\n   ignored their multiple, loud, and clear verbal commands to cease creating a disturbance\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   that was spreading to other inmates who were yelling from within their locked cells in the Unit, which prompted Officer Mooney to open the slot in Inmate Delgado's locked cell door through which Officer McCourt deployed \"two one second burst[s]\" of OC spray into the cell. The officers state this \"very low level\" use of force was utilized to gain Inmate Delgado's compliance and restore order to the Unit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regarding the water being turned off to Inmate Delgado's cell after the OC spray was deployed, Officer McCourt stated in his Incident Report that Officers Mooney and Mattox turned off the water \"[i]n order to allow [Delgado] to deescalate[.]\" Officer Mattox stated in his Incident Report that the water was shut off \"due to Inmate Delgado's prior history to prevent him from flooding his cell and unit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The petitioner officers further allege that approximately ten minutes after the OC spray was deployed, Inmate Delgado was placed in mechanical wrist restraints and removed from his cell at which point leg restraints were also applied. He was escorted by Officers Mattox and Mooney to the recreation yard for decontamination where they contend he refused decontamination. Next, Inmate Delgado was taken for medical assessment by Nurse Coleman. Officer Mattox stated in his Incident Report that \"[d]uring the medical assessment, there were no injuries to be noted for Inmate Delgado[.]\" Officer Allen stated in a memorandum that Inmate Delgado was \"medically assessed by LPN Joyce Coleman.\" Similarly, a confidential Use of Force Committee Report to Warden Ballard states that Inmate Delgado \"was medically assessed by LPN Coleman and medically cleared to return to his cell.\" Inconsistent with these reports, Nurse Coleman, the individual who was to have performed this medical assessment, stated in her Incident Report that Inmate Delgado refused medical assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following Inmate Delgado's exhaustion of his administrative remedies concerning this incident, he filed the instant action against the petitioners seeking monetary damages, as well as injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He asserted violations of his federal constitutional rights,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   including allegations that the correctional officers used excessive force against him in violation of the Eighth Amendment. More specifically, Inmate Delgado alleged that Officer McCourt violated his \"constitutional rights to safety ... and to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by indiscriminately utilizing ... OC pepper spray, through excessive and nontrivial force against [him], as a sadistic and malicious form of punishment, rather than adhering to clearly established law, [and] proper disciplinary procedures[.]\" He alleged the petitioner officers were \"deliberately indifferent to [his] medical need for decontamination in a manner that caused [him] an unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\" A claim of assault and battery was also asserted against\n   Officer McCourt and intentional infliction of emotional distress against the petitioner officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In addition, Inmate Delgado asserted a claim of supervisory liability against Warden Ballard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   He alleged that Warden Ballard's actions violated his constitutional rights through his promulgation and implementation of policies and internal orders that exposed him and other inmates confined in the segregation units at MOCC \"to unnecessary and unreasonable uses of force when such uses of force were not justified, but rather administered as wanton forms of punishment.\" In support of this claim, Inmate Delgado's evidence included: (1) an inmate's inquiry concerning whether there was \"martial law\" in the Quilliams Units and an MOCC lieutenant's written response that stated: \"PER WARDEN, MARTIAL LAW IS A CONDITION THAT MOCC UTILIZES[;]\" (2) an MOCC major's email to prison administrators and employees on which Warden Ballard was copied and which advised that officers \"do not have to give efforts to temper to those locked up in our Seg units[;]\" (3) the testimony of an MOCC correctional officer during a disciplinary hearing that \"there's martial law going on right now\" and that \"they told me that came from the Warden[;]\" and the deposition testimony of Warden Ballard in which he confirmed that \"efforts to temper are not required in the segregation ... units.\" Also, Inmate Delgado testified during his deposition to having heard correctional officers discuss martial law in the Quilliams Units, explaining it was his\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   understanding from what the officers say, the paperwork I've seen, say we were under Martial Law and that we could be sprayed for any reason or for no reason at all. And that there was a memo that I read that the staff working in Quilliams did not need to temper their efforts of a forceful response meaning that we were-we could be victimized by the officers at any time. That there was nothing we could do about it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Inmate Delgado further testified that he and many other inmates in the segregation units were regularly subjected to the use of OC spray for minor infractions, such as yelling through the doors of their locked isolation cells. He maintains that the subject incident exemplifies how correctional officers implemented this policy of martial law \"and/or the suspension of the requirement that officers should make 'efforts to temper' the use of force against inmates on the isolation units.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In further support of his supervisory liability claim, Inmate Delgado alleged in his complaint, inter alia, that Warden Ballard's directive not to give efforts to temper \"was in direct violation of clearly established law\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   that it was objectively unreasonable and an \"unawarranted invasion\" upon his clearly established rights under the Eighth Amendment; that the MOCC policy of martial law, which permits any level of force to be used without efforts to temper, creates a \"pervasive and unreasonable risk that inmates, including [himself], will be maliciously and sadistically harmed by the use of force for the purpose of punishment and without regard for the need for force;\" and that Warden Ballard had actual and constructive knowledge of the numerous incidents of excessive force in the segregation units, had approved policies and practices of martial law, and then acted with deliberate indifference through his failure to stop the abusive and excessive uses of force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The petitioners filed motions for summary judgment in which they asserted entitlement to qualified immunity from Inmate Delgado's\n   claims. Inmate Delgado filed responses in opposition to the motions. During the final pretrial conference, the circuit court fully entertained counsels' arguments on these dispositive motions. The hearing transcript reveals that the circuit court asked counsel several questions during the course of the hearing concerning the parties' conflicting factual accounts. The circuit court also confirmed its understanding of the petitioner officers' arguments, asking: \"[Y]ou're arguing that your clients are entitled to qualified immunity, that these were discretionary actions, and that they did this in good faith, and that there's no violation of clearly established laws as it relates to any actions that they took?\" The correctional officers' counsel responded in the affirmative. After hearing the arguments of counsel, the circuit court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [U]nder the circumstances, I do believe that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether or not there was excessive force.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   I think there are issues ... when you look at the\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Whitley\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   factors to the need for the application of the force, the relationship between that need and the amount of force used, and, frankly, the threat reasonably perceived by the officials.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   And I just think it's appropriate to let those issues go before the jury, and I do believe that the remaining tort claims flow from that. I think that they're factual issues, so they'll go to the jury[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (Footnote added). The circuit court also concluded during the hearing that there were disputed facts related to the supervisory liability claim against Warden Ballard, observing that if evidence was not elicited as Inmate Delgado's counsel anticipates, the court would \"do the appropriate thing at the directed verdict stage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The circuit court directed Inmate Delgado's counsel to prepare an order denying the summary judgment motions. Counsel did so, submitting a proposed order to which the petitioners objected.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Over those objections, the circuit court entered a seventeen-page order on March 6, 2017, denying the petitioners' motions for summary judgment based on qualified immunity. The circuit court found that summary judgment was improper because the resolution of the immunity and the substantive claims were dependent upon a determination of conflicting evidence. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We are asked to determine whether the circuit court erred in denying summary judgment to the petitioners based on their assertion of qualified immunity. While the denial of summary judgment is generally not subject to appellate review, we have carved out an exception, holding that \"[a] circuit court's denial of summary judgment that is predicated on qualified immunity is an interlocutory ruling which is subject to immediate appeal under the 'collateral order' doctrine.\" Syl.

Rather than a discretionary measure employed when he allegedly failed to conform to the petitioner officers' verbal commands, Inmate Delgado denies being given any specific directives by the officers. Instead, he contends that he was sprayed solely in retaliation for his admittedly rude comments to Nurse Coleman and with a malicious intent to cause him pain, which violates his Eighth Amendment rights. He reports that Officer Mooney told him that he was \"tired of his smart mouth and attitude with the nurses\" and that \"they were fed up with it\" immediately prior to the OC being sprayed into his locked cell.

Arguing further, they contend that their discretionary refusal to remove Inmate Delgado's mechanical wrist restraints, as he had requested, was to ensure safety and security on the recreation yard where the decontamination process was to occur.

Thereafter, he was taken to a multiple purpose room where he should have been medically assessed, but Nurse Coleman read a book instead.

Supervisory Liability Claim Against Warden Ballard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Warden Ballard asserts that he should be immune from Inmate Delgado's supervisory liability claim. He argues that his administrative policy-making functions are grounded in his adherence to certain policies in the treatment of inmates at MOCC. Although denying he had declared \"martial law\" in the segregation units at MOCC, Warden Ballard contends that any directive that \"efforts to temper\" were not required in the segregation units would not violate any statute or constitutional rights through which entitlement to qualified immunity would be foreclosed. Lastly, Warden Ballard maintains that he cannot be liable under any theory of supervisory liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   We begin by observing that supervisory liability is not premised upon respondeat superior but upon \"a recognition that supervisory indifference or tacit authorization of subordinates' misconduct may be a causative factor in the constitutional injuries they inflict on those committed to their care.\"\n   <em>\n    Slakan v.

To defeat qualified immunity on a claim of supervisory liability, a plaintiff must show that it was clearly established at the time of the subordinate's conduct that the\n   supervisor could be held liable under \u00a7 1983 for constitutional violations committed by the subordinate; that the supervisor knew that the degree of force being used was unconstitutional; and that a reasonable person in the supervisor's position would have known that his actions were unlawful.\n   <em>\n    Shaw v.

Further, the appendix record contains evidence that shows Warden Ballard had the authority and responsibility for the administration and operation of MOCC, including the safety and security of inmates, and for ensuring that MOCC employees abide by MOCC policies and procedures, including the policy that correctional officers were not required to temper force in their interactions with inmates housed in the segregation units at MOCC. Regarding Warden Ballard's knowledge that his subordinates were engaged in uses of force, there is evidence that he reviews all inmate grievances, all incident reports filed by correctional officers, and all Use of Force Review Committee reports. Through these administrative processes and reports, Warden Ballard would have been aware of the OC spray being used against inmates housed in the segregation units. And, because inmates must exhaust their administrative remedies prior to filing a court action,\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Warden Ballard would have been aware of these uses of force prior to him being named as a defendant in the multiple federal lawsuits listed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Regarding Warden Ballard's response to his awareness of the use of OC spray on inmates in the segregation units and whether there is a link between his actions and the alleged constitutional injury,\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1834588\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/13/791/#p801\">\n    13 F.3d at 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we have the allegation that he had declared \"martial law\" in the segregation units. Although he testified during his deposition that he had not done so, again, there is conflicting evidence. For example, when an MOCC inmate housed in the segregation units completed a Unit Team Request Form, asking whether a correctional officer had been truthful in telling him that the segregation units were under \"Martial Law[,]\" a lieutenant provided a written response that stated: \"Per warden, martial law is a condition that MOCC utilizes.\" There is also an audio-recording of a disciplinary hearing during which an MOCC correctional officer testified that \"[t]here's martial law going on right now\" and \"they told me that came from the Warden.\" In addition, Inmate Delgado testified during his deposition concerning\n   his understanding from correctional officers that the segregation units were \"under Martial Law and that we could be sprayed for any reason or for no reason at all.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Based on the evidence summarized above, a reasonable jury could conclude that Warden Ballard had actual, subjective awareness of a pervasive and unreasonable risk posed by his correctional officers who were allegedly engaging in unnecessary and untempered force against inmates housed in the segregation units as a result of prison policies and directives, which is the first\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   factor. This same evidence could also lead a jury to find that the second and third\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   factors were also met: that Warden Ballard's response to the knowledge of the risk being posed was so inadequate as to show \" 'deliberate indifference to or tacit authorization of the alleged offensive practices,'\" particularly when he confirmed during his deposition testimony that a correctional officer cannot be reprimanded for not using \"confrontational avoidance measures\" with inmates housed in a segregation unit; and \"that there was an 'affirmative causal link' between [Warden Ballard's] inaction and the particular constitutional injury suffered by the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1834588\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/13/791/#p801\">\n    13 F.3d at 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Slakan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"669816\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/737/368/#p372\">\n    737 F.2d at 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted) (observing that causation may be proved directly \" 'where the policy commands the injury of which the plaintiff complains....

Based upon the facts of this case, I disagree with the majority that the conduct of the correctional officers or Warden Ballard violated Mr. Delgado's constitutional rights, either by using excessive force or by deliberate indifference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   First, there was no excessive force in this case. Inmate Delgado clearly was a problem inmate. He was in the segregation unit, where he had been housed for six years, due to his chronic insubordination. The record in this case reflects that, on the day of the incident in question, Inmate Delgado became belligerent and verbally assaultive when the nurse did not respond quickly enough, in his mind, to his attempt to ask a question. The nurse was escorted from the area, but Inmate Delgado's disruptive conduct continued. Despite multiple loud, clear, verbal commands to cease creating a disturbance, Inmate\n   Delgado continued in his defiant behavior, and it began to spread to other inmates, who also started yelling. After their verbal attempts to deescalate the situation had no effect, the correctional officers warned Inmate Delgado that they would use OC spray if he continued to disregard their commands. Thereafter, a correctional officer deployed two, one-second bursts of OC spray into Inmate Delgado's cell. Deploying two, one-second bursts of OC spray under these conditions was not excessive force, and was not done for the purpose of inflicting pain; rather, it was a discretionary act that became necessary as a result of Inmate Delgado's continued raucous conduct, and was a final attempt to restore order in the segregation unit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iko v. Shreve\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5896808\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/535/225/#p235\">\n    535 F.3d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 240 (4th Cir. 2008) (recognizing that \" '[i]t is generally recognized that it is a violation of the Eighth Amendment for prison officials to use mace, tear gas or other chemical agents\n   <em>\n    in quantities greater than necessary or for the sole purpose of infliction of pain\n   </em>\n   ' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Williams v.Benjamin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7641618\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/77/756/#p761\">\n    77 F.3d 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 763 (4th Cir. 1996) ) (some emphasis added). Because the correctional officers deployed the OC spray in an effort to restore order, and not for the purpose of inflicting pain, and because such force was used only after their verbal attempts to calm the situation were ignored, the correctional officers are entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Likewise, the correctional officers were not deliberately indifferent to Inmate Delgado's medical needs. This claim is primarily based upon the delay in decontaminating Inmate Delgado. As the majority observes, the deliberate indifference analysis has an objective and a subjective component.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Germain v. Metheny\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639137\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/539/108/#p109\">\n    539 F. App'x 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 109 (4th Cir. 2013). \"The plaintiff must demonstrate that the officers acted with 'deliberate indifference' (subjective) to the inmate's 'serious medical needs' (objective).\n   <em>\n    Estelle v.

The objective component requires an inmate to \"objectively show that the deprivation suffered or injury inflicted was 'sufficiently serious.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5896808\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/535/225/#p235\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Citation omitted). A \"sufficiently serious medical need is one that\n   <em>\n    requires medical treatment\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5896808\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/535/225/#p235\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Emphasis added). Although Inmate Delgado complained of the effects of the OC spray, the record simply lacks objective evidence that Inmate Delgado suffered a sufficiently serious injury that required\n   <em>\n    medical treatment\n   </em>\n   . Furthermore, during the delay of approximately one hour before the decontamination process was completed, the correctional officers did not demonstrate subjective deliberate indifference. The record shows that, after the OC spray was deployed, Inmate Delgado was able to wash his hands and splash his face with water while still in his cell. Thereafter, Inmate Delgado was taken to the recreation yard for further decontamination of his face and eyes. Inmate Delgado complains about the denial of his request to have his handcuffs removed while he was in the recreation yard so that he could remove his shirt, but the denial was based upon issues of safety and security. In this regard it should not be overlooked that Inmate Delgado already is serving a sentence of life without mercy, and he has been in the segregation unit for six years as a result of his repeated insubordination; thus, safety and security are valid concerns. Also during this time, Inmate Delgado was taken to the nurse for a medical evaluation, and, after his cell was decontaminated, he was taken to the shower to complete his decontamination process. Accordingly, the evidence was insufficient to establish deliberate indifference, and the correctional officers were entitled to qualified immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    The correctional officers' entitlement to qualified immunity would render moot the supervisory liability claim against Warden Ballard.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
