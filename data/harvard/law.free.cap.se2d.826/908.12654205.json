HUMPHREYS\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This appeal permits us to review and clarify our jurisprudence with respect to the quantum of evidence sufficient to constitute an attempt to commit a crime in the Commonwealth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On June 28, 2016, appellant Dustin Scott Jones (\"Jones\") was convicted by the Circuit Court of the City of Petersburg (the \"circuit court\") of conspiracy to commit robbery,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   attempted robbery, and use of a firearm in the commission of attempted robbery. Jones argued on appeal that the evidence did not prove attempted robbery because the evidence did not establish that he performed an overt act in furtherance of the intended robbery. Jones also contended that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for use of a firearm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   A\n   three-judge panel of this Court agreed with Jones and reversed\n   and dismissed both of his convictions in an unpublished opinion. On October 30, 2018, we granted the Commonwealth's petition for a rehearing\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At approximately 5:45 a.m. on October 6, 2015, Petersburg Police Officers Binford and Seabridge observed a white Mercedes drive into the parking lot of a housing complex that they had under observation. Officers Binford and Seabridge were in full uniform but driving in an unmarked pickup truck. The officers then observed a man exit the white Mercedes and walk across the street. A few minutes later, two other men, who were later identified as Jones and Phillip Boyce (\"Boyce\"), exited the white Mercedes and \"adjust[ed]\" their clothing for four or five minutes before starting to cross the street in the same direction that the first man had gone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Officers Binford and Seabridge followed Jones and Boyce to an alley between two residences. They witnessed Jones and Boyce at the corner behind one of the houses, but not near the door. When Jones and Boyce saw the police officers, Jones and Boyce started to walk down the alley toward the street. Officers Binford and Seabridge subsequently exited their truck and identified themselves. At that point, Boyce stopped walking and Jones fled. Officer Seabridge witnessed Jones run in and out of a fenced parking lot before returning to the white Mercedes. Officer Seabridge then saw Jones get in the white Mercedes and drive away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Another police officer conducted a traffic stop on the white Mercedes and apprehended Jones a short time later. After responding to the site of the traffic stop, Officer Seabridge searched the white Mercedes and recovered a yellow bag with a ski mask. Officer Seabridge also located another ski mask in a street that Jones had travelled before Jones was stopped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Several hours later, in response to a telephone call, Officer Seabridge searched the fenced-in area where he previously witnessed Jones running and found a sawed-off shotgun under a bush.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Detective Thomas Ewers interviewed Jones after his arrest. During the interview, Jones gave conflicting statements about the incident but eventually admitted that he and Boyce went to the housing complex to \"make sure Trip didn't get hurt.\" Jones explained that \"Trip,\" the third person from the white Mercedes, had intended to rob a known drug dealer, Austin Strickland (\"Strickland\"). At the subsequent bench trial, neither party presented evidence regarding where Strickland lived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The circuit court determined that Jones's statement to the police that he accompanied Trip to protect him during the planned robbery made Jones \"part of the robbery.\" Therefore, in addition to finding Jones guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery, the circuit court also found Jones guilty of attempted robbery and use of a firearm in the commission of attempted robbery. On October 25, 2016, the circuit court sentenced Jones to a total of twenty-three years in prison, with twenty years suspended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   When presented on appeal with a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court reviews the evidence in the \"light most favorable\" to the prevailing party at trial, in this case, the Commonwealth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

The English common law doctrine of criminal attempt can be traced back to the eighteenth century.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Over time, however, courts have blurred the line between mere preparation to commit a crime and the type of act sufficient to establish an attempted offense. This is, at least in part, a consequence of courts throughout the nation utilizing a wide and not entirely consistent variety of phrases to describe the type of act required. These phrases include a \"step toward the commission of the crime,\" an \"act in part execution of the intent,\" a \"direct movement toward the commission of the offense,\" an \"act in furtherance of the crime,\" a \"substantial step toward the commission of the offense,\" and \"some appreciable fragment of the crime.\" Wayne R. LaFave,\n   <em>\n    Criminal Law\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11.4 (5th ed. 2010) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Even so, the common law generally informs us that \"to constitute an act of attempt, the act must possess four characteristics: first, it must be a step toward a punishable offense;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   second, it must be apparently (but not necessarily in reality) adapted to the purpose intended; third, it must come dangerously near to success; fourth, it must not succeed.\" J.

The analyses in these latter cases clearly indicate that an overt act constituting an attempted crime must have linkage to an element of the offense, rather than merely the overall criminal intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Moreover, the\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   standard does not provide comprehensive guidance with respect to distinguishing an act amounting to preparation to commit the crime from the attempt to do so, and the \"slight acts done in furtherance\" language used in\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Sizemore\n   </em>\n   , and missing from later Supreme Court cases has given rise to some confusion. This is because any overt act analysis requires two important considerations-the nature of the overt act and its timing in relation to the elements of the intended crime. Further, in some conceivable situations, it is difficult to harmonize\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   with the \"slight acts\" standard from\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Sizemore\n   </em>\n   .

Such a standard, however, is overly broad and fails to consider important evidentiary distinctions in attempt cases-whether the evidence objectively demonstrates \"the commencement of the consummation\" or, stated another way, the beginning of the commission of the intended crime itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12640706\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/659/311/#p524\">\n    275 Va. at 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12640706\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/659/311/#p524\">\n    659 S.E.2d 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   , 86 Va.

Therefore, we recognize that confusion surrounding the difference between preparation and attempt is, at least in part, due to less than precise language and abridged analyses regarding the type of slight\n   or overt act that satisfactorily manifests a defendant's commencement of the commission of a crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In summary, the difference between our analysis and that of our concurring colleagues is whether, to constitute an attempted crime, an overt act, \"slight\" or not, must be in furtherance of the commission of the\n   <em>\n    crime itself\n   </em>\n   or merely in furtherance of the\n   <em>\n    criminal intent\n   </em>\n   to commit it. In seeking to rectify the confusion on this point that\n   may be found in our own jurisprudence, we accept the more precise guidance from our Supreme Court and elsewhere which clarifies that, in order for a crime to be attempted, and thus for criminal liability to attach, the intended crime must be in progress to some extent.

In the first hypothetical, Justice Holmes stated that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   lighting a match with intent to set fire to a haystack has been held to amount to a criminal attempt to burn it, although the defendant blew out the match on seeing that he was observed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.,\n   <em>\n    The Common Law\n   </em>\n   67 (1881). In the second, however, Holmes observed that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   [t]he law does not punish every act which is done with the intent to bring about a crime. If a man starts from Boston to Cambridge for the purpose of committing a murder when he gets there, but is stopped by the draw [bridge] and goes home, he is no more punishable than if he had sat in his chair and resolved to shoot somebody, but on second thoughts had given up the notion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 68. In a continuing discussion on the proper resolution of these hypothetical questions, Justice Holmes noted that\n   \"[e]minent judges have been puzzled where to draw the line,\" but also illustrated what, in his view, it takes to constitute a criminal attempt by observing as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   When a man buys matches to fire a haystack, or starts on a journey meaning to murder at the end of it, there is still a considerable chance that he will change his mind before he comes to the point. But when he has struck the match, or cocked and aimed the pistol, there is very little chance that he will not persist to the end,\n   and the danger becomes so great that the law steps in.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 68-69. Holmes's latter hypothetical also expresses the basic public policy that encourages would-be criminals to abandon their efforts by not attaching criminal liability to their actions until they actually begin the commission of the intended crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Mindful of the authority referenced above, this Court has already distinguished preparation from attempt in a manner that avoids the pitfalls of\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Sizemore\n   </em>\n   , as well as the limitations of\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   .

Only then does preparation become an attempt. The difference between preparation and attempt lies between an act in preparation of a crime-one yet to take place or commence-and an act in the commission of a crime. Of course, the \"act in commission of a crime\" can be \"slight\" yet enough to constitute an attempt. Threatening actions such as cocking a gun or pointing one at an intended victim or an unsuccessful demand for money or personal property, coupled with an implied threat, are examples of acts that would be insufficient, standing alone, to constitute a completed robbery. With the addition of the requisite criminal intent, such acts would certainly be enough to satisfy the elements of attempted robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Moreover, expanding the definition of an overt act as urged by the concurrence and the Attorney General would effectively eliminate \"mere preparation\" as a discrete concept. This is necessarily the case since, under such an expanded definition, every act done in preparation to commit a crime is also by definition an act in furtherance of the criminal intent. Although our concurring colleagues flatly state otherwise, they offer no limiting principle that would distinguish an overt act \"in furtherance of the criminal intent\" constituting preparation from one they would consider an attempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The concurring opinion in this case relies upon language from\n   <em>\n    Sizemore\n   </em>\n   to propose what is essentially a \"we will know it when we see it\" analytical approach. One result of adopting the concurrence's definition is that one could be convicted of attempted robbery despite the lack of any victim being placed in fear and any demand for personal property made. In other words, this approach could result in affirming a conviction for attempted robbery where\n   <em>\n    none\n   </em>\n   of the elements of robbery have yet been commenced. Moreover, such an imprecise definition of an attempt would undercut the common law principle\n   that \"[t]he law does not punish every act which is done with the intent to bring about a crime.\" Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.,\n   <em>\n    The Common Law\n   </em>\n   68 (1881).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Further, the parameters of attempt crimes encouraged by the Attorney General would effectively obviate the common law policy consideration that previously allowed one to abandon a criminal enterprise without consequence at any time before actually creating a victim. While erroneous in our view, the Attorney General candidly argues, and our concurring colleagues do not disagree, that once\n   the criminal intent is formed,\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   act to effectuate that intent constitutes an attempt. This, as previously explained, is neither the result that the common law requires nor desires. Hypothetically, in the Attorney General's view, acts triggering criminal attempt liability would include actions that were historically considered mere preparation, such as acquiring a weapon or a mask, driving to the location of the crime, parking a vehicle to facilitate a quick getaway, and walking toward the entrance of the location of the robbery with a gun and/or mask in a pocket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   While the line between preparation and an attempt may not be as bright as may be desirable, neither is it as dim as the concurring opinion suggests. Of course, the elements of the crime and the facts of each case will determine whether an attempted crime has occurred, but whatever the luminosity of the line between preparation and attempt, it is far more definite than the concurrence submits. It seems axiomatic to us that preparation is every act, slight or not, that serves as a\n   <em>\n    prelude\n   </em>\n   to the commission of the crime. Thus, preparation necessarily ceases when the commission of that crime actually begins through the commencement of\n   <em>\n    an\n   </em>\n   act-not the \"last proximate act\" as asserted by our colleagues-that constitutes one or more elements of the crime. In response, our concurring colleagues postulate a third, very gray area, where they suggest that preparation has ceased but no execution of an element of the intended crime has yet commenced. The concurrence, however, offers nothing to distinguish the parameters of this gray area except a purely arbitrary proposition\n   that any act in furtherance of the criminal intent they consider subjectively close enough in space and time to the locus of the crime is sufficient to constitute an attempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Additionally, as previously noted, current public policy does not attach criminal liability for a substantive offense until the point where a crime is actually commenced. In the context of a robbery, despite having the intent to do so, if no person has been subjected to force, violence or intimidation and no demand to part with personal property made, neither robbery nor attempted robbery has yet occurred, although as noted in connection with the concurrence's hypothetical, other crimes may well be complete. At the other end of the spectrum, if both have been accomplished and personal property taken, a completed robbery has occurred. Between those points, if an act constituting any of those elements has commenced, the crime of attempted robbery has occurred even if the enterprise is abandoned or interrupted before completion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Returning to the present matter, we hold that the evidence does not show that Jones committed an overt act sufficient to constitute the commencement of the consummation of the crime of robbery despite having the requisite criminal intent. At no time did Jones or his co-conspirators use force, threat, or intimidation in any manner against, or seize property from, Strickland. Rather, the record demonstrates that Jones and his co-conspirators never encountered Strickland or even entered Strickland's residence. Furthermore, the record contains no evidence that Strickland lived in the vicinity where Officers Binford and Seabridge encountered Jones and his co-conspirators. While it is\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   that Jones and his co-conspirators were in the vicinity of Strickland's residence and\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have been moments away from the process of commencing the planned robbery, the record does not even objectively reveal those facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore,\n   without speculation,\n   even in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, we cannot conclude that Jones's presence and actions went beyond preparation to commit a robbery or otherwise reached far enough towards the accomplishment of the desired result to amount to the commencement of an element of that offense. Accordingly, we reverse Jones's conviction for attempted robbery and dismiss that indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Use of a Firearm\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   We now turn to Jones's second assignment of error that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. In relevant part, that statute makes it \"unlawful for any person to use or\n   <em>\n    attempt to use\n   </em>\n   any pistol, shotgun, rifle, or other firearm or display such weapon in a threatening manner while committing or attempting to commit\" a number of enumerated felonies, including robbery. Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 (emphasis added). The circuit court determined that Jones possessed the sawed-off shotgun found by Officer Seabridge in the course of an attempted robbery. Consequently, the circuit court convicted Jones of use of a firearm in the commission of that attempted robbery. On appeal, Jones argues that the\n   evidence was insufficient to prove that he used, attempted to use, or displayed a firearm in the commission of a felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   To convict a defendant of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt \"that the [defendant] actually had a firearm in his possession and that he used or attempted to use the firearm or displayed the firearm in a threatening manner while committing or attempting to commit robbery or one of the other specified felonies.\"\n   <em>\n    Startin v.

It follows that we need only analyze whether Jones used or attempted to use the sawed-off shotgun or displayed the sawed-off shotgun in a threatening manner,\n   <em>\n    while\n   </em>\n   committing or attempting to commit robbery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Since we have concluded that the evidence is insufficient to sustain Jones's conviction for attempted robbery, we also hold that the evidence is insufficient to sustain Jones's conviction for use of a firearm in the commission of an attempted robbery. Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence does not reflect that Jones manipulated the sawed-off shotgun in any manner prohibited by the statute\n   <em>\n    while\n   </em>\n   committing or attempting to commit robbery.

I disagree with the majority's conclusion that years of common law and Supreme Court precedent regarding what constitutes an \"overt act\" required for an attempt should now be \"[p]ut another way\" to mean an action that begins \"the execution\" of \"one or more elements of a crime but does not complete all of them.\" While simultaneously suggesting that courts have created \"a wide and not entirely consistent variety of phrases to describe the type of act\" sufficient to establish an attempted offense, the majority has decided to throw its own hat into the ring by introducing its own test. It now invites litigants to grapple with the requirement that attempt \"begins once an overt act commencing an element of the intended crime is initiated with the requisite intent.\" While the majority indicates that it endeavors to clarify the law of attempt, I strongly suspect that today's opinion will have the exact opposite effect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The majority's new test attempts to create a bright-line rule on the law of attempt. This runs contrary to its own statement that \"how near to success any effort to commit a crime must come before criminality attaches is obviously a question to be determined in each case upon the specific facts of the case and the elements of the intended crime.\" More importantly, it violates the Supreme Court's instruction that \"no general rule can be laid down which will serve as a test in all cases.

Although the majority claims that its test only requires that the overt act \"have linkage to an element of the offense,\" the attempted robbery examples used by the majority show that the majority's new test actually requires that the overt act\n   <em>\n    be\n   </em>\n   the commission of at least one of the elements of the offense - not just linked to an element of the offense. Under the majority's test, a defendant detained by the police after walking into a convenience store while wearing a mask and holding a shotgun with his finger on the trigger would not be guilty of attempted robbery if there were no customers in the store and the clerk was unaware of the defendant's entry because he was elsewhere at the time, such as in the backroom or the bathroom. Despite the hypothetical defendant's obvious intent and\n   dangerous proximity to completing a robbery, he would not be convicted of attempted robbery under the majority's test because no one was yet subject to intimidation and no personal property was yet demanded.

However, whether an overt act has been committed must be determined on a case-by-case basis, viewing the totality of the circumstances in each case. That is why the Supreme Court has clearly said that there can be no bright-line test for all attempt cases to determine when an action has moved beyond mere preparation. For all these reasons, I cannot join the majority's effort to create such a bright-line test.\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Evidence is Insufficient to Uphold Jones's Conviction for Attempted Robbery, Given the Complete Lack of Evidence About the Purported Victim's Whereabouts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Given that Jones's intent was clearly established through his confession - and not challenged on appeal - we consider the rule that \"slight acts done in furtherance of this design will constitute an attempt.\"\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"468414\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/144/594/\">\n    144 Va. at 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20S.E.%20212\">\n    131 S.E. 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even applying this test, however, the evidence in this case is insufficient to uphold Jones's conviction for attempted robbery, primarily because the record is completely devoid of evidence as to the whereabouts of Strickland, the intended target of the planned robbery, and the record does not actually show whether Jones had yet reached the scene of the intended crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the slight acts framework does not alleviate the requirement that the actions taken be more than \"merely preparatory.\"\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1879045\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/86/223/#p226\">\n    86 Va. at 226-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20S.E.%201024\">\n    9 S.E. 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, we cannot conclude that Jones's actions were more than \"merely preparatory\" as the Commonwealth simply failed to put on any evidence that Strickland was present in one of the homes or loft apartments in this neighborhood when these events took place. Not only do we lack evidence of Strickland's actual location during the relevant time, we cannot even discern from the record precisely where or why the trio believed they would encounter Strickland in order to commence a robbery. The Commonwealth presented absolutely no evidence that would allow the factfinder to conclude that Strickland lived in, or otherwise frequented, the nearby homes or lofts - or that he was expected to make an appearance in the alleyway or at some other location where Boyce and Jones were following Trip on foot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In addition, the Commonwealth presented no evidence that Trip was found at the scene when Boyce and Jones were apprehended. Trip's absence suggests that the co-conspirators had not yet reached the intended scene of the crime because Boyce and Jones would need to be near Trip in order to\n   effectuate their plan to protect him during the robbery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   For these reasons, I agree with the majority that the conviction for attempted robbery must be reversed. I also agree that the conviction for possession of a firearm in the commission of attempted robbery must be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    The Companion Cases of Hopson and Jordan Were Wrongly Decided\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   While I agree with the majority on the final disposition of this appeal, given the paucity of the evidence put on by the Commonwealth as to the location or presence of any victim in this case, I must also depart from the majority's analysis because of the importance of definitively overturning this Court's 1993 decision in the companion cases of\n   <em>\n    Hopson v.

The majority opinion states that \"to the extent that\n   <em>\n    Hopson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Jordan\n   </em>\n   are inconsistent with this opinion, they can no longer be considered good law.\" It is abundantly clear, however, that\n   <em>\n    Hopson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Jordan\n   </em>\n   will remain completely intact as binding precedent in Virginia after today's decision. According to the majority, \"if no person has been subjected to force, violence or intimidation and no demand to part with personal property made,\" attempted robbery has not occurred. Hopson and Jordan had completed their preparations and\n   were then peering around the corner toward the entrance of the store - one with a gun in hand and the other wearing a mask - but the police interrupted them before they could complete the \"last proximate act[s]\" of robbery and subject the clerk and customers to force, violence, or intimidation. Therefore, under the majority's test,\n   <em>\n    Hopson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Jordan\n   </em>\n   remain good law.

On the attempted robbery charge, the record is completely devoid of the location of the intended victim. The Commonwealth failed to present evidence of Strickland's whereabouts, or even of the co-conspirators' beliefs as to Strickland's whereabouts, to allow us to infer that the robbery was about to commence or that the co-conspirators had even arrived at the scene of Trip's purported attempt to rob Strickland. As no evidence was presented even to show that Jones had reached the scene of the intended crime or of where the potential victim was, his conviction for attempted robbery should be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Finally, I write separately as I would overturn the wrongly decided decisions in the companion cases of\n   <em>\n    Hopson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Jordan\n   </em>\n   because of the importance of ensuring clear guidance in our jurisprudence dealing with the crime of attempt. Applying the Supreme Court's slight acts framework, Hopson's and Jordan's actions of putting on a mask, wielding a gun, and peering around the corner of the store to its entrance were overt acts that went beyond mere preparation. Although the majority suggests that its new test would limit these cases as precedent to some extent, today's opinion has no impact on\n   <em>\n    Hopson\n   </em>\n   's and\n   <em>\n    Jordan\n   </em>\n   's continued viability and seemingly actually reaffirms them under the majority's new test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   For all of these reasons, I concur only in the judgment of this Court reversing Jones's convictions for attempted robbery and use of a firearm in the commission of attempted robbery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    The record reflects that Jones was indicted for conspiracy to commit robbery, and although he does not contest his conviction for that offense, we also note that the final judgment order of the circuit court reflects that Jones was convicted of robbery, not conspiracy to commit robbery.

Because the Commonwealth failed to prove that there even was a principal in the first degree who committed attempted robbery or robbery, Jones could not be convicted of that crime as a principal in the second degree.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    <em>\n     Hopson\n    </em>\n    and Jordan were distinguishable in other cases where we have upheld attempt convictions, such as\n    <em>\n     Rogers v.

We are rightly hesitant to overturn previous decisions of this Court, but there are occasions, when sitting\n    <em>\n     en banc\n    </em>\n    , where clarifying our case law and correcting a wrongly decided case demands it. The problems created by\n    <em>\n     Hopson\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Jordan\n    </em>\n    are especially apparent in\n    <em>\n     Reaux-King\n    </em>\n    . In that case, the evidence demonstrated that Reaux-King met a convenience store clerk outside of the store and told her that he intended to rob the store during her shift.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *1. He showed her a machete that he told her he intended to put against her throat during the robbery.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    After the clerk went back into the store, Reaux-King paced around the outside of the store and entered and exited the store twice \"looking around without buying anything or using the restroom.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *4. He remained near the store, and the clerk testified that her manager called the police just as Reaux-King leaned behind the ice machine where he had hidden the machete.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    He was also leaning behind the ice machine when the police arrived.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    While the panel majority correctly distinguished\n    <em>\n     Hopson\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Jordan\n    </em>\n    , the dissent disagreed, stating that \"binding Virginia jurisprudence necessitates a reversal in this case\" and adding, \"Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion because it is inapposite to our holdings in\n    <em>\n     Hopson v.
