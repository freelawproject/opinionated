Factual Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Record shows the following facts. Plaintiff-Appellant BDM Investments Inc. (\"Plaintiff\" or \"BDM\") is a general partnership, engaged exclusively in purchasing and holding real estate. Plaintiff's managing partner, Kenneth W. King, Jr. (\"King\"), and its two other partners, Leah L. King and Richard A. Mu, are licensed attorneys.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs\n   purchased undeveloped land on 1 March 2007 and subsequently lost their investment and projected profits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Since the early 1990s, Glenn Hollingsworth (\"Hollingsworth\") served as King's personal and business financial agent and advisor, preparing King's tax returns and \"occupy[ing] a position of close personal trust\" with King. In 2001, Hollingsworth also began providing personal and business financial advice to Leah King.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In or around 2004, Hollingsworth informed King he had sold his accounting business and acquired a provisional real estate license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Hollingsworth's provisional real estate license required supervision by Martin J. Evans/Homeplace Realty Associates, Inc. (\"Evans/Homeplace\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the same time, Hollingsworth intended to continue serving certain clients by including them in favorable investment opportunities. Based on their relationship of trust and confidence, King \"believed that [Hollingsworth] would be acting in King's best interests in all respects related to matters of a personal and business financial nature.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2006, Hollingsworth contacted King regarding an \" 'unbelievable opportunity' \" to invest in land in the Lennon Hills subdivision in Brunswick County. Defendants Lenhil, Inc. and Lennon Hills L.L.C. developed and sold the Lennon Hills Lots. Hollingsworth told King that plaintiffs could buy ten undeveloped lots in the subdivision for $850,000 with a ten percent down payment. After plaintiffs held the lots for one year, during which time the developer would pay the interest on the loan for the land, they could then sell the lots back to the developer for a profit. Hollingsworth further represented that it was such a favorable investment, he had purchased lots in the subdivision. Hollingsworth \"offered to take all necessary actions to complete BDM's investment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Based on Hollingsworth's representations about the \"particularly choice lots[,]\" plaintiffs decided to purchase ten lots from the developer (the \"Lennon Hills transaction\"). On 5 December 2006, Plaintiff BDM signed a contract to purchase the lots for $850,000 and deposited $30,000 earnest money with closing attorney, Gary Lawrence (\"Lawrence\"), who was serving as an \"impartial 'escrow agent' for the parties\" to the transaction. At the time BDM signed the contract, the Lennon Hills plat map had not yet been recorded with the Brunswick County Register of Deeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During the Lennon Hill transaction, Hollingsworth assisted plaintiffs with securing financing, first through Cooperative Bank, and when that failed, through Wachovia Bank and Trust Company, Inc. Hollingsworth was also working with Defendant Edwin L. Burnett, III (\"Burnett\") and Defendant Daniel Hilla III (\"Hilla\"), shareholders of Lenhil Inc. and Lennon Hills, L.L.C. Hollingsworth had been preparing Burnett's tax returns, among other services, for over 20 years. Additionally, Hollingsworth was a W-2 employee of Viable Corp. (\"Viable\"), a North\n   Carolina corporation of which Burnett is the sole shareholder. Viable paid Hollingsworth approximately $3000 per month for his services. According to Plaintiff, Burnett, a licensed real estate agent, \"appointed himself BDM's agent in the transaction and arranged for his half of the commission [$42,500] to be paid through Viable\" to Hollingsworth Further, Burnett \"as BDM's agent arranged for [Lawrence] to represent BDM.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Lawrence drafted the restrictive covenants for Lennon Hills and the custom Homesite Purchase Agreement for signing. Plaintiffs did not know about Lawrence's prior work for Lennon Hills, but claimed Burnett,\n   \"BDM's agent in the transaction, was aware of this relationship.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The contract for the Lennon Hills transaction, which was attached to each of plaintiffs' complaints: listed the closing date for plaintiffs' purchase as 6 February 2007; listed Lawrence as the escrow agent for the transaction; included no promise by the developer to repurchase the lots ; and listed Lenhil, Inc. as seller. King gave the earnest money check to Hollingsworth at \"First Citizens [Bank] in Porters Neck[.]\" In discussing a closing date with Hollingsworth, King indicated that his schedule would delay him coming to Brunswick County; Hollingsworth subsequently agreed to pick up the documents and meet to sign them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Lawrence acted as the closing agent on the Lennon Hills transaction, preparing all the documents for the closing on behalf of plaintiffs, pursuant to the contract and the instructions of the lender. He \"treated [the closing] as a 'mail away' closing ... [a] common practice in Brunswick County for real estate transactions ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   King's deposition indicates he was aware at the date of closing that Lawrence was the closing attorney. King also stated he did no due diligence investigation as to the viability of the developer, made no effort to contact Lawrence as to the developer or any loans needing to be paid off in connection to the closing, nor spoke to any attorneys of his choosing about the transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On 23 February 2007, King received \"a good faith estimate and a proposed HUD,\" which Lawrence had faxed to Lumina Mortgage broker Nick Frank, who then faxed the statement to King's bookkeeper. The good faith estimate, which was not prepared by Lawrence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   reflected the $850,000 purchase price for the ten lots, and listed a ten percent commission, split in two equal parts: $42,500 to Viable Corp., and $42,500 to Lawrence Sales &amp; Marketing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Lawrence Sales &amp; Marketing is operated by Pam Lawrence, a real estate agent who is also Gary Lawrence's wife. Pam Lawrence and Burnett previously worked together in marketing and developing the Lennon Hills subdivision and other real estate ventures. During the development of Lennon Hills, Pam Lawrence asked Gary Lawrence to draft a form contract for sales, restrictive covenants, and bylaws for the future homeowners' association. Lawrence did so. Plaintiff asserts it did not know of Pam and Gary Lawrence's relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In his deposition, Lawrence explained that in performing the title search in order to close the loan, he found a prior mortgage from BB&amp;T Bank to Lennon Hills, L.L.C. as well as a deed of trust on the entire development from Lennon Hills, L.L.C. to Lenhil Inc., which Lawrence knew were essentially duplicate entities. Lawrence asked Alton Lennon, Lennon Hills' attorney, to release all ten lots that Plaintiff was purchasing from the deed of trust; Lennon agreed to do so. Lawrence further stated Burnett, \"apparently\" as Plaintiff's agent, was aware of the Lawrence's marriage, the covenants for the development, and the homeowners' association bylaws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Lennon Hills transaction closed on 1 March 2007, when King met Hollingsworth in a parking lot and signed documents closing Plaintiff's purchase of the ten lots. King knew Lawrence was the closing attorney but had had no communications with Lawrence at that time. Lawrence did not attend the parking lot closing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The closing documents included a Wachovia Bank closing statement and a final HUD settlement statement, prepared by Lawrence as the settlement agent, and signed by King. King also affirmed during his deposition that he \"had seen a draft HUD a week or so earlier that indicated [Lawrence] was the closing attorney[.]\" The statement, which was included as an exhibit to plaintiffs' complaints, lists a $42,500 commission payment each to Lawrence Sales &amp; Marketing and Viable. Hollingsworth's commission was concealed in the sales commission paid to other defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As to the transaction, King admitted \"BDM never reduced any binding repurchase agreement with the developers to writing,\" nor did plaintiffs perform any \"due diligence investigation into the lot purchase\" or \"visit or look at the property before signing the homesite purchase agreement or closing the transaction.\" No documents included the promise by the seller to pay the first year's interest on the loan or to buy back the lots at a profit. King also admitted he \"didn't pay any particular attention\" to the entities receiving commission, nor did he raise\n   questions with Hollingsworth about the commission for the transaction. At the closing, King gave Hollingsworth a check for $63,526.48 covering the remaining balance of the ten percent down payment and additional closing costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On 7 March 2007, Viable Corp. paid $42,500 to Hollingsworth; this payment was not disclosed to Lawrence. Hollingsworth did not disclose the transaction to Evans/Homeplace, and upon questioning by Evans, he \"denied receiving the $42,500 commission.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   By letter of 30 March 2007, Lawrence \"sent correspondence to plaintiffs enclosing a General Warranty Deed.\" The mailing included deeds for the ten lots in the Lennon Hills subdivision. Lawrence performed no further representation, nor did he and King communicate directly until this litigation began.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   B. Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On 28 February 2011, plaintiffs filed the original complaint and issuance of summons against 29 defendants. The complaint included 19 causes of action and a separately pled claim for punitive damages against all defendants. On 16 March 2011, plaintiffs filed the First Amended Complaint against 29 defendants, with 19 causes of action and a claim for punitive damages against all defendants. On 8 April 2011, the North Carolina Supreme Court designated the case a Complex Business Case, and assigned the case on 14 April 2011 to the Honorable James L. Gale, Special Superior Court Judge for Complex Business Cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Between April and November of 2011, defendants filed answers to the complaints, motions to strike, and numerous motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On 18 January 2012, the trial court dismissed by order the following claims pursuant to motions to dismiss under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-12(b)(6): Legal Malpractice and Breach of Fiduciary Duty against Lawrence; Negligent Misrepresentation and Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices against Lennon Hills Defendants;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and all claims against Evans/Homeplace Realty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Claims not dismissed were subject to discovery. After discovery concluded, the trial court heard oral arguments on 17 December 2013. On 20 March 2014, the trial court issued an order and opinion on six\n   motions:\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (1) Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment against Lennon Hills Defendants, which the court denied; (2) Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment against the Estate of Hollingsworth, which the court denied; (3) Defendant Judith Hollingsworth's, as Executrix of the Estate of Hollingsworth, motion for summary judgment on all claims, which the court granted in part and denied in part; (4) Lennon Hills Defendants' motion for summary judgment, which the court granted in part and denied in part; (5) Defendant Lawrence's motion for summary judgment, which the court granted; and (6) Plaintiff's motion to amend complaint and to rescind and/or amend pursuant to Rules 15 and 54(b), which the court granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On 27 May 2014, the Lennon Hills Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's claim for piercing the corporate veil. The trial court issued an order and opinion on 21 July 2014 explaining that after the 20 March 2014 order, the parties disagreed as to whether Plaintiff's claim for\n   piercing the corporate veil survived that order. The court determined the claim remained and allowed the Lennon Hills Defendants to file a motion as to the claim. The court granted the motion as to Plaintiff's claim for piercing the corporate veil and dismissed the claim with prejudice, leaving no other claims against Defendants Burnett or Hilla.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On 17 October 2017, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Dismissal with Prejudice, dismissing its claims against Judith Hollingsworth individually and as Executrix of the Estate of Glenn Hollingsworth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In an Opinion and Final Order filed 16 November 2017, the trial court dismissed Plaintiff's action by denying its motions for summary judgment as to all defendants, granting the defendants' cross-motions, and resolving all claims in the action. Accordingly, the court dismissed the following claims pursuant to defendants' motions for summary judgment: Constructive Fraud and Negligent Misrepresentation against Lawrence; Civil Conspiracy against all defendants; Aiding and Abetting Breach of Fiduciary Duty against all defendants; and Punitive Damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On 12 December 2017, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal as to Judge Gale's 18 January 2012, 20 March 2014, 21 July 2014 interlocutory orders and 16 November 2017 Final Order and Opinion dismissing all remaining defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Judge Gale's orders of 18 January 2012, 20 March 2014, and 21 July 2014 were interlocutory; his Opinion and Final Order of 16 November 2017 is a final judgment. The North Carolina Supreme Court designated this a Complex Business Case on 8 April 2011. Because the designation was prior to 1 October 2014, this Court reviews the appeal pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7A-27(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Standards of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A.

Plaintiff filed suit on 28 February 2011, which was one day shy of four years from Lawrence's last date of representation. The question, then, is whether Plaintiff's claim is time barred by the statute of limitations or allowed pursuant to the statute of repose. Plaintiff's malpractice claim-whereby Plaintiff argues on appeal \"Lawrence's entire representation ... was fraught with unethical conduct\"-is largely centered on a failure to disclose facts that were in the closing documents and the contract. Plaintiff signed the contract of sale prior to Lawrence's representation in the transaction. At the trial court, Plaintiff alleged Lawrence improperly served as escrow agent and closing attorney, but Plaintiff knew these facts prior to closing. During its 30(b)(6) deposition, Plaintiff admitted that the allegations that it did not know Lawrence was the escrow agent or its closing attorney until after the closing were false [King I Dep. 52:18-19, 53:2-17]; Plaintiff did not, however, withdraw those allegations. Plaintiff's complaint further alleged \"Lawrence never disclosed to [Plaintiff] that he was disbursing $42,500.00 of the purchase price to ... Viable, yet the complaint also alleged that the settlement statement Lawrence prepared \"identified [a] commission payment ... to Viable ... in the amount of $42,500.00.\" Thus, at the latest, Plaintiff knew that Lawrence was acting as its closing attorney when it received the preliminary closing statement on 23 February 2007, which included the ten percent commission, split in two equal parts: $42,500 to Viable Corp., and $42,500 to Lawrence Sales and Marketing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In Plaintiff's three complaints, it alleges only that it did not discover its loss in its real estate investment until \"long after the purchase was complete.\" On appeal, Plaintiff argues this was a \"non-apparent injury\" that was discovered \"\n   <em>\n    long after\n   </em>\n   the purchase was complete[,]\" and thus argues Plaintiff \"was not injured\n   <em>\n    until King discovered\n   </em>\n   the misrepresentations and omissions made by Lawrence and other parties involved[,]\" as set forth in the pleadings. (Emphasis added.) Plaintiff argues, further, it was the \"deceptive nature\" of Lawrence's acts that prevented King from discovering \"underlying facts until\n   <em>\n    much later\n   </em>\n   and BDM filed suit within one year of that discovery.\" (Emphasis added.) Plaintiff did not identify its economic or monetary loss or explain why any alleged injury was not reasonably discoverable, nor did it provide a specific date of injury by which the court could measure the time frame in which the suit had to be commenced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bolton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8915767\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/162/171/#p173\">\n    162 N.C.

In its brief, Plaintiff concedes it did not plead a date of discovery. Such vague arguments fail to meet the necessary\n   elements set forth by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201-15\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Both the contract and the settlement statement lead to legal conclusions that the statute of limitations as well as the statute of repose do not save Plaintiff's claims against Lawrence for malpractice. The four-year statute of repose would not save Plaintiff's claim because Plaintiff failed to show that its alleged loss due to Lawrence's nondisclosure was one which should not have reasonably been discovered within two years of the closing. Later discovery of additional facts or greater damages does not delay accrual. The three-year statute of limitations had run from the time Plaintiff must have known that Lawrence was both closing and attorney escrow agent. Plaintiff's own allegations show that it should have reasonably discovered Lawrence's complained of actions no later than 1 March 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Moreover, Lawrence filed a motion to dismiss all claims against him, arguing the statute of limitations as a defense because the claims \"accrued no later than March 1, 2007[.]\" Plaintiff's response to Lawrence's motion to dismiss neither raised the statute of repose nor argued why it applied.

In its brief, Plaintiff argues Lawrence breached his fiduciary duty by \"fail[ing] to disclose his marriage to Pam Lawrence\" and Lawrence's \"multiple conflicts of interest\" resulting in \"an ethical breach of the duty of loyalty\" particularly arising from Lawrence's \"long standing professional relationship\" with the Lennon Hill Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Breach of fiduciary claims are subject to the statute of limitations found in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201-52\">\n    N.C.

In its brief, Plaintiff argues, and we agree, that the three year statute of limitations against Lawrence should apply to its \"[a]llegations of a breach of fiduciary duty that do not rise to the level of constructive fraud.\" Plaintiff's claims for breach of fiduciary duty overlap its claims for legal malpractice; accordingly, for the same reasons the legal malpractice claims should be dismissed as time barred, so too should the claims for breach of fiduciary duty be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   We therefore affirm the trial court's dismissal of Plaintiff's claim for breach of fiduciary duty against Lawrence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   3. Constructive Fraud\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In its brief, Plaintiff states in its breach of fiduciary duty argument, \"certain breaches of fiduciary duty based on fraud, such as [Lawrence's] failure to disclose his wife's commission and past work for Lennon Hills defendants, do not merge with the general claim of legal malpractice.\" In a separate argument, Plaintiff subsequently challenges the trial court's 20 March 2014 summary judgment order dismissing the constructive fraud claims against Lawrence. In its 18 January 2012 order, pursuant to motions to dismiss, the trial court dismissed all constructive fraud claims except against Hollingsworth. In its 20 March 2014 order, the trial court determined the following claims would not survive summary judgment: Plaintiff's \"direct\" claims of fraud; fraud in the inducement; and negligent misrepresentation against Lawrence for failing to disclose his relationship with Lawrence Sales &amp; Marketing, the prior legal work he performed for the Lennon Hills Defendants, and a deed of trust that did not affect BDM's title to the lots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Plaintiff argues in its brief, \"the claim [for constructive fraud] should not have been dismissed pursuant to summary judgment.\" Plaintiff's appellate argument, therefore, references a grant of summary judgment on different claims not addressed in its brief. Assuming without deciding Plaintiff properly raised constructive fraud on appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the arguments center on Lawrence's fiduciary duty to Plaintiff in the Lennon Hills transaction, and Lawrence's failure to \"disclose material facts that would have kept BDM from completing the land purchase, including but not limited to, the commission paid to Lawrence's wife, a possible benefit to Lawrence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \"Although the showing necessary to establish the existence of a breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud involves overlapping elements, the two claims are separate under North Carolina law.\"\n   <em>\n    Trillium Ridge Condo.

Facts support, however, Lawrence's fair handling of the transaction. The contract for the sale of the transaction\n   was signed prior to Lawrence's involvement as an escrow agent. The deed of trust did not encumber Plaintiff's lots, and thus Lawrence was not obligated to disclose it. Plaintiff received clear title to its lots and notice of who received commissions, including Lawrence Sales &amp; Marketing. Plaintiff did not contest the accuracy of the settlement statement. Lawrence completed the closing and disbursed funds appropriately as the escrow agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Here, the complaint does not meet the requirement of particularity with regard to fraud or constructive fraud and instead presents conclusory statements. Such claims merely repeat the reasons stated for the legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty claims.

Moreover, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed with prejudice all claims against Judith T. Hollingsworth, individually and as Executrix of the Estate of Glenn Hollingsworth. Thus, claims against Hollingsworth no longer exist as the central figure in the alleged conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   King, in his deposition, alleged Lawrence knew Hollingsworth was secretly being paid to lead Plaintiff into the transaction. In its appellate brief, Plaintiff suggests there was evidence Lawrence knew about the payment from Viable to Hollingsworth, citing to Lawrence's deposition testimony that Lawrence knew \"Viable would 'do something with the money' \". Greater context of the quoted testimony reveals Lawrence had no knowledge of Viable's payment to Hollingsworth until after this lawsuit was filed. Lawrence testified in his deposition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   [I] had no knowledge of who Glenn Hollingsworth was. I had no knowledge that he was a realtor .... I had no reason to suspect that he was being paid any sum of money. I paid at closing the two real estate agents I knew were involved ... I paid $42,500 to Ed Burnett through his company, Viable. I have no idea what he did with that money.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Lawrence further testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   We were aware there were two agents involved and that they were splitting the commission. That is who we paid. We had no reason to believe that anybody else was going to get it. Now, I did have reason to believe Viable would do something with the money but I had no idea what .... I didn't know what Viable was going to do with its money. And I certainly had no idea that\n   Glenn Hollingsworth was going to get any portion of it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Plaintiff offers nothing to dispute that Lawrence had no knowledge of a secret payment. Other allegations regarding related \"misrepresentations, conflicts of interest, hidden shared interest, conspiracies, banking violations, [and] appraisal violations\" are likewise unsupported by\n   anything more than suspicion or conjecture. Plaintiff's argument on appeal likewise mirrors the conclusory allegations set out in his complaint and fails to cite any specific facts in support of his claim for civil conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   We conclude, therefore, Plaintiff has not forecast enough evidence to present a genuine question of material fact as to conspiracy. Accordingly, the trial court properly entered summary judgment for Lawrence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   6. Aiding and Abetting Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Plaintiff next claims the trial court erred in dismissing its aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty claims against Lawrence and the Lennon Hills Defendants. To suggest Lawrence aided and abetted Hollingsworth in his breach, Plaintiff cites to Lawrence's deposition, in which he stated he knew Viable would \"do something\" with the money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   As Plaintiff acknowledges in its brief, the North Carolina Supreme Court has not recognized a cause of action for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, nor do we recognize it here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ehrenhaus v.

Equitable Estoppel\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   As an \"alternative\" to its other arguments, Plaintiff argues on appeal that \"all defendants should be equitably estopped from asserting defenses against the foregoing claims including but not limited to the statute of limitations.\" Plaintiff asserts in its brief that \"through pleadings and discovery\" it showed \"defendants repeatedly and knowingly made false representations and concealed material facts related to the Lennon Hills transaction\" in order to lead Plaintiff into the sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   While Plaintiff's brief uses the terminology \"all defendants,\" plaintiffs' complaint did not include Lawrence in the specific listing of defendants pertaining to the Equitable Estoppel claim. To any extent Plaintiff\n   attempts to raise equitable estoppel against Lawrence on appeal, it is waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   8. Punitive Damages\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Plaintiff claims on appeal it is \"entitled to punitive damages in addition to rescission of the contract\" for the Lennon Hills transaction. Plaintiff asserts it is entitled to \"punish defendants\" with such damages \"based on defendants' constructive fraud and negligent misrepresentations.\" Thus, on appeal, Plaintiff does not mention any individual defendant when discussing punitive damages, including Lawrence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Because no claims remained against Lawrence, the trial court granted summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages against Lawrence. By affirming the trial court as to all previously considered claims against Lawrence, we likewise affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment as to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   For the above reasons, we affirm the trial court's orders as to Defendant Gary Lawrence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   B. Claims against Evans/Homeplace\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Plaintiff next assigns error to the trial court for \"dismissing all claims\" against\n   Evans/Homeplace. Other than a mere reference to \"all claims,\" Plaintiff argues on appeal, more specifically, pursuant to vicarious liability,\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   , and negligent supervision claiming Evans/Homeplace \"should be held liable for Hollingsworth's acts with respect to the Lennon Hills transaction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Plaintiff's argument does not include that the trial court erred in its ruling pertaining to the statute of limitations. The trial court's order of 18 January 2012 discussed the statute of limitations as it pertained to other defendants, but did not specifically discuss whether plaintiffs' claims against Evans/Homeplace were time barred. As to the order, Evans/Homeplace had already been dismissed, prior to the court's discussion of the statute of limitations. For the same reason the trial court dismissed other defendants based on the statute of limitations, however, most of plaintiffs' claims against Evans/Homeplace were time barred. Further, the trial court's order noted plaintiffs' concession at oral argument and in the motion brief that claims for negligence, gross negligence, conversion, breach of contract, and the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing were time barred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201-52\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9) and (16) (2017.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Plaintiff also alleged joint venture and civil conspiracy against Evans/Homeplace. Under these claims, which are not separate causes of action, the conduct of one member of the joint venture or conspiracy is imposed upon another member of the joint venture or conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sellers v.

Thus, the statute of limitations for the underlying claims govern the claims for the joint venture or conspiracy. Other than the Chapter 75 claim, joint venture and civil conspiracy claims are also barred by the three-year statute of limitations. Accordingly, actions giving rise to Plaintiff's claims for negligence occurred during or before the parking lot closing on 1 March 2007 and are time barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   1. Vicarious Liability\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Even if Plaintiff's negligence claims were not time barred by the statute of limitations, Plaintiff's argument that Evans/Homeplace is vicariously liable for Hollingsworth's actions fails. The doctrine of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   imposes liability on an employer for damages caused by the negligent acts of an employee.\n   <em>\n    Estes v.

King asserted he \"reli[ed] on the fiduciary relationship\" in Hollingsworth's selection of the lots, and plaintiffs \"believed that Hollingsworth would be acting in plaintiffs' best financial interest\" in selecting the lots. The past agency relationship was based in financial advice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint goes on to state \"Hollingsworth misrepresented to plaintiffs, by his silence, that Viable corporation was a realtor that had performed actual real estate sales services entitling it to a split of the sales commission when ... Viable was in reality a mere straw man for Hollingsworth who was actually receiving a hidden commission[.]\" Alternatively, plaintiffs' complaint asserts \"Viable was in reality a front name used by\" the Lennon Hills Defendants to obtain \"funds necessary to pay the first year's interest on the Wachovia loan[.]\" Plaintiffs' complaint further assert \"Hollingsworth misrepresented to plaintiffs that the Exit Realty defendants were monitoring his activities, and that Hollingsworth was doing all that was required of him as a realtor-sponsored holder of a new real estate license, when in truth the Exit Realty defendants, including defendant J. Martin Evans, were\n   <em>\n    not overseeing anything\n   </em>\n   Hollingsworth was doing, including the transaction involving plaintiffs[.]\" (Emphasis added.) Plaintiffs assert \"Hollingsworth misrepresented to plaintiffs, by his silence, the truth of his\n   <em>\n    failure to\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    inform\n   </em>\n   the Exit Realty defendants-Hollingsworth's alleged sponsor and overseer-of the $42,500 commission Hollingsworth earned on the sale of the lots to plaintiffs[.]\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   As to a conspiracy, plaintiffs complaint explains that various parties conspired with each other to conceal material facts, conflicts of interest, and improper relationships pertaining to the purchase of the Lennon Hills property. To effect the conspiracy, \"all defendants agreed that Hollingsworth would refrain from telling his realty sponsor [Evans/Homeplace] about the sale of the lots to the plaintiffs so that Hollingsworth's 'financial advisor' status could be maintained in the\n   eyes of the plaintiffs and further that the defendants could receive as much money as possible in fees and commissions.\" In its brief, Plaintiff argues Burnett, a real estate agent, \"appointed himself BDM's agent in the transaction and arranged for his half of the commission to be paid through Viable in order to conceal the payment to Hollingsworth.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Plaintiff's allegations regarding this secretive behavior directly counter any allegations that Evans/Homeplace knew or had reason to know of Hollingsworth's misdeeds. Evans/Homeplace's testimony also supports the notion it was unaware of Hollingsworth's involvement\n   in or payment for the transaction at issue. Hollingsworth concealed from Evans/Homeplace his business relationship with Plaintiff. Because Evans/Homeplace was unaware, there was no \"relation of master and servant\" between Evans/Homeplace and Hollingsworth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tomlinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8615697\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/226/177/#p179\">\n    226 N.C. at 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20S.E.2d%20498\">\n    37 S.E.2d at 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Claims against Lennon Hill Defendants\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   1. Negligent Misrepresentation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Plaintiff assigns error to the trial court for dismissing the negligent misrepresentation claim against the Lennon Hills Defendants. Plaintiff asserts the Lennon Hills Defendants, \"through their manipulation and concealment of material facts committed negligent misrepresentation in breach of the fiduciary duty of good faith and fair dealing implicit in their contractual relationship\" for the transaction of the sale of the lots. This argument is without support in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   \"The tort of negligent misrepresentation occurs when a party justifiably relies to his detriment on information prepared without reasonable care by one who owed the relying party a duty of care.\"\n   <em>\n    Raritan River Steel Co. v.

Nothing in the pleadings reflect that the Lennon Hills Defendants negligently prepared information for Plaintiff. The first referenced section in the complaint states: \"The defendants reasonably calculated that the misrepresentations and concealed material facts would deceive plaintiffs and defendants desired and expected that plaintiffs would reasonably rely on the misrepresentations and undisclosed material facts.\" The sections continue, \"defendants recklessly made misrepresentations,\" \"recklessly concealed material facts and conflicts of interest and improper relationships,\" and that \"plaintiffs\n   justifiably relied upon and acted upon\" such misrepresentations and undisclosed facts. Plaintiffs complained had they known the truth, they would not have purchased the lots; plaintiffs further claimed damages as to the \"numerous fraudulent misrepresentations\" that caused their injury. Lacking from the complaint is any specific information that defendants, particularly the Lennon Hills Defendants, negligently supplied information with respect to the transaction. Plaintiff's brief is likewise filled with generalities and conclusory statements. It states Burnett and Hilla \"withheld and manipulated material facts\"; Viable, \"as BDM's agent, breached its separate fiduciary duty in perpetrating the same negligent misrepresentations\"; and Lennon Hills Defendants \"failed to disclose\" the commission payment and that they had a long-standing relationship with Hollingsworth. Plaintiff also fails to show it justifiably relied on any such negligently prepared or omitted information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Raritan River Steel Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2516944\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/322/200/#p206\">\n    322 N.C. at 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=367%20S.E.2d%20609\">\n    367 S.E.2d at 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Plaintiff has not sufficiently pled a claim for negligent misrepresentation, and we thus affirm the trial court's dismissal of the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   2.

Civil Conspiracy\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   We reference the Plaintiff's allegations against \"[a]ll Defendants\" and law set forth\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   regarding claims for civil conspiracy. Our review of Plaintiff's allegations reveals that Plaintiff has failed to allege any specific overt act in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy or common agreement and objective between the Lennon Hills Defendants and the other defendants. As discussed, by dismissing Hollingsworth's Estate and its representative, claims against the central figure no long exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   On appeal Plaintiff asserts Burnett and Viable Corp. created an agency relationship with Plaintiff by acting as Plaintiff's agent for the closing. Plaintiff alleges the Lennon Hills Defendants entered into an agreement with the specific purpose of \"negligently misrepresent[ing] certain facts regarding the sale of Lennon Hills [property], as well as engaging in unfair and deceptive trade practices.\" [P. Br. 39] Plaintiff also alleges Burnett and Lawrence falsified the HUD statement showing the sale of the Lennon Hills property, and that the Lennon Hills Defendants concealed the nature of Hollingsworth's involvement in the Lennon Hills sales transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Acting as an agent for and effectuating a land deal closing is not unlawful. Nothing in the record supports that Burnett and Viable's working together was part of a master plan. Plaintiff has not provided any\n   evidence beyond a suspicion or conjecture,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dalton\n   </em>\n   , 138 N.C.

We thus affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   4. Aiding and Abetting Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   For reasons set forth\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , we do not recognize here a claim for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty. We thus affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   5. Punitive Damages\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Plaintiff asserted a punitive damages claim against Hollingsworth and the Lennon Hills Defendants for constructive fraud, among other things. As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , a claim for punitive damages is not an independent claim; rather, punitive damages must only be awarded if a defendant is liable for compensatory damages related to fraud, malice, or willful or wanton conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1D-15(a) (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Claims for fraud are \"subject to more exacting pleading requirements than are generally demanded by our liberal rules of notice pleading.\"\n   <em>\n    Chesapeake Microfilm, Inc. v. Eastern Microfilm Sales &amp; Serv., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8526156\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/91/539/#p542\">\n    91 N.C.

Further, such claims require time, place, and content of conversation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=372%20S.E.2d%20901\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=372%20S.E.2d%20901\">\n    372 S.E.2d at 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   In its February 2012 order, the trial court found Plaintiff failed to allege in its Second Amended Complaint the \"time, place and content of the [alleged] fraudulent representations [Plaintiff] claimed were made by [the Lennon Hills Defendants].\" The trial court found the Second Amended Complaint deficient because it did not include specific references to the time, place, and content of the alleged fraudulent representations made by the Lennon Hills Defendants. Without showing there was information exchanged between Plaintiff and the Lennon Hills Defendants, and without showing how Plaintiff justifiably relied on such information, there is no showing of fraud. Plaintiff also did not assert allegations of malice, or willful or wanton conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1D-15(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Like the trial court, we see nothing in the record to indicate Plaintiff produced evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that clear and convincing evidence exists that an officer, director, or manager of Viable, Lenhil, Inc, or Lennon Hills, L.L.C. participated in or condoned\n   any of the potentially fraudulent, malicious, or willful and wanton conduct of Hollingsworth. We affirm the trial court's dismissal of any and all claims against the Lennon Hills Defendants for constructive fraud and denial of punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   6. Equitable Estoppel\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Plaintiff on appeal suggests that \"\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   defendants should be equitably estopped.\" Plaintiff, however, provides no specific references to the record supporting its assertions that the Lennon Hills Defendants concealed material facts or made false representations. Plaintiff also provides no support for alleging it had no means of knowledge of certain facts. The public record, discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , provided most of the facts that were allegedly uncovered after the close of the Lennon Hills sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   We therefore affirm the trial court's dismissal of the equitable estoppel claims against the Lennon Hills Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   7. Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Plaintiff also assesses error to the trial court for denying its motion for summary judgment with respect to the claims of civil conspiracy and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty against the Lennon Hills Defendants. In support of its claim, Plaintiff asserts on appeal: (1) \"Burnett and Hollingsworth entered a secret agreement that Hollingsworth would be paid half of the commission on the Lennon Hills ... transaction[ ]\" (2) Hollingsworth held a real estate license at the time of the transaction; (3) \"Burnett appointed himself/Viable as BDM's agent for purposes of the transaction\"; (4) the HUD statement \"violated Chapter 93A disclosure requirements\"; and (5) Plaintiff \"would not have entered the Lennon Hills transaction had they been aware of the agreement between Burnett and Hollingsworth.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   In its March 2014 order, the trial court concluded there are genuine issues of material fact as to these claims because Plaintiff failed to prove Hollingsworth served as Plaintiff's agent in the transaction and whether he served as Viable, Lenhil, or Lennon Hills, L.L.C.'s agent in the transaction. This was grounded in the fact that the dual agency relationship was central to Plaintiff's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   While Burnett told Hollingsworth he would \"take care\" of him if Hollingsworth brought buyers for the development, nothing in the record establishes employment of Hollingsworth, or that Hollingsworth was an agent of Burnett, Viable Corp., or any other defendant. Lacking an agency relationship between Hollingsworth and other defendants, there is no conspiracy. As addressed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , there is no recognized\n   claim for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty under North Carolina law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   We thus affirm the trial court's denial of Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the claims of civil conspiracy and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court's orders as to Lawrence, Evans/Homeplace, and the Lennon Hills Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Judges DAVIS and BERGER concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    In the initial and two amended Complaints, and in all related filings up to and including the trial court's 18 January 2012 order, \"Plaintiffs\" or \"plaintiffs\" included BDM Investments, Kenneth W. King, Jr., Leah L. King, and Richard A. Mu. The trial court also referred to the Kings and Mu as \"Individual Plaintiffs.\" The trial court's 18 January 2012 order granted Defendants' motion to dismiss Individual Plaintiffs, explaining they lacked standing to pursue individual claims because they failed to allege an injury separate and distinct from that suffered by BDM. The issue of standing of individual plaintiffs is not on appeal. Subsequently, BDM remains as the sole plaintiff. We refer to BDM as \"Plaintiff,\" but may reference \"plaintiffs\" when explaining or quoting historical facts and procedure.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    Plaintiff-Appellants' Second Amended Complaint identifies as defendants \"Exit Realty 1\n    <sup>\n     st\n    </sup>\n    , LLC, Exit Realty &amp; Associates, Inc., Exit Realty Seaside, L.L.C., and Homeplace Realty Associates, Inc.
