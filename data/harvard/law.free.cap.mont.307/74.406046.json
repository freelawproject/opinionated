The attempted deliberate homicide charge was dismissed before trial. At the close of the State\u2019s evidence at trial, Giant moved for a directed verdict of acquittal. The District Court denied the motion and the jury found Giant guilty. Giant appeals the denial of his motion for a directed verdict, asserting that the evidence was insufficient for a conviction as a matter of law because evidence of flight was the only corroboration of the prior inconsistent statements of the victim identifying him as the assailant. He also appeals a number of trial and sentencing issues. We reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion for a directed verdict and, therefore, decline to address the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal: Did the District Court err in denying Giant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict of acquittal when the prior inconsistent statements identifying Giant as the assailant were corroborated solely by flight evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u00b63 On June 5, 1998, Deborah Giant (Deborah) was assaulted in her home after work. While Deborah was standing at the kitchen sink, someone attacked her from behind by wrapping duct tape around her neck. Her attacker then dragged her by the hair to her bedroom, placed her on or near a large piece of black plastic on the floor, and placed duct tape over her mouth, around her head and around her wrists. She struggled with her assailant for an extended period, but was beaten about the face, choked, and stabbed in the arm with an ice pick. The ice pick lacerated one of the radial nerves controlling her wrist and fingers. After the attack, Deborah drove herself to the hospital. Upon continued questioning, she possibly admitted to one doctor that her husband, Giant, was the assailant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Deborah returned to her house, partially cleaned up, and spent the night there alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">\u00b64 The next day, June 6, 1998, Deborah reported the assault to the police and told them Giant was the assailant. In addition to the events described above, Deborah said Giant threatened her with a gun. Deborah also told the police that Giant took their two younger sons to a hotel the night of the assault, withdrew all their savings, and took cash advances on all their credit cards. She said the youngest son, M., took a bag of approximately $27,000 cash from the hotel room and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>returned home by himself in the early morning hours of June 6,1998. While with the police, Deborah made arrangements over the phone with Giant to exchange the cash for the middle son, D. However, an exchange never took place and D. was discovered at home later on June 6, 1998, when the police executed a search warrant. The search produced pieces of duct tape, a broken steak knife, blood stained clothing and bedding, a large piece of black plastic, and a gun and ammunition. No ice pick was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">\u00b65 A warrant was issued for Giant\u2019s arrest. Giant\u2019s truck was found a couple days later with the license plates inside the truck. Officer Richardson (Richardson) contacted Giant on June 10,1998, by calling his cellular phone number. Giant confirmed his identity to Richardson but refused to turn himself in. Phone records revealed Giant was in the San Francisco area. Four months later, on October 8, 1998, Giant returned to Billings and turned himself in to the police. The State charged Giant with attempted deliberate homicide and later amended the information to add a charge of aggravated assault. Giant made a motion to dismiss one of the charges for multiplicity or to charge in the alternative before trial and the State responded by making a motion to dismiss the charge of attempted deliberate homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u00b66 At the trial of aggravated assault, Deborah testified to the same sequence of events, but said that her oldest son, E., was the assailant rather than her husband. She testified that E. was high on drugs at the time, and that Giant walked in on the assault and engaged E. in a struggle to get E. to stop. Deborah said that E. was angry at her because Giant told him that Deborah was supposedly having an affair with an employee that was E.\u2019s age and also that Deborah wanted to have E. committed in order to cure his drug problem. She testified that Giant got the gun to protect her from E. The rest of her testimony-that Giant took the younger boys to a hotel, converted their liquid assets to cash, and agreed to exchange D. for the cash-was consistent with her earlier statements. Deborah explained the change in her story by testifying that she and Giant were intending to get a divorce during the time of the assault, that she did not want to report her son E. to the police, and that she was mad at her husband for taking the children and the cash. Due to the inconsistency between Deborah\u2019s pre-trial statements and her trial testimony, the State introduced parts of her prior inconsistent statements made to the police, to the county attorney\u2019s office, to doctors, and to the District Court in which she identified Giant as the assailant and questioned her regarding her conversation with a doctor the night of the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>\u00b67 The remaining witnesses were three law enforcement officers, one of the doctors who treated Deborah, and a victim witness assistant with the Billings County Attorney\u2019s Office. Some of the evidence seized at the home was introduced, as were pictures of Deborah\u2019s injuries taken shortly after the assault. None of the children testified at trial to corroborate either of Deborah\u2019s statements. Deborah moved to Texas after the assault and the State was unable to properly serve her or her children. Deborah eventually agreed with the State to come to Montana and voluntarily testify if the State would cease its efforts to serve process on the three children.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">\u00b68 At the close of the State\u2019s evidence, Giant moved for a directed verdict, arguing that Deborah\u2019s prior inconsistent statements could not serve as the sole basis for conviction without corroboration. Giant argued there was no corroborating evidence to confirm that he was the assailant rather than his son. The State admitted that no forensic testing was performed on the evidence seized from the Giant\u2019s home. The State said it had no indication before trial that E. would be implicated as the assailant and that Deborah stopped cooperating with their investigation. The State argued that the undisputed testimony of Giant\u2019s flight behavior was sufficient to corroborate Deborah\u2019s prior inconsistent statements and that the evidence seized from the home matched her statements. The District Court denied Giant\u2019s motion, citing evidence of Giant\u2019s flight as sufficient to corroborate the prior inconsistent statements. Giant declined to present any evidence, the case was submitted to the jury, and the jury returned a guilty verdict. Giant now appeals from the denial of his motion for a directed verdict. Further details of the testimony and evidence at trial will be discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u00b69 This Court reviews denial of a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Cochran, </em>1998 MT 138, \u00b6 28, 290 Mont 1, \u00b6 28, 964 P.2d 707, \u00b6 28. A directed verdict of acquittal is appropriate when the State fails to prove its case and there is no evidence upon which a jury could base a guilty verdict. <em>State v. Longstreth, </em>1999 MT 204, \u00b6 16,295 Mont. 457, \u00b6 16, 984 P.2d 157, \u00b6 16, <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1167, 120 S.Ct. 1187, 145 L.Ed.2d 1093 (2000); \u00a7 46-16-403, MCA. No abuse of discretion occurs if, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Cochran, </em>\u00b6 28. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>However, if the denial of directed verdict is based on a conclusion of law, like our review of any conclusion of law by a district court, we review the conclusion of law <em>de novo </em>to determine whether it is correct. <em>State v. Simmons, </em>2000 MT 329, \u00b6 9, 303 Mont. 60, \u00b6 9, 15 P.3d 408, \u00b6 9 (reviewing motion to suppress).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">\u00b610 Because the State cites to evidence presented at the sentencing hearing along with other evidence not admitted at trial in order to support its arguments regarding the directed verdict, we must first emphasize that, in considering the denial of a motion for a directed verdict, we only consider the trial testimony and the evidence properly before the jury. We cannot consider potential evidence that was not introduced, offers of proof discussed during arguments on motions if the evidence is not eventually offered and accepted, discussions in chambers or during sidebars, or evidence not admitted at trial but admitted during the sentencing hearing. To consider evidence outside the trial setting would defeat due process generally and motions for directed verdict specifically. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-16-403, MCA, (determination of sufficiency of evidence to support guilt is made \u201cat the close of the prosecution\u2019s evidence or at the close of all the evidence ....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\u00b611 Did the District Court err in denying Giant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict of acquittal when the prior inconsistent statements identifying Giant as the assailant were corroborated solely by flight evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">\u00b612  When considering a motion for directed verdict to determine whether any rational trier of fact could find the elements of a crime satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, the district court and this Court must consider the evidence properly admitted and before the jury according to the rules that govern the use of evidence in a criminal case. The interaction of two evidentiary rules is at issue in this case. We have previously held that a criminal conviction cannot be sustained where the only evidence of some essential element of the crime is a prior inconsistent statement. <em>State v. White Water </em>(1981), 194 Mont. 85, 89, 634 P.2d 636, 639; <em>State v. Gommenginger </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 265, 278, 790 P.2d 455, 463; <em>State v. Jolly </em>(1941), 112 Mont 352, 355-56, 116 P.2d 686, 687-88 (holding prior inconsistent statement insufficient for conviction before the current Montana rule was enacted); <em>compare State v. Fitzpatrick </em>(1980), 186 Mont. 187, 195-98, 606 P.2d 1343, 1348-49 (holding prior inconsistent statement of witness admissible as substantive evidence); <em>State v. Woods </em>(1983), 203 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Mont. 401, 411-12, 662 P.2d 579, 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\u00b613  Further, we have frequently held that evidence of flight is not sufficient in itself to prove guilt. <em>State v. Davis, </em>2000 MT 199, \u00b6 41, 300 Mont. 458, \u00b6 41, 5 P.3d 547, \u00b6 41; <em>State v. Hall, </em>1999 MT 297, \u00b6 47,297 Mont. 111, \u00b6 47, 991 P.2d 929, \u00b6 47; <em>State v. Patton </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 278, 290, 930 P.2d 635, 642; <em>State v. Banning </em>(1921), 60 Mont. 362, 364-65, 199 P. 274, 275 <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Campbell </em>(1965), 146 Mont. 251, 263, 405 P.2d 978, 985; <em>State v. Paisley </em>(1907), 36 Mont. 237, 252, 92 P. 566, 571; <em>see also United States v. Flores </em>(5th Cir. 1977), 564 F.2d 717, 718-19 (finding flight alone insufficient to infer guilt beyond a reasonable doubt). Because the District Court concluded that evidence of Giant\u2019s flight could serve to corroborate Deborah\u2019s prior inconsistent statements when it allowed the case to go to the jury, this case presents the question of whether flight, insufficient to prove guilt as matter of law on its own, can corroborate a prior inconsistent statement, also insufficient to prove guilt as a matter of law on its own. To answer this question, we must analyze the rationale behind each rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\u00b614 Before we do that, however, it is important to summarize the evidence before the jury in the instant ease. The fact that an assault occurred is undisputed. The evidence seized from the Giant home and Deborah\u2019s physical condition after the assault are consistent with and could corroborate either possible assailant identified by Deborah. Further, it is undisputed Giant was present and held a gun in both versions of Deborah\u2019s story of the assault. No forensic testing was done on any of the evidence collected during the search of the Giant home that could corroborate either Giant or E. as the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\u00b615 The evidence of flight is undisputed. Giant was preparing to leave town when he withdrew all available cash from the couple\u2019s savings accounts and credit cards and took the two younger boys, D. and M., to a hotel. The night of the assault, Giant kept the money and left the house. Later, Giant abandoned his truck with the license plates inside. Richardson contacted Giant on his cell phone five days after the assault and asked Giant to turn himself in. Giant refused and would not say where he was. Giant was at large for four months. When Giant turned himself in, he said he was tired of running. Given this evidence, Deborah\u2019s prior inconsistent statements and Giant\u2019s flight make up the only evidence against Giant on the essential element of the identity of the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">A. Prior Inconsistent Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">1. History of the Enactment of the Current Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>and Montana Rules of Evidence 801(d)(1)(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">\u00b616  Originally, common law allowed prior inconsistent statements to be used for impeachment purposes, but prohibited the use of prior inconsistent statements as substantive evidence. 5 JOSEPH M. McLaughlin, Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence, \u00a7 801 App.01[2] at 4 (2d ed. 2001) [hereinafter WEINSTEIN\u2019S]; <em>Jolly, </em>112 Mont at 355-56, 116 P.2d at 687-88. In 1975, the Federal Rules of Evidence amended the common law rule to allow prior inconsistent statements to be considered substantive evidence when those prior statements were \u201c[g]iven under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial or hearing, or other proceeding, or in a deposition ....\u201d Rule 801(d)(1)(A), Fed.R.Evid. The Montana rule, enacted in 1976, differs from its federal counterpart in that all prior inconsistent statements may be admitted as substantive evidence in Montana under Rule 801(d)(1)(A), M.R.Evid. <em>In re Goldman </em>(1978), 179 Mont. 526, 549-50, 588 P.2d 964, 977; <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>186 Mont. at 195-98,606 P.2d at 1348-49; <em>Woods, </em>203 Mont. at 411-12, 662 P.2d at 584; <em>compare State v.

Walker Jameson Blakey, <em>Substantive Use of Prior Inconsistent Statements Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, </em>64 Ky. L.J. 3, 6-9 (1975-76) [hereinafter Blakey] (analyzing the legislative history behind and potential problems with applying the new Rule 801(d)(1)(A), Fed.R.Evid.). The original federal proposal and Montana\u2019s rule followed the corresponding rules developed in the Model Code of Evidence and the Uniform Rules of Evidence. 2 John W. Strong et al., McCormick on EVIDENCE, \u00a7 251, at 116 &amp; n.14 (5th ed. 1999) [hereinafter McCormick]; Blakey, at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u00b618 The original version was initially recommended by the Advisory Committee on Rules of Evidence, Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Judicial Conference of the United States (Advisory Committee). Rules of Evidence for United States Courts and Magistrates, Amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure, 56 F.R.D. 183, 293 (1973); Blakey, at 6. This version was recommended based on the assertion by modern commentators on evidence that cross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>examination during trial was sufficient both to remove prior inconsistent statements from the definition of hearsay, and to provide the jury a means to assess the reliability and trustworthiness of these statements. WEINSTEIN\u2019S, \u00a7\u00a7 801App.01[4] at 14-18, [5] at 36-36.3 (Advisory Committee\u2019s letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee and clarification after Rule 801(d)(1)(A) was enacted); Blakey, at 41; 56 F.R.D. at 295-96. These commentators asserted that this reasoning was as sound as the rationale behind the other exclusions and exceptions from the hearsay rule. WEINSTEIN\u2019S, \u00a7 801App.01[4] at 18; <em>compare </em>Rule 801(d)(1)(C), M.R.Evid., (pretrial identification); Rule 801(d)(2), M.R.Evid., (admissions by party-opponent); Rule 803, M.R.Evid., (allowing exceptions to the hearsay exclusion rule for present sense impression, excited utterance, recorded recollection, etc.); Rule 804, M.R.Evid., (allowing admission of statements by a declarant who is unavailable). Finally, the original proposal was also supported by findings that prior statements made nearer in time to an incident were more accurate and free from outside influences. McCormick, \u00a7 251, at 116 &amp; n.12; Weinstein\u2019s, \u00a7 801App.01[4] at 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\u00b619 The Commission Comments to Montana Rule 801(d)(1)(A) indicate that Montana relied on the above rationale behind the original federal proposal in enacting this State\u2019s rule. The Comments state that the Commission believed cross examination during trial was sufficient to remove such statements from the definition of hearsay and that to require the prior inconsistent statement be made under trial conditions would defeat the usefulness of the rule. Commission Comments to Rule 801(d)(1)(A), M.R.Evid., (citing the Advisory Committee\u2019s recommendation, 56 F.R.D. at 295). The Commission also noted as support for the new rule the idea that, regardless of limiting jury instructions, juries tended to consider such evidence substantively anyway. Commission Comments to Rule 801(d)(1)(A), M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b620 Regardless of the reasons behind the original f\u00e9deral proposal, the federal legislative history of 801(d)(1)(A), Fed.R.Evid., indicates the additional requirements for the substantive use of prior inconsistent statements, i.e., oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a formal proceeding, were included because of concerns in Congress. Representatives expressed concern about the possibility of convictions based solely on unsworn out-of-court statements which were considered unreliable at common law. WEINSTEIN\u2019S, \u00a7 801App.01[5] at 36.1; Blakey, at 21; Kelly A. Kutler, <em>The Admission of Prior Inconsistent Statements as Substantive Evidence-Commonwealth v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number><em>Brady, </em>60 Temp. L.Q. 427, 434 n.56 (1986) (now Temp. L.R.). There was also testimony that prior inconsistent statements contained in police reports and insurance claims are unreliable because of the subjective and bias interests of police officers and claims examiners who take such statements. 30B MICHAEL H. GRAHAM, FEDERAL Practice and Procedure, Federal Rules of Evidence \u00a7 7011, at 116 n.13 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b621 To address congressional concerns, some commentators asserted there was confusion between the issue of admissibility and the issue of sufficiency. Blakey, at 20-22. These commentators argued that the original proposal was only intended to address the issue of admissibility of prior inconsistent statements as substantive evidence and that whether sufficient evidence existed to support a verdict would have to be addressed independently under substantial evidence review. Blakey, at 20-22. Further, the commentators stated that under such review, such a conviction could not stand because of the high burden of the reasonable doubt standard. Blakey, at 21-22. Regardless of the distinction between admissibility and sufficiency, Congress chose to amend and narrow the original proposal to its current version. Weinstein\u2019s, \u00a7 80lApp.01[5] at 36.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b622 After the federal change in rule 801(d)(1)(A), all but nine states modernized from the common law to allow some substantive use of prior inconsistent statements. Jennifer L. Hilliard, Note, <em>Substantive Admissibility of a Non-party Witness\u2019 Prior Inconsistent Statements: Pennsylvania Adopts the Modern View, </em>32 Vill. L. Rev. 471, 489-96 (1987) [hereinafter Hilliard]. Fourteen states adopted the federal rule verbatim. Hilliard, 492 &amp; n.98. Twenty states, including Montana, adopted the original proposal to allow substantive use of all prior inconsistent statements. Hilliard, 491 &amp; n.94. The remaining states adopted various versions of the federal rule modified to ensure the reliability of the prior inconsistent statements in different ways. Hilliard, 491-96. <em>See </em>Haw.R.Evid. 802.1(1) (allowing prior inconsistent statements to serve as substantive evidence if the statement is reduced to a signed writing or electronically recorded, in addition to the statements allowed under Rule 801(d)(1)(A), Fed.R.Evid.).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">2. The Use of Prior Inconsistent Statements as Substantive Evidence: Sufficiency vs. Reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">\u00b623 After the modernization of Rule 801(d)(1)(A), state and federal case law began to struggle with the issue of the sufficiency of prior inconsistent statements as the sole proof supporting a conviction. Sufficiency of evidence is a determination that depends on the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>specific to a case and addresses the question of whether the evidence supports a conviction such that any rational trier of fact could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Hocevar, </em>2000 MT 157, \u00b6 23, 300 Mont. 167, \u00b6 23, 7 P.3d 329, \u00b6 23. When a conviction is supported solely by a prior inconsistent statement, a review of the evidence for sufficiency so as to assess whether any rational trier of fact could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt inevitably involves a review of the degree of reliability of the prior inconsistent statement. Thus, the reasoning behind using prior inconsistent statements as substantive evidence becomes circular: prior inconsistent statements are admissible as substantive evidence because cross examination at trial guarantees reliability, but when considered alone such statements must be reviewed to see if they are reliable enough. A recognition of this quandary is apparent in the fact that since the new rules were enacted, state and federal case law has continually turned to a review of the reliability of prior inconsistent statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b624 This paradox was foreshadowed in <em>California v. Green </em>(1970), 399 U.S. 149, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489, a case holding that the use of prior inconsistent statements as substantive evidence does not violate the Confrontation Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Justice Harlan\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Green </em>asserts that if a case rests entirely on a prior inconsistent statement, the defendant would be entitled to a hearing on the reliability of the statement. <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. at 187, 90 S.Ct. at 1950, n.20. <em>See also </em>Stanley A. Goldman, <em>Guilt by Intuition: the Insufficiency of Prior Inconsistent Statements to Convict </em>65 N.C. L. Rev. 1 (1986) (criticizing the substantive use of prior inconsistent statements by questioning the reliability of such statements). While there is precedent establishing that convictions based entirely on unreliable evidence cannot stand, <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. at 187, 90 S.Ct. at 1950, n.20 (citations omitted), the Court has not addressed the specific issue of whether a prior inconsistent statement as the sole proof of conviction violates other due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u00b625 The Court\u2019s later cases indicate that sufficiency of such evidence is completely dependent on its reliability. The Court has held that statements admitted under a residual hearsay exception, rather than a firmly-rooted exception to hearsay, cannot be considered for substantive purposes if the statements do not have adequate indicia of reliability as required under the Confrontation Clause. <em>Idaho v. Wright </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 805, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d <em>638 passim </em>(holding child\u2019s pre-trial statements to doctor regarding sexual abuse were not admissible for substantive use). In contrast, the Court has also held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>that no reliability hearing is necessary for Confrontation Clause purposes for an out-of-court identification admitted under Rule 801(d)(1)(C), Fed.R.Evid., when the person who made the identification is available at trial for cross examination. <em>United States v. Owens </em>(1988), 484 U.S. 554, 560-61, 108 S.Ct. 838, 843, 98 L.Ed.2d 951. <em>See also Ohio v. Roberts </em>(1980), 448 U.S. 56, 70-73, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2541-43, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (holding pre-trial statements admissible as substantive evidence because statements were subject to cross examination when given).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u00b626 In federal case law, the issue of sufficiency of a prior inconsistent statement alone was first addressed in <em>United States v. Orrico </em>(6th Cir. 1979), 599 F.2d 113. In <em>Orrico, </em>a conviction for fraudulent transportation of checks in interstate commerce was reversed based on the rationale that the entire case rested on a prior inconsistent statement and a past recorded recollection which were insufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Orrico, </em>599 F.2d at 118-19. The entire analysis in the case revolves around the questionable reliability of those statements. <em>Orrico, </em>599 F.2d at 116-17. In contrast, the same circuit found in <em>United States v. Woods </em>(6th Cir. 1980), 613 F.2d 629, 637, that the conviction was sufficiently supported by the evidence even though pre-trial testimony before a grand jury apparently was the only direct evidence linking defendant Underwood to the robbery. <em>Compare Ticey v. Peters </em>(7th Cir. 1993) 8 F.3d 498, 503-04 (holding on <em>habeas corpus </em>petition that prior inconsistent statements of rape victim were sufficiently reliable as sole support for conviction, even though statements were testified to and paraphrased by the police officer who took statements); <em>United States v. Bahe </em>(D.N.M. 1998), 40 F. Supp. 2d 1302 (prior inconsistent statement of niece was insufficient to support conviction for sexual abuse).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u00b627 As criminal prosecution of domestic abuse cases has increased, states are more often dealing with the difficultly of the substantive use of prior inconsistent statements. <em>See State v. Clark </em>(Haw. 1996), 926 P.2d 194 (holding prior inconsistent statements of domestic abuse victim were sufficient as the sole proof of identity for conviction even though she testified at trial the wounds were self inflicted because she was high on drugs). <em>See also </em>Neal A. Hudders, Note, <em>The Problem of Using Hearsay in Domestic Violence Cases: Is a New Exception the </em>Answer? 49 Duke L.J. 1041 (2000) (analyzing current and potential exceptions to hearsay for domestic violence cases); Peter R. Dworkin, <em>Confronting Your Abuser in Oregon: a New Domestic Violence Hearsay Exception, </em>37 Willamette L. Rev. 299 (2001) (analyzing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>constitutionality of Oregon\u2019s new hearsay exception that specifically allows substantive admission of domestic abuse reports); Andrea G. Nadel, <em>Use or Admissibility of Prior Inconsistent Statements of Witness as Substantive Evidence of Facts to Which They Relate in Criminal Case-Modern State Cases, </em>30 A.L.R.4th 414 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u00b628 Our review of state case law indicates that appellate courts have inevitably walked down the path of categorizing particular prior inconsistent statements depending on reliability, in order to determine the sufficiency of evidence. Pennsylvania established a rule similar to Montana\u2019s by judicial decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Brady </em>(Pa. 1986), 507 A.2d 66. This decision has been continually refined and limited to the point that Pennsylvania\u2019s rule is now similar to the statutory rule in Hawaii mentioned above. <em>See Commonwealth v. Wilson </em>(Pa. 1998), 707 A.2d 1114, 1118 (explaining some of the case law refinements since <em>Brady </em>and holding prior inconsistent statement must be electronically recorded in order to qualify as substantive evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u00b629 Massachusetts has almost approached a case-by-case analysis of convictions based solely on the substantive use of prior inconsistent statements. Prior inconsistent statements given at a probable cause hearing are sufficient to support a conviction alone, but prior inconsistent statements given at a grand jury must be corroborated. <em>Compare Commonwealth v. Clements </em>(Mass. 2001), 747 N.E.2d 682, 687-88 (grand jury testimony corroborated by pretrial photographic identification admitted under 801(d)(1)(C), Mass.R.Evid.), <em>rehearing granted by </em>752 N.E.2d 241 (2001); <em>Commonwealth v. Sineiro </em>(Mass. 2000), 740 N.E.2d 602, 609-10 (cross-examined probable cause testimony sufficient alone). New Jersey has adopted a fifteen factor test for reviewing the reliability of a prior inconsistent statement, in addition to its statutory rule. <em>State v. Mancine </em>(N.J. 1991), 590 A.2d 1107, 1115.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See also R.T.L. v. State </em>(Fla. 2000), 764 So.2d 871 (prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>inconsistent statement insufficient alone); <em>Nance v. State </em>(Md. 1993), 629 A.2d 633 (prior inconsistent statement sufficient alone if reliable); <em>State v. Robar </em>(Vt. 1991), 601 A.2d 1376 (same); <em>People v. Chavies </em>(Mich. 1999), 593 N.W.2d 655 (prior inconsistent statement may serve as sole basis for conviction; credibility of statement is issue for the jury), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 841, 121 S.Ct. 105, 148 L.Ed.2d. 63 (2000); <em>State v. Igoe </em>(N.D. 1973), 206 N.W.2d 291 (same). While the approach is different in the various jurisdictions, the effect of the modified rules is to narrow the issue of the sufficiency of evidence, and therefore its reliability, either by requiring corroboration or by constraining the admissibility of prior inconsistent statements for use as substantive evidence in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">3. The Use of Prior Inconsistent Statements in Montana</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b630 <em>White Water </em>was the first Montana case to recognize the sufficiency limitations of using a prior inconsistent statement as the sole substantive evidence. <em>White Water, </em>194 Mont. at 88-89, 634 P.2d at 638-39. In a trial charging sexual intercourse without consent, the victim testified that no penetration occurred. <em>White Water, </em>194 Mont. at 87, 634 P.2d at 637. We affirmed the district court\u2019s directed verdict where the only evidence of penetration, an essential element of sexual intercourse without consent, was an unreliable, unsworn, prior inconsistent statement made by the victim and written by the sheriff who interviewed her. <em>White Water, </em>194 Mont. at 87-88,634 P.2d at 637. We held that a prior inconsistent statement admitted as substantive evidence under Rule 801(d)(1)(A), M.R.Evid., although admissible, is insufficient by itself to support a conviction without corroboration by independent evidence. <em>White Water, </em>194 Mont. at 88-89, 634 P.2d at 638-39. <em>See also Jolly, </em>112 Mont at 355-56, 116 P.2d at 687-88 (before current Rule 801(d)(1)(A) was enacted, finding prior inconsistent statement substantive evidence, but insufficient to convict).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\u00b631 We based our holding in <em>White Water </em>on the reasoning that a rational juror could not likely be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt based solely on a prior inconsistent statement. <em>White Water, </em>194 Mont. at 89, 634 P.2d at 639. We emphasized the insufficiency of such evidence by noting that if \u201cthe entire case for the prosecution was a prior inconsistent unsworn statement it would be difficult indeed to see how [a judge] could avoid directing a verdict.\u201d <em>White Water, </em>194 Mont. at 89-90, 634 P.2d at 639. However, the paradox discussed above between admissibility and sufficiency was realized in <em>White Water </em>because the reasoning in <em>White Water </em>is wholly based on an analysis of the questionable reliability of the prior inconsistent statement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>victim. <em>White Water, </em>194 Mont. at 89-90, 634 P.2d at 639. We held the directed verdict was appropriate because the unreliability of the victim\u2019s statement made conviction beyond a reasonable doubt impossible. Further, in reaching our holding in <em>White Water, </em>we relied on the concerns expressed in the legislative history which resulted in the current federal rule, a rule which would have prohibited the substantive use of the victim\u2019s statements in <em>White Water. White Water, </em>194 Mont. at 88-90, 634 P.2d at 638-39 (quoting legislative history and commentary discussed in Blakey, at 21-22).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">\u00b632 Our focus on the reliability of the victim\u2019s prior inconsistent statement in <em>White Water </em>left open the possibility that some types of <em>reliable </em>or <em>sworn </em>prior inconsistent statements could be used as the sole basis for conviction and that only <em>unreliable </em>or <em>unsworn </em>prior inconsistent statements required corroboration. In <em>State v. Stringer </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 367, 382, 897 P.2d 1063, 1072, a domestic abuse case similar to the case at bar, the victim denied an assault even occurred when questioned at trial. We determined her prior inconsistent statements were more reliable than those in <em>White Water </em>because the victim wrote and signed the statements herself the day after the assault. <em>Stringer, </em>271 Mont. at 382, 897 P.2d at 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\u00b633 This holding could be interpreted to mean that we drew a distinction between reliable and unreliable prior inconsistent statements and intended to allow similarly reliable prior inconsistent statements to serve as the sole basis for conviction. However, this interpretation of <em>Stringer </em>ignores our fundamental concern about the questionable reliability of prior inconsistent statements and ignores the fact that, in <em>Stringer, </em>the victim\u2019s prior inconsistent statements were corroborated by other evidence. The corroboration included photographs of her injuries, observations by the police who arrived shortly after the incident, and statements of the victim\u2019s children to the police. <em>Stringer, </em>271 Mont. at 382, 897 P.2d at 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\u00b634 The above review of the issue of sufficiency of the evidence when a conviction is based on a prior inconsistent statement alone demonstrates that sufficiency is dependent on the reliability of that statement. We decline to continue down the path of analyzing the reliability of each and every type of prior inconsistent statement as many states have done. Rather, in order to create a clear, bright-line rule for trial courts and practitioners, we reaffirm our holdings in <em>White Water </em>and in <em>Gommenginger </em>that require prior inconsistent statements admitted as substantive evidence of guilt be corroborated in order to sustain a conviction. In doing so, we are in line with states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>that use this approach to address sufficiency when a conviction is based on a prior inconsistent statement. <em>See State v. Moore </em>(Fla. 1986), 485 So.2d 1279, 1281 (finding that the risk of convicting an innocent person is too great where a prior inconsistent statement was sole substantive evidence); <em>Brower </em>v. <em>State </em>(Alaska 1986), 728 P.2d 645. We also clarify <em>White Water </em>and <em>Stringer </em>to make clear that prior inconsistent statements admitted at trial pursuant to Rule 801(d)(1)(A), M.R.Evid., as substantive evidence must be corroborated by other evidence, even if those prior statements seem as reliable as those in <em>Stringer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">\u00b635 Judge Learned Hand\u2019s statement in <em>Di Carlo v. United States </em>is often cited in support of allowing prior inconsistent statements to be used as substantive evidence. <em>Di Carlo v. United States </em>(2d Cir. 1925), 6 F.2d 364, 368. He stated that i\u00a3[i]f, from all that the jury see of the witness, they conclude that what he says now is not the truth, but what he said before, they are none the less [sic] deciding from what they see and hear of that person and in court.\u201d <em>Di Carlo, </em>6 F.2d at 368. However, this rationale only addresses the credibility a jury gives to one witness. It does not address whether the out-of-court statement is so reliable it supports guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Di Carlo, </em>6 F.2d at 365 (beginning discussion of that case by stating that \u201cno question is raised of the sufficiency of the proof\u2019). Therefore, we conclude that requiring corroboration is the best way to ensure that the variations in the reliability of such statements are addressed in a way that can support a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\u00b636 The State argues here that, following <em>Stringer, </em>Deborah\u2019s prior inconsistent statements should be considered reliable and sufficient as the sole basis for identifying Giant as the assailant because her prior statements were consistent with the physical evidence, three of her statements were given right after the incident, at least one was tape-recorded, and the statement submitted to the District Court on the issue of bail reduction was notarized.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, as clarified above, <em>Stringer </em>does not support this assertion because the victim\u2019s prior statement that an assault had actually occurred-the issue in dispute in that case-was corroborated by independent evidence. Therefore, Deborah\u2019s prior inconsistent statements must be corroborated by independent evidence of Giant\u2019s identity as the assailant for the denial of directed verdict to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>\u00b637  In that regard, we note that much of the evidence presented at trial goes to the reliability of each of Deborah\u2019s statements. For example, in order to reinforce the credibility of the prior statements, the State attempted to show that Deborah stopped cooperating with the County Attorney\u2019s office when Giant was released on bail and also attempted to show that Deborah asked that the case be dismissed after her divorce proceedings were voluntarily dismissed. However, this evidence only affects the reliability of the prior inconsistent statements; none of this evidence independently corroborates the statements. Therefore, Deborah\u2019s prior statements alone are insufficient as a matter of law to support Giant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">B. Flight Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\u00b638  This brings us to the issue presented in this case: can evidence of flight be the sole corroboration of prior inconsistent statements? As mentioned above, we have held that flight evidence cannot be the sole basis of guilt. <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6 47. The rationale behind this rule lies in the fact that evidence of flight without any other evidence can be as consistent with innocence as it is with guilt. In <em>Wong Sun v. United States </em>(1963), 371 U.S. 471, 484, 83 S.Ct. 407, 415, 9 L.Ed.2d 441, a case holding evidence of flight alone insufficient for probable cause, the Supreme Court stated \u201cwe have consistently doubted the probative value in criminal trials of evidence that the accused fled the scene of an actual or supposed crime.\u201d <em>Wong Sun </em>quoted <em>Alberty v. United States </em>and reaffirmed the following reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">[I]t is not universally true that a man who is conscious that he has done a wrong \u201cwill pursue a certain course not in harmony with the conduct of a man who is conscious of having done an act which is innocent, right, and proper,\u201d since it is a matter of common knowledge that men who are entirely innocent do sometimes fly from the scene of a crime through fear of being apprehended as the guilty parties, or from an unwillingness to appear as witnesses. Nor is it true as an accepted axiom of criminal law that \u201cthe wicked flee when no man pursueth, but the righteous are as bold as a lion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-7\"><em>Wong Sun, </em>371 U.S. at 484, 83 S.Ct. at 415 (quoting <em>Alberty v. United States </em>(1896), 162 U.S. 499, 511, 16 S.Ct. 864, 868, 40 L.Ed. 1051). The Court in <em>Alberty </em>reversed jury instructions that created a presumption of guilt if the elements of a crime were established and there was evidence of flight by the defendant. <em>Alberty, </em>162 U.S. at 511, 16 S.Ct. at 868, 40 L.Ed. 1051; <em>see also Banning, </em>60 Mont. at 364-65, 199 P. at 275; <em>Hickory v. United States </em>(1896), 160 U.S. 408, 16 S.Ct. 327, 40 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>L.Ed. 474. Further, in order to avoid the court making an unnecessary comment on the evidence, a separate jury instruction on flight evidence should not be given. <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6 45. Therefore, because evidence of flight by itself is as consistent with innocence as it is with guilt, we reaffirm our precedent that flight by itself is insufficient as a matter of law to support a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">C. Flight and Prior Inconsistent Statements</p>\n<p id=\"ALO\">\u00b639  Having reviewed both forms of evidence and having pointed out the inherent weaknesses in each, we now reach the question of whether evidence of flight is sufficient to corroborate prior inconsistent statements admitted as substantive evidence of guilt. W e conclude that the answer to this question must be, No.\u201d Holding that two forms of evidence, each unreliable in its own right, nonetheless, when taken together, are sufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, accords the sum of the evidence a characteristic trustworthiness that neither of its constituent parts possesses. Simply put, zero and zero cannot make one. Therefore, we hold, as a matter of law, that evidence of flight cannot be the sole corroboration of a prior inconsistent statement admitted as substantive evidence of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\u00b640  We now turn to apply this rule to the instant case. Here, Deborah\u2019s prior inconsistent statements and Giant\u2019s flight implicate him as the assailant. Deborah\u2019s prior inconsistent statements require corroboration because Deborah refused to identify Giant as the assailant at trial. Because of the divorce and Giant\u2019s possible fear of being falsely accused, Giant\u2019s flight is as consistent with innocence as it is with guilt. The remaining evidence in this case consists of the physical evidence recovered from the home and the photographs of Deborah\u2019s injury. This evidence, which would normally be sufficient corroborating evidence, is insufficient in this case because it does not corroborate the essential element of identity needed because Deborah identified another possible assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\u00b641 Because all the evidence identifying Giant as the assailant-Deborah\u2019s prior inconsistent statements and Giant\u2019s flight-is insufficient as a matter of law, the District Court\u2019s denial of Giant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">\u00b642 Reversed and remanded to the District Court for entry of an order granting Giant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict and for a verdict of acquittal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b113-9\">JUSTICES COTTER, TRIEWEILER, REGNIER and LEAPHART <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The doctor in question did not testify at trial.

In doing so, it is important to state without equivocation my total agreement that, under our jurisprudence, a criminal conviction cannot be sustained where the only evidence of an essential element of the offense is a prior inconsistent statement. I also agree that evidence of flight is not sufficient on a stand-alone basis to prove guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\u00b644 Having agreed with those basic principles at issue here, I observe that, while much of the Court\u2019s discussion is of interest from an intellectual standpoint, little of it bears on the issue presently before us. Indeed, the only pertinent facts in \u00b6\u00b6 16 though 22 of the Court\u2019s opinion are that, under Rule 801(d)(1)(A), M.R.Evid., prior inconsistent statements are not hearsay in this state and may be admitted as substantive, direct evidence. It is difficult to discern the reason for the rest of the Court\u2019s lengthy discussion in these paragraphs, except that it may indicate the Court\u2019s displeasure with the Montana rule. Nonetheless, Rule 801(d)(1)(A), M.R.Evid., is our Rule and it-rather than the federal rule, concerns of \u201ccommentators\u201d or different approaches in other states-is at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">\u00b645 Similarly, the Court\u2019s discussion of the \u201creliability\u201d question in federal case law and other jurisdictions at \u00b6\u00b6 23 through 29, insofar as it relates to prior inconsistent statements as the <em>sole evidence </em>of an element of a criminal offense, is largely extraneous. This Court\u2019s jurisprudence on the issue is contained in <em>White Water, </em>and that principle is that a criminal conviction cannot be sustained where the only evidence of some essential element of the crime is a prior inconsistent statement, because such a statement generally is unsworn. As to the Court\u2019s lengthy discussion of both other jurisdictions\u2019 case law and <em>White Water </em>in this regard, it is based on the premise that the prior inconsistent statements are the only evidence of an element of the charged offense. That is not the situation in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">\u00b646 Simply stated, the prosecution in this case presented substantial evidence identifying Giant as the assailant. As the Court states, Deborah\u2019s multiple prior statements to that effect are direct and substantive evidence of the identity of her assailant. While that evidence standing alone-that is, without corroboration-is insufficient to go to the jury on the identity element of the charged offense, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>prosecution also presented circumstantial evidence on the identity element via the flight evidence. On the basis of that evidence, the District Court denied Giant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict and allowed the case to go to the jury, which convicted Giant. On this record, and under this Court\u2019s jurisprudence, I would affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ7\">\u00b647 The fact is that Giant does not present the \u201creliability\u201d question in the broad context in which the Court ultimately decides it. Instead, Giant first argues on appeal that, under <em>White Water, </em>Deborah\u2019s prior inconsistent statements cannot be the sole evidence on which the jury could be allowed to determine that Giant was her assailant because the prior statements were unsworn. Under this Court\u2019s cases, his argument is correct and I join the Court in so concluding.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\u00b648 Giant\u2019s second argument is that the State\u2019s flight evidence here is so \u201ctenuous\u201d that it is insufficient to corroborate Deborah\u2019s prior inconsistent statements because flight evidence can be consistent with either guilt or innocence. The argument is based on Giant\u2019s contention that the only flight evidence is that he went \u201cto his parents in California right after the assault.\u201d His argument does not raise the question the Court states is the issue presented in this case of whether flight evidence can be the sole corroboration of prior inconsistent statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\u00b649 In any event, the Court does not agree with Giant\u2019s premise, namely, the \u201ctenuous\u201d nature of the flight evidence, and neither do I. Indeed, the Court states that the following \u201cevidence of flight is undisputed[:]\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\">Giant was preparing to leave town when he withdrew all available cash from the couple\u2019s savings accounts and credit cards and took the two younger boys, D. and M., to a hotel. The night of the assault, Giant kept the money and left the house. Later, Giant abandoned his truck with the license plates inside. Richardson contacted Giant on his cell phone five days after the assault and asked Giant to turn himself in. Giant refused and would not say where he was. Giant was at large for four months. When Giant turned himself in, he said he was tired of running.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">This is significant and substantial flight evidence which, although circumstantial evidence going to Giant\u2019s identity as Deborah\u2019s assailant, corroborates her prior inconsistent statements as required by our cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">\u00b650 The Court having implicitly rejected Giant\u2019s argument that the flight evidence is \u201ctenuous,\u201d it is my view that the remainder of his argument, that the evidence is insufficient to corroborate Deborah\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>prior inconsistent statements, also must be rejected. At that point, our analysis having covered Giant\u2019s arguments on appeal, we should affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Giant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. That our case law properly holds flight evidence can be consistent with innocence as well as guilt means only that it is insufficient on a stand-alone basis to support a conviction. Here, as corroboration of Deborah\u2019s statements, it creates a jury question, and the same is true regarding the weight and credibility to be given Deborah\u2019s direct and substantive evidence-via her numerous prior inconsistent statements-identifying Giant as her assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">\u00b651 In this latter regard, it is important to keep in mind the extent and timing of Deborah\u2019s prior statements-inconsistent with her later trial testimony-about the June 5, 1998, assault. As the Court mentions, Deborah testified she possibly told a doctor at the hospital almost immediately after the assault that Giant was her assailant. In addition, her undisputed testimony was that she told doctors at the hospital the following day that her \u201chusband did it.\u201d That same day, she told police that Giant was her assailant. Aside from the \u201cinsufficient standing alone\u201d issue, these statements made nearer in time to the incident could be considered by the jury to be more accurate and free from outside influences than those made later. Indeed, according to McCormick, \u00a7 251, 116 n.12, \u201c[t]he fresher the memory, the fuller and more accurate it is.\u201d It is my view that, because they were corroborated by substantial flight evidence, the jury was entitled to weigh Deborah\u2019s prior statements, together with her trial testimony and credibility, and find beyond a reasonable doubt that Giant was the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">\u00b652 My view is strengthened by an additional prior inconsistent statement of Deborah\u2019s mentioned only in passing by the Court as one \u201conly certain portions of which were read aloud.\u201d It is true that Deborah read only certain portions of this additional statement during her testimony, admitting she swore to the statement before a notary; it is somewhat misleading, however, for the Court to omit the substance of these statements and the time frame in which they were made. Unlike the statements made so soon after the assault, Deborah made the following statements on December 18, 1998, more than six months after the assault:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\">Ed [Giant] committed an extremely violent and near fatal act on me on June 5, 1998.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\">He planned it out for a week and had everything organized to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>carry out his plan to kill me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Again, these numerous statements by Deborah, made to different people at significantly different times, are insufficient on a stand-alone basis to establish the identity element of the offense with which Giant was charged. Taken together with the substantial corroborating evidence of flight, however, it strikes me as beyond dispute that the evidence was sufficient to withstand a motion for a directed verdict which was based on insufficient evidence of the identity of Deborah\u2019s assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\u00b653 As Judge Learned Hand said in <em>Di Carlo, </em>\u201c[i]f from all that the jury see of the witness, they conclude that what [s]he says now is not the truth, but what [s]he said before, they are none the less deciding from what they see and hear of that person and in court.\u201d That is what the jury in this case determined with regard to Deborah\u2019s trial testimony and her statements at earlier times, respectively, and-together with the substantial flight evidence-it is what the jury had a right to do after the District Court properly denied the motion for a directed verdict. Ignoring Giant\u2019s actual arguments on appeal, the Court instead turns jury credibility and weight questions into a question of law, <em>sua sponte </em>and without any citation to authority, and concludes that all of the evidence of identity-taken together \u2014 was so inherently unreliable as to be insufficient to allow the case to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\u00b654 Moreover, the Court\u2019s \u201czero and zero cannot make one\u201d statement is insupportable on this record. There are no \u201czeroes\u201d here. The Court simply disregards the fact that both direct and substantive evidence from Deborah near the time of the assault and later, and substantial flight evidence from Giant\u2019s own conduct immediately after the assault, were presented by the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">\u00b655 I could not disagree more strongly with the Court\u2019s approach and result in this case. I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b117-8\">JUSTICE RICE joins in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
