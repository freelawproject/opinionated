Placzkiewicz (Alan), by counsel, appeals from the District Court\u2019s February 2,2000 order denying his request to file a petition for postconviction relief. The sole issue which we consider is whether the District Court properly concluded that postconviction relief was time-barred. We hold that, as a matter of law, the trial court\u2019s decision was correct. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">\u00b62 On July 23, 1992, Alan was sentenced on his plea of guilty to felony arson to serve 20 years in the Montana State Prison, with 15 years suspended on various conditions. Alan was later released from prison to begin serving the suspended portion of his sentence. On February 8,1995, as a result of a petition filed by the Missoula County Attorney, the District Court revoked Alan\u2019s suspended sentence and ordered him to serve 15 years at the Montana State Prison with all time suspended on conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">\u00b63 On February 13, 1995, the Missoula County Attorney again petitioned to revoke Alan\u2019s suspended sentence. The District Court granted this petition on February 27, 1995. In this second revocation proceeding, the court imposed a term of 15 years in the Montana State Prison, with 10 years suspended on various conditions. Alan was later released from prison to begin serving the suspended portion of this sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">\u00b64 In February 1998, the Missoula County Attorney\u2019s office once again filed a petition to revoke Alan\u2019s suspended sentence for violating the rules of his probation. For a third time the District court revoked Alan\u2019s suspended sentence and, this time, required him to serve 10 years in the Montana State Prison, with all but three days suspended on various terms and conditions. Two months later, on April 9, 1998, and for a fourth time, the Missoula County Attorney petitioned to revoke Alan\u2019s suspended sentence. This petition culminated with the District Court issuing a judgment sentencing Alan to a term of 10 years in the Montana State Prison with no time suspended. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>sentence was affirmed by the Sentence Review Division on September 1, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">\u00b65 The record reflects that Alan then filed various <em>pro se </em>documents with the District Court attempting to obtain other documents and discovery. As a result, the District Court requested the Missoula County Public Defender\u2019s Office to represent Alan. However, because of a conflict the Public Defender referred Alan\u2019s case to William Boggs, Alan\u2019s present counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\u00b66 On October 18,1999, Boggs filed a \u201cRequest for Hearing on Post-Judgment Representation\u201d indicating that Alan wanted to \u201cchallenge his original 1992 conviction by way of a petition for post-conviction relief, alleging ineffective assistance of then-appointed counsel....\u201d In this request for hearing, Boggs expressed several concerns, one of which was that Alan\u2019s postconviction petition would be time-barred under \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\u00b67 Following a hearing on his request, the District Court authorized Boggs to file a brief on the statute of limitations issue without filing a postconviction petition. Subsequently, Boggs filed his memorandum of law on December 23, 1999, arguing that the statute of limitations should be tolled. The State responded, and on February 2, 2000, the District Court entered its order denying Alan\u2019s request to file a petition for postconviction relief on the basis that such a petition would be time-barred. Alan timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">\u00b68 We conclude that the District Court\u2019s decision was correct and, therefore, must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">\u00b69 <em>Was Alan time-barred from seeking postconviction relief?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">\u00b610 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of postconviction relief to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>State v. Hanson, </em>1999 MT 226, \u00b6 9, 296 Mont. 82, \u00b6 9, 988 P.2d 299, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">\u00b611 In its decision, the trial court noted that Alan and the State both agreed that under \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA (1991), Alan had five years from the date of his conviction within which to petition for postconviction relief. There is no question that Alan did not comply with this requirement. Nonetheless, Alan argues that his petition was not time-barred because the tolling provision for civil proceedings set out in \u00a7 27-2-401(1), MCA (1991), controls, rather than the specific postconviction relief statute of limitations set out in \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA (1991). This tolling period, according to Alan, would include the months of his incarceration plus the five year limitations period under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>\u00a7 46-21-102, MCA (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">\u00b612  At the outset, while we have held that the statutory time-bar may be waived when there is a clear miscarriage of justice, this exception does not apply unless the petitioner provides newly discovered evidence that demonstrates his actual innocence. <em>State v. Wells, </em>2001 MT 55, \u00b6\u00b6 10-11, 304 Mont. 329, \u00b6\u00b6 10-11, 21 P.3d 610, \u00b6\u00b6 10-11; <em>State v. Rosales, </em>2000 MT 89, \u00b6 7, 299 Mont. 226, \u00b6 7, 999 P.2d 313, \u00b6 7; <em>State v. Nichols, </em>1999 MT 212, \u00b6 20, 295 Mont. 489, \u00b6 20, 986 P.2d 1093, \u00b6 20; <em>State v. Redcrow, </em>1999 MT 95, \u00b6\u00b6 33-34, 37, 294 Mont. 252, \u00b6 33-34, 37, 980 P.2d 622, \u00b6\u00b6 33-34, 37. Here, Alan has not asserted much less shown, that he is actually innocent of the offense of arson of which he was convicted. Accordingly, he has failed to satisfy the miscarriage of justice exception to the five-year time-bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u00b613 Nonetheless, as noted by the District Court, Alan argues that this statute of limitations should be tolled because he was incarcerated for most of the time since his original conviction. Alan\u2019s argument is premised on the civil tolling provisions of \u00a7 27-2-401(1), MCA (1991). This statute provides<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">When person entitled to bring action is under a disability. (1) If a person entitled to bring an action mentioned in part 2, except 27-2-211(3), is, at the time the cause of action accrues, either a minor, seriously mentally ill, or imprisoned on a criminal charge or under a sentence for a term less than for life, the time of such disability is not a part of the time limited for commencing the action. However, the time so limited cannot be extended more than 5 years by any such disability except minority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">\u00b614 Based on this statute, Alan contends that, assuming his ineffective assistance of counsel claim accrued at the earliest on July 23,1992<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (the date of sentencing), then the maximum time limitation on his action for postconviction relief would be ten years from that accrual, or July 23, 2002 (the five-year period of limitation plus the maximum five-year tolling period). Alan argues that this conclusion follows from the fact that postconviction proceedings are civil in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>nature. <em>See Coleman v. State </em>(1981), 194 Mont. 428, 433, 633 P.2d 624, 627, <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 983, 102 S.Ct. 1492, 71 L.Ed.2d 693 (1982) (holding that the Montana postconviction procedure is civil in nature and independent of the underlying criminal cause).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">\u00b615 The State disagrees, arguing that \u00a7 27-2-401(1), MCA (1991), has no application to postconviction proceedings. First, the State argues that this statute only applies to persons \u201centitled to bring an action mentioned in part 2.\u201d Part two sets forth the statute of limitations periods for certain actions including: actions upon judgments (\u00a7 27-2-201, MCA); actions based on contract or other obligations (\u00a7 27-2-202, MCA); actions for relief on grounds of fraud or mistake (\u00a7 27-2-203, MCA); tort actions for general and personal injury (\u00a7 27-2-204, MCA); actions for medical malpractice (\u00a7 27-2-205, MCA); actions for legal malpractice (\u00a7 27-2-206, MCA); actions for injuries involving property (\u00a7 27-2-207, MCA); actions for damages arising out of work on improvements to real property (\u00a7 27-2-208, MCA); actions against local government and local government officials (\u00a7 27-2-209, MCA); actions arising from the seizure or sale of property for taxes (\u00a7 27-2-210, MCA); actions to enforce a penalty or forfeiture or other statutory liability (\u00a7 27-2-211, MCA); actions arising from wrongful removal or exclusion from office (\u00a7 27-2-212, MCA); actions against banks (\u00a7 27-2-213, MCA); actions for mesne profits of real property (\u00a7 27-2-214, MCA); and tort actions for childhood sexual abuse (\u00a7 27-2-216, MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\u00b616 The State argues that there is no specific mention of postconviction relief in part two of Title 27, Chapter 2, and that while there is a catch-all statute of limitations of five years for all other actions not specifically mentioned in part two, postconviction relief cannot be one of those actions because it has its own statute of limitations codified at \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\u00b617  We have held that where the Legislature provides for a specific statute of limitations outside of Title 27, Chapter 2, Part 2, the statutory tolling provisions of \u00a7 27-2-401(1), MCA, do not apply. <em>See In re Estate of Allen </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 469, 472-73, 843 P.2d 781, 783-84 (holding that \u00a7 72-3-801, MCA, which requires that a claim against a decedent\u2019s estate must be filed within four months from day of first publication of notice to creditors constitutes a special statute of limitations as to decedents, with respect to which there is no extension under \u00a7 27-2-401, MCA, even for a person having a statutory \u201cdisability\u201d-in that case, incarceration at Montana State Prison).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">\u00b618 Moreover, we follow the rule that a particular legislative intent will control over a general one that is inconsistent with it. Section 1-2-102, MCA; <em>see also Weston v. Cole </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 61, 63, 758 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>289, 291 (holding that the shorter two-year period for filing a particular tort action such as assault and battery, \u00a7 27-2-204(3), MCA, controls over the more general three-year statute of limitations for tort actions in \u00a7 27-2-204(1), MCA); and <em>Schuff v. A.T. Klemens &amp; Son, </em>2000 MT 357, \u00b6 116, 303 Mont. 274, \u00b6 116, 16 P.3d 1002, \u00b6 116 (reciting and applying the general rules of statutory construction to include the rule that the specific governs the general).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">\u00b619  With respect to postconviction proceedings, the Legislature has set forth a specific statute of limitations at \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA. That section, in 1991, required that a petition for postconviction relief be filed within five years of the date of conviction. We hold that the specific statute of limitations for postconviction proceedings provided in Title 46, Chapter 21, controls over other statutes of limitations and the tolling provisions relating to those. Accordingly, we reject Alan\u2019s argument that, by reason of his incarceration, \u00a7 27-2-401(1), MCA (1991), tolled his time to file for postconviction relief. At the time he sought to file his petition for postconviction relief relating to his July 1992 conviction, Alan was time-barred from doing so. The District Court was correct as a matter of law in its decision to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b216-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, TRIEWEILER and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-8\"> In 1995, \u00a7 27-2-401(1), MCA, was amended to, among other things, delete the words \u201cor imprisoned on a criminal charge or under a sentence for a term less than for life.\u201d Sec. 1, Ch. 46, L.1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b214-9\"> The sentencing hearing was held on July 23,1992.
