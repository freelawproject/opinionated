The guardian ad litem also appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of a motion for emergency stay filed after entry of judgment. We affirm the judgment and order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">\u00b62 The following issues are raised on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">\u00b63 1. Are the District Court\u2019s findings of fact clearly erroneous?</p>\n<p id=\"b402-14\">\u00b64 2.

Did the District Court err when it denied the guardian ad litem\u2019s motion to set aside the judgment based on newly discovered evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b402-16\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b402-17\">\u00b66 During 1997, Stacey became heavily involved in the use of illegal drugs, particularly methamphetamine, and related criminal activity. Prior to October 1997, Stacey, who was born in 1966, had no criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>history. Stacey was convicted of three criminal offenses in San Diego County between 1998 and 1999. On June 1,1998, she was convicted of receiving stolen property. On January 7, 1999, she was convicted of petty theft. Sometime after January 1999, she was convicted of resisting an officer. Stacey\u2019s convictions were apparently linked to her drug use and resulted in a jail sentence and sentence to a treatment center. It was during this time that Stacey established a relationship with James, B.B.\u2019s natural father. He was Stacey\u2019s apparent drug supplier and a drug user himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">\u00b67 Stacey was involved with James for the two years prior to B.B.\u2019s birth. Stacey left California sometime before April 2, 1999, while on probation and in a chemical dependency treatment program, and while she was pregnant with B.B. She arrived in Yellowstone County by bus on approximately April 2, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u00b68 Upon her birth on April 30, 1999, B.B. tested positive for methamphetamine. Stacey concealed her identity during the birth of B.B., used an alias at the hospital, furnished incorrect information for B.B.\u2019s birth certificate, failed to furnish information about the father, and gave inaccurate information to hospital staff and social workers. B.B. was removed from Stacey\u2019s care at the hospital and placed into foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\u00b69 Stacey was taken to Rimrock Foundation for detoxification after her release from the hospital. Stacey then enrolled at Cedar Mountain Center, a treatment center in Cody, Wyoming. Stacey successfully completed a treatment program at Cedar Mountain which lasted for approximately thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">\u00b610 On May 5, 1999, DPHHS filed a petition for temporary investigative authority and protective services for B.B. The original show cause hearing took place on June 11, 1999, following which the order for protective services was maintained. Stacey met with the assigned social worker at the time of the hearing and stated her desire to go to a half-way house located near her grandmother in Des Moines, Iowa. She had been raised and educated in Iowa. The social worker suggested that she stay at the Women and Family Shelter in Billings, and asked that she call on June 14, 1999, to set up a visit with B.B. However, Stacey had no job or means of transportation. Furthermore, she had no family, friends, or support system in Billings. Given her circumstances, Stacey took a bus to Iowa on the weekend of June 11, 1999. Upon her departure, Stacey had been in Montana for approximately two months from arrival to departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">\u00b611 For a month and a half after arriving in Iowa, Stacey lived at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>half-way house, the Beacon of Life. Stacey was employed at the Comfort Inn. Stacey continued her aftercare program and attended parenting classes. In a letter dated July 8,1999, Stacey made the first of repeated requests for an interstate compact between Montana and Iowa to place B.B. in foster care in Iowa. DPHHS denied these requests throughout most of the proceedings, insistent that Stacey show progress on her treatment plan and fearful of the effect of B.B.\u2019s removal from her Montana foster home. DPHHS felt Stacey should move back to Montana and work through her treatment plans, repeatedly offering her one-way bus tickets.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">\u00b612 Stacey reunited with B.B. for the first time in December of 1999 when she returned for the temporary custody hearing. Because Stacey requested the case be moved to Iowa, and DPHHS insisted the case remain in Montana, Stacey did not see B.B. during the first seven months of her life. Stacey had an extensive visit with B.B. for a five-day period in January 2000. In February 2000, after learning that DPHHS intended to file a petition to terminate her parental rights, Stacey again visited B.B., this time for approximately three days.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\u00b613 On February 7, 2000, DPHHS filed its petition to permanently terminate Stacey\u2019s parental rights. Stacey agreed to return to Billings at the request of DPHHS to complete her treatment plan and to further develop her bond with B.B. Stacey moved back to Billings on March 11, 2000. Stacey stayed in Montana through May 22, 2000. During that time, Stacey maintained employment, first at the Rimview Inn, then at the Sheraton Hotel. Stacey had significant visitation with B.B., both at public places and at her home. When visitation was at its greatest frequency, Stacey was able to see B.B. for approximately thirty hours per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\u00b614 With the exception of missing one urinalysis test (which she contends was an oversight), Stacey also appeared to be in compliance with her treatment plan and participated in services offered by DPHHS. Stacey was evaluated by several specialists, including a social worker and a clinical psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">\u00b615 Eventually DPHHS received a report which alleged that B.B. was returned to her foster parents with \u201cpoopy\u201d diapers and a dirty face. There was evidence that at times during visits with B.B., Stacey would sleep and that B.B. was not properly fed. Finally, B.B.\u2019s foster parent reported to DPHHS that she saw an individual matching the description of James at Stacey\u2019s door. With that information, DPHHS decreased visitation to approximately three hours per week and only in the presence of someone from DPHHS. Stacey then decided to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>return to Iowa.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">\u00b616 The District Court held hearings to consider DPHHS\u2019 petition for parts of six days: June 28, August 1, August 2, September 5, September 6, and October 2, 2000. On October 31, 2000, the District Court made its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and dismissed DPHHS\u2019 petition. Furthermore, it ordered B.B. be returned to the care of Stacey within a period of thirty days. The District Court found that, with the exception of her outstanding criminal issues in California, Stacey had substantially complied with her treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">\u00b617 After the notice of entry of judgment was served on the parties on November 8, 2000, DPHHS and the guardian ad litem filed a joint notice of appeal on November 14, 2000. The parties also filed separate motions to stay judgment and the guardian ad litem moved to set aside the judgment based on newly discovered evidence. The District Court denied both motions on December 4,2000. The guardian ad litem filed a separate notice of appeal from the post-judgment order on December 15, 2000. On December 19, 2000, DPHHS withdrew its appeal of the October 31, 2000, judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">\u00b618 In termination of parental rights cases, we review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re J.M.J., </em>1999 MT 277, \u00b6 15, 296 Mont. 510, \u00b6 15, 989 P.2d 840, \u00b6 15. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or a review of the record leaves us with the definite and firm conviction that the court made a mistake. \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">\u00b619 We review a district court\u2019s limitations on cross-examination for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Gallagher </em>(1978), 177 Mont. 150, 159, 580 P.2d 930, 935.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">\u00b620 The denial of a post-judgment motion for an emergency stay is within the district court\u2019s discretion and, therefore, will also be reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Sourdough Protective Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs of Gallatin County </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 325, 327, 833 P.2d 207, 208. The test for abuse of discretion is whether the district court acted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>J.M.J., </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Atg\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">\u00b621 Are the District Court\u2019s findings of fact clearly erroneous?</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\u00b622 The District Court in this case made extensive findings of fact and Appellant claims that several were clearly erroneous. Specifically, Appellant contends that the District Court either made findings without sufficient evidence or misapprehended the effect of the evidence. Appellant contests Findings 18, 10, 15, 16, and 17. We will address each finding in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\u00b623 In Finding No. 18, Appellant asserts that the District Court misapprehended the effect of the evidence when it found that the evidence <em>suggested </em>Stacey had a personality disorder, as opposed to a finding that Stacey in fact had a personality disorder. Finding No. 18 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">Psychologist Ned Tranel conducted a psychological evaluation of Stacey on May 9, 2000. Mr. Tranel had no written report of his findings. In his testimony, he indicated that Stacey\u2019s profile suggested a borderline personality disorder. The Court was unclear concerning whether that was an actual diagnosis or just a suggestion of a condition which he found.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">The District Court\u2019s finding reflects Dr. Tranel\u2019s testimony at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">Q: Did you find any evidence of any sort of personality disorders? A: Yes, the profile <em>suggests </em>a borderline personality disorder. The hallmark of that is a fear of abandonment, a panic like response to the possibility of being left alone, and that leaves her quite vulnerable to forming relationships without proper scrutiny and without proper assessment of the risks involved. So she\u2019s still handicapped by that fear of being abandoned and left alone. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">Dr. Tranel\u2019s testimony about the personality disorder was exactly as characterized in the District Court\u2019s findings. Therefore, we conclude that finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">\u00b624 Appellant similarly contends that the District Court erred in Finding No. 18 when it found that Dr. Tranel\u2019s recommendation to terminate Stacey\u2019s parental rights was based primarily on bonding issues. The court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-12\">Much of Mr. Tranel\u2019s testimony related to bonding issues between B.B. and the foster parents and his opinion concerning bonding issues between B.B. and Stacey. Mr. Tranel did not observe Stacey with the child although the reason that did not occur may have been because Stacey left Billings in May of 2000 before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>observation could be made.... <em>Primarily </em>based on bonding issues, Mr. Tranel has recommended that the child not be returned to Stacey. This evidence is not persuasive. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ae3\">Following Dr. Tranel\u2019s discussion of his psychological evaluation of Stacey, the remainder of his testimony during direct examination centered on bonding issues. Among the topics of discussion were B.B.\u2019s bond to her foster parents, the importance and development of bonds, and the potential transferability of bonds from B.B.\u2019s foster parents to Stacey. The extent of the bonding testimony was sufficient to support the District Court\u2019s finding. Furthermore, the Court\u2019s finding was that Dr. Tranel\u2019s recommendation was <em>primarily </em>based on bonding issues, not <em>exclusively </em>based on bonding issues. We agree that other issues cited by Appellant, such as Stacey\u2019s evaluation, her level of sobriety and associated denial and minimization, and her ability to change, may have been influential. But the record contains substantial evidence for a finding that Dr. Tranel\u2019s recommendation was primarily based on bonding issues and we conclude that the finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\u00b625 Appellant next contests the District Court\u2019s finding that the proceedings should have been transferred to Iowa. Finding No. 10 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">[I]t would be logical that Stacey be in Iowa where she had spent much of her life, where her family members and friends lived, where she had attended college, where she spent her early years of married life and where she had an apparent better ability to earn income than in Montana.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Stacey testified that she wanted to go back to Iowa because that is where she had family, a support network, and the best chance to beat her addiction. She referred to Iowa as \u201chome.\u201d She had the following to say about moving back to Iowa after treatment in Billings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">Q: And why did you want to go back to Iowa?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">A: Because I didn\u2019t know what to do and I didn\u2019t know where I was going to stay and I didn\u2019t know where I was going to live and I had no money and I hadn\u2019t had no one to help me and I didn\u2019t know what else to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">Q: What do you think would have happened to you if you\u2019d stayed in Billings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-10\">A: I have no idea. Would have had to stay at the mission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-11\">Q: Were you afraid of relapsing at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-12\">A: Well, I had no support system there. I mean if anybody\u2019s ever stayed at the mission, that place is the dumpiest place in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>world and all kinds of scary people are around there and I wasn\u2019t getting support from anybody. I didn\u2019t know what to do and that\u2019s why I asked my grandma to send me home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\">Q: When you went back to Iowa, what were you thinking about as far as contact with [B.B.]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">A: Well, I was hoping that I could get the case transferred to Iowa, now that I had moved back to Iowa, and that maybe they could set her up in foster care in Iowa while I completed my - whatever they wanted me to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">We conclude that the District Court had substantial evidence to support Finding No. 10 and that the finding is not clearly erroneous. \u00b626 Next, Appellant contends that the District Court misapprehended the effect of evidence in Finding No. 16 where it found that at the time of trial, B.B. had bonded better with her foster parents than with Stacey. It appears that Appellant would have preferred a finding focusing on the lack of bonding between Stacey and B.B., rather than a finding that B.B. had bonded better with her foster parents. However, the difference is semantic and unimportant to the outcome at any rate. The District Court concluded Finding No. 16 by stating that its finding that B.B. had bonded better with her foster parents was not determinative in its conclusion. Therefore, we move to the next contested finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">\u00b627 The guardian ad litem challenges that part of Finding No. 15 where the court found that \u201cthere is no evidence that Stacey wanted to do anything except keep James out of her life.\u201d While there was conflicting circumstantial evidence, there was no direct evidence in the record that James and Stacey had ongoing communications. Appellant\u2019s contentions that ongoing communications between James and Stacey could be presumed because Stacey did not obtain a restraining order against James and because Stacey had maintained contact with James\u2019 brother prior to James coming to Billings are speculative and not based on direct evidence. Stacey testified that she wanted nothing to do with James, assuming his lifestyle was as it had been in California. She testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">Q: Well, if you had taken B.B. home from the hospital and raised her, would you have allowed him [James] to see her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">A: It depends on what he would have done. I mean -1 mean if he would continue in the same lifestyle as he was doing when I was in California, hell no. That\u2019s why I left. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>equivocal at best:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Another contention that James was sighted by the foster mother at Stacey\u2019s door was based on the following testimony which was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Q: So for all you know, that might not have been James?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">A: For all I know it might not have been. For all I know it might have been.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Therefore, we conclude that Finding No. 15 is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"Auc\">\u00b628 Appellant contests several portions of Finding No. 17, which addresses Stacey\u2019s compliance with, and the success of, her treatment plan. After reviewing the guardian ad litem\u2019s brief, it appears he is contesting several subsections of the finding, as well as the overall finding that Stacey had substantially complied with her treatment plan. We will discuss the subsections first, followed by the overall finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">\u00b629 Subsection (b) discusses Stacey\u2019s treatment plan goal to increase her parenting abilities. Appellant contends that the District Court\u2019s finding that there was no pattern of behavior that indicated Stacey was an inappropriate caretaker was clearly erroneous. In subsection (b), the District Court recited several \u201cisolated instances\u201d of poor parenting decisions, including sending B.B. back to the foster mother with dirty diapers, returning B.B. in an unclean condition, and sleeping during visitation. However, the District Court found that such isolated instances did not equate to a pattern of poor parenting. We agree. Without a more extensive pattern, the record supports the District Court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">\u00b630 Appellant also contests the finding in subsection (b) that Stacey\u2019s parenting abilities are adequate when she is not using illegal drugs, based on his contention that Stacey had a borderline personality disorder. However, because of our previous determination that the District Court did not err when it found that a personality disorder was merely <em>suggested, </em>Appellant\u2019s argument is without merit. Furthermore, the record indicates that Stacey was an effective parent of her two older children prior to her increased drug use in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">\u00b631 Subsection (c) of Finding No. 17 discusses Stacey\u2019s treatment plan goal to provide a safe and healthy environment for B.B. The District Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-10\">One of the tasks that the Department has requested in the treatment plan of Stacey related to the providing of an appropriate environment for children was for Stacey to address her legal issues. The Department has requested that Stacey return to California to address those problems. Stacey has an attorney in California with the Public Defender\u2019s Office. Stacey testified that she believes through that attorney that those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>proceedings will be resolved appropriately in a manner not requiring incarceration when she furnishes proof of her chemical dependency treatment and aftercare. The matter has not yet been resolved. California apparently does not intend to extradite Stacey to California. This is the one area of the treatment plan where there has not been compliance but is not itself a basis to terminate parental rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Appellant accuses the District Court of minimizing or overlooking the fact that Stacey failed to complete a portion of her treatment plan. We disagree. The District Court did not \u201coverlook\u201d the outstanding criminal issues, but acknowledged them, was assured they were being addressed, and looked at the criminal issues as but one aspect of a comprehensive treatment plan toward which Stacey had made successful progress in a reasonable period of time. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s Finding No. 17 was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u00b632  As a final matter, Appellant contends that the District Court erroneously found that Stacey substantially complied with her treatment plan. However, the District Court was thorough in its analysis, made findings pertaining to each goal within the treatment plan, and summarized the completion of the treatment plan based upon those findings. It stated up front that Stacey had not accomplished all of the treatment plan tasks. Nevertheless, the Court was satisfied that Stacey had substantially complied with the plan as a whole, that the plan was successful, and that she could provide adequate care for B.B. In substantiating its determination, the District Court contrasted Stacey\u2019s life at the time of B.B.\u2019s birth with her life at present. It found that much of DPHHS\u2019 concerns related to Stacey\u2019s use of aliases, her association with inappropriate individuals, her ability to be an appropriate caretaker, and her drug use, and that those matters had been addressed. At the time of trial, Stacey was employed, lived in a healthy home environment, had participated in parenting classes and aftercare, and had proved to be drug-free since B.B.\u2019s birth. While the Court recognized that bonding issues remain, the Court attributed the lack of bonding to date to Stacey\u2019s presence in Iowa while B.B. was in Montana, rather than an inability to bond. We conclude that the District Court\u2019s finding that Stacey has substantially complied with her treatment plan is based on substantial evidence and is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">\u00b633 Did the District Court err when it sustained an objection to Dr. Veraldi\u2019s testimony about the effects of a personality disorder on parenting?</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u00b634 Appellant contends that Dr. Veraldi should have been allowed to testify about the effects of a personality disorder on parenting, based on the fact that Stacey\u2019s counsel opened the door to such testimony. Because Dr. Veraldi was asked about opinions that could be made based on her evaluation, and Dr. Veraldi\u2019s response that she would talk about personality and cognitive features and limitations, Appellant contends it should have been allowed on cross-examination to inquire into the effects of a personality disorder on parenting. The District Court sustained Respondent\u2019s objection to such an inquiry as beyond the scope of direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\u00b635  The latitude of cross examination is at the discretion of the trial court, and this Court will not interfere unless there is an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Gallagher </em>(1978), 177 Mont. 150, 159, 580 P.2d 930,935. We conclude there was no abuse of discretion here. Following the objection by Stacey\u2019s counsel, the Court asked Dr. Veraldi:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">Q: Do you have any diagnosis of her [Stacey] with borderline personality disorder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">A: I don\u2019t from my own data.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Upon hearing that counsel was to discuss how a borderline personality disorder affects parenting, the Court explained its ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-10\">Well, I guess what bothers me, that is outside the scope of his direct. His direct is related to this one incident here [a two hour observation of the interaction between Stacey and B.B.]. Are you calling her as a witness now to bolster - I\u2019ll sustain the objection. I\u2019m going to do it on the basis it exceeds the scope of the direct examination. It has nothing to do with this report [Dr. Veraldi\u2019s evaluation summary].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">Because Dr. Veraldi\u2019s direct examination centered on her observation of Stacey with B.B., and Dr. Veraldi had not diagnosed Stacey with a borderline personality disorder, the District Court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">\u00b636 Did the District Court err when it denied the guardian ad litem\u2019s motion to set aside the judgment based on newly discovered evidence? \u00b637 On November 29, 2000, the guardian ad litem filed a motion for an emergency stay and requested a hearing based on newly discovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>evidence. With the motion, the guardian ad litem attached eight affidavits with information it alleges was discovered after DPHHS filed its notice of appeal. The basis for the guardian ad litem\u2019s motion is unclear. The motion could be construed as a Rule 59, M.R.Civ.P., motion for a new trial, or a Rule 60(b)(2), M.R.Civ.P., motion to set aside the judgment based on newly discovered evidence. However, as the District Court correctly found, if the motion was filed pursuant to Rule 59, M.R.Civ.P., it was late. The motion was filed on November 29, 2000, when the ten-day deadline for filing a motion for a new trial would have required the motion to be filed before November 27, 2000. Therefore, we will review the guardian\u2019s motion as a Rule 60(b)(2), M.R.Civ.P., motion to set aside the judgment based on newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">\u00b638 Rule 60(b)(2), M.R.Civ.P., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a party\u2019s legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">(2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\u00b639 The standard of review for a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P., motion depends on the issues involved. When the district court engages in a discretionary appraisal or weighing of the facts to dispose of the motion, we determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Estate of Nielsen v. Pardis </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 470, 475, 878 P.2d 234, 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">\u00b640  Newly discovered evidence may constitute grounds for judgment relief if the following conditions are met: (1) the alleged newly discovered evidence came to the moving party after trial; (2) it was not a want of due diligence which precluded its earlier discovery; (3) the materiality of the new evidence is so great that it would probably produce a different result on retrial; and (4) the new evidence is not merely cumulative, not tending only to impeach or discredit witnesses in the case. <em>Fjelstad v. State, Through Dep\u2019t of Highways </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 211, 220-21, 883 P.2d 106, 111-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">\u00b641 The guardian ad litem presented the newly discovered evidence through affidavits. The affidavits contend, among other things, that Stacey: (1) left her apartment in poor condition with empty beer cans; (2) was evicted; (3) was fired twice from her employment; (4) was seen driving a stolen vehicle; and (5) had continued ongoing communication with James. The District Court found it \u201cextremely unlikely that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>alleged newly discovered evidence ... could not with reasonable diligence have been discovered and produced at the time of trial.\u201d The District Court explained its denial of the guardian ad litem\u2019s motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag6\">This trial was one of the hardest fought and most lengthy trials in this Court\u2019s experience involving a petition to terminate parental rights. The Department and Guardian Ad Litem seemed to leave no stone unturned concerning evidence elicited in an attempt to paint the natural mother as a bad person. It is interesting to the Court that some of this allegedly newly discovered evidence is claimed to have been discovered after the October 31, 2000, order. One would have thought, as hard fought as this case was, that incidents which occurred in or prior to early June would have been presented in Court during the course of this trial which consumed part of six days beginning June 28, 2000, and ending October 2, 2000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">\u00b642 The District Court was neither satisfied that the alleged newly discovered material was discovered after trial, nor that the moving party could not have discovered the information earlier by exercising due diligence. The affidavit of Frannie Fowler, the property manager of Stacey\u2019s apartment building, is a case in point. In discussing whether Stacey was evicted from her apartment, the affidavit referenced events which occurred between May 24 and June 12, 2000. Such information could have been presented prior to the conclusion of the final hearing, which ended on October 2,2000. Furthermore, many of the individuals who provided affidavits, including Donna Veraldi, Janis Langohr, Ned Tranel, and Rim Vopel, the foster mother, testified at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u00b643  The District Court considered the weight of the affidavit information and did not act arbitrarily. Accordingly, the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the guardian ad litem\u2019s motion to set aside the judgment based on newly discovered evidence. \u00b644 The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b413-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, RICE and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
