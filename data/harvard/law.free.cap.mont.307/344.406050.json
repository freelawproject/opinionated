The following issue is dispositive of Schimmel\u2019s appeal: whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred when it determined that Schimmel\u2019s employer, Jasper Express, Inc., was not required to provide Schimmel with workers\u2019 compensation coverage. We reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">\u00b62 Arthur Schimmel was injured on November 18, 1998, while loading posts onto a trailer in Missoula County, Montana. At the time of the accident, Schimmel was employed by Jasper Express as a long-haul truck driver and resided in Trout Creek, Montana. Jasper Express operates a long-haul trucking business and is incorporated and maintains its place of business in the State of Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\u00b63 Jasper Express did not have Schimmel covered under a Montana workers\u2019 compensation insurance plan. Schimmel filed a claim for benefits with the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund (\u201cFund\u201d) which denied his claim. Schimmel then filed a petition for benefits against Jasper Express and the Fund in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court seeking a determination that Jasper Express should have provided him with workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage. Jasper Express moved to dismiss, arguing, among other things, that Schimmel was not an employee pursuant to the Act because his employment duties were neither primarily carried out in Montana nor controlled within Montana. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court denied Jasper Express\u2019s motion to dismiss. The court observed that the evidence did not \u201cestablish whether claimant spent more time in any state other than Montana, only that he drove less that 50% of his total miles in Montana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\u00b64 Trial was held on April 10, 2000. On June 28, 2000, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Judgment. The court concluded that Jasper Express was not required to maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage for Schimmel because Schimmel was not an \u201cemployee\u201d as defined by the Act. Correspondingly, the court also held that the Uninsured Employers Fund was not liable for Schimmel\u2019s claim. Schimmel appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">\u00b65 We review the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are supported by substantial credible evidence. <em>Matthews v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>1999 MT 225, \u00b6 5, 296 Mont. 76, \u00b6 5, 985 P.2d 741, \u00b6 5. We review the Workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Compensation Court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Matthews, </em>\u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u00b66 Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred when it determined that Jasper Express was not required to provide Schimmel with workers\u2019 compensation coverage?</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\u00b67 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court concluded that Jasper Express was not required to insure Schimmel because Schimmel was not an \u201cemployee\u201d as defined by \u00a7 39-71-118, MCA. In so deciding, the court relied on \u00a7 39-71-118(10)(a), MCA, which provides that an \u201cemployee or worker in this state\u201d is defined as \u201ca resident of Montana who is employed by an employer and whose employment duties are primarily carried out or controlled within this state.\u201d The court found that Schimmel was not an \u201cemployee\u201d for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation coverage because his employment duties were neither primarily carried nor controlled within Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">\u00b68 We conclude the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred when it relied on \u00a7 39-71-118(10)(a), MCA, to exclude Schimmel from the statutory definition of \u201cemployee.\u201d Section 39-71-401(1), MCA,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides that \u201cthe Workers\u2019 Compensation Act applies to all employers, as defined in 39-71-117, and to all <em>employees, </em>as defined in 39-71-118.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 39-71-118(l)(a), MCA, provides in relevant part that the term \u201cemployee\u201d means \u201ceach person in this state, including a contractor other than an independent contractor, who is in the service of an employer, as defined by 39-71-117, under any appointment or contract of hire, express or implied, oral or written.\u201d The court needed go no further; Schimmel\u2019s status should have been determined with regard to this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">\u00b69 The provision relied upon by the court to exclude Schimmel from the definition of \u201cemployee,\u201d \u00a7 39-71-118(10)(a), MCA, does not purport to define \u201cemployee,\u201d but rather expressly defines the phrase \u201c\u2019employee or worker in this state.\u201d It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-9\">For purposes of this section, an \u201cemployee or worker in this state\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-10\">(a) a resident of Montana who is employed by an employer and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>whose employment duties are primarily carried out or controlled within this state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-3\">Given the quotations surrounding the phrase \u201cemployer or worker in this state,\u201d we can only conclude that subsection 10 means exactly what it says, defining the phrase \u201cemployee or worker in this state\u201d where that phrase occurs in \u00a7 39-71-118, MCA. Turning our attention to the other provisions of \u00a7 39-71-118, MCA, we find that this very same phrase is used in subsection 8, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-4\">(8) Except as provided in chapter 8 of this title, <em>an employee or worker in this state </em>whose services are furnished by a person, association, contractor, firm, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, or corporation, other than a temporary service contractor, to an employer, as defined in 39-71-117, is presumed to be under the control and employment of the employer. This presumption may be rebutted as provided in 39-71-117(3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">(Emphasis added.) Subsections 8 and 10 clearly must be read together. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that both subsections 8 and 10 were enacted together as part of Senate Bill 383. Subsections 8 and 10, in conjunction with \u00a7 39-71-117(3), MCA, serve to identify the employer responsible for workers\u2019 compensation coverage in those situations when an employee is furnished by one business to another. See \u00a7 39-71-118(8), MCA, (provides that an employer or worker in this state whose services are provided by an entity to an \u201cemployer\u201d is presumed to be under the employment of the employer). <em>See </em>\u00a7 39-71-118(8), MCA (providing that an employee or worker in this state whose services are provided by one entity to another entity which fits the statutory definition of \u201cemployer\u201d is presumed to be under the employment of the \u201cemployer\u201d). Schimmel was not furnished to Jasper Express by another business. Therefore, we conclude that subsection 10 is not relevant to a determination of whether Schimmel was an \u201cemployee.\u201d Schimmel\u2019s status must be determined pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-118(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\u00b610  As the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court correctly determined, there must be both a covered employee and a covered employer before the provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act apply. <em>See </em>\u00a7 39-71-401(1), MCA. A motor carrier \u201cdoing business in this state who uses drivers in this state is considered the employer [and] is liable for workers\u2019 compensation premiums.\u201d Section 39-71-117(4), MCA. Both Jasper Express and the Fund urge us to conclude that this provision was only meant to apply to Montana-based motor carriers. We decline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>to do so. Although the legislature could have easily done so, the statute is not limited on its face to Montana-based motor carriers. Rather, it refers to a motor carrier \u201cdoing business in this state who uses drivers in this state.\u201d It certainly takes no stretch of the statutory language to fit it around Jasper Express. Jasper Express used a Montana resident driver to pick up and drop off numerous loads in Montana. Nothing more is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\u00b611 We note that, as urged by all the parties, we have plumbed the depths of legislative history with regard to \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-117 and -118, MCA. However, our search has borne no fruit. If the legislature had different intentions than those we have discerned above, we are at a loss to determine exactly what those intentions were.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\u00b612 Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b370-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON, TRIEWEILER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-11\">Because Schimmel\u2019s accident occurred in 1998, the 1997 version of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act applies. <em>See Buckman v. Montana Deaconess Hosp. </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 318, 321, 730 P.2d 380, 382. Therefore, all statutory references will be to the 1997 version of the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
