Giddings, </em>2001 MT 76, 305 Mont. 74, 29 P.3d 475, because she did not receive a probable cause hearing within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>36 hours of her arrest under a bench warrant for probation revocation. The State of Montana has conceded that Vance is entitled to the benefit of our <em>Giddings </em>decision, and indicates it intends to proceed in accordance with \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA (2001), by filing a petition for revocation of deferred sentence and obtaining a bench warrant. Vance argues, however, that a petition for revocation of a deferred sentence must be filed during the period of the deferred sentence, under \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA. Since her deferred sentence expired in April 2001, she argues that the refiling of a petition for revocation of an expired sentence is prohibited under the law. On November 20, 2001, we directed the State to file a response to Vance\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u00b62 The State has responded, claiming it may proceed anew with revocation proceedings under \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA (2001), even though Vance has discharged her original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\u00b63 There is no dispute that the probation violation occurred in October of 1999, nor does the State dispute the fact that Vance\u2019s original sentence expired in April 2001. However, the State relies on <em>State v. Goebel, </em>2001 MT 155, \u00b6 30, 306 Mont. 83, \u00b6 30, 31 P.3d 340, \u00b6 30, where we held that due to the jurisdictional defect in the proceedings, all subsequent proceedings in the district court were void <em>ab initio, </em>and the parties are therefore returned to the same position \u201cas if no District Court proceedings had occurred.\u201d Id., \u00b6 30 (citation omitted). The State infers from this holding that the original sentence is tolled during the period of the void proceedings, for purposes of refiling a petition to revoke. The State cites \u00b6 32 of <em>State v. Goebel, supra, </em>where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">While Giddings, and others who are similarly situated, were not afforded a hearing pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA (1999), and thus the District Court lacked jurisdiction to hold a revocation hearing in their cases, the State may now refile the petition to revoke their probation pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA (2001), as long as those probationers were still \u201cunder the custody or supervision of the department of corrections\u201d on May 1, 2001.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abq\">The State argues that since Vance was under the custody or supervision of the Department of Corrections on May 1, 2001, pursuant to the void judgment of June 8,2000, the State is entitled to refile, irrespective of the fact that the original sentence expired in April, 2001. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\u00b64  The fact that the previous revocation proceedings were defective and therefore void <em>ab initio </em>does not mean that time stood still during the period of defective proceedings. Time passed, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Vance\u2019s original sentence expired. Moreover, the provisions of \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA, are not suspended by virtue of our decision in <em>Giddings and Goebel, supra. </em>Section 46-18-203(2), MCA, clearly states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-4\">The petition for a revocation must be filed with the sentencing court during the period of suspension or deferral</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFq\">\u00b65  There is no provision in the law allowing the State to refile a petition for revocation of suspended or deferred sentence to \u201crelate back to the date of the probation violation\u201d as the State urges. Although we have held in <em>Giddings </em>and <em>Goebel </em>that the State may refile a petition to revoke a suspended or deferred sentence, such refiling is conditional upon the petition being filed during the period of suspension or deferral of sentence, as \u00a7 46-18-203(2), MCA, requires. Once the term of the sentence expires, the State has no more power to refile a petition to revoke that suspended or deferred sentence than it would have to file an original proceeding to revoke under those circumstances. Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Stana Jean Vance\u2019s Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus is GRANTED. The State of Montana is directed to release Vance from custody with respect to the captioned cause number within 48 hours of the date of this Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk of this Court is directed to serve notice of this Order by mail to Stana Jean Vance at her last known address and upon the respondents\u2019 attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">DATED this 5th day of December, 2001.</p>\n<judges id=\"b95-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, TRIEWEILER, REGNIER, NELSON, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
