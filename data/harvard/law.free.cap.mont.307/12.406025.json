The following issue is dispositive of this appeal: Did the District Court commit reversible error when it admitted Derrick Steilman\u2019s out of court statements? We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b35-13\">\u00b62 On October 2, 1998, the State charged Steven Francis with deliberate homicide in violation of \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(a), MCA. Francis pled not guilty. The day before Francis was charged, Detectives Douglas Conway and Jack Best interviewed Derrick Steilman. During the interview, Steilman informed them that he and Francis had murdered Paul Bischke to prove their worth to each other in conducting other criminal activity. Steilman was offered a plea agreement and his interview was videotaped.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-14\">\u00b63 A trial by jury was held on June 15-17, 1999. The State called Steilman as a witness, but he refused to answer any questions on the ground that he might incriminate himself. The State then sought the admission of out of court statements made by Steilman, including his videotaped interview with the police. The court admitted Steilman\u2019s statements. The jury found Francis guilty of deliberate homicide. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>District Court sentenced Francis to the Montana State Prison for a term of 100 years and further ordered that Francis would be ineligible for parole or participation in the supervised release program. Francis appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\u00b64 We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Weitzel, </em>2000 MT 86, \u00b6 24, 299 Mont. 192, \u00b6 24,998 P.2d 1154, \u00b6 24. Francis asserts that we should review the admission of Steilman\u2019s out of court statements <em>de novo </em>because the District Court \u201cfailed to put any explanation on the record for its ruling.\u201d We decline to do so. The State offered arguments on the admissibility of Steilman\u2019s statements. Francis\u2019 attorney countered the State\u2019s arguments. The court accepted the State\u2019s argument. We see no reason to use a different standard of review under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">\u00b65 Did the District Court commit reversible error when it admitted Steilman\u2019s out of court statements?</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">\u00b66 The State called Derrick Steilman as a witness in Francis\u2019 trial. Steilman, however, refused to answer any questions on the ground that he might incriminate himself. The District Court excused Steilman. The State then sought the admission of out of court statements made by Steilman, including Steilman\u2019s videotaped statement to Detectives Conway and Best.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">\u00b67 Counsel for Francis responded that Steilman\u2019s out of court statements were inadmissible hearsay and their admission would violate Francis\u2019 constitutional right of confrontation. The State noted that it had provided the court with a copy of a \u201cPoint Brief\u2019 in support of the admission of Steilman\u2019s out of court statements. Apparently, the Point Brief had been presented to the court before trial, but the State did not file a copy of the brief with the clerk of court nor did it provide defense counsel with a copy of the brief until defense counsel objected to the admission of Steilman\u2019s out of court statements at trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The State orally argued that Steilman\u2019s statements to \u201clay witnesses\u201d (i.e., statements made to people other than the police) were admissible as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>statements of a co-conspirator made in furtherance of a conspiracy. Steilman\u2019s statements to Detectives Best and Conway, according to the State, were admissible because they were admissions against his penal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">\u00b68 The District Court admitted Steilman\u2019s out of court statements but refused to admit the videotape of Steilman\u2019s interview with Detectives Conway and Best and refused to admit a transcript of that interview. However, the videotape of Steilman\u2019s confession was subsequently shown to the jury pursuant to a motion by defense counsel who stated that, pursuant to the court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of Steilman\u2019s out of court statements, the defense wanted the jury to have an opportunity to observe Mr. Steilman.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\u00b69 A. Did the District Court err when it admitted Steilman\u2019s out of court statements to Shannon Dinius?</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\u00b610 After the District Court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of Steilman\u2019s out of court statements, the State called Steilman\u2019s former girlfriend Shannon Dinius to testify. Dinius testified that within a week of Bischke\u2019s murder, she and Steilman were driving past the scene of the murder and Steilman pointed to it and told her that he and Francis had killed Bischke. Steilman told her that they had masks and weapons and that Francis had struck Bischke first. On cross-examination, Dinius testified that Steilman and Francis did it to \u201cprove themselves to each other, have some kind of like a blood bond-type thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\u00b611  As noted above, the State orally argued to the District Court that Steilman\u2019s statements to \u201clay witnesses\u201d were admissible as statements of a co-conspirator made in furtherance of a conspiracy. The State also maintained in its Point Brief that Steilman\u2019s statements to Dinius were admissible as statements against penal interest. On appeal, however, the State concedes that Steilman\u2019s statements, to the extent they consisted mainly of blaming Francis, were not admissible. <em>See State v. Castle </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 363, 372, 948 P.2d 688, 693 (stating that a declarant\u2019s collateral non-inculpatory statements are neither credible nor admissible, particularly when they implicate another person). Furthermore, the State admits the inadequacy of its argument that Francis\u2019 statements were admissible as those of a co-conspirator. Co-conspirators\u2019 statements made after attainment of the conspiracy\u2019s object are not admissible unless the movant can prove an express agreement existed among the co-conspirators to continue to act in concert to cover up the crime after its commission. <em>See Gr\u00fcnewald v. United States </em>(1957), 353 U.S. 391, 396-97, 77 S. Ct. 963, 969-70, 1 L. Ed. 2d 931. The State offers no such proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>\u00b612 Instead, the State insists that we should affirm the District Court\u2019s admission of Dinius\u2019 testimony because the court reached the right result even though it employed the wrong reasons. The State contends, for the first time on appeal, that Dinius\u2019 testimony was admissible pursuant to Rule 801(d)(2)(A), M.R.Evid. as testimony regarding out of court statements made by Francis. An \u201cadmission by party-opponent,\u201d under Rule 801(d)(2)(A) is a statement that is \u201cthe party s own statement\u201d offered against the party. <em>State v. Smith </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 434, 441, 916 P.2d 773, 777. Our function is confined to determining whether there is substantial credible evidence to support the court\u2019s findings. <em>Lacey v. Herndon </em>(1983), 205 Mont. 379, 387, 668 P.2d 251, 255. Unfortunately, because the State did not assert Rule 801(d)(2)(A) to the District Court as a reason to admit Dinius\u2019 testimony, there is insufficient evidence on the record for us to ascertain whether Dinius\u2019 testimony was admissible as an admission by a party-opponent made by Francis.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">\u00b613 At trial, Dinius first denied talking to Francis about the murder. Later, during cross-examination, Dinius testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Did you ever discuss anything regarding the 1996 homicide with Steve Francis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">DINIUS: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: And -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-8\">DINIUS: You mean like since then or then when it happened? Because when it had happened, they both had told me. He agreed right along with Derrick. Derrick would tell me, and Steve sat there and agreed with the whole thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-9\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: And where was this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-10\">DINIUS: In the Bronco.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-11\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: You testified that you were alone in the Bronco with Mr. Steilman, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-12\">DINIUS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-13\">Defense counsel then proceeded to a different line of questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-14\">\u00b614 Since the State never raised Rule 801(d)(2)(A) before the District Court, the court never reconciled the conflicts in Dinius\u2019 testimony concerning whether Francis confessed to Dinius or if he was present when Steilman did so. The court also made no findings concerning statements made by Francis. This record provides an inadequate basis for us to ascertain whether the District Court properly accepted Dinius\u2019 testimony under Rule 801(d)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-15\">\u00b615 Alternatively, the State argues that, pursuant to Rule 801(d)(2)(B), M.R.Evid., Dinius\u2019 testimony was admissible as testimony concerning out of court statements made by Steilman and adopted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Francis. Rule 801(d)(2)(B) provides that \u201c[a] statement is not hearsay if... [t]he statement is offered against a party and is ... a statement of which the party has manifested an adoption or belief in its truth\u201d. <em>See </em>Rule 801(d)(2)(B), M.R.Evid.; <em>see also State v. Widenhofer </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 341, 349, 950 P.2d 1383,1388. There are two reasons that the State\u2019s reliance on Rule 801(d)(2)(B), M.R.Evid., is misguided. First, the District Court failed to make an express determination that Francis adopted Steilman\u2019s statements as required. <em>See Widenhofer, </em>286 Mont. at 349, 950 P.2d at 1388 (citing <em>United States v. </em>Schaff (9th Cir. 1991), 948 F.2d 501, 505). Second, the State has not presented sufficient evidence to show that Francis adopted Steilman\u2019s statements. It is, at best, unclear whether Francis was even in the car at the time Steilman made the alleged statements. Given that the District Court made no findings on this matter, we cannot conclude that the court properly admitted Dinius\u2019 testimony as statements made by Steilman and then adopted by Francis.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">\u00b616 We will affirm a district court\u2019s decision when it reaches the correct result for the wrong reasons. <em>See State v. Veis, </em>1998 MT 162, \u00b616,289 Mont. 450, \u00b616,962 P.2d 1153, \u00b616. In this case, however, the record is insufficiently developed for us to entertain the State\u2019s new rationale. Therefore, we must conclude that the District Court erred in admitting Dinius\u2019 testimony regarding Steilman\u2019s out of court statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">\u00b617 B. Did the District Court err when it admitted Steilman\u2019s out of court statements to Detective Conway?</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\u00b618 After noting defense counsel\u2019s continuing objection to the admission of Steilman\u2019s out of court statements, the court allowed Detective Conway to testify about an interview he conducted with Steilman. Detective Conway testified that he conducted an interview of Steilman on October 1, 1998. According to Detective Conway, Steilman stated that he and Francis killed Bischke in order to prove their worth to each other to conduct other criminal activity. Steilman stated that he was armed with a wooden dowel and Francis was armed with an octagon-shaped crowbar. Steilman claimed that Francis inflicted the blows to Bischke.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">\u00b619 On the next day of testimony, Francis\u2019 attorney moved to admit the videotape of Steilman\u2019s confession. Defense counsel stated that pursuant to the court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of Steilman\u2019s out-of-court statements, the defense wanted the jury to have an opportunity to observe Mr. Steilman. Defense counsel also requested that the court note its continuing obj ection to the admission of Steilman\u2019s out of court statements. The videotape was played for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>\u00b620 As noted above, the State argued that Steilman\u2019s statements to Detectives Best and Conway were admissible because they were admissions against his penal interest. The State properly concedes on appeal that Steilman\u2019s confession was not admissible pursuant to Rule 804(b)(3), M.R.Evid., as statements against his penal interest. In <em>Castle, </em>we stated that the fact that \u201cportions of a declarant\u2019s confession are admissible because they are self-inculpatory, however, does not necessarily make the collateral non-inculpatory statements either credible or admissible, particularly where the declarant implicates another person.\u201d <em>Castle, </em>285 Mont. at 372, 948 P.2d at 693. In the instant case, Steilman\u2019s confession consisted mainly of blaming Francis. Since the only basis for admitting Steilman\u2019s confession was the erroneous application of Rule 804(b)(3), M.R.Evid., we hold that the District Court erred in admitting Steilman\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">\u00b621 C. Does the District Court\u2019s erroneous admission of Steilman\u2019s out of court statements to Dinius and to the police require a reversal of Francis\u2019 conviction?</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">\u00b622 We now turn our attention to whether the admission of Steilman\u2019s out of court statements in violation of the Montana Rules of Evidence requires reversal. Section 46-20-701(1), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">Whenever the record on appeal contains any order, ruling, or proceeding of the trial court against the convicted person affecting the convicted person\u2019s substantial rights on the appeal of the cause, together with any required objection of the convicted person, the supreme court on that appeal shall consider the orders, rulings, or proceedings and the objections thereto and shall reverse or affirm the cause on the appeal according to the substantial rights of the respective parties, as shown upon the record. A cause may not be reversed by reason of any error committed by the trial court against the convicted person unless the record shows that the error was prejudicial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">\u00b623 We recently restated our analysis under \u00a7 46-20-701, MCA, in <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735. The first step in our reversible error analysis requires us to determine whether the error complained of is a \u201cstructural\u201d error or a \u201ctrial\u201d error. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 37. Structural error affects the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than simply an error in the trial process itself. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 38. Examples of structural error referred to in <em>Van Kirk </em>include errors in the jury selection process, total deprivation of the right to counsel, and lack of an impartial trial judge. <em>See Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 39; <em>see also State v. LaMere, </em>2000 MT 45, \u00b6 23, 298 Mont. 358, \u00b6 23, 2 P.3d 204, \u00b6 23 (providing further examples of structural error). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Structural error is presumptively prejudicial, requiring automatic reversal and thus ending our inquiry. <em>See Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 39; <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 23. Trial error is that type of error that typically occurs during the presentation of a case to the jury. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40. Such error is amendable to qualitative assessment by a reviewing court for prejudicial impact relative to the other evidence introduced at trial and thus does not require automatic reversal. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40. The erroneous admission of evidence, such as occurred here, is the classic example of a trial error. <em>See Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 48 (concluding that the erroneous admission of the results of a horizontal gaze nystagmus, or HGN test, was trial error); <em>State v. Whipple, </em>2001 MT 16, \u00b6 26, 304 Mont. 118, \u00b6 26, 19 P.3d 228, \u00b6 26 (reviewing erroneous admission of hearsay evidence under harmless error standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">\u00b624  Because the error complained of here is a trial error, the analysis proceeds to the second step, which involves the determination of whether, under the circumstances, the error was harmless. <em>See Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 41. In order to do this, the State must demonstrate that there is no reasonable possibility that the inadmissible evidence might have contributed to the verdict. <em>See Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47. In reaffirming this principle, we stated in <em>Van Kirk </em>that we were abandoning the \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d test in favor of the \u201ccumulative evidence\u201d test because, although unquestionably more restrictive, the cumulative error test would bring us closer to gauging the potentially prejudicial impact of the evidence. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 43. In bearing its burden under the cumulative evidence standard, the State must direct us to admissible evidence that proved the same facts as the tainted evidence proved and, qualitatively, the tainted evidence would not have contributed to the verdict. In those cases in which no such cumulative evidence was presented, and the tainted evidence went to the proof of an element of the crime charged, the court\u2019s decision must be reversed. In those cases in which no such cumulative evidence was presented, and the tainted evidence did not go to the proof of an element of the crime charged, the State must demonstrate that, qualitatively, there is no reasonable possibility that the tainted evidence might have contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\u00b625 In the instant case, Francis was charged with \u201cpurposely or knowingly [causing] the death of another human being.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-5-102(l)(a), MCA. The State offered Steilman\u2019s out of court statements to his girlfriend, Dinius, and to the police to prove an element of homicide: that Francis purposely killed Paul Bischke. Dinius testified that Steilman pointed to the murder scene and told her that he and Francis killed Bischke. Detective Conway testified that Steilman told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>him that he and Francis used a wooden dowel and crowbar to kill Bischke in order to prove their worth to each other to conduct further criminal activity and that Francis inflicted the lethal blows. Therefore, the State must demonstrate that (a) it presented other admissible evidence demonstrating the \u201cpurposely caused the death\u201d element of the crime charged, <em>and </em>(b) that, qualitatively, no reasonable possibility exists that the tainted evidence might have contributed to Francis\u2019 conviction. <em>See Van </em>Kirk, \u00b6 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">\u00b626 The State argues that Steilman\u2019s out of court statements were cumulative to the evidence already presented to the jury. The State notes that those portions of Steilman\u2019s statements in which he implicated himself were admissible as statements against his penal interest. The State also observes that various witnesses testified that Francis and Steilman were virtually inseparable and lived together at the time of Bischke\u2019s death. Valerie Smelich, Francis\u2019 girlfriend, testified that Francis had a clipping of a newspaper account of the homicide in his wallet, that he confided in her that he and Steilman had killed Bischke for fun and to see if they could keep a secret. The State also observes that both Francis and Steilman disclosed their involvement in the homicide to Lani Nakamura, one of Steilman\u2019s former girlfriends. Francis discussed his involvement with Joseph Juchemich, his roommate at the time of his arrest, and Kevin Sheffield, his neighbor. Lastly, the State notes that Francis himself admitted that he told various people that he had participated in Bischke\u2019s death, even though he told the jury he made these admissions only to impress women and instill fear into others.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\u00b627 We agree that the foregoing testimony sufficiently establishes that the State presented other cumulative admissible evidence regarding Francis\u2019 purposeful participation in the killing of Paul Bischke.Francis\u2019 disclosures to various other people that he and Steilman purposely killed Bischke were cumulative admissible evidence on this element of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">\u00b628 Finally, the State must also prove that, qualitatively, no reasonable possibility exists that the tainted evidence might have contributed to Francis\u2019 conviction. <em>See Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 48. We noted by way of example in <em>Van Kirk </em>a few situations in which the State would be hard-pressed to demonstrate that erroneously admitted evidence did not contribute to a conviction. The first example we cited involved the erroneous admission of an involuntary confession in a prosecution for robbery even though there was other evidence tending to prove that the defendant committed the crime. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 45. In another example, we stated that it would be virtually impossible to prove that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>evidence presented in a DUI case that the defendant was a convicted child molester did not contribute to the DUI conviction because of the highly inflammatory nature of the evidence. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">\u00b629 In the instant case, the State asserts that the inadmissible statements were \u201cinconsequential\u201d in light of all the cumulative admissible evidence. However, we do not believe the resolution of this case is quite so clear. On the one hand, we have the admissible portions of Steilman\u2019s confession in which he admitted that he participated in killing Bischke, the fact that Steilman and Francis were close friends and roommates at the time of the murder, that Francis had a newspaper article regarding the murder in his wallet, and Francis\u2019 admission that he told other people he had participated in the homicide along with Steilman. However, on the other hand we have the erroneously admitted hearsay evidence that Steilman stated that both he and Francis killed Bischke, that Francis dealt the lethal blows, and Francis\u2019 contention that he told other people that he participated in the murder because he wanted to intimidate or impress them.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">\u00b630  Although this case presents a very close call, we are forced to conclude that there is a reasonable possibility that the erroneously admitted testimony of Steilman\u2019s out of court statements implicating Francis might have contributed to the verdict. We note that the test is not whether it was unlikely that the erroneously admitted evidence actually contributed to the verdict, but whether there was a <em>\u201creasonable possibility </em>that the inadmissable evidence <em>might have </em>contributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47 (emphasis added). An erroneously admitted hearsay statement by an admitted participant in a murder that the defendant also participated in the murder and that the defendant was the one who inflicted the lethal blows is qualitatively very damning, especially in light of the complete absence of any other direct evidence of the defendant\u2019s participation (e.g., other admissible eyewitness testimony, a confession, or other physical evidence). Accordingly, we must admit that there is a reasonable possibility that Steilman\u2019s confession implicating Francis might have contributed to Francis\u2019 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">\u00b631 Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b43-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b36-10\">Francis does not argue that the State\u2019s submission of its Point Brief to the District Court prior to trial without contemporaneously serving him with a copy constitutes a separate basis for reversal. Rather, Francis maintains that \u201cthe <em>ex parte </em>Point Brief in this case must be considered as part of the entire trial process and in conjunction with other admitted trial errors.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
