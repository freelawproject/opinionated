The Plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment that the Defendants were negligent per se for admittedly violating Montana\u2019s whistle statute, \u00a7 69-14-562(7), MCA. Following a hearing, the District Court entered its Decision and Order in which it denied the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment and awarded summary judgment to Defendant Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad Company. The District Court then entered judgment in favor of both Defendants. The Plaintiffs now appeal from the District Court\u2019s order and judgment. We reverse the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">\u00b62 The following issues are presented on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it held that \u00a7 69-14-562(7), MCA, does not require that train whistles and bells be sounded at \u201cany\u201d railroad crossing, whether public or private?</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err when it awarded summary judgment to the Defendant Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad Company? \u00b65 3. Did the District Court err when it held that the Defendants\u2019 ind\u00e9mnity agreement is enforceable against the Plaintiffs?</p>\n<p id=\"b316-13\">\u00b66 4. Did the District Court err when it refused to exclude evidence of Jeffs post-accident drug screen?</p>\n<p id=\"b316-14\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b316-15\">\u00b67 The Plaintiffs, Jeff and Carol Langemo, filed this action against the Defendants, Montana Rail Link (MRL) and Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company (BNSF), in the District Court for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>First Judicial District in Lewis and Clark County on July 23,1999. The Langemos sought compensatory and punitive damages because of injuries sustained by Jeff as a result of his collision with an MRL locomotive at a private railroad crossing west of Helena, Montana. Jeff Langemo, while driving his four-wheel ATV, collided with an MRL locomotive at a private crossing which provides access to several residences off Birdseye Road, including the Langemos\u2019 residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">\u00b68 The private crossing is the subject of a \u201cPrivate Roadway and Crossing Agreement\u201d between the Langemos and the railroads dated May 28, 1997. The agreement permitted the Langemos to use the 16 foot railroad crossing to access their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b69 MRL acquired the trackage over the crossing from BNSF in 1990. Neither BNSF nor MRL ever installed a whistle post at the crossing to alert the operators of approaching locomotives of the need to sound the locomotive whistle. When MRL took over the line from BNSF, it adopted BNSF\u2019s long-standing policy of not sounding the train whistle for private crossings. MRL admitted that the train involved in the accident had failed to sound the train whistle and bell for the private crossing.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">\u00b610 In their Complaint, the Plaintiffs alleged that the Defendants were negligent as a matter of law because they failed to sound the train whistle and bell at the private crossing, in violation of \u00a7 69-14-562(7), MCA. The Complaint also alleged claims for failure to construct and maintain a good and safe crossing, and for failure to keep a proper lookout. The Plaintiffs subsequently withdrew their \u201cunsafe crossing\u201d claims and proceeded solely on the issue of negligence based on \u00a7 69-14-562(7), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\u00b611 MRL filed an Answer on October 7, 1999, which included a counterclaim against the Plaintiffs for indemnification pursuant to the private crossing agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">\u00b612 On January 6, 2000, the Plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of negligence, alleging that the Defendants were negligent per se for admittedly violating \u00a7 69-14-562(7), MCA, Montana\u2019s whistle and bell statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">\u00b613 On May 5, 2000, BNSF filed a brief in support of its own motion for summary judgment. BNSF contended it had no duty with respect to the condition of the crossing or the failure of MRL crew to sound the whistle and bell.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">\u00b614 On October 11, 2000, the Plaintiffs filed a motion in limine to preclude results of a post-accident drug and alcohol screen.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">\u00b615 The District Court held a hearing on all pending motions on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>December 12, 2000. On January 11, 2001, the District Court entered a Decision and Order which denied the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment; granted BNSF\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all claims; denied the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to dismiss MRL\u2019s indemnity counterclaim; and conditionally allowed evidence of a post-accident drug screen in the event that the Defendants could demonstrate that drugs were somehow involved in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\u00b616 Because the Plaintiffs based their case entirely on the Defendants\u2019 admitted failure to comply with the whistle and bell statute, the District Court\u2019s ruling that as a matter of law the statute does not apply to private crossings resolved the Plaintiffs\u2019 claim. Accordingly, the District Court entered judgment in favor of Defendants on January 17, 2001. The Plaintiffs now appeal the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AUq\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\u00b617 Did the District Court err when it ruled that \u00a7 69-14-562(7), MCA, does not require train whistles and bells to be sounded at \u201cany\u201d railroad crossing, whether public or private?</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">\u00b618 The District Court held that Montana\u2019s train whistle and bell statute, \u00a7 69-14-562(7), MCA, applies only to public railroad crossings. We review questions of statutory interpretation as a question of law to determine whether the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Hobbs v. City of Thompson Falls, </em>2000 MT 336, \u00b6 11, 303 Mont. 140, \u00b6 11, 15 P.3d 418, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">\u00b619 Because MRL admitted that no whistle or bell was sounded prior to the collision, the District Court faced the purely legal question of whether \u00a7 69-14-562(7), MCA, applied to private railroad crossings - a question that has never been specifically addressed in Montana. The statute provides that a railroad is guilty of a misdemeanor if it shall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdJ\">(7) permit any locomotive to approach <em>any </em>highway, road, or railroad crossing without causing the whistle to be sounded at a point between 50 and 80 rods from the crossing, the bell to be rung from said point until the crossing is reached. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">Montana\u2019s whistle statute was first enacted by the Territorial Legislature in 1873. The original statute used the precise language that is contained in the current statute and made it a misdemeanor if any railroad corporation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-10\">[S]hall approach <em>any </em>highway, road, or railroad crossing without having, at a distance of fifty rods therefrom and within a distance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>of eighty rods therefrom, having sounded said whistle and rang said bell. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\u00b620 In concluding that \u201cany highway, road, or railroad crossing\u201d did not include the private crossing at issue here, the District Court relied on the definition of \u201croad\u201d found in Title 60, MCA, pertaining to highways and transportation, where the terms \u201chighway, road, and street\u201d are defined in \u00a7 60-1-103(19), MCA, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">\u201cHighway,\u201d \u201croad,\u201d and \u201cstreet,\u201d whether the terms appear together or separately or are preceded by the adjective \u201cpublic,\u201d are general terms denoting a public way for purposes of vehicular travel and include the entire right-of-way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Based on this statutory definition, the District Court concluded that the Legislature intended to change the meaning of the 1873 whistle statute. Because the whistle statute also uses the terms \u201chighway\u201d and \u201croad\u201d, the District Court concluded that the definition of \u201croad\u201d found in \u00a7 60-1-103 applied to \u00a7 69-14-562(7). The result, according to the District Court, is that any prior interpretation of \u00a7 69-14-562(7) was impliedly \u201csuperseded\u201d by the enactment of the highway code in 1965 and, therefore, application of the whistle statute applies only to \u201cpublic\u201d crossings rather than \u201cany\u201d crossing.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">\u00b621 The Plaintiffs contend that the plain language of \u00a7 69-14-562(7), MCA, requires that the whistle and bell be sounded prior to any railroad crossing, which necessarily includes private crossings such as the crossing involved in this case. Therefore, according to the Plaintiffs, the District Court erred when it ruled that the plain language of the statute was somehow impliedly repealed or \u201csuperseded\u201d by subsequent legislative enactments. The Plaintiffs argue that a 1965 amendment which defined highways and roads as limited to public highways and roads could not have affected the interpretation of this statute, which specifically refers to crossings and has not been amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">\u00b622 We agree and conclude that the District Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 69-14-562(7), MCA, violates basic rules of statutory construction. When we interpret statutes, our foremost goal is \u201csimply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA. Therefore, we determine legislative intent based on \u201cthe plain meaning of the language used by the Legislature.\u201d <em>In re R.L.S., </em>1999 MT 34, \u00b6 8, 293 Mont. 288, \u00b6 8, 977 P.2d 967, \u00b6 8. The statutory language \u201cmust be reasonably and logically interpreted, giving words their usual and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Gallatin County v. Eighteenth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number><em>Judicial District Court </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 33, 40, 930 P.2d 680, 685.</p>\n<p id=\"A1O\">\u00b623  We interpret \u00a7 69-14-562(7), MCA\u2019s, use of the phrase <em>\u201cany </em>highway, road, or railroad crossing\u201d to mean <em>any </em>railroad crossing, not just public railroad crossings. The usual and ordinary meaning of the word \u201cany\u201d is \u201cevery\u201d. WEBSTER\u2019S NEW WORLD COLLEGE DICTIONARY 64 (4th ed. 1999). Where, as here, the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, the statute speaks for itself and this Court cannot resort to other means of interpretation. <em>See State ex rel. Cobbs v. Montana Dep\u2019t of Social and Rehabilitation Services </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 157,162, 906 P.2d 204, 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\u00b624  Nor do we find any indication that the Legislature intended to change the plain and unambiguous meaning of the 1873 whistle statute by defining the terms \u201chighway, road, and street\u201d in Title 60 as \u201cdenoting a public way for purposes of vehicular travel.\u201d It is undisputed that the whistle statute has not been expressly repealed by Title 60 and, therefore, any repeal would have to be accomplished by implication. Repeal by implication has never been favored in Montana. <em>Ross v. City of Great Falls, </em>1998 MT 276, \u00b6 17, 291 Mont. 377, \u00b6 17, 967 P.2d 1103, \u00b6 17. Moreover, a later, general statute will not affect an earlier specific statute unless the intent to repeal the earlier specific statute is either clearly manifested or unavoidably implied by irreconcilable differences created by the continued operation of the statutes. <em>Trustees of Carbon County School Dish v. Spivey </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 33, 36, 805 P.2d 61, 63. Based on its plain language, we conclude that the Legislature specifically intended to require train whistles and bells at \u201cany\u201d crossing when it enacted the whistle statute. The highway code found at Title 60 has nothing to do with train whistles or the requirements for their use, and, therefore, does not create irreconcilable differences between the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u00b625 At no time between 1873 and the time of the collision at issue did the Legislature insert the word \u201cpublic\u201d so as to restrict application of the whistle statute to public railroad crossings. When the Legislature enacted the original version of \u00a7 69-14-562(7), MCA, in 1873, it knew the meaning of the word \u201cpublic\u201d and how to use it to restrict applicability of railroad statutes. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 69-14-554(2), -534, -551, MCA. Finally, the enactment of Senate Bill No. 348 by the 57th Legislature, a bill which went into effect on October 1,2001 and which amended the plain language of the whistle statute by inserting the word \u201cpublic,\u201d demonstrates that the Legislature did not believe the language at issue restricted the whistle statute to public crossings. \u00b626 Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court incorrectly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>interpreted the whistle statute, and its interpretation is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u00b627 Did the District Court err when it awarded summary judgment to Defendant BNSF?</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\u00b628 The District Court awarded summary judgment to Defendant BNSF solely on the basis of its determination that the whistle statute did not require the whistle to be sounded at the private crossing where the collision occurred. Since, as we have held, that conclusion was incorrect, summary judgment based on that conclusion was also incorrect. BNSF contends that, irrespective of the ruling on the whistle statute, summary judgment in its favor should be affirmed because it had no independent duty to assure that MRL employees sounded whistles at private crossings, and, therefore, there is no factual nor legal basis for its liability. However, we decline the invitation to award summary judgment on a basis not yet decided by the District Court. Therefore, the District Court\u2019s award of summary judgment to BNSF is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">\u00b629 Did the District Court err when it ruled that the Defendants\u2019 indemnity agreement is enforceable against the Plaintiffs?</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">\u00b630 At the District Court the Defendants counterclaimed that the Plaintiffs were required to indemnify the Defendants for \u201cany liability, claim, cost or damage\u201d resulting from the Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cacts, omissions, or exercise of its rights\u201d pursuant to the Private Roadway and Crossing Agreement between the parties. The Plaintiffs moved to dismiss the indemnity claim as unenforceable pursuant to \u00a7 28-2-702, MCA, which provides that contracts may not exempt anyone from liability for their own negligent acts. The District Court ruled that although \u00a7 28-2-702, MCA, precluded the Defendants from being indemnified for their own negligence, the indemnity agreement was enforceable as applied to the negligent acts or omissions of the Plaintiffs and allowed the Defendants to enforce their claim for indemnity at the same time they claim the right to reduction in the Plaintiffs\u2019 award based on contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">\u00b631  We conclude that the indemnity agreement is redundant of the protection afforded by the contributory negligence statute. Jeffs recovery will already be reduced by any negligence attributable to him. The Defendants cannot be indemnified for their own negligence and Carol\u2019s claim for loss of consortium has been dismissed by stipulation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Therefore, we conclude that the District Court erred when it held that the Defendants could rely on additional protection from their indemnity agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">ISSUE 4</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\u00b632 Did the District Court err when it refused to exclude evidence of the results of Jeffs post-accident drug screen?</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u00b633 The District Court\u2019s ruling on the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion in limine regarding the results of a post-accident drug screen is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Estate of Lande, </em>1999 MT 162, \u00b6 34, 295 Mont. 160, \u00b6 34, 983 P.2d 308, \u00b6 34. The Plaintiffs contend that the District Court abused its discretion when it held that the railroad was entitled to introduce evidence of a post-accident drug screen if drugs \u201cin some way\u201d contributed to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\u00b634 The District Court held that before the Defendants could introduce evidence of the drug screen, they would be required, outside the presence of the jury, to establish that the drugs \u201cin some way\u201d contributed to the accident. Despite the Plaintiffs\u2019 argument on appeal, the District Court has not conclusively ruled whether the evidence of the drug screen will be admitted. Consequently, the Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal of this issue is not ripe for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">\u00b635 We reverse the District Court\u2019s conclusion thatthe whistle statute does not apply to private railroad crossings; we reverse the District Court\u2019s award of summary judgment to Defendant BNSF; and we reverse the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the indemnity agreement should be enforced. We further conclude that the issue of the admissibility of the post-accident drug screen is not ripe for review. Accordingly, this matter is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b322-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
