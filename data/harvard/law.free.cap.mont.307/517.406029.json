The District Court found that Canton breached the contract, yet concluded the contract remedy violated the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act and was an unenforceable liquidated damages provision. The District Court subsequently awarded Riverview monetary damages in the amount of $92,046 plus interest and attorney fees. Riverview appeals both the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the contract remedy was void as a matter of law and, in the alternative, the amount of damages awarded. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">\u00b62 The following issues are presented on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it concluded the contract remedy provision violated the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act?</p>\n<p id=\"AlW\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err when it concluded the contract remedy provision was an unenforceable liquidated damages provision?</p>\n<p id=\"Aho\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in its calculation of the amount of monetary damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">\u00b66 On September 3,1993, Riverview Homes II, a limited partnership, and Jim Canton, an individual, entered into a contract for the sale and purchase of real property. Pursuant to the terms of the contract, Riverview agreed to purchase three lots in a previously approved and platted subdivision known as River Bend No. 1, and six one-acre lots in a proposed subdivision located in an adjacent twenty-acre tract to be called River Bend No. 2. Neither the six lots nor the twenty-acre tract had been submitted for county review and approval at the time the parties entered the contract. The contract provided for a purchase price of $279,000. Riverview paid $82,500 prior to closing, and $77,500 at closing. The remaining balance of $119,000 was to be paid upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Canton\u2019s completion of the River Bend No. 2 subdivision and the construction of a man-made lake within that subdivision. These contractual obligations were to be completed by May 1,1994, with the remaining balance to bear interest at nine percent until that date. The parties later agreed to extend the deadline for completion to November 1, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">\u00b67 The contract for deed set forth remedies available to Riverview in the event Canton failed to obtain final plat approval for River Bend No. 2 or complete the man-made lake. Paragraph <em>6 </em>of the contract for deed provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\"><em>Additional Security: </em>The SELLER hereby grants BUYER an assignment of BUYER\u2019S interest for security purposes only and a Quitclaim Deed on the twenty (20) acres described on Exhibit \u201cB\u201d. The security shall give the BUYER a priority position subject only to the first priority position identified in Section 7 of this Agreement on said twenty (20) acre parcel until such time as the SELLER completes all necessary state and county requirements and obtains the recordation of the new proposed River Bend No. 2 subdivision including the additional six (6) lots as described on page 1 of this agreement. The parties hereto agree that Seller\u2019s completion of said state and county requirements and the requirements contained in this agreement shall be valued at Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000.00). In addition, SELLER shall complete the man-made lake which SELLER is in the process of building.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Paragraph 6 was supplemented with Paragraph 23:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\"><em>DEFAULT BY SELLER: </em>Time is of the essence and should SELLER be unable to complete the construction of the man-made lake prior to May 1, 1994, the BUYER, at BUYER\u2019S option, may consider such a failure a default of SELLER by providing written notice of such default to SELLER stating that SELLER shall have thirty (30) days from the mailing of said notice in which to cure said default, by completing the construction of the man-made lake as required herein. In the event the SELLER fails to cure said default within said time period, the BUYER, at BUYER\u2019S option, may commence foreclosure proceedings on the property previously described and given to BUYER as security for compliance of SELLER\u2019S obligation. Further, in the event of default, at the BUYER\u2019S option, the BUYER may record the Quitclaim Deed or foreclosure upon the assignment of BUYER\u2019S interest for security purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Together, the contract provisions permitted Riverview to either commence foreclosure proceedings or record the quitclaim deed to the twenty-acre parcel as the remedy in the event of Canton\u2019s breach. The twenty-acre parcel included property subject to the purchase agreement but other property as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">\u00b68 On August 13,1997, Riverview sent Canton a notice of default. In September of 1997, Riverview received from escrow the deed conveying the twenty-acre tract from Canton to Riverview. Riverview attempted to record the deed, but the Ravalli County Clerk and Recorder refused to file it because such transfers required subdivision approval. In October of 1998, Riverview commenced a quiet title action to receive title to the twenty-acre parcel, based on the contract remedy provision.</p>\n<p id=\"AuY\">\u00b69 Following a four-day trial, the District Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order on March 23,2000. It concluded that Canton had breached his contractual obligation to complete the subdivision and construct the man-made lake. However, the District Court declared the contract remedy void because it violated \u00a7 76-3-302, MCA, of the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act. Furthermore, it concluded that the parties\u2019 valuation of the requirements that the seller was obligated to complete was an unenforceable liquidated damages provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">\u00b610 The District Court then ordered a hearing to determine the appropriate amount of monetary damages to be awarded to Riverview for Canton\u2019s breach of contract. The hearing was held on July 6, 2000. After hearing expert testimony on damages, the District Court awarded $92,046 to Riverview, plus interest and attorney fees. The award was based on \u201cscenario one\u201d as testified to by Canton\u2019s expert witness, Steve Hall, a licensed and certified appraiser. Under scenario one, the District Court assumed that the lots would have been received by Riverview as of November 1, 1994, and sold as bare lots without homes. After determining the amount of net profit and accounting for present value, the District Court arrived at the $92,046 award.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">\u00b611 On September 14, 2000, the District Court entered its final judgment in favor of Riverview, with the addition of attorney fees in the amount of $42,500. Riverview filed a Notice of Appeal on September 27, 2000, from the District Court\u2019s judgment. Specifically, it contends that the agreed upon contract remedy was enforceable, and, in the event it was not, that the District Court failed to award monetary damages in an amount which compensates Riverview for all of the detriment actually caused by Canton\u2019s default. Canton filed a cross-appeal of the District Court\u2019s order which was subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\u00b612 The standard of review of a district court\u2019s conclusions of law is whether the court\u2019s interpretation ofthelawis correct. <em>Carbon County v. Union Reserve Coal Co. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 459, 469, 898 P.2d 680, 686. The standard of review of a district court\u2019s findings of fact is whether those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Baines v. Knight </em>(1995), 269 Mont. 320, 324, 888 P.2d 904, 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">DISCUSSION ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">\u00b613 Did the District Court err when it concluded the contract remedy provision violated the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">\u00b614 Riverview contends that the transfer of the twenty-acre parcel pledged by Canton as security for his contractual obligations does not violate the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act. The Act generally requires that all transfers of land comprising less than 160 acres undergo subdivision plat review prior to transfer. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 76-3-104, - 301, -302, MCA. However, pursuant to \u00a7 76-3~201(1)(b), MCA, certain divisions of land are exempted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">Exemption for certain divisions of land. (1) Unless the method of disposition is adopted for the purpose of evading this chapter, the requirements of this chapter may not apply to any division of land that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-10\">(b) is created to provide security for construction mortgages, hens, or trust indentures;....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">Riverview contends that the security provision in the contract was, in effect, a \u201cconstruction lien\u201d as contemplated in \u00a7 76-3-201(1)(b), MCA. It relies on the definition of \u201clien\u201d found at \u00a7 71-3-101(2), MCA, of the general lien statute, as well as the definition of \u201cconstruction\u201d from Webster\u2019s dictionary. Section \u00a7 71-3-101(2), MCA, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-12\">A \u201clien\u201d is a charge imposed in some mode other than by a transfer in trust upon specific property by which it is made security for the performance of an act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">Because the twenty-acre parcel was given as security in part for Canton\u2019s obligation to construct a man-made lake, Riverview argues a construction lien was created, and \u00a7 76-3-201(2), MCA, of the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act was applicable. Therefore, the District Court erred in its interpretation of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>\u00b615 The District Court concluded that despite Canton\u2019s agreement to pledge interest in the land, the twenty-acre parcel was not transferable pursuant to \u00a7 76-3-302, MCA, and failed to qualify for any applicable exceptions. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\">[I]t would be contrary to good public policy to allow parties to evade the provisions of the Subdivision and Platting Act by simply contracting to create divisions of land such as this for purposes other than to provide security for construction mortgages, a recognized exemption provided by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\u00b616 Given the specificity of the exemption under \u00a7 76-3-201(2), MCA, we must decide whether a \u201cconstruction lien\u201d existed, not whether a general \u201clien\u201d existed pursuant to \u00a7 71-3-101(2), MCA. To enforce a construction lien, one must satisfy the requirements applicable to construction liens found in Title 71, Chapter 3, Part 5, MCA. Only those who furnish services or materials pursuant to a real estate improvement contract may claim a construction lien. \u00a7 71-3-523, MCA. Furthermore, certain steps are required to perfect and enforce construction liens, such as notice pursuant to \u00a7 71-3-531, MCA, and recordation pursuant to \u00a7 71-3-535, MCA. Riverview neither furnished services or materials to Canton for completion of the man-made lake, nor satisfied any other requirement applicable to construction hens in Title 71, Chapter 3, Part 5, MCA. Therefore, Riverview\u2019s construction lien theory lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">\u00b617 Riverview contends that the exemption for \u201cconstruction mortgages, liens, or trust indentures\u201d is not limited to construction liens as defined in Title 71, Chapter 3, Part 5, MCA. We disagree. If it is not a construction lien as defined by statute, it is a general lien pursuant to \u00a7 71-3-101(2), MCA. General liens are looked upon with disfavor. <em>Reiter v. Reiter </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 220, 222, 772 P.2d 314, 315. In the absence of an express agreement to give a lien, as is the case here, a general lien \u201ccan be claimed only as arising from dealings in particular trades or businesses in which the existence of a general lien has been recognized by judicial decisions or where a custom to that effect can be established by evidence.\u201d <em>Reiter, </em>237 Mont. at 222, 772 P.2d at 315 <em>(quoting Deitchman v. Korach </em>(Ill. App. Ct. 1947), 71 N.E.2d 367, 369). In <em>Reiter, </em>we refused to recognize a general lien for breach of contract to provide equity in land. 237 Mont. at 222, 772 P.2d at 315. We similarly decline to recognize a general lien in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"AWqX\">\u00b618  Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the twenty-acre parcel was not a transferable parcel pursuant to \u00a7 76-3-302, MCA, of the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act, and failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>qualify for any applicable exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u00b619 Did the District Court err when it concluded the contract remedy provision was an unenforceable liquidated damages provision?</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\u00b620 The District Court first concluded that the twenty-acre parcel was not transferable because of the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act. Given that conclusion, the District Court then reexamined the contract for another possible method to determine the appropriate amount of damages. Upon that examination, the Court noted the following language in Paragraph 6:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">The parties hereto agree that Seller\u2019s [Canton\u2019s] completion of said state and county requirements and the requirements contained in this agreement shall be valued at Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000.00).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">It then concluded: \u201cThis would appear to constitute a contractual provision by which the amount of damage to be paid for breach of Canton\u2019s obligations was determined in anticipation of his possible breach, i.e., a liquidated damages provision.\u201d Given that determination, the District Court analyzed the provision as a liquidated damages provision in light of \u00a7 28-2-721, MCA. Section 28-2-721, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">When provision fixing liquidated damages valid. (1) Every contract by which the <em>amount of damage to be paid or other compensation to be made </em>for a breach of an obligation is determined in anticipation thereof is to that extent void, except as expressly provided in subsection (2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">(2) The parties to a contract may agree therein upon an amount which shall be presumed to be an amount of damage sustained by a breach thereof when, from the nature of the case, it would be impracticable or extremely difficult to fix the actual damage. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">\u00b621 Riverview contends that the provision in Paragraph 6 is not a liquidated damages provision, because the parties did not agree on the amount of compensation or damages to be paid by Canton to Riverview. Therefore, \u00a7 28-2-721(1), MCA, does not apply. We agree. The provision sets forth a value for Canton\u2019s completion of certain tasks, it does not give Riverview the right to collect $200,000 from Canton. However, neither did Riverview contend that it should be awarded the $200,000 amount set forth in Paragraph 6. Therefore, the District Court\u2019s discussion regarding liquidated damages was not essential to the resolution of the parties\u2019 claims and we move on to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>actual award of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\u00b622 Did the District Court err in its calculation of the amount of monetary damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">\u00b623 After concluding that the contract remedy was void as a matter of law, the District Court held a hearing to determine the actual damages suffered by Riverview as a result of Canton\u2019s breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">\u00b624 Riverview asserts that the amount of expectancy damages awarded by the District Court was insufficient to compensate Riverview for all the detriment actually caused by Canton\u2019s breach. It contends that the District Court failed to account for the profit that Riverview would have received from the sale of lots with homes, as opposed to bare lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">\u00b625 The District Court carefully considered three methods for calculating damages. With \u201cscenario one,\u201d the Court looked to the contractual assumptions of the parties and added an assumption that the lots would have been received by Riverview as of November 1, 1994, and sold as bare lots without homes. From that assumption, the Court determined that Riverview\u2019s losses ranged from $92,046 to $120,445, depending on whether a 12 or 14 percent rate of return was realized. The District Court based its award of damages on scenario one, and awarded $92,046. Neither party gave serious consideration to scenario two as a viable damage alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">\u00b626 Riverview contends that \u201cscenario three\u201d was the appropriate measure of damages. In scenario three, the Court would consider the future value of the money Riverview paid to Canton, and from which it received no benefit. At closing, Riverview had paid Canton $160,000 of the $279,000 purchase price. From that $160,000, $84,500 was for the three lots in River Bend No. 1. The remaining $75,500 was paid in anticipation of the completion of the subdivision and the construction of the man-made lake. Therefore, Riverview contends that since September 3,1993, Canton reaped the benefits of the $75,500 without fulfilling its obligations. As a result, Riverview claims that it is entitled to the original $75,500, plus a reasonable return on that investment to the time of the hearing. That amount would be $143,586 at 12 percent or $187,884 at 14 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">\u00b627  For breach of an obligation arising from a contract, the appropriate measure of damages is the amount which will compensate the party aggrieved for all the detriment which was proximately caused thereby or in the ordinary course of things would likely result therefrom. \u00a7 27-1-311, MCA. Damages which are not clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>ascertainable in both their nature and origin cannot be recovered for a breach of contract. \u00a7 27-1-311, MCA. Furthermore, no person can recover a greater amount of damages for a contract breach than would be gained by full performance unless a greater recovery is specified by statute. \u00a7 27-1-303, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">\u00b628  In contract actions, lost profits will be allowed only if the loss is proven with a reasonable degree of certainty. 22 Am Jur. 2d <em>Damages </em>\u00a7 624 (1988). Lost profits maybe awarded if the loss is shown to be the \u201cnatural and direct result of the act of the defendant\u201d and if the loss is not speculative. <em>Topeo, Inc. v. State Dept. of Highways </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 352, 361, 912 P.2d 805, 810. The prohibition against speculative profits applies to the uncertainty about \u201cwhether the loss of profits is the result of the wrong and whether such profit would have been derived at all.\u201d <em>Topeo, </em>275 Mont. at 352, 912 P.2d at 810-11 <em>(quoting Olson v. Parchen </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 342, 348, 816 P.2d 423, 427). In this case, no evidence was presented regarding lost profits attributable to Riverview\u2019s inability to sell developed lots. Riverview opted not to introduce evidence establishing the size of the houses to be built, the quality of the houses, or other relevant features which would impact lost profits. Riverview has the burden to prove such lost profits, and failed to do so. Instead, Riverview opted to argue that establishing such profits was impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\u00b629  After review of the record, we agree that scenario one is the most appropriate measure of damages. If the contract had been fully performed, Riverview would have had six bare lots, approved as a subdivision by the appropriate government entities, and a man-made lake. Because of Canton\u2019s breach, Riverview had neither. Given the lack of evidence presented, the District Court was left with limited options for determining damages, and found the \u201cmost reasonable estimate of damages\u201d given the scenarios presented. Scenario one best accounts for the expectations of the parties at the signing of the contract. In determining expectancy damages and lost profits, this Court has not previously used the future value of held monies as an appropriate measure of damages, and we decline the opportunity to do so here. Because there is substantial evidence to support the District Court\u2019s finding that scenario one is the most reasonable measure of damages, we conclude that the District Court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">\u00b630  As a final matter, Canton requests this Court to award his costs and attorney fees incurred on appeal as the prevailing party pursuant to the contract. The contract provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">In case suit or action is instituted to enforce compliance with any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement, there shall be paid to the prevailing party in such suit or action such sum as the Court may adjudge as reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and, in the event any appeal is taken from any judgment or decree in such suit or action, the prevailing party on such appeal likewise shall recover from the other party costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees on such appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">Therefore, Canton, as the prevailing party on appeal, is entitled to costs and attorney fees. We remand to the District Court for a determination of those costs and fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\u00b631 Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b549-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b549-7\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"AkDE\">respectfully dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">\u00b632 I believe the District Court erred when it concluded that the contract remedy provision violated the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act. Accordingly, I would have granted the plaintiff\u2019s request to quiet title to the twenty-acre parcel pledged by Canton as security in the event Canton breached his contractual obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">\u00b633 Section 76-3-201(l)(b), MCA, exempts from subdivision regulations, divisions of land that are \"... created to provide security for construction mortgages, liens, or trust indentures ...\u201d The majority concludes that the word \u201clien\u201d must be construed to mean a \u201cconstruction lien.\u201d I disagree. The statute references \u201cconstruction mortgages\u201d and \u201cliens\u201d separately; nowhere does it mention \u201cconstruction liens.\u201d The majority then goes on to say it will not recognize a general lien, absent an express agreement to give a lien in the first place. Here, there was an express agreement to give a lien, as \u201clien\u201d is defined at \u00a7 71-3-101(2), MCA, in Paragraph 23 of the Contract for Deed. The seller expressly gave the buyer a quit-claim deed on the twenty acres, as and for security for performance of an act, and gave the buyer the option to commence foreclosure proceedings on the property should he default. I would give Riverview Homes the benefit of these contractual provisions negotiated between the parties. \u00b634 The introductory language of \u00a7 76-3-201(1), MCA, allows a lien to be exempted from the provisions of the chapter \u201c[u]nless the method of disposition is adopted for the purpose of evading this chapter ....\u201d There was no finding by the District Court that the parties purposely intended to evade the requirements of the subdivision chapter. Therefore, I would conclude that a valid lien was created, that the lien</p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>was not intended to evade the subdivision requirements, and that the plaintiff had the right to quiet title to the twenty-acre parcel pledged by Canton as security. I would therefore find that the contract remedy did not violate the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act, and would order remand for purposes of quieting title to the twenty-acre parcel in the name of Riverview Homes. I would accordingly not reach issues two or three.</p>\n<judges id=\"b550-4\">JUSTICE RICE joins in the foregoing dissent of JUSTICE COTTER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
