We affirm on the ground the action is barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">\u00b62 On August 11, 1995, the State filed an Information charging 22-year-old Paul Wright with deliberate homicide, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-102, MCA, alleging Wright shot and killed Phillip Talamantes on August 7,1995. Wright signed a plea agreement and Waiver of Rights to Trial, and entered a plea of guilty on May 21, 1996. After a presentence investigation and hearing, the court sentenced Wright on June 11, 1996, to 75 years at Montana State Prison, with five years additional imprisonment as a statutorily enhanced punishment for using a weapon during the commission of the crime, under \u00a7 46-18-221, MCA. In accordance with the plea agreement, the court ordered Wright ineligible for parole or for placement in a supervised release program for 20 years. The court filed the order for Judgment and Commitment on June 28,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">\u00b63 Wright applied to the Sentence Review Division on July 17,1996, for reconsideration of his sentence. After a hearing on the matter, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>which Wright was not represented by counsel, the Division unanimously extended Wright\u2019s ineligibility for parole to 30 years due to Wright\u2019s prior history of violent behavior and filed an amended judgment on October 28, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">\u00b64 On February 13,1997, Wright petitioned this Court for sentence review. We held the Sentence Review Division had violated Wright\u2019s constitutional right to counsel, pursuant to Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, by not appointing counsel to represent Wright through the entire sentence review procedure. <em>In re the Petition of Paul Edward Wright, </em>Order 97-087. On April 30, 1998, we reinstated Wright\u2019s original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u00b65 On November 16,2000, Wright filed the instant <em>pro se </em>petition for postconviction relief with the District Court in Yellowstone County, pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 46-21-101, MCA, et seq. The petition was supported by a brief and accompanied by a Motion for Clarification of Sentence and/or Motion to Withdraw Plea. Without requiring responsive pleadings or an evidentiary hearing, the court dismissed the petition and motion on November 27, 2000, finding no factual or legal basis for granting relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u00b66 The sole issue raised on appeal is whether the District Court erred in denying Wright\u2019s petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">\u00b67  The standard of review of a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief is whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>State v. Charlo, 2000 </em>MT 192, \u00b6 7, 300 Mont. 435, \u00b6 7, 4 P.3d 1201, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">\u00b68 The State asserts Wright\u2019s petition for postconviction relief is procedurally barred by the statute of limitations found in \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA (1997). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">\u00b69 In 1997, the Montana Legislature amended the procedures for seeking postconviction relief under \u00a7 46-21-101, MCA, et seq. Among other changes, the amendments reduced the statute of limitations for filing a petition from five years to one year from the date a conviction becomes final. Montana Session Laws (1997), Ch. 378, Sec. 4. A special relation-back provision of the 1997 legislation subjected all convictions occurring during the 12 months prior to the April 24, 1997, effective</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>date to the amended procedures. Montana Session Laws (1997), Ch. 378, Sec. 9. The act afforded persons convicted between April 25,1996, and April 24, 1997, another year following the legislation\u2019s effective date, or until April 24,1998, in which to file their postconviction relief petitions. See, Compiler\u2019s Comments to \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">\u00b610 The 1997 amendments to \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, made the procedures by which a petitioner may seek relief after conviction expressly retroactive. Retroactive laws include both laws with a retrospective effect and ex post facto laws. <em>Saint Vincent Hosp. and Health Center, Inc. v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Montana </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 56, 60, 862 P.2d 6, 9. We have described a retrospective law as one which takes away or impairs a vested right acquired under existing laws or imposes a new obligation, duty, or disability with respect to conduct that occurred before the statute\u2019s effective date. <em>Saint Vincent Hosp., </em>261 Mont. at 60, 862 P.2d at 9. By contrast, the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws takes aim at laws that retroactively make innocent action criminal, enlarge the definition of crimes or increase the punishment for criminal acts. <em>California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales </em>(1995), 514 U.S. 499, 504, 115 S.Ct. 1597, 1601, 131 L.Ed.2d 588. Changes in procedure which do not affect substantive rights do not implicate the prohibition against ex post facto laws. <em>State v. Goebel, </em>2001 MT 155, \u00b6 28, 306 Mont. 83, \u00b6 28, 31 P.3d 340, \u00b6 28; <em>State v. Duffy, </em>2000 MT 186, \u00b6 31, 300 Mont. 381, \u00b6 31, 6 P.3d 453, \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u00b611 The Montana Code states: \u201cNo law contained in any of the statutes of Montana is retroactive unless so declared.\u201d Section 1-2-109, MCA. While the legislature has the power to enact laws with retrospective effect, the rule of construction requires the intent to apply a law retroactively be gained from the act itself. In amending \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, the legislature explicitly directed the retroactive application of the abbreviated statute of limitations for filing a petition for postconviction relief. Because this procedural change neither alters the definition of the crime nor increases the petitioner\u2019s punishment, the amended statute of limitations is not subject to prohibition against ex post facto laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u00b612  The District Court imposed Wright\u2019s sentence on June 11, 1996, which falls within the 12-month period preceding the effective date of the 1997 amendments. Under the relation-back scheme set up by the legislature, Wright had only until April 24, 1998, to file his petition for postconviction relief. Accordingly, Wright\u2019s petition for postconviction relief violates the statute of limitations established by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>\u00a7 46-21-102(1), MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">\u00b613  The postconviction statute of limitations is a jurisdictional limit on litigation that is waived by this Court only when there is a clear miscarriage of justice, one so obvious that the judgment is rendered a complete nullity. <em>State v. Rosales, </em>2000 MT 89, \u00b6 7, 299 Mont. 226, \u00b6 7, 999 P.2d 313, \u00b6 7. See also <em>State v. Perry </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 455, 758 P.2d 268. We have repeatedly held that the \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d exception does not apply to postconviction claims unless a constitutional violation has resulted in the conviction of an innocent person or newly-discovered evidence establishes innocence. <em>Rosales, </em>\u00b6 7; <em>State v. Redcrow, </em>1999 MT 95, \u00b6\u00b6 33-34, 294 Mont. 252, \u00b6\u00b6 33-34, 980 P.2d 622, \u00b6\u00b6 33-34 (miscarriage of justice refers to actual, not legal, innocence).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\u00b614  In his petition, Wright alleges the District Court made a series of errors related to sentencing and contends his acceptance of an onerous punishment by agreement proves that his plea was neither voluntary nor intelligent. Wright neither alleges the discovery of new exculpatory evidence nor asserts his innocence. Consequently, we will not waive the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u00b615 The District Court did not err in dismissing Wright\u2019s petition for postconviction relief. Its decision is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b126-7\">JUSTICES REGNIER, COTTER, TRIEWEILER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
