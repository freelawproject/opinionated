The Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, granted summary judgment to North Central, and Schlemmer appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">\u00b62 The issues are:</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in concluding Schlemmer materially misrepresented his health on the disability insurance application?</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">\u00b64 2. Is the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Schlemmer made a material misrepresentation legally sufficient to allow North Central to deny coverage under the policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in failing to rule on whether North Central\u2019s agent had knowledge of Schlemmer\u2019s medical condition?</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">\u00b66 On April 16,1996, Schlemmer executed an application for credit life and disability insurance with North Central in connection with his home mortgage. The insurance would pay off Schlemmer\u2019s home mortgage in the event of his death or disability. North Central\u2019s insurance agent was Schlemmer\u2019s bank loan officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">\u00b67 The insurance application Schlemmer executed contains two questions about the applicant\u2019s health. The following statement is printed above the two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-15\">Borrowers and co-borrowers answering \u201cyes\u201d to question \u201c1\u201d are not eligible for Credit Life or Credit Disability Insurance. Any borrowers answering \u201cyes\u201d to question \u201c1\u201d or \u201c2\u201d are not eligible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>for Credit Disability Insurance. So any certificate inadvertently provided you is invalid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-3\">Beside questions \u201c1\u201d and \u201c2\u201d are checkoff boxes labeled \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo.\u201d Question \u201c1\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-4\">During the last two years, have you been medically treated for or been diagnosed by a physician as having any of the following: Cancer, High Blood Pressure (taking 2 or more medications), Heart Disease, Prior Heart Surgery, Stroke, Lung Disease, Seizure Disorder, Multiple Sclerosis, Muscular Dystrophy, Diabetes (insulin dependent), Disease or Disorder of the Liver or Kidney, Alcoholism or Drug Addiction, or Immune Disorder?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7Q\">Question \u201c2\u201d asks whether the applicant has been absent from work during the last year for more than five consecutive days due to a back or neck disorder. On Schlemmer\u2019s application form, the boxes labeled \u201cNo\u201d are checked beside both questions. Farther down on the page, and immediately above Schlemmer\u2019s signature, is the printed statement, \u201cI have read and understand this page and my answers to the health questions are true.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u00b68 In August of 1998, Schlemmer submitted a claim to North Central for the disability benefits under the credit life and disability policy. North Central investigated the claim and learned that, at the time he applied for the disability insurance, Schlemmer had been treated within the previous two years for hypertension, chronic obstructive lung disease and disease or disorder of the kidneys. As a result, North Central denied Schlemmer\u2019s claim and refunded the premiums he had paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\u00b69 After Schlemmer filed this action, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment. North Central based its summary judgment motion on its argument that, because Schlemmer had made a material misrepresentation in his application for insurance, North Central was entitled to rescind the policy as a matter of law. Schlemmer based his cross-motion for partial summary judgment on his argument that, under \u00a7 33-22-110, MCA, a pre-existing condition may only be excluded from disability insurance coverage for a maximum of 12 months. Because more than 12 months had elapsed between his application for disability insurance and his claim, he asserted entitlement to the disability benefits as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">\u00b610 The District Court determined Schlemmer is not entitled to recover the disability insurance proceeds because he made a material misrepresentation to North Central in the application. On that basis, the court granted summary judgment to North Central. Schlemmer appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\u00b611 This Court reviews a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>using the same Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P., criteria used by the district court. Summary judgment is proper when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Bruner v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264, 900 P.2d 901, 903 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u00b612 1. Did the District Court err in concluding Schlemmer materially misrepresented his health on the disability insurance application?</p>\n<p id=\"AVj\">\u00b613 The District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">[I]t is undisputed that [Schlemmer] signed the application for insurance, and that the box indicating that [Schlemmer] had not been diagnosed with or treated for lung disease was checked. Under section 33-15-403(2) such a misrepresentation prevents recovery under the policy if it is material or would have caused the insurer not to issue the policy. Under the analysis from <em>Schneider </em>[v. <em>Minnesota Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 334, 339-40, 806 P.2d 1032, 1036] if an insurer considers a health condition to be material the insurer should specifically inquire about that condition. Here the application specifically asked about lung disease. [Schlemmer\u2019s] misrepresentation is therefore material, and coverage may be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">\u00b614 Schlemmer asserts that a factual controversy exists as to whether he made a material misrepresentation. He points out that he stated in a filed affidavit that he did not fill out the disability portion of the application and did not know that a previous condition \u201cwhich was not disabling\u201d would exclude him from coverage. His affidavit also states the North Central agent did not explain to him the pre-existing condition clause in the disability portion of the application. Schlemmer also points out that North Central did not file an affidavit refuting his affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">\u00b615 In the latter regard, the record reflects the North Central agent had died by the time Schlemmer brought this action. Therefore, it appears no one was available to refute Schlemmer\u2019s factual allegations regarding his transaction with that agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">\u00b616  In any event, however, the language of the application is clear and unambiguous and Schlemmer did not deny signing it. As set forth above, the printed statement, \u201cI have read and understand this page and my answers to the health questions are true\u201d appears immediately above Schlemmer\u2019s signature. Under these circumstances, Schlem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>mer\u2019s claim of ignorance of the contents of the written application cannot prevail. <em>See Wiley v. Iverson, </em>1999 MT 214, \u00b6 25, 295 Mont. 511, \u00b6 25, 985 P.2d 1176, \u00b6 25 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\">\u00b617 The record discloses no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the misrepresentation on Schlemmer\u2019s insurance application was made and signed by Schlemmer. Schlemmer does not argue that his answer to question \u201c1\u201d was, in fact, correct so as to negate the District Court\u2019s determination that he misrepresented his condition. Nor does he argue the misrepresentation was not material. Further, the misrepresentation met the <em>Schneider </em>standard for materiality cited by the District Court, in that the North Central application included a specific question regarding lung disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\u00b618  We hold the District Court did not err in concluding Schlemmer materially misrepresented his health on the disability insurance application.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u00b619 2. Is the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Schlemmer made a material misrepresentation legally sufficient to allow North Central to deny coverage under the policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\u00b620 The District Court determined Schlemmer\u2019s material misrepresentation was legally sufficient to allow North Central to deny coverage under the policy pursuant to \u00a7 33-15-403, MCA (1995). That statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">(2) Misrepresentations, omissions, concealment of facts, and incorrect statements shall not prevent a recovery under the policy or contract unless either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">(b) material either to the acceptance of the risk or to the hazard assumed by the insurer; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">(c) the insurer in good faith would either not have issued the policy or contract or would not have issued a policy or contract in as large an amount or at the same premium or rate or would not have provided coverage with respect to the hazard resulting in the loss if the true facts had been made known to the insurer as required either by the application for the policy or contract or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">Section 33-15-403(2), MCA (1995). Based on question \u201c1\u201d and an affidavit from a North Central underwriter, the District Court concluded that Schlemmer\u2019s misrepresentation was material and that North Central would not have issued the policy had the true state of Schlemmer\u2019s health been disclosed as required by the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">\u00b621 Schlemmer argues that, even if he made a material misrepresentation on the application, the misrepresentation could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>serve as a basis to rescind the policy because he did not apply for benefits until more than two years after he applied for the insurance. He relies on \u00a7 33-22-205(1), MCA, but he did not raise an argument based on \u00a7 33-22-205(1), MCA, in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">\u00b622 This Court does not consider a change in legal theory or new arguments first raised on appeal, because of the fundamental unfairness of faulting a district court for failing to rule correctly on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider. <em>Unified Industries, Inc. v. Easley, </em>1998 MT 145, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 255, \u00b6 15, 961 P.2d 100, \u00b6 15 (citations omitted). Consequently, we decline to consider Schlemmer\u2019s argument based on \u00a7 33-22-205(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u00b623 In the last paragraph of his brief, Schlemmer notes that the District Court did not discuss \u00a7. 33-22-110(1), MCA (1995), which prohibits an insurance policy or certificate of disability insurance from excluding coverage for certain pre-existing conditions for over 12 months. Schlemmer\u2019s discussion of \u00a7 33-22-110(1), MCA (1995), in his brief on appeal is limited to two sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u00b624 Section 33-22-110(1), MCA (1995), addresses the circumstances under which pre-existing conditions may be excluded from disability insurance coverage; it also provides, as Schlemmer contends, that such a condition \u201cmay only be excluded for a maximum of 12 months.\u201d In order for a policy to expressly exclude coverage for a condition in the first instance and for the maximum allowable period, however, the insurer first must be aware that the applicant has the condition. Because of Schlemmer\u2019s misrepresentation on the insurance application, such was not the case here. As a result, there was not-and could not have been-either an express exclusion or a maximum period of exclusion under \u00a7 33-22-110(1), MCA (1995). Indeed, in the present case, the policy application specifically provides that an applicant disclosing the existence of the conditions set forth in question \u201c1\u201d or \u201c2\u201d is ineligible for the credit disability insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\u00b625  We hold the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Schlemmer made a material misrepresentation is legally sufficient to allow North Central to deny coverage under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">\u00b626 3. Did the District Court err in failing to rule on whether North Central\u2019s agent had knowledge of Schlemmer\u2019s medical condition?</p>\n<p id=\"AZZZ\">\u00b627 Schlemmer contends an issue of material fact exists regarding the nature and extent of North Central\u2019s agent\u2019s knowledge of his condition at the time he applied for the disability insurance. In his affidavit, he stated \u201cfrom 1991 through 19961 had numerous medical problems which [the North Central agent] was or should have been aware of.\u201d In his brief, he argues the agent \u201cmost likely had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>knowledge\u201d of his condition because of her \u2018long standing relationship\u201d with him as his bank loan officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\">\u00b628 Schlemmer\u2019s statement that the agent \u201cmost likely had knowledge\u201d of his medical problems is pure speculation. Mere speculation cannot create an issue of fact to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment. <em>See Stutzman v. Safeco Ins. Co. of America </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 372, 376, 945 P.2d 32, 34 (quoting <em>Bruner v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264-65, 900 P.2d 901, 903).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">\u00b629 Schlemmer also contends that the copy of a December 7, 1995 medical record of Dr. Gary Walter attached to Schlemmer\u2019s affidavit suggests he was using and carrying an oxygen tank when he applied for disability insurance in April of 1996. The medical record on which Schlemmer relies is a doctor\u2019s note typed up after an appointment saying, \u2018Will recheck his oxygen to see if he still needs that. Continue with his current regimen and FU for a yearly exam in 3 months.\u201d The medical record does not explain Schlemmer\u2019s \u201ccurrent regimen\u201d regarding oxygen in December of 1995, four months before his application for the disability insurance. It merely suggests his \u201coxygen\u201d will be rechecked in three months to see if it is still needed. The doctor\u2019s note does not establish, tend to establish or even raise an inference that Schlemmer was carrying an oxygen tank when he applied for the credit disability insurance on April 16,1996. Thus, it is insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding the nature and extent of the North Central agent\u2019s knowledge of his condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\u00b630  We hold that the District Court did not err in failing to rule on whether North Central\u2019s agent had knowledge of Schlemmer\u2019s medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\u00b631 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b231-7\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
