The District Court concluded that Appellants did not have access rights to Respondents\u2019 lands and therefore granted the Respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The Appellants appeal from the order of the District Court and the Respondents cross-appeal. We affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">\u00b62 The parties raise several issues on appeal and cross-appeal. However, we find the following restated issue to be dispositive:</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err when it concluded that any access rights referred to in the agreement between the parties\u2019 predecessors were extinguished pursuant to the doctrine of merger?</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">\u00b64 On February 17, 1970, Clifford Gehring, Sr., entered into an agreement with the APS Corporation in which he agreed to sell APS certain real property located in Lewis and Clark County. Pursuant to this \u201cAgreement\u201d, apparently drafted by the parties without the assistance of counsel, Gehring agreed to sell approximately 360 acres of the 4,000 acres of real property he owned to the APS Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"AK_\">\u00b65 The Agreement gave APS the right to purchase, subdivide and develop lots for residential purposes on the 360 acres. The Agreement included a section entitled \u201cAccess Rights\u201d which provided in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-11\">Seller hereby grants privileges to future Buyers whereby they shall enjoy hunting rights, Snow Mobile [sic] rights, and horseback trail rights over other lands that the Seller now owns with the understanding that rules and regulations will be established by a Future Owners Association whereby people who do not abide by the rules of the Association and the directives of that group (on recommendation of the Developer and the Owner) may be restrained from such privileges ... Any rights given on other lands of Seller are subject to being rescinded for cause by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Seller...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">\u00b66 An abstract of this Agreement was eventually filed with the Lewis and Clark County Clerk and Recorder on February 13,1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">\u00b67 On June 29, 1970 two deeds were recorded in Lewis and Clark County. One of the deeds, dated February 9,1970, transferred title to approximately 67.5 acres of real property from Gehring to the APS Corporation. The second deed, dated June 12, 1970, transferred title to approximately 295.6 acres to the APS Corporation. Neither deed referred to the Agreement nor otherwise reserved any access rights over the lands retained by Gehring</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">\u00b68 On April 3,1974, Gehring conveyed the remaining 3,640 acres to the Gehring Ranch Corporation. When Gehring died later in 1974, his daughters, Christine Gehring Holm and Susan Gehring, inherited all of his shares in Gehring Ranch Corp. In 1993, Susan formed Baldy Mountain Ranch, Inc., and transferred a portion of the remaining lands to that corporation. Susan is Baldy Mountain Ranch, Inc.\u2019s, sole shareholder. Christine is Gehring Ranch Corp.\u2019s sole shareholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">\u00b69 APS subdivided the 360 acres into lots and sold those lots to individual purchasers. The Appellants in this case are some of the successors in interest to the APS Corporation. The Strandskovs purchased a lot in 1995. The Richmans purchased their lot in 1998. Neither the Strandskovs nor the Richmans purchased their lots directly from the APS Corporation. Neither the original purchasers of the lots now owned by the Richmans and Strandskovs nor any of the other purchasers of lots within the 360 acre parcel have ever sought to assert access rights on the retained 3,640 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">\u00b610 Both Gehring Ranch and the Baldy Mountain Ranch have established an ongoing policy of managing hunting on ranch lands and have attached conditions to using ranch lands for recreational pin-poses. Access to ranch property is restricted by locking perimeter gates, especially during hunting season.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">\u00b611 After being told they did not have the right to hunt on ranch lands, the Appellants filed suit in the District Court for the First Judicial District in August 1999. The Appellants alleged that the Respondents improperly excluded them from the land now owned by the Gehring Ranch Corp. and Baldy Mountain Ranch, Inc. They further maintained that the Agreement created an easement over Respondents\u2019 land, and sought injunctive, declaratory and monetary relief to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">\u00b612 Following a hearing, the District Court granted Respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The District Court concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>language in the Agreement which purportedly created an easement failed to identify the \u201cother lands\u201d retained by Gehring. In addition, the District Court concluded that any agreement prior to execution of the deeds was merged with the deeds and since the deeds transferring title did not provide for access, the Appellants lost any access rights they may have been promised in the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">\u00b613 The Appellants now appeal from the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Respondents. The Respondents have advanced several alternative arguments on cross-appeal which we need not address.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">\u00b614 Our standard of review of appeals from summary judgment is de novo. <em>Motarie v. Northern Montana Joint Refuse Disposal Dist. </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 239, 242, 907 P.2d 154, 156. We apply the same criteria which is applied by the district court pursuant to Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. <em>Spinler v. Allen, </em>1999 MT 160, \u00b6 14, 295 Mont. 139, \u00b6 14, 983 P.2d 348, \u00b6 14. The moving party must establish both the absence of genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Hadford v. Credit Bureau of Havre, Inc., </em>1998 MT 179, \u00b6 14, 289 Mont. 529, \u00b6 14, 962 P.2d 1198, \u00b6 14. Once the moving party has met its burden, the opposing party must present material and substantial evidence, rather than mere conclusory or speculative statements, to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Hadford, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">\u00b615 This appeal focuses on whether the 1970 Agreement between Gehring and APS Corporation created an easement which would allow the Appellants, as purchasers of lots within the 360 acres originally purchased by the APS Corporation, to hunt and recreate on the lands which now comprise the Baldy Mountain and Gehring Ranches. Although the parties raise several issues on appeal and on cross-appeal, we find the issue of whether the purported access rights were extinguished according to the contract law principle of merger to be dispositive. Therefore, we do not address the additional reasons for affirming the District Court offered by the Respondents on cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">\u00b616 The Appellants contend that the District Court erred when it held that because the deeds did not mention the Agreement nor otherwise create an easement, the Appellants lost the benefit of any access rights created by the Agreement. They argue that the Agreement clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>demonstrates Gehring\u2019s intention to grant an easement. Specifically, the Appellants focus on the clause which stated \u201cSeller <em>hereby grants </em>privileges to future Buyers whereby they shall enjoy hunting rights ... over other lands that the Seller now owns...\u201d The language used by Gehring, according to the Appellants, was not a promise to be carried out at some later date as was the contract for sale in <em>Urquhart v. Teller, </em>1998 MT 119, 288 Mont. 497, 958 P.2d 714, on which the District Court relied, but rather an immediate grant of an easement which conformed to the statutory requirements for conveyance of estates in real property found in \u00a7 70-20-103, MCA. Consequently, the granted easements did not merge with the executed deeds and the District Court erred when it concluded that they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">\u00b617 The Respondents contend that Gehring did not intend to grant an easement. Rather, the Agreement was simply a contract for the future sale of real property and the District Court was correct when it concluded that any rights contained in the Agreement were extinguished when the Agreement merged with the deeds pursuant to general principles of contract law.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\u00b618  We agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that any potential access rights created in the Agreement merged with the deeds. The clause in the Agreement relied on by the Appellants was part of a larger agreement to transfer property in the future. Absent the future transfer of property, there was no intention to provide access. When interpreting written documents, the cardinal rule of construction is to glean the intent of the parties from the four corners of the document and not to focus on isolated tracts, clauses and words. <em>Rumph v. Edwards </em>(1979), 183 Mont. 359, 367-68, 600 P.2d 163, 167.</p>\n<p id=\"AqjM\">\u00b619 Gehring, the owner of the property to he burdened by the purported easement, did not intend to grant an easement-at most he intended to provide for potential access privileges if certain conditions were met.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">Seller hereby grants privileges to future Buyers whereby they shall enjoy hunting rights, Snow Mobile [sic] rights, and horseback trail rights over other lands that the Seller now owns with the understanding that rules and regulations will be established by a Future Owners Association whereby people who do not abide by the rules of the Association and the directives of that group (on recommendation of the Developer and the Owner) may be restrained from such privileges ... Any rights given on other lands of Seller are subject to being rescinded for cause by Seller...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>\u00b620 As this section of the Agreement indicates, any potential access privileges were conditioned upon the formation of an owners association and the adoption of rules to govern use of the privileges. Absent future transfer of the 360 acres to APS, there would have been no association nor rules. The Agreement also provided for rescission of any potential access rights. The rescission language is more consistent with the interpretation of the Agreement as a contract for deed which provided for potential access rights than as a present grant of an easement. A portion of a clause granting rights to as yet unidentified \u201cfuture buyers\u201d on unspecified land if certain conditions were met does not persuade us that Gehring intended to grant an easement. In fact, none of the other landowners have ever sought to assert the access rights now asserted by the Appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">\u00b621 Therefore, we conclude that the terms of the Agreement merged with the deeds and any purported access rights were extinguished pursuant to the principle of merger. This Court explained and applied the contract law principle of merger in <em>Urquhart v. Teller, </em>1998 MT 119, \u00b6 28, 288 Mont. 497, \u00b6 28, 958 P.2d 714, \u00b6 28, where we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9o\">It is a general tenet of contract law that all provisions in a contract for sale of real property are merged into the deed. Thus, when a deed has been executed, the purchaser\u2019s rights are generally found in the deed covenants, not the executed contract. An exception to the general rule of merger occurs when parties intended for an agreement in a contract for sale to be collateral. Covenants relating to title, quantity, and possession of land are generally not collateral and merge into the deed. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">\u00b622 In <em>Urquhart, </em>we considered whether restrictive covenants found in a contract for deed could be enforced when the deed itself was silent. We noted that the doctrine of merger applies where a buyer and seller enter into a contract for the sale of real property and subsequently execute a deed conveying title to the real property. <em>Urquhart, </em>\u00b6 31. Our holding that the parties intended the restrictive covenants to merge with the deed conveying title was based on several factors: the deed conveying title did not refer to the covenants, the parties did not record the contract for deed at the time it was executed, and no separate declaration of covenants was ever filed. <em>Urquhart, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\u00b623 The Appellants argument that the Agreement granted an easement is, in effect, an attempt to provide an exception to the merger doctrine\u2019s general rule that the deed contains all the rights of the parties. In other words, the Appellants contend that the quoted clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>in the Agreement granted an easement, and was therefore a collateral agreement which did not merge with the deeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\u00b624 We find this argument unpersuasive for several reasons. As in <em>Urquhart, </em>neither of the deeds conveying title from Gehring to the APS Corporation refer to the Agreement. No declaration of hunting, snowmobiling, or horseback trail riding privileges was ever filed separately. Nor was the Agreement filed upon execution or when title to the property was transferred to APS pursuant to the deeds. APS only belatedly filed an abstract of the Agreement over ten years later in February of 1981. Neither of the Appellants\u2019 deeds refer to any access rights over what are now the Gehring and Baldy Mountain ranches. There is no evidence that access rights were intended to be part of a collateral agreement supported by additional consideration beyond the purchase price for the real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">\u00b625 Furthermore, covenants relating to title, quantity, and possession of land are generally not collateral and merge with the deed. <em>Urquhart, </em>\u00b6 28. Any grant of access rights over all the lands retained by Gehring would certainly erode the owner\u2019s right to exclusive possession of that real property and, therefore, would not have been collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\u00b626  Consequently, we apply the general rule of merger and hold that the District Court did not err when it concluded that any potential access rights referred to in the Agreement merged with the deeds. Accordingly, the Order of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b471-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, NELSON and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
