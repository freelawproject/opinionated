The first person to encounter the accident, a registered nurse, noticed a strong smell of alcohol and shared her observations with Montana Highway Patrol Officer Virginia Kinsey when she arrived at the scene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>minutes later. Kinsey conferred separately with Bilant, confirmed the odor of alcohol on his breath and noted his blood-shot eyes. Kinsey then asked Bilant to perform a variety of field sobriety tests. She read Bilant the implied consent form for a preliminary breath test, but Bilant refused to take the test and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d pass or not.\u201d Kinsey brought Bilant to the police station for processing, where she conducted additional sobriety tests and Bilant again refused to take the breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">\u00b63 Bilant was charged with failure to wear a seatbelt, \u00a7 61-13-103, MCA (1999), and with his fourth violation of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), \u00a7 61-8-401(d), MCA. He received verbal Miranda warnings and requested to see an attorney before proceeding with an interview. Minutes later, however, Bilant decided to talk with Officer Kinsey without an attorney present. Kinsey proceeded to pose the standard DUI in-take questions. When asked if he was taking any medications, Bilant informed Kinsey he had taken a pain reliever called \u201cpropoxy\u201d at about 3:30 p.m. that afternoon. Bilant stated he was not certain of the name of the medication, but it had been prescribed by a Dr. Teal in Billings, Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">\u00b64 Officer Kinsey called Dr. Teal\u2019s office the next day to confirm the information provided by Bilant. Although Dr. Teal had retired some years earlier, his Billings practice had been subsumed by Orthopedic Surgeons, P.F.C. The person who answered the office telephone checked Bilant\u2019s medical records and told Kinsey that Bilant\u2019s only prescription from Dr. Teal was for propoxyphene napsylate acetaminophen, also known as Darvocet N100. Kinsey then called a pharmacist in Roundup to check on the medication\u2019s side effects and learned that Darvocet N100 can cause drowsiness and decreased reaction times, particularly when consumed in conjunction with alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\u00b65 On January 9, 2000, Officer Kinsey again interviewed Bilant. When asked about the medication he had taken prior to the accident, Bilant denied his earlier statement about the \u201cpropoxy.\u201d He stated he had taken only Tylenol for a headache in the morning on the day of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">\u00b66 The District Court issued an investigative subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>to Orthopedic Surgeons, P.F.C., on May 10, 2000, that sought the following information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">Certified copies of any and all documentation concerning medications prescribed for Robert D. Bilant a/k/a Robert Dean Bilant for the period commencing January 1, 1996 to present, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>including, but not limited to, written and/or oral prescriptions, physicians notes, advisory warnings, etc. regarding any prescriptive medications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">The doctor\u2019s office responded to the subpoena by sending the County Attorney Bilant\u2019s entire medical file dating from 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u00b67 Bilant first moved the District Court to suppress the medical information provided by his doctor\u2019s office over the telephone to Officer Kinsey. Two weeks later, Bilant supplemented the motion to include suppression of all medical record information obtained by the County Attorney in response to the investigative subpoena. The District Court denied the entire motion on the grounds that the physician-patient privilege provided by \u00a7 26-1-805, MCA, is not available to a criminal defendant and the exclusionary rule does not apply to information obtained by investigative subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">\u00b68 Reserving his right to appeal, Bilant agreed to plead guilty to the lesser charge of negligent endangerment, under \u00a7 45-5-208, MCA, in exchange for dismissal of the DUI and seatbelt violations. On August 1, 2000, the court fined Bilant $500 and sentenced him to a one-year term in the county jail with all but 48 hours suspended, followed by probation and a chemical dependency evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">\u00b69 We frame the issues on appeal as:</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">\u00b610 1) Did the District Court err by denying a motion to suppress medical record information acquired by an investigating officer from a health care provider by telephone inquiry?</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">\u00b611 2) Did the District Court err in finding probable cause for an investigative subpoena seeking medical record information?</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">\u00b612 3) Did the District Court issue the investigative subpoena for an overly broad time period?</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress to ascertain whether the court\u2019s factual findings are clearly erroneous and whether the findings were correctly applied as a matter of law. <em>State v. Nelson </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 231, 236, 941 P.2d 441, 445. We review <em>de novo </em>to determine whether probable cause supported the issuance of an investigative subpoena for constitutionally protected material. <em>State v. Kuneff, </em>1998 MT 287, \u00b6 19, 291 Mont. 474, \u00b6 19, 970 P.2d 556, \u00b619. We will affirm a district court\u2019s ruling if the court reaches the correct result, even if it does so for the wrong reasons. <em>State v. Parker, </em>1998 MT 6, \u00b6 20, 287 Mont. 151, \u00b6 20, 953 P.2d 692, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">\u00b614 The factual findings of the District Court are not in dispute on appeal. To briefly reiterate, the court found Bilant had been apprised of his Miranda rights by Officer Kinsey and waived those rights when he agreed to be interviewed at the police station without an attorney present immediately after the accident on January 3, 2000. The court also found that at about 3:30 p.m. on the day of the accident, Bilant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily disclosed he had taken a pain medication called something like \u201cpropoxy,\u201d which had been prescribed by a Dr. Teal in Billings, Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\u00b615 Bilant argues the State violated both his constitutional right to privacy and statutory protections of the Uniform Health Care Information Act, specifically \u00a7 50-16-535, MCA. He seeks suppression of all medical record information obtained from his health care provider. Bilant does not ask the court to suppress medical Information he voluntarily disclosed to Officer Kinsey. Rather, he asserts that Officer Kinsey obtained privileged medical information when she telephoned Orthopedic Surgeons, P.F.C., and inquired about Bilant\u2019s drug prescriptions. Since this information was not lawfully available to be used as evidence in support.of an investigative subpoena, Bilant claims the subpoena was improperly issued and must be dismissed in its entirety. In addition, Bilant asserts the subpoena requested records for an overly broad time period and production was excessive in scope.</p>\n<p id=\"AqU\">\u00b616 The State counters that Bilant waived his right to claim confidentiality in the medical information that he voluntarily disclosed to Officer Kinsey. Rather than offer new or additional medical information, the State asserts Orthopedic Surgeons, P.F.C., only confirmed Bilant\u2019s statement regarding his prescription and provided Kinsey with the exact name of the medication Bilant admitted taking. The State claims the subpoena was issued on the basis of probable cause, sought only health care information pertinent to the accident investigation, and is not implicated adversely by the over-production of records by Bilant\u2019s health care provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Issue <em>1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">\n<em>Did the District Court err by denying a motion to suppress medical record information acquired by an investigating officer from a health care provider by telephone inquiry ?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">\u00b617  The Montana Constitution guarantees \u201cthe right of individual privacy is essential to the well being of a free society and shall not be infringed without the showing of compelling state interest.\u201d Art. II, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Sec. 10, Mont. Const. The Legislature has recognized that \u201chealth care information is personal and sensitive information that if improperly used or released may do significant harm to a patient\u2019s interests in privacy and health care or other interests.\u201d Section 50-16-502(1), MCA. This Court has held that medical records are quintessentially private and deserve the utmost constitutional protection. <em>Nelson, </em>283 Mont. at 242, 941 P.2d at 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">\u00b618 In addition to his constitutional argument, Bilant invokes the statutory protections against disclosure of private medical information afforded by the Uniform Health Care Information Act, specifically \u00a7 50-16-535(1), MCA. Section 50-16-535(1), MCA, restricts the circumstances under which a health care provider may legally disclose a patient\u2019s confidential medical information. Bilant asserts his doctor\u2019s office disclosed information from his medical records to Officer Kinsey without benefit of written consent, waiver, court order or subpoena. \u00b619 We acknowledge Bilant\u2019s argument that none of the prerequisites for legal disclosure of medical information under \u00a7 50-16-535(1), MCA, were met. However, as we noted in <em>Nelson, </em>the restrictions imposed by the Uniform Health Care Information Act are directed at health care providers, not law enforcement. <em>Nelson, </em>283 Mont. at 237-38,941 P.2d at 446. The question before us today is not whether Bilant\u2019s health care provider legally disclosed medical information, but whether medical information was obtained by illegal state action, thus triggering the exclusionary rule. See <em>State v. Long </em>(1985), 216 Mont. 65, 71, 700 P.2d 153,157.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">\u00b620  Although the Uniform Health Care Information Act is aimed at private health care providers and cannot be grounds for suppression of illegally obtained evidence, the guarantee of \u201cinformational privacy\u201d provided by Article II, Section 10 of the Montana Constitution can be the basis. See <em>Nelson, </em>283 Mont. at 242-44, 941 P.2d at 448-49. We reject the State\u2019s argument that Bilant waived his claim of confidentiality in his medical information when he chose to waive his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination by telling Officer Kinsey that he had taken pain medication on the day of the accident. In deciding to reveal limited medical information in a police interview, Bilant did not forfeit his constitutional right to subsequently claim confidentiality in his medical records. We hold that Officer Kinsey conducted an illegal search when she sought constitutionally protected private medical information from Bilant\u2019s health care provider without the benefit of an investigative subpoena under \u00a7 46-4-301(3), MCA, which requires probable cause. The information obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>from Officer Kinsey\u2019s telephone inquiry should have been suppressed by the District Court. However, as set forth below, in the context of this case, that failure does not amount to reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">\n<em>Issue 2</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\n<em>Did the District Court err in finding probable cause for an investigative subpoena seeking medical record information?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u00b621 We now examine the adequacy of the county prosecutor\u2019s application for the investigative subpoena to compel production of Bilant\u2019s medical records. Bilant cites the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine to challenge the subpoena in its entirety, claiming the information about his prescriptive medications gathered during the illegal search established the probable cause required for the investigative subpoena. Bilant also points to \u00a7 46-4-303, MCA, which states the remedy for an improperly issued investigative subpoena is either to dismiss the subpoena or to limit its scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">\u00b622  The \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine forbids the use of evidence that comes to light as the result of the exploitation of an initial illegal act. <em>State v. New </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 529, 540, 917 P.2d 919, 925 (citing <em>Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. U.S. </em>(1920), 251 U.S. 385, 40 S.Ct. 182, 64 L.Ed. 319). In <em>New, </em>we discussed three exceptions to the doctrine, stating that the \u201cfruit\u201d or derivative evidence is admissible if it is (1) attenuated from the constitutional violation so as to remove its primary taint; (2) obtained from an independent source; or (3) determined to be evidence which inevitably would have been discovered apart from the constitutional violation. <em>New, </em>276 Mont. at 536, 917 P.2d at 923 (citing <em>State v. Pearson </em>(1985), 217 Mont. 363, 366, 704 P.2d 1056, 1058-59). We have supported the proposition that police should be placed in no worse position once tainted evidence is excised <em>from </em>proceedings than they would have been had the illegal search not occurred. <em>Pearson, </em>217 Mont. at 366, 704 P.2d at 1059.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">\u00b623  In this case, Bilant voluntarily admitted in an interview with Officer Kinsey that he took a pain medication prescribed by a Dr. Teal in Billings called something like \u201cpropoxy\u201d at 3:30 p.m. in the afternoon prior to the accident. This volunteered medical information derives from a source other than the illegal telephone inquiry and may legally be used as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">\u00b624  In <em>Nelson, </em>we likened an investigative subpoena seeking constitutionally protected personal information to a search warrant, which must satisfy the strictures of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 11 of the Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Constitution. <em>Nelson, </em>283 Mont. at 243, 941 P.2d at 449. We held a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>seeking medical records requires greater justification for state access than the standard \u201cadministration of justice\u201d rationale used to obtain non-private information under \u00a7 46-4-301, MCA. <em>Nelson, </em>283 Mont. at 244, 941 P.2d at 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">\u00b625 The legislature codified these holdings as they affect state criminal investigations by amending \u00a7 46-4-301, MCA, and incorporating the heightened requirement of compelling state interest for law enforcement access to private medical records. Montana Session Laws (1999), Ch. 318, Sec. 1. The pertinent part of the amended statute reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">(3) In the case of constitutionally protected material, such as but not limited to medical records or information, a subpoena may be issued only when it appears upon the affidavit of the prosecutor that a compelling state interest requires it to be issued. In order to establish a compelling state interest for the issuance of such a subpoena, the prosecutor shall state facts and circumstances sufficient to support probable cause to believe that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">(a) an offense has been committed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">(b) the information relative to the commission of that offense is in the possession of the person or institution to whom the subpoena is directed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Section 46-4-301(3), MCA (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">\u00b626  When a search warrant is based, in part, on illegally obtained information, the reviewing court shall excise the illegal evidence from the application and review the remaining information <em>de novo </em>to determine whether probable cause supported the issuance. <em>Kuneff, </em>\u00b6 19. We will review the probable cause basis for an investigative subpoena for constitutionally protected material by the same process. The application must state sufficient facts to support a determination that there is a probability of criminal activity. <em>State v. Rinehart </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 204, 209, 864 P.2d 1219, 1222. Probable cause must be determined exclusively from the four corners of the application. <em>Rinehart, </em>262 Mont. at 211, 864 P.2d at 1223.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">\u00b627 The affidavit in support of the investigative subpoena to Bilant\u2019s medical provider runs six-pages in length and presents considerable incriminating evidence in addition to the information illegally obtained from Bilant\u2019s health care provider over the telephone. The application details the smell of alcohol emanating from Bilant at the accident scene; Bilant\u2019s blood shot eyes; his multiple refusals to take the breath test; the results of field sobriety tests administered by Officer Kinsey; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Bilant\u2019s apparent confusion and lack of concentration after the accident; his admission that he drank beer earlier on the evening of the accident; and, finally, Bilant\u2019s statement during the interview with Officer Kinsey that he had a medical condition that precluded him from performing the sobriety tests. The District Court found Bilant\u2019s admission during the interview that he had taken the \u201cpropoxy\u201d medication earlier on the day of the accident, in itself, constituted sufficient probable cause for the issuance of the investigative subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u00b628  Even when the medical information subject to suppression has been excised, the remaining evidence presented in the affidavit establishes probable cause that the offense of driving under the influence of alcohol had been committed. Furthermore, the affidavit underscores a compelling state interest in medical records related to prescriptive medications in order to confirm Bilant\u2019s initial admissions to Officer Kinsey. We hold the investigative subpoena was issued in accordance with the statutory requirements for constitutionally protected medical records under \u00a7 46-4-301(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\n<em>Issue 3</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\"><em>Did the District Court issue the investigative subpoena for an overly broad time period </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">\u00b629  Bilant attacks the investigative subpoena on the grounds that the delineated time period was overly broad. The subpoena sought \u201cany and all documentation concerning medications prescribed for ... the period commencing January 1, 1996 to present...\u201d The accident occurred on January 3, 2000, and the affidavit was filed on May 10, 2000. Bilant argues that medical records after the accident are not relevant to the investigation. The State claims that a legitimate nexus exists between prescriptions issued before January 3, 2000, and prescription refills issued during subsequent months. Since Dr. Teal had retired some years earlier, the State reasoned there would be an increased likelihood that Bilant was obtaining refill orders from Orthopedic Surgeons, P.F.C., for prior prescriptions. We hold the inclusion of the time between January 3 and May 10, 2000, does not cause the subpoena to be defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">\u00b630  Bilant also asserts that delivery by Orthopedic Surgeons, P.F.C., of his medical records dating back to 1991 when the subpoena only sought records back to 1996 implicates the State and makes the investigative subpoena process overly broad in its reach. As we pointed out previously, our laws regarding disclosure of medical information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>are directed not at law enforcement but at health care providers. <em>Nelson, </em>283 Mont. at 237, 941 P.2d at 446; see also, \u00a7 50-16-501, MCA, et. seq. If a health care provider discloses medical information beyond what the statute allows, the remedy lies with the health care provider and not through a motion to suppress. <em>Nelson, </em>283 Mont. at 238, 941 P.2d at 446. The purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter illegal police conduct and preserve judicial integrity. <em>Long, </em>216 Mont. at 71, 700 P.2d at 157. Suppression of all evidence derived though the investigative subpoena process due to excessive production by a health care provider would not serve this end. The County Attorney's receipt of medical files containing information beyond the scope and time period requested does not justify suppression of those portions of the medical record sought by and yielded pursuant to a legally sufficient investigative subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\u00b631 We hold that Officer Kinsey exceeded her investigatory authority when she telephoned Bilant\u2019s health care provider to inquire about Bilant\u2019s medical history. The information derived from Officer Kinsey\u2019s illegal search should have been suppressed. However, the court\u2019s failure to suppress that information does not change the outcome. When the suppressed evidence is excised from the application for an investigative subpoena, sufficient facts and circumstances remain to justify a finding of probable cause for the time period for which the records were sought. And, finally, whether the health care provider produced medical records beyond those required by the subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>is a matter beyond the scope of our review of the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\u00b632 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b145-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, NELSON, RICE, COTTER and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
