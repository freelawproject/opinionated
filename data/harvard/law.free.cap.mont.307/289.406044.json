CCCS moved for summary judgment and the District Court granted that motion. It held that CCCS\u2019s offer to buy Albright\u2019s real property was contingent on obtaining financing and that no separate oral contract had been formed. Albright appeals from the judgment of the District Court. We affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u00b62 The sole issue presented on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it granted summary judgment to CCCS.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">\u00b63 In 1995, the Montana Department of Corrections issued a Request for Proposals from parties interested in contracting with the DOC for the operation of a pre-release facility in Lewis and Clark County. On June 26, 1995, the DOC offered the contract to CCCS.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">\u00b64 On February 13,1996, Albright and CCCS entered into a Buy-Sell Agreement for the purchase of Albright\u2019s real property known as the Upcountry Inn, which CCCS intended to convert to a pre-release facility. The Agreement specifically conditioned CCCS\u2019s offer to buy the Upcountry Inn on its ability to obtain financing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-10\">Buyer\u2019s offer is contingent upon obtaining the financing specified herein. If financing cannot be obtained within the time set forth in the TIME FOR COMPLETION section, this offer is terminated and the earnest money will be refunded to the Buyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">\u00b65 Although Norwest Investment Services submitted a financing proposal to CCCS, Norwest\u2019s willingness to finance the purchase was contingent upon CCCS\u2019s contract with DOC to provide pre-release services at the Upcountry Inn. On July 31, 1996, the DOC advised CCCS that it would not offer a contract for the operation of a prerelease center. Pursuant to the Agreement, CCCS\u2019s offer terminated thirty days later and Albright refunded the down payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">\u00b66 At approximately the same time the Agreement was executed, the Executive Director of CCCS informed Albright of his need for furnishings at the facility. Apparently the Executive Director and Albright orally agreed that she would sell personal property listed on a \u201cSale List\u201d to CCCS once the Upcountry Inn transaction was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\">\u00b67 Albright filed her Complaint in the District Court for the Eighteenth Judicial District in Gallatin County on August 4,1998. She alleged breach of contract and sought damages caused by CCCS\u2019s refusal to purchase the Upcountry Inn. She also claimed breach of the oral contract to buy the property\u2019s furnishings. CCCS moved for summary judgment on both claims and the District Court granted the motion on September 7,1999. The District Court subsequently entered judgment in favor of CCCS. Albright now appeals from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u00b68 Our standard of review of appeals from summary judgment is <em>de novo. Motarie v. Northern Montana Joint Refuse Disposal Dist. </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 239, 242, 907 P.2d 154, 156. We apply the same criteria which is applied by the district court pursuant to Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. <em>Spinier v. Allen, </em>1999 MT 160, \u00b6 14, 295 Mont. 139, \u00b6 14, 983 P.2d 348, \u00b6 14. The moving party must establish both the absence of genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Hadford v. Credit Bureau of Havre, Inc., </em>1998 MT 179, \u00b6 14, 289 Mont. 529, \u00b6 14, 962 P.2d 1198, \u00b6 14. Once the moving party has met its burden, the opposing party must present material and substantial evidence, rather than mere conclusory or speculative statements, to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Hadford, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\u00b69 Did the District Court err when it granted summary judgment to CCCS?</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">\u00b610 The essence of Albright\u2019s argument on appeal is that she produced evidence that CCCS obtained unconditional financing which thereby obligated CCCS to buy the Upcountry Inn. At the very least, according to Albright, the evidence concerning CCCS\u2019s ability to obtain financing presented an issue of fact which should have precluded summary judgment. Likewise, Albright contends that whether an oral contract was formed for the sale of personal property presented an issue of fact. \u00b611 CCCS contends that Norwest\u2019s financing proposal was contingent on its contract with the DOC to operate a pre-release center at the Upcountry Inn. Because the DOC did not issue the contract, Norwest provided no financing. Consequently, CCCS\u2019s offer to purchase the Upcountry Inn terminated pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. CCCS further contends that the oral agreement to purchase furnishings was dependent on the sale of real property. When that contract failed, so did any oral agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">\u00b612 The District Court concluded that CCCS pursued but did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>obtain financing. Furthermore, the District Court concluded that the Agreement unambiguously included a contingency that excused performance by CCCS if it was unable to obtain financing. Because there was no issue of material fact regarding the availability of financing, the District Court held that the expressed condition of the Agreement was not met as a matter of law. Consequently, there was no separate contract for sale of personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\u00b613 We agree with the District Court. The evidence produced by Albright did not raise an issue of fact sufficient to preclude summary judgment. Albright argues that she responded to CCCS\u2019s motion for summary judgment by presenting evidence that neither the Agreement nor Norwest\u2019s financing proposal mentioned any contingency based on CCCS\u2019s contract with the DOC despite the fact that CCCS included appropriate contingencies on prior occasions. Albright also points to CCCS\u2019s statement in a May 10,1996, letter that it was \u201cfinancially capable to fund this project with committed bank financing....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b614 However, in the reply brief in support of its motion for summary judgment, CCCS submitted the affidavit of Michael S. Olauson, Senior Vice President for Norwest Investment Services. He stated that Norwest submitted a financing proposal but did not make a commitment to finance the purchase. He further stated that Norwest\u2019s commitment to finance the purchase \u201chinged on CCCS being able to secure the contract with the State of Montana, to operate the site as a Pre-Release Center.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u00b615  None of the evidence offered by Albright contradicts Olauson\u2019s affidavit. Mere denial, conclusory or speculative statements do not raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Hadford, </em>\u00b6 14. No question of fact existed with respect to the conditions for the Agreement. The Agreement conditioned formation of any contract to buy the Upcountry Inn on CCCS\u2019s ability to obtain financing. CCCS could not obtain financing without a contract from the DOC. Therefore, the District Court correctly concluded that CCCS\u2019s offer terminated pursuant to the plain language of the Agreement and that CCCS was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u00b616  Because it is clear from Albright\u2019s own affidavit that any oral agreement to purchase the property\u2019s furnishings was contingent on purchase of the property, we conclude that the District Court also correctly decided that issue by summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\u00b617 Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b314-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
