The District Court sentenced him to 60 years in the Montana State Prison with an additional 10 year consecutive sentence for use of a weapon. Allen appealed his conviction, which we affirmed in <em>State v. Allen </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 298, 299, 916 P.2d 112, 113. He then sought postconviction relief. Following an evidentiary hearing, the District Court denied relief. Allen appeals from the order of the District Court which denied his petition for postconviction relief. We affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">\u00b62 Allen raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it sentenced Allen based on allegedly false information?</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">\u00b64 2. Did Allen receive ineffective assistance from his court appointed counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">\u00b65 William Allen was charged with robbery, a felony, pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-401(l)(b), MCA, in the District Court for the Twentieth Judicial District in Lake County on August 15, 1994. The State accused Allen of threatening Tana Bockman and her daughter with a handgun during the theft of a television set from the Bockman residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-14\">\u00b66 The jury convicted Allen and the District Court sentenced him to 60 years at the Montana State Prison, adding a consecutive 10 year sentence for use of a weapon pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-221, MCA. The District Court sentenced Allen as a persistent felony offender pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-502, MCA, based on Allen\u2019s prior felony convictions and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>less than five year period that elapsed between the present offense and Allen\u2019s August 26, 1991, release on parole for a felony burglary conviction in California. In the underlying criminal proceedings, Allen was represented by Benjamin Anciaux.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">\u00b67 Allen, represented by new counsel, appealed the District Court\u2019s judgment. We affirmed the District Court in <em>State v. Allen </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 298, 299, 916 P.2d 112, 113, and provided a summary of evidence presented at Allen\u2019s trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">On the evening of July 9, 1994, Allen went to the apartment of Tana Bockman (Bockman) in Ronan, Montana, to demand money which he alleged Bockman owed to him. Allen and his then-girlfriend, Marcie Mestith (Mestith), now married to Allen, had stayed at Bockman\u2019s apartment in late May of 1994. While they were staying at the apartment, Bockman borrowed money from both Mestith and Allen. Bockman contended that she did not owe money to Mestith or Allen, rather, that the debt was offset as compensation for the couple\u2019s use of her apartment and for the time she spent babysitting for them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">When Allen arrived at the apartment on the night of July 9,1994, an argument over the alleged debt ensued. During the argument, the telephone rang and Bockman awakened her teenage daughter Kenclena for the call. While Kenclena was speaking on the telephone, Bockman told Kenclena to call the police. Allen, who had earlier removed a gun from the waistband of his pants, began waiving it around the room, pointed the gun at Kenclena directing her not to call the police and demanded anything of value in the apartment. He decided to take the television set as payment for the debt. Bockman helped Allen unplug and remove the television. A neighbor, Jerry Beck, testified that he saw Allen leave the apartment carrying a television and that he observed a gun stuck in the belt of Allen\u2019s pants. Allen testified that he did not threaten Bockman and denied having a gun.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-7\"><em>Allen, </em>276 Mont. at 299, 916 P.2d at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">\u00b68 On appeal, Allen argued that the District Court abused its discretion when it restricted his cross-examination of Bockman about her mental health. We concluded that Bockman\u2019s alleged mental incompetence was not dispositive on the question of whether Allen took the television while brandishing a weapon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">Here, the jury heard evidence from Kenclena that Allen flourished a firearm in the apartment and that she was scared and upset by the incident.... In addition, Jerry Beck testified that he saw Allen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>carrying the television out of the apartment and saw \u201cthe butt of the gun sticking out of his belt where his jacket was pushed away from it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><em>Allen, </em>276 Mont. at 301, 916 P.2d at 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u00b69 Allen then filed his initial petition for postconviction relief on January 20, 1998, and the District Court appointed the Montana Appellate Defender to represent him. On May 6, 1998, Allen filed an amended petition. In a second amended petition, filed April 14, 2000, Allen alleged that because his sentence was based on incorrect information concerning a prior felony, his state and federal due process rights had been violated. He further alleged that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. After the second amended petition for postconviction relief was filed, the District Court held an evidentiary hearing on September 5, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\u00b610 After Allen\u2019s first petition was filed, Jerry Beck, in a document drafted while he was in the Lake County Jail, recanted his trial testimony that he had witnessed Allen leaving Bockman\u2019s apartment with a gun. The notarized statement was admitted at the hearing and states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">I Jerry Beck want to say I lied and want to clear up Statements for Bill Allen and that Tana Bockman asked me to do her a favor and testify aginst [sic] Bill Allen she told me somethings to say in Her Behalf. I have Not been treatend [sic] to write this this is my own words.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">\u00b611 However, at the September 5, 2000, hearing Beck reaffirmed his original testimony. Beck stated that he wrote and signed the recantation because he was in the B Block of the Lake County Jail with Allen. Beck testified that he was intimidated by Allen and feared for his safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">\u00b612 Allen also testified at the evidentiary hearing. Allen stated that Anciaux failed to call a witness, John Lilly, who owned the pickup Allen borrowed to go to Bockman\u2019s apartment and who could have provided exculpatory evidence. Allen further testified that a 1978 conviction from San Luis Obispo, California, which was listed on the presentence investigation report as a felony, was actually a misdemeanor but that the court record had been destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">\u00b613 Following the hearing, the District Court denied Allen\u2019s petition in an order dated October 20, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>\u00b614 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief to determine whether the court\u2019s finding are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Bauer v. State, </em>1999 MT 185, \u00b6 17, 295 Mont. 306, \u00b6 17, 983 P.2d 955, \u00b6 17. In reviewing a district court\u2019s findings of fact, the Court (1) will determine whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence; (2) if the findings are supported by substantial evidence, the Court will determine if the trial court has misapprehended the evidence; and (3) if the findings are supported by substantial evidence and that evidence has not been misapprehended, this Court may still hold that a finding is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, a review of the record leaves the court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Vernon Kills on Top v. State </em>(1996) 279 Mont. 384, 409, 928 P.2d 182, 197-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are mixed questions of law and fact, and are reviewed de novo. <em>State v. Turner, </em>2000 MT 270, \u00b6 47, 302 Mont. 69, \u00b6 47, 12 P.3d 934, \u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AGA\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u00b615 Did the District Court err when it sentenced Allen based on allegedly false information?</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\u00b616 Allen makes two separate but related arguments concerning allegedly false information that contributed to his conviction and sentence. First, Allen argues that his due process rights were violated because he was sentenced based on materially false and prejudicial information about the number of his prior felony convictions. Next Allen argues that Jerry Beck\u2019s recanted testimony was false and that he is actually innocent of the offense for which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\u00b617 Allen contends that one of his prior felony convictions was actually a misdemeanor and that the District Court erred and violated his due process rights by relying on false information concerning the number of his prior felonies when it sentenced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">\u00b618  The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article II, Section 17, of the Montana Constitution protect a defendant from being sentenced based on misinformation about the defendant\u2019s criminal history. <em>Bauer, </em>\u00b6 20. Pursuant to this right, an offender must be given an opportunity to explain, argue, and rebut any information, including presentencing information, that may lead to a deprivation of life, liberty, or property. <em>Vernon Kills on Top v. State, </em>2000 MT 340, \u00b6 67, 303 Mont. 164, \u00b6 67,15 P.3d 422, \u00b6 67. However, due process does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>not protect against all misinformation. Rather, the inquiry is whether the sentence was premised on materially false information. <em>Vernon Kills on Top, </em>\u00b6 67. Where the sentencing court does not rely on erroneous information in sentencing the defendant, there is \u201cnothing to correct or rebut\u201d and the defendant is not entitled to be resentenced. <em>Vernon Kills on Top, </em>\u00b6 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b619 At the evidentiary hearing, Allen testified that a 1978 \u201cTheft of a Vehicle\u201d conviction in San Luis Obispo, California, was incorrectly listed in the presentence investigation report as a felony. Allen also introduced a letter from a clerk with the Superior Court in San Luis Obispo County in which the clerk stated that case files and dockets had been destroyed pursuant to state law. Therefore, there were no records available regarding Allen\u2019s 1978 conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b620 Whether or not Allen\u2019s 1978 conviction for \u201cTheft of Vehicle\u201d was a misdemeanor or a felony is a matter of law that is ascertainable by reference to the California code. Although the presentence investigation does not identify the specific statute that Allen was charged with violating, we take judicial notice of the fact that any theft of an automobile is defined as grand theft pursuant to the current California code. <em>See </em>CAL. PENAL CODE \u00a7 487(d) (West 1999). This code section is identical to the effective law at the time Allen committed the offense. Therefore, Allen\u2019s 1978 conviction appears to be correctly classified by the presentence investigation as a felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u00b621 Regardless, we conclude that Allen\u2019s sentence was not premised on the allegedly false information and was therefore not in violation of his due process rights. In Finding of Fact #21, the District Court found that the persistent felony offender designation was supported by Allen\u2019s record \u201cregardless of whether his 08/02/78 Theft of Vehicle conviction was a felony and whether the Defendant had four or five prior felonies did not affect said judgment.\u201d Similarly, in Conclusion of Law # 7, the District Court concluded \u201c[t]hat the designation of the first conviction shown on Defendant\u2019s Pre-Sentence Investigation Report as a felony or misdemeanor had no effect upon Defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u00b622  Because due process rights are not implicated unless the sentence was predicated on misinformation, the District Court did not err when it sentenced Allen as a persistent felony offender. Consequently, we affirm the District Court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\u00b623 As for Allen\u2019s related contention that he is actually innocent of the offense in light of the allegedly false testimony provided by Jerry Beck, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s finding that Beck did not recant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>his trial testimony was not clearly erroneous. The issue in dispute in the underlying case was whether Allen used a handgun during the commission of the offense. The jury heard the testimony of Jerry Beck, who testified that he saw Allen with a gun as he left the premises. Beck later recanted his testimony and said he lied at trial. Still later while he was in custody in the Lake County Jail, Beck took back his recantation and affirmed his trial testimony after being interviewed by law enforcement officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u00b624  Allen contends that the facts clearly demonstrate that he is actually innocent of the offense for which he was convicted. However, substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s finding that Beck\u2019s recantation of his trial testimony was not credible. The District Court found that Beck\u2019s July 1998 recantation was not credible because Beck was in the same cell block in the Lake County Jail with Allen. The District Court further found that Beck was intimidated by Allen and wrote the recantation statement as a result of intimidation and duress. These findings were supported by substantial evidence and, after reviewing the record, we conclude that the findings of the District Court as to Beck\u2019s recantation were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\u00b625 Did Allen receive ineffective assistance from his court appointed counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\u00b626 Allen contends that his trial attorney, Benjamin Anciaux, provided ineffective assistance of counsel by (1) failing to conduct an adequate investigation of the underlying facts of the case; (2) failing to call a witness at trial regarding Allen\u2019s possession of a gun; and (3) failing to present evidence at the sentencing hearing that Allen had four rather than five prior felony convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">\u00b627 In deciding ineffective assistance of counsel claims, we have adopted the two-prong test from <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052,80 L.Ed.2d 674. <em>See Hagen v. State, </em>1999 MT 8, \u00b6 10, 293 Mont. 60, \u00b6 10, 973 P.2d 233, \u00b6 10. Pursuant to the <em>Strickland </em>test, the defendant bears the burden of showing that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2064; <em>State v. Coates </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 331, 337, 786 P.2d 1182, 1185. Next, the defendant must show that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different - i.e., that the defendant was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s errors. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068; <em>Strickler v. Greene </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>(1999), 527 U.S. 263, 291, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 1953, 144 L.Ed.2d 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u00b628 Allen\u2019s claim that Anciaux failed to conduct an adequate investigation is not supported by the record. No evidence has been presented that before trial or sentencing Allen\u2019s counsel failed to investigate. The relevant inquiry in an ineffective assistance of counsel claim asserting the failure to investigate is not what could have been done, but whether counsel\u2019s choices were reasonable. <em>See, e.g., Dawson v. State, </em>2000 MT 219, \u00b6 137, 301 Mont. 135, \u00b6 137, 10 P.3d 49, \u00b6 137 (concluding it was reasonable for Dawson\u2019s counsel not to pursue further investigation where there was no evidence that further investigation would be beneficial). We conclude that Anciaux\u2019s investigation was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u00b629 The decision not to call John Lilly, the owner of the truck Allen borrowed, to testify that Allen did not have a gun was reasonable. The jury had already heard testimony from other witnesses who testified that Allen did not have a gun before or after the offense. Counsel had no obligation to present cumulative evidence. Moreover, Allen fails to show how Lilly\u2019s testimony might have affected the verdict and therefore fails to establish prejudice pursuant to the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\u00b630 Likewise, Allen fails to demonstrate how he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s alleged failure to investigate whether Allen had four or five prior felonies. As discussed previously, the records concerning the prior offense at issue had been destroyed, and the statutory evidence available indicates that the conviction at issue was a felony. Finally, Allen does not demonstrate that but for Anciaux\u2019s failure to investigate the number of prior felonies the result of the trial would have been different. Accordingly, we conclude that Allen fails to meet the two part standard for ineffective assistance of counsel claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">\u00b631 For these reasons, the District Court\u2019s order which denied Allen\u2019s petition for postconviction relief is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b282-8\">JUSTICES REGNIER, NELSON, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
