Pursuant to a plea agreement, Johnson plead guilty and was sentenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>to five years in the Montana State Prison, all of which was suspended. Nine months later, the Respondent, State of Montana, petitioned the District Court to revoke Johnson\u2019s suspended sentence. Johnson filed a motion to dismiss the revocation proceedings and to remand the matter to the Department of Corrections for proceedings consistent with \u00a7 46-23-1012(4), MCA (1999). The District Court denied Johnson\u2019s motion. Johnson now appeals the order of the District Court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it denied Johnson\u2019s motion to dismiss the revocation proceedings and remand this matter to the Department of Corrections for proceedings consistent with \u00a7 46-23-1012(4), MCA (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\u00b63 On September 15, 1999, Johnson plead guilty in the Thirteenth Judicial District Court to one count of criminal possession of dangerous drugs, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-102, MCA, and was subsequently sentenced to five years in the Montana State Prison. The District Court suspended all five years of the sentence and imposed conditions on the suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\u00b64 On August 23,2000, the State filed a petition to revoke Johnson\u2019s suspended sentence. The affidavit in support of the petition cited several sentence violations, which included Johnson\u2019s failure to: conduct himself in a law abiding manner; provide an accurate description of his place of residence; report to a supervising officer; abstain from consuming alcoholic beverages; maintain legitimate employment; and undergo a chemical dependency evaluation. The affidavit also indicated that Johnson absconded from supervision prior to his arrest on an August 21, 2000, field warrant. Johnson was not arrested pursuant to a court issued warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">\u00b65 On September 27, 2000, in response to the State\u2019s petition, Johnson filed a motion to dismiss the revocation proceedings, brought pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1013, MCA (1999), and to remand the matter to the Department of Corrections for proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1012(4), MCA (1999). On October 12, 2000, the District Court denied Johnson\u2019s motion. At a revocation hearing on October 18,2000, Johnson admitted that he violated certain conditions of the suspended sentence. On November 1, 2000, the District Court revoked Johnson\u2019s previous suspended sentence and imposed a new five-year sentence. The District Court again suspended the sentence, reimposed the initial conditions, and ordered Johnson to complete the Intensive Supervision Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>\u00b66 On November 28, 2000, the State filed another petition to revoke Johnson\u2019s suspended sentence on the grounds that Johnson had not been accepted by the Intensive Supervision Program. On December 1, 2000, Johnson filed a notice of appeal challenging the District Court\u2019s order which denied his motion to dismiss and remand the revocation proceedings. The District Court continued its consideration of the second petition to revoke pending resolution of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u00b67 The grant or denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case is a question of law which we review <em>de novo. State v. Goebel, </em>2001 MT 73, \u00b6 10, 305 Mont. 53, \u00b6 10, 31 P.3d 335, \u00b6 10. Our standard of review of a conclusion of law being plenary, we review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss to determine whether the court\u2019s conclusion of law is correct. <em>Goebel, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err when it denied Johnson\u2019s motion to dismiss the revocation proceedings and remand this matter to the Department of Corrections for proceedings consistent with \u00a7 46-23-1012(4), MCA (1999)?</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">\u00b69 In 1999, the Montana Legislature added subsections (4) and (5) to \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA. Among other things, these subsections provide for an administrative probable cause hearing and an intermediate sanction for probation violators, the probation violator prison diversion program. The intermediate sanction permits a sentence of up to thirty days in a detention center and serves as an alternative to judicial revocation hearings for those violators who commit technical violations of their probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">\u00b610 Section 46-23-1012(4), MCA (1999), provides:'</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">Any probation and parole officer may hold a defendant arrested under subsection (1) without bail for 72 hours. After the arrest of the defendant pursuant to this subsection, a hearings officer for the probation and parole bureau shall hold a hearing within 36 hours of the defendant\u2019s arrest. The hearings officer shall determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the defendant has violated a condition of probation and, if probable cause exists, notify the sentencing court and determine an appropriate plan to ensure the defendant\u2019s compliance with the conditions of probation. An appropriate plan may include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-11\">(a) holding the defendant for a period of time up to 30 days, with credit for any time served from the time of the arrest to the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>of the hearing to determine probable cause;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\">(b) a request to the court pursuant to 46-23-1011 to modify the defendant\u2019s terms or conditions of probation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">(c) a notification to the court with jurisdiction over the defendant pursuant to 46-23-1013.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">This section refers to \u00a7 46-23-1012(1), MCA (1999), which authorizes the court to issue a warrant for the arrest of a probation violator. Notably, \u00a7 46-23-1012(4), MCA (1999), makes no mention of \u00a7 46-23-1012(2), MCA (1999), which authorizes a probation or parole officer to arrest a defendant without a warrant when the defendant, in the officer\u2019s judgment, violates the conditions of his or her release.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">\u00b611 Johnson was arrested pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1012(2), MCA (1999), for committing \u201ctechnical violations\u201d of his probation. However, Johnson argued in the District Court that \u00a7 46-23-1012(4), MCA (1999), should apply to the disposition of his probation violation because the Legislature could not have intended for its provisions to apply to violators arrested pursuant to a court\u2019s warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">\u00b612 The District Court disagreed with Johnson. In denying Johnson\u2019s motion, the District Court concluded that \u00a7 46-23-1012(4), MCA (1999), applied only to those court ordered arrests provided for in \u00a7 46-23-1012(1), MCA (1999). Since Johnson was arrested pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1012(2), MCA (1999), the District Court initiated revocation proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1013, MCA (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">\u00b613 On appeal, Johnson cites <em>In re Marriage of Syverson </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 1, 19, 931 P.2d 691, 702, for the proposition that this Court has a duty to look beyond the language of a statute if its literal application would compel an odd result. Johnson maintains that to hold an administrative probable cause hearing to review a court ordered arrest warrant, issued for probable cause, compels an odd result. Johnson insists the Legislature intended the administrative probable cause hearing and prison diversion program to apply to probationers arrested on technical violations pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1012(2), MCA (1999). Since Johnson committed technical violations of his probation, Johnson suggests he is exactly the type of probationer contemplated by the Legislature when it authorized the intermediate sanction. Johnson contends that the reference in \u00a7 46-23-1012(4), MCA (1999), to subsection (1) rather than subsection (2), was merely a typographical error. Therefore, Johnson requests that this Court reverse the District Court\u2019s order and remand this matter to the Department of Corrections for proceedings consistent with \u00a7 46-23-1012(4), MCA (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">\u00b614 After the parties filed their briefs, we decided <em>State v. </em>Goebel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>2001 MT 73, 305 Mont. 53, 31 P.3d 335, and <em>State v. Giddings, </em>2001 MT 76, 305 Mont. 74, 29 P.3d 475. The parties in <em>Goebel </em>and <em>Giddings </em>disputed the meaning and effect of the very statute at issue in this case. In <em>Goebel, </em>we recognized that statutory language must be construed according to its plain meaning and if the language is clear and unambiguous, no further interpretation is required. <em>Goebel, </em>\u00b6 16. \u00b615 In construing \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA (1999), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-4\">[T]he phrase \u201cthis subsection\u201d in \u00a7 46-23-1012(4), MCA, does not mandate the probation and parole bureau hold the hearing described in subsection (4) in every case of alleged probation violation before the court may proceed under \u00a7 46-23-1013, MCA. ... The first sentence of \u00a7 46-23-1012(4), MCA, states: \u201cAny probation and parole officer may hold a defendant arrested under subsection (1) without bail for 72 hours.\u201d The next sentence of subsection (4) states, in part: \u201cAfter the arrest of the defendant pursuant to <em>this subsection . . </em>. (emphasis added).\u201d Because a defendant may only be arrested under the provisions of subsections (1) and (2), the phrase \u201c[a]fter the arrest of the defendant pursuant to this subsection,\u201d cannot refer to the entirety of \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA.... Clearly, \u201cthis subsection\u201d relates back to the reference in the previous sentence to subsection (1), which allows a judge to issue a warrant or notice to appear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aja\"><em>Goebel, </em>\u00b6 19. Therefore, we held that based on the plain meaning of \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA (1999), a probable cause hearing is only mandatory when an offender has been arrested pursuant to a warrant issued by a judge. <em>Goebel, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u00b616  Here, Johnson acknowledges that he was not arrested pursuant to a court ordered warrant. We need not engage in a lengthy analysis of the Legislature\u2019s intent in promulgating \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA (1999), as Johnson urges, since we have determined that the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous on its face. <em>See Goebel, </em>\u00b6 21. The District Court correctly concluded that \u00a7 46-23-1012(4), MCA (1999), only applies to those probation violators arrested pursuant to a court ordered warrant. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it denied Johnson\u2019s motion to dismiss the \u00a7 46-23-1013, MCA (1999), proceedings and remand the matter to the Department of Corrections. Accordingly, the order of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b343-6\">JUSTICES RICE, REGNIER, COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
