We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">\u00b62 The following issues are presented on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it found and concluded that Elva\u2019s parental rights should be terminated pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court inappropriately rely on the statutory presumption created by \u00a7 41-3-604(1), MCA, when it terminated Elva\u2019s parental rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b435-13\">\u00b65 Elva is the natural mother of the two children of concern, B.H. and D.H. At the time of the hearing, B.H. was seven years old and D.H. was two years old. The natural father, Delbert, voluntarily relinquished his parental rights to B.H. and D.H. during the District Court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-14\">\u00b66 On May 10,1999, the Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) received a report that D.H., who was approximately four months old at the time, was being fed 2% milk, had an unusual cry and did not appear to be developing appropriately. An effort to investigate the report by two community social workers was met with resistance by Elva, who became belligerent and agitated. She argued that she could do what she wanted to with her baby and that she did not have to talk with the social workers. One of the social workers urged Elva to work with DPHHS and asked that she allow D.H. to be seen by a pediatrician. Eventually, Elva agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>\u00b67 On May 11, 1999, Dr. Wayne Sager, a Butte pediatrician, examined D.H. and found that he was in the bottom percentile for weight at his age, he lacked normal muscle tone, and he was only at a developmental stage for about half his age. After diagnosing D.H. with severe malnutrition, Dr. Sager recommended that he immediately begin drinking formula. Elva resisted Dr. Sager\u2019s recommendation. She argued that 2% milk worked for her and her older child, B.H., and that D.H. had pushed away bottles of formula in the past. Given Elva\u2019s response, Dr. Sager recommended that D.H. be placed in foster care so that his recommendation could be implemented. D.H. was placed in foster care that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">\u00b68 On May 12, 1999, the District Court determined that both D.H. and B.H. were youths in need of care pursuant to \u00a7 71-3-102, MCA, and granted temporary investigative authority to DPHHS. Based on D.H.\u2019s severe malnutrition, D.H. was removed from his parents\u2019 care. The District Court again found the children to be youths in need of care on May 26,1999, and ordered that its May 12,1999, order remain in full force and effect for ninety days.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">\u00b69 While D.H. was in foster care, Elva, Delbert and B.H. continued to visit. Delbert was angry and belligerent with DPHHS as a result of D.H.\u2019s placement in foster care. At one point, he assaulted the social worker. His visits were cancelled pending his completion of an anger management course. Elva and B.H. continued their visits. On July 6, 1999, the social worker discussed with Elva the need for B.H. to have a speech evaluation. On her next visit with D.H., Elva failed to bring B.H. along. She stated that she did not know where B.H. was and that Delbert had met with friends and took B.H. for an unspecified period of time. Two weeks later, Elva told the social worker that she had received a phone call from Delbert, and that Delbert and B.H. were in New York. The social worker told Elva that visitation with D.H. would cease until she cooperated with DPHHS to locate and return B.H. to Anaconda.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">\u00b610 On August 3,1999, the District Court ordered Elva to show cause for her failure to make B.H. available for a speech evaluation. At the August 11,1999, show cause hearing, Elva informed the District Court that B.H. was sent to Glasgow with Delbert to ensure that DPHHS would not remove B.H. from their custody. On that same day, DPHHS filed a petition for temporary legal custody for both B.H. and D.H. On September 1, 1999, the District Court granted DPHHS\u2019 petition. The District Court ordered B.H. be returned to DPHHS by September 2, 1999, so that she could be placed in foster care within two weeks, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>ordered DPHHS to present a treatment plan for the parents within thirty days, and ordered DPHHS to prepare a report of its investigation and make a recommendation for disposition by February 1, 2000. B.H. was placed in foster care on September 4, 1999. A treatment plan for Elva was approved by the Court on November 10, 1999. The treatment plan required that Elva attend parenting classes, undergo psychological and chemical evaluations, and meet with a social worker on a regular basis. Elizabeth Hill was assigned as the case social worker. The District Court subsequently granted an extension of the State\u2019s temporary legal custody on March 15, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"AY-\">\u00b611 On September 13,2000, DPHHS petitioned for the termination of Elva and Delbert\u2019s parental rights. The District Court held a hearing on the matter on December 13, 2000. It was at that time that Delbert voluntarily relinquished his parental rights and transferred permanent legal custody of B.H. and D.H. to DPHHS. At the time of the hearing, D.H. had been in foster care for approximately twenty months and B.H. had been in foster care for approximately sixteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">\u00b612 On February 14, 2001, the District Court issued its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and ordered that the parent-child relationship between Elva and her children be terminated. Elva filed a Notice of Appeal on March 12, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">\u00b613 On review of a decision to terminate parental rights, we determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact supporting termination are clearly erroneous and whether the district court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct. <em>In re C.B., </em>2001 MT 42, \u00b6 6, 304 Mont. 252, \u00b6 6,20 P.3d 117, \u00b6 6. Findings of fact are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial evidence, the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or this Court\u2019s review of the record persuades it that a mistake has been made. <em>In re T.B., </em>1999 MT 174, \u00b6 12, 295 Mont. 234, \u00b6 12, 983 P.2d 929, \u00b6 12. Additionally, courts must, when considering the criteria for termination of parental rights, give primary consideration to the best interests of the child as demonstrated by the child\u2019s physical, mental, and emotional needs. <em>In re J.N., </em>1999 MT 64, \u00b6 13, 293 Mont. 524, \u00b6 13, 977 P.2d 317, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A5y\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">\u00b614 Did the District Court err when it found and concluded that Elva\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>parental rights should be terminated pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"AKq\">\u00b615 The criteria for termination of parental rights is set forth at \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA. Of the six possible scenarios which allow for termination, \u00a7 41-3-609(f), MCA, applies to this case, and provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARB\">Criteria for termination. (1) The court may order a termination of the parent-child legal relationship upon a finding that any of the following circumstances exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\">(f) the child is an adjudicated youth in need of care and both of the following exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">(i) an appropriate treatment plan that has been approved by the court has not been complied with by the parents or has not been successful; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">(ii) the conduct or condition of the parents rendering them unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\u00b616  The party seeking termination of an individual\u2019s parental rights has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the statutory criteria for termination have been met. J.N., \u00b6 12. In the context of parental rights cases, we have defined clear and convincing evidence as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">simply a requirement that a preponderance of the evidence be definite, clear, and convincing, or that a particular issue must be clearly established by a preponderance of the evidence or by a clear preponderance of the proof. This requirement does not call for unanswerable or conclusive evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-9\"><em>Matter of J.L. </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 284, 289, 922 P.2d 459, 462 (quoting <em>In re Interest of S.M.Q. </em>(Kan. 1990), 796 P.2d 543, 545).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">\u00b617 Therefore, to terminate Elva\u2019s parental rights to B.H. and D.H., the District Court had to find that clear and convincing evidence existed to show that: (1) B.H. and D.H. were adjudicated youths in need of care; (2) an appropriate treatment plan had been approved for Elva and either had not been complied with or had not been successful; and (3) the conduct or condition rendering Elva unfit to parent was unlikely to change within a reasonable time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">\u00b618 The District Court\u2019s findings that B.H. and D.H. were youths in need of care and that an appropriate treatment plan had been approved for Elva are undisputed. The question before us is whether clear and convincing evidence existed for the Court\u2019s finding that (1) Elva\u2019s treatment plan was unsuccessful and (2) that her conduct or condition rendering her unfit to parent was unlikely to change within a reasonable time period. Elva contends that the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>incorrectly relied upon the testimony and conclusions of two psychologists, Dr. Tim Casey and Dr. Tranel, in making that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">\u00b619 From the testimony of all of the experts at the hearing, including but not limited to or dependent upon Dr. Casey and Dr. Tranel, the District Court found there was clear and convincing evidence to support termination pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA. For the following reasons, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">\u00b620 Before discussing the testimonies of Dr. Casey and Dr. Tranel, we find it important to note that several other experts provided relevant testimony to questions before the Court. With respect to whether Elva successfully completed her treatment plan, Elizabeth Hill, the case social worker, testified that, in her opinion, Elva had not successfully completed her treatment plan in that she failed to effectively incorporate the learned parenting skills into her daily life on a consistent basis.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">Q: [S]he did superficially comply (with the treatment plan) and go where you told her to go, is that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">Q: Do you think she successfully completed the treatment plan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-10\">Q: Or that she was successful and got the skills out of going to the things that she was suppose to get?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-11\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">Based upon her sixteen months of work with Elva and Delbert, Hill recommended the termination of Elva\u2019s parental rights. Terri Waldorf, the social work supervisor at DPHHS who assumed responsibility for the case in September of 2000, agreed with Hill\u2019s testimony. Waldorf testified that she believed that it was in the best interests of the children to terminate Elva\u2019s parental rights. The testimonies of Hill and Waldorf provided the District Court with clear and convincing evidence, apart from the testimonies of Dr. Casey and Dr. Tranel, that Elva had not successfully completed her treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-13\">\u00b621 In Conclusion No. 4, the District Court noted that the testimonies of Dr. Casey and Dr. Tranel were particularly important to the question of whether the conduct or condition rendering Elva unfit to parent was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Dr. Casey evaluated Elva in August and September of 1999, approximately fifteen months prior to the termination hearing. Dr. Tranel performed his evaluation in April, about eight months before the hearing. Elva contends that Dr. Casey and Dr. Tranel conducted their psychological <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>evaluations too far in advance of the December 2000 hearing to be able to determine whether the conduct rendering her unfit to parent was unlikely to change. Both evaluations occurred prior to Elva\u2019s participation in parenting classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">\u00b622 However, after review of the psychologists\u2019 testimonies, it is clear that their conclusions were relevant to the question before the Court regardless of Elva\u2019s subsequent participation in parenting classes. Dr. Casey found that Elva had below average intelligence which raised questions about her ability to function. More importantly, Dr. Casey diagnosed Elva with an \u201cAxis II\u201d personality disorder based on her inability to learn from experience. Axis II personality disorders are long-standing, maladaptive patterns of behavior, which are not easily corrected in a reasonable period of time. In Dr. Casey\u2019s opinion, as a result of her personality disorder, Elva was incapable of parenting without direct twenty-four hour supervision from a responsible party.</p>\n<p id=\"ABa\">\u00b623 Dr. Tranel similarly provided useful information to support the District Court\u2019s conclusion. Dr. Tranel concluded that Elva had two significantly handicapping conditions which would prevent her from providing a minimal or threshold level of parenting for B.H. and D.H. First, Elva tested marginally for general aptitude, where her test scores indicated a sixth grade level in reading, spelling, and arithmetic. While acknowledging that a lower intelligence level is not a bar to being an effective parent, Dr. Tranel opined that her lower aptitude level \u201cmakes it extremely difficult for her to benefit from training opportunities, parent training exposure or other didactic interventions that might help her elevate her level of functioning.\u201d Second, Dr. Tranel similarly diagnosed Elva with a personality disorder, and when asked what impact that may have, Dr. Tranel responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">Well, a personality disorder by definition is a long-standing maladaptive or dysfunctional style of living or pattern of behaving in social situations. It\u2019s important because her style of living is not adaptive to the demands of parenting or even to the demands of age appropriate vocational functioning. She mis-reads [sic] circumstances in her life. She\u2019s not reflective and has difficulty learning from experience, and meanders through life repeating the same dysfunctional behaviors but never really improving or changing her lifestyle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\u00b624 Therefore, in Dr. Tranel\u2019s opinion, attendance at parenting classes would not have had a major impact on Elva\u2019s ability to make the changes necessary to effectively parent within a reasonable time. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Because of her two handicapping conditions, Dr. Tranel believed Elva did not have sufficient skills to successfully parent and could not develop those skills in a reasonable time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">\u00b625  Taken as a whole, the record demonstrates clear and convincing evidence that Elva had not successfully completed her treatment plan and that the condition rendering her unfit to parent would not change within the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the District Court properly found and concluded that the statutory criteria had been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\u00b626 2. Did the District Court inappropriately rely on the statutory presumption created by \u00a7 41-3-604(1), MCA, when it terminated Elva\u2019s parental rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">\u00b627 Elva contends that the District Court inappropriately relied on the statutory presumption created by \u00a7 41-3-604(1), MCA, contrary to the statutory requirements in \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">\u00b628 Section \u00a7 41-3-604(1), MCA, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-9\">When petition to terminate parental rights required. (1) If a child has been in foster care under the custody of the state for 15 months of the most recent 22 months, the best interests of the child must be presumed to be served by termination of parental rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">Because both B.H. and D.H. had been in foster care for more than 15 of the most recent 22 months, the presumption was applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">\u00b629  We agree that the presumption in \u00a7 41-3-604(1), MCA, neither eliminates the substantive requirements of \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA, nor diminishes the clear and convincing burden of proof on the party seeking termination of parental rights. However, in this case, the record is clear that the District Court both acknowledged the presence of the presumption given the facts of this case <em>and </em>considered the criteria required for termination in \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA, as discussed above. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"A1vg\">\u00b630 For these reasons, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"A_K\">JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
