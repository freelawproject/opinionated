Thee, Jr., appeals the denial by the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, of his petition for post-conviction relief. Pursuant to a plea agreement, Thee pleaded guilty to the charge of deliberate homicide under \u00a7 45-5-102(1)(b), MCA (1997), for aggravated assault resulting in the death of a 12-month-old child. After the District Court entered judgment and sentence, Thee petitioned <em>pro se </em>for post-conviction relief, alleging he would not have pleaded guilty but for ineffective assistance of counsel. The District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Court denied the petition. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">\u00b62 Kevin Gefroh died as a result of severe blunt force trauma to the head shortly after admission to a Great Falls emergency room on February 22,1998. Due to the non-accidental nature of 12-month-old Kevin\u2019s injuries, medical personnel alerted the police, who began an immediate investigation. In questioning Kevin\u2019s mother, Julie Johnson, and her live-in boyfriend, Douglas Thee, regarding events preceding Kevin\u2019s death, the police found inconsistencies in Johnson\u2019s and Thee\u2019s statements. Detectives asked Thee to submit to further questioning at the police station. Police gave Thee a verbal Miranda warning and read him the waiver, which Thee signed prior to the interview. During questioning, Thee again changed his story about how Kevin was injured. Kevin died during the interview process, and Thee was placed under arrest. On March 4, 1998, Thee was charged with deliberate homicide under the felony murder rule under \u00a7 45-5-102(1)(b), MCA (1997). The Information alleged that in the course of committing felony assault upon Kevin, Thee caused the child\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"AB_\">\u00b63 The District Court assigned Eric Olson, lead attorney at the Cascade County Public Defender\u2019s office, to represent Thee, with the assistance of co-counsel Carl Jensen, also with the Public Defender\u2019s Office. The record shows defense counsel sought and obtained a court-ordered mental evaluation for Thee.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\u00b64 Thee signed and filed a Plea Agreement and an Acknowledgment of Waiver of Rights by Plea of Guilty on April 16, 1998, almost two months after his arrest. The agreement provided that the State would recommend a 100-year prison sentence in exchange for Thee\u2019s plea of guilty to the charge of deliberate homicide under \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(b), MCA. At the conclusion of the change of plea hearing, the court accepted Thee\u2019s guilty plea and ordered a pre-sentence evaluation. The District Court held a sentencing hearing, after which Thee received the sentence of 100 years at Montana State Prison with no eligibility for parole for 30 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">\u00b65 On May 7, 1999, Thee filed the instant <em>pro se </em>petition for post-conviction relief, alleging he was denied his right to effective counsel prior to and during his change of plea hearing. For relief, Thee seeks withdrawal of his guilty plea and the opportunity to take his case to trial. To create a record for review, the District Court ordered transcripts of the change of plea and sentencing hearings. Defense counsel Eric Olson prepared a response to Thee\u2019s allegations that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>described, without abridging the attorney-client privilege, Olson\u2019s decision-making process during his representation of Thee. Olson recommended new counsel be appointed for Thee, given the fact that Thee would again be exposed to the possibility of the death penalty should his request to withdraw his plea be granted. Cascade County Attorney Brant Light filed a separate response to Thee\u2019s post-conviction petition. On May 3,2000, the District Court issued findings that Thee\u2019s change of plea was voluntary and that Thee was afforded competent counsel. The court dismissed Thee\u2019s petition as a matter of law for failure to state a claim for relief under \u00a7 46-21-201(1)(a), MCA. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\u00b66 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for post-conviction relief to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous and whether the conclusions of law ar\u00e9 correct. <em>Dawson v. State, </em>2000 MT 219, \u00b6 18, 301 Mont. 135, \u00b6 18, 10 P.3d 49, \u00b6 18; <em>Bone v. State </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 293, 302, 944 P.2d 734, 739-40. When reviewing the district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are clearly erroneous, we apply the following criteria:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">(1) the Court will determine whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence; (2) if the findings are supported by substantial evidence, the Court will determine if the trial court has misapprehended the evidence; and (3) if the findings are supported by substantial evidence and that evidence has not been misapprehended, this Court may still find a finding is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, a review of the record leaves the court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-7\"><em>Dawson, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">\u00b67 A defendant\u2019s right to assistance of counsel is guaranteed by Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution and by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal or in post-conviction proceedings using the two-pronged test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. <em>See Dawson, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>Kills on Top v. State </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 32, 49, 901 P.2d 1368, 1379. The right to counsel means \u201cthe right to effective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 686,104 S.Ct. at 2063, 80 L.Ed.2d at 692 (quoting <em>McMann v. Richardson </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 759, 771, n. 14, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 1449, n. 14, 25 L.Ed.2d 763, 773, n. 14). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number><em>Strickland </em>provides that a defendant is denied effective assistance of counsel if: (1) counsel made errors so serious that his conduct fell short of the range of competence required of attorneys in criminal cases; and (2) counsel\u2019s errors were prejudicial. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693; <em>State v. Boyer </em>(1985), <em>215 </em>Mont. 143, 147, 695 P.2d 829, 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">\u00b68 Judicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential and courts must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s actions regarding defense strategies fall within the wide range of reasonable and sound professional assistance. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688-89, 104 S.Ct. at 2064-65, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693-94. To constitute ineffective assistance, counsel\u2019s challenged actions must stem from ignorance or neglect rather than from professional deliberation. <em>State v. Aliff, </em>2001 MT 52, \u00b6 13, 304 Mont. 310, \u00b6 13, 21 P. 3d 624, \u00b6 13 (citing State <em>v. Gonzales </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 525, 532, 926 P.2d 705, 710). Moreover, we maintain that counsel\u2019s strategic decisions deserve great deference and cannot be the basis upon which to find ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Hans v. State </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 379, 392, 942 P.2d 674, 682 (citations omitted). However, we also noted in <em>Hans, </em>that counsel\u2019s duty to inform his client as to the nature and elements of the offense and the advisability of a plea are obligatory, not strategic. <em>Hans, </em>283 Mont. at 392, 942 P.2d at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">\u00b69 The second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test requires a defendant to show that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693. To show prejudice, the petitioner allegingineffective assistance of counsel must demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. <em>Hill v. Lockhart </em>(1985), 474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 370, 88 L.Ed.2d 203, 210. <em>\u201cA </em>reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d at 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">\u00b610 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in denying Douglas Thee\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">\u00b611 Thee alleges in his petition that he was denied his right to effective assistance of counsel prior to and during his change of plea hearing. Thee\u2019s claim encompasses the following specific allegations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjO\">a. Defense counsel induced Thee to plead guilty and threatened Thee by telling him he was \u201cgoing to die\u201d unless he pleaded guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>b. Defense counsel failed to address the alleged violent treatment Thee received from inmates and jail guards during Thee\u2019s incarceration in the Cascade County Jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-4\">c. Defense counsel failed to seek suppression of statements Thee made during police interrogation, which Thee alleged violated his Miranda rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">d. Defense counsel failed to have Thee\u2019s mental or emotional stress at the time of the homicide evaluated by a qualified mental health examiner to prove circumstances that could be used to mitigate the deliberate homicide charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">e. Defense counsel failed to inform Thee of a possibility of seeking conviction at trial of a lesser included offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">As a result of the alleged ineffective assistance, Thee claims he did not reach his decision to plead guilty to deliberate homicide voluntarily or intelligently, and he seeks to have his plea vacated. We examine each allegation in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">\n<em>a. Threats</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">\u00b612 Thee asserts defense counsel induced Thee to plead guilty by threatening \u201che was going to die unless he pled guilty.\u201d Thee further alleges his counsel told him, \u201csince you won\u2019t sign the plea agreement, you can think about dying because this is where you are headed.\u201d Defense counsel Eric Olson, in his written response to Thee\u2019s allegations prepared for the District Court, chose not to disclose specific attorney-client communications. Olson noted only that Thee was charged with deliberate homicide and the death penalty remained a viable sentencing option until Thee signed the binding plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">\u00b613  Defense counsel has a duty to inform a client of the elements of the offense, the possible punishment, and advisability of a plea agreement. <em>Hans, </em>283 Mont. at 392, 942 P.2d at 682. Montana law provides that \u201c[a] person convicted of the offense of deliberate homicide shall be punished by death ... , by life imprisonment, or by imprisonment in the state prison for a term of not less than 10 years or more than 100 years.\u201d Section 45-5-102(2), MCA. Discussion of the death penalty between an attorney and client in a capital case may well evoke extreme anxiety but, nevertheless, relate directly, albeit painfully, to the genuine circumstances of a client. Without more, we cannot assume Olson\u2019s candid assessment of the State\u2019s case and the merits of a plea agreement, as described by the petitioner, violated Olson\u2019s duty of loyalty and constituted threats designed to induce Thee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>to plead guilty. With the deference afforded defense strategies on retrospective review, the reported statements to Thee fall within the wide range of reasonable and sound professional assistance of a competent attorney counseling a client facing the possibility of capital punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">\n<em>b. Lack of investigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\u00b614 Thee claims defense counsel failed to investigate Thee\u2019s allegations of physical assault by jail inmates and guards during his pre-judgment incarceration in the county jail. Olson counters that he and co-counsel Carl Jensen communicated with detention center personnel and prepared a report of their findings that Olson shared with Thee and jail administrator, Dan O\u2019Fallon. Neither a copy of defense counsel\u2019s report nor any information regarding the nature of the findings and what actions, if any, Cascade County personnel may have taken to address the alleged jailhouse violence against Thee is included in the record on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\u00b615  To constitute ineffective assistance, counsel\u2019s challenged action must stem from neglect or ignorance rather than from informed professional deliberation. <em>Aliff, </em>\u00b6 13 (citing <em>Gonzales, </em>278 Mont. at 532, 926 P.2d at 710). In this case, defense counsel investigated Thee\u2019s allegations of violence, prepared a report of their findings, discussed these findings with Thee, and brought the matter to the attention of appropriate authorities. With the deference afforded counsel under the <em>Strickland </em>test, the concerted actions of Olson and Jensen preclude a finding of deficient counsel performance due to failure to investigate allegations of physical assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">c. <em>Failure to seek suppression of evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"AlL\">\u00b616 Thee alleges Olson failed to seek the suppression of certain statements Thee made to police officers prior to the appointment of counsel. Olson claims he reviewed and conferred with Thee about all statements attributed to Thee in police reports and transcripts of interviews. In his response to Thee\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief, Olson states he \u201cresearched the viability of suppression of the statements and, for various reasons, determined that such a challenge would not be legally viable.\u201d Olson also directed forensic psychologist Dr. Duane Green to investigate mental infirmity, mental disease or defect, or suggestibility as grounds for challenging statements made by Thee to the authorities. Dr. Green found no psychological or medical basis for such a challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>\u00b617  Given the deference afforded counsel under the <em>Strickland </em>test, strategic choices made after thorough investigation of the law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d at 695. According to Olson\u2019s statement, he investigated all statements made by Thee to police investigators, conferred with his client and researched the legal bases for possible suppression of certain statements. The fact that defense counsel reached a legal conclusion on an evidentiary challenge contrary to Thee\u2019s hopes provides no ground for finding deficient attorney performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">\n<em>d. Failure to seek mental health evaluation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AKO\">\u00b618 Thee claims that defense counsel \u201cfailed to have him evaluated by any mental health counselors to determine his competency.\u201d The court record shows that defense counsel requested and the court authorized a mental health examination. Although a copy of the report by forensic psychologist Dr. Green is not included in the record on appeal, defense counsel described the results of the evaluation in his response to Thee\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief. According to Olson, Dr. Green concluded \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt not only that the defendant was fully competent to understand the charges against him and to assist in his own defense, but that the defendant did not suffer from a mental disease or defect either at the time of the offense or at any other relevant time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">\u00b619 We indulge a presumption that counsel\u2019s actions fall within the wide range of reasonable and sound professional assistance. Contrary to Thee\u2019s allegations, defense counsel sought and obtained a court-ordered mental health evaluation of his client. In this case, it appears defense counsel took the unequivocal findings of the mental health evaluation into consideration when advising Thee to accept the plea agreement. We find no deficiency in defense counsel\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\n<em>e. Failure to inform defendant of a lesser included offense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A5z\">\u00b620 Thee claims his decision to change his plea to guilty to deliberate homicide was neither voluntary nor intelligent because the decision was not based upon a complete understanding of the plea\u2019s punitive implications. Thee asserts he would have insisted upon going to trial had Olson informed him of the possibility that a jury could convict him of a lesser included offense, specifically mitigated deliberate homicide under \u00a7 45-5-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">\u00b621 At the change of plea hearing on April 17,1998, the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>judge probed Thee\u2019s understanding of the implications of changing his plea.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\">THE COURT: Did you read the plea agreement over before signing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">THE DEFENDANT: It was read to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">THE COURT: Did you enter the plea agreement voluntarily?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkH\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, I was broken up at the time, but yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">THE COURT: Well, I mean, at the time is one thing. But we\u2019re here now. And this is an opportunity to tell the court whether or not you voluntarily are going to go forward with the plea agreement. I don\u2019t want you to feel that we\u2019re forcing you to enter into this plea agreement. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">\u00b622 The court proceeded to query Thee in detail regarding his understanding of the punishment outlined in the plea agreement. The court specifically asked Thee whether he understood he waived certain rights by pleading guilty, including the right to trial by jury or bench trial, the right to assistance of counsel through the trial process, the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, the right not to be compelled to testify against himself, the right to require his guilt be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and the right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">\u00b623 The colloquy encompassed a discussion of lesser included offenses, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-11\">THE COURT: And you also have the right to submit an instruction to the jury regarding lesser included offenses if they would apply. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-12\">THE DEFENDANT: I don\u2019t remember what me and you were talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-13\">THE COURT: Do you have a question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-14\">(WHEREUPON, the defendant conferred with Mr. Olson.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-15\">The transcript provides no further reference to lesser included offenses and Thee\u2019s grasp of the concept remains ambiguous in the court record.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqo\">\u00b624  Failure of an attorney to inform a client of the relevant law constitutes deficient performance under the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. <em>Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 62, 106 S.Ct. at 372, 88 L.Ed.2d at 212. However, included offenses are not relevant to Thee\u2019s situation. Neither mitigated deliberate homicide nor negligent homicide are included offenses of deliberate homicide as defined in \u00a7 45-5-102(1)(b), MCA. Sections 45-5-103(3) and 45-5-104(2), MCA(1997). Because Thee was charged with deliberate homicide under the \u201cfelony murder\u201d rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>of \u00a7 45-5-102(1)(b), MCA, neither mitigated deliberate homicide nor negligent homicide was considered a lesser included offense. Consequently, Thee did not waive a right to a jury instruction on a lesser included offense when he waived his right to a trial. Olson had no duty to inform Thee about the possibility of conviction at trial of a lesser included offense when such a possibility did not legally exist. Thee\u2019s claim that he pleaded guilty involuntarily because his attorney did not inform him of the possibility of a lesser included offense carries no legal weight. We find no error in the District Court\u2019s finding that Thee voluntarily changed his plea to guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">\u00b625 The record provides substantial evidence to support the District Court\u2019s findings that Douglas Thee changed his plea intelligently and voluntarily and that Thee was afforded effective assistance of counsel. We hold none of the challenged actions of defense counsel fall outside the \u201cwide range of reasonable and sound professional assistance\u201d set forth by the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. Because we find no deficiency in defense counsel performance, prejudice has no pertinence. We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b481-6\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER, NELSON, COTTER and RE.GNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
