We deny the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u00b62 The following issues are raised:</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">\u00b63 Does \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA, apply to parole revocation proceedings? \u00b64 Is the Petitioner entitled to good time credits?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">\u00b65 Is the Petitioner entitled to credit for time served?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A4T\">\u00b66 On March 24,1987, the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, sentenced Gundrum to a term of ten years at the Montana State Prison (MSP), with six suspended, for the felony offense of Issuing a Bad Check. On May 3,1989, the court sentenced Gundrum to a term of sixteen years at MSP, with twelve suspended, for the felony offenses of Burglary and Forgery. Gundrum\u2019s suspended sentences were subsequently revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">\u00b67 The parole hoard granted Gundrum parole, however law enforcement authorities arrested Gundrum on a parole violation warrant on April 20, 2000. The Department of Corrections returned Gundrum to MSP and, after a hearing, the parole board revoked Gundrum\u2019s parole. Gundrum filed a writ of habeas corpus challenging the procedure underlying the revocation of his parole as well as the Department of Corrections\u2019 calculation of good time credits and credit for time served.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">\u00b68 Does \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA, apply to parole revocation proceedings?</p>\n<p id=\"AMV\">\u00b69 Subject to limitations, the writ of habeas corpus permits every person imprisoned or otherwise restrained of liberty to inquire into the cause of imprisonment or restraint and, if illegal, to be delivered from the imprisonment or restraint. Section 46-22-101(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-13\">\u00b610 Gundrum first alleges that he is illegally restrained because he was not afforded a probable cause hearing within 36 hours of his arrest as provided in \u00a7 46-23-1012(4), MCA (1999), and discussed in <em>State v. Giddings, </em>2001 MT 76, 305 Mont. 74, 29 P.3d 475, and <em>State v. Goebel, </em>2001 MT 155, 306 Mont. 83, 31 P.3d 340. In support of his argument, Gundrum points to the following language from our decision in <em>Goebel:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUa\">[T]he statute applies to those individuals whose <em>probation or </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number><em>parole </em>was revoked between April 28, 1999, the effective date of \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA (1999), and May 1, 2001, the effective date of \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA (2001).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><em>Goebel, </em>\u00b6 31 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u00b611 The State claims that this language in <em>Goebel </em>referring to \u201cprobation or parole\u201d revocations is an error. The State claims \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA, applies only to probation violation proceedings. As such, the State argues that \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA, <em>Giddings </em>and <em>Goebel </em>do not apply to Gundrum\u2019s arrest for parole violations or his parole revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\u00b612  We agree with the State. Section 46-23-1012, MCA, governs arrests when violations of probation are alleged, while a separate statute, \u00a7 46-23-1023, MCA, governs arrests of alleged parole violators. In addition, both <em>Giddings </em>and <em>Goebel </em>dealt with probation violations rather than parole violations. Therefore, we conclude that our reference to parole revocation proceedings in <em>Goebel </em>was an error, and we hold that \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA, applies only to probation revocation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u00b613  Here, Gundrum\u2019s parole, rather than probation, was revoked. Accordingly, \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA, does not apply to Gundrum\u2019s parole revocation proceedings, and he was not entitled to a probable cause hearing within 36 hours of his arrest. We conclude that Gundrum is thus legally incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">\u00b614 Is the Petitioner entitled to good time credits?</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">\u00b615 Gundrum was arrested on April 20, 2000, for a parole violation and incarcerated. He was then returned to MSP on June 2, 2000. He claims that while the parole board awarded him credit for time served for these 43 days, it did not award good time credits. Citing <em>MacPheat v. Mahoney, </em>2000 MT 62, 299 Mont. 46,997 P.2d 753, Gundrum claims he is entitled to good time credits for the 43 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">\u00b616 The State claims that the Department of Corrections has recently re-evaluated its good time policy, and it will award Gundrum the good time credits he seeks if appropriate under the new policy. We conclude that Gundrum remains legally incarcerated during this process.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">\u00b617 Is the Petitioner entitled to credit for time served?</p>\n<p id=\"b120-12\">\u00b618 Gundrum was placed on probation on August 11, 1992, and a bench warrant was issued for his arrest on probation violations on December 7, 1993. Gundrum claims that he should receive credit for this period of time under \u00a7 46-18-402, MCA, even though he was not incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-13\">\u00b619  The State responds that under \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(b), MCA, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number><em>McDermott v. Montana Dept. of Corrections, </em>2001 MT 134, \u00b6 45, 305 Mont. 462, \u00b6 45, 29 P.3d 992, \u00b6 45, a judge has complete discretion to consider the elapsed time that an offender is on probation, and he or she may either expressly allow or reject the time as credit on the offender\u2019s sentence. The State contends that Gundrum does not assert that the sentencing court failed to follow the mandates of \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">\u00b620 We agree. First, Gundrum admits he was not incarcerated during this time. Rather, he was released on probation. Consequently, \u00a7 46-18-402, MCA, pertaining to an award of credit for time served while imprisoned is inapplicable. Second, \u00a7 46-18-201(4), MCA, governs the revocation of Gundrum\u2019s suspended sentences and allows a district court judge to reject all or part of the time an offender serves on probation as a credit against his sentence. Here, the District Court stated in its May 22, 1997, Order of Revocation, Judgment and Sentence that given the nature of Gundrum\u2019s violations and the magnitude of his financial obligations, he was not to be given credit for time otherwise served on probation. Accordingly, Gundrum is not entitled to credit for time he was released on probation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak19\">\u00b621 Since Gundrum fails to demonstrate that the cause of his imprisonment or restraint is illegal, his writ of habeas corpus is hereby denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">DATED this 6th day of December, 2001.</p>\n<judges id=\"b121-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, REGNIER, NELSON, COTTER, TRIEWEILER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
