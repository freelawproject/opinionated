Langton, to set aside an order of suppression excluding the admission of a blood test and its results obtained for medical treatment purposes bearing on the question of whether Defendant Linda Llewellyn (\u201cLlewellyn\u201d) was under the Influence of alcohol on September 28, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">\u00b62 The petition for writ of supervisory control presents the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">\u00b63 1. Whether we should exercise jurisdiction in this matter?</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred in suppressing Llewellyn\u2019s blood test results obtained by medical authorities for emergency treatment purposes when Llewellyn refused to consent to a blood test pursuant to a police officer\u2019s request under Montana\u2019s implied consent statute?</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">\u00b65 We assume supervisory control, reverse the District Court\u2019s Order granting Llewellyn\u2019s motion to suppress and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">\u00b66 On September 28, 2000, Llewellyn allegedly rear-ended another vehicle stopped at a red light at the intersection of Eastside Highway and Highway 93 in Ravalli County. Llewellyn, who suffered significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>injuries as a result of the accident, refused to submit to a breath test at the scene. She was then transported to the emergency room of the Community Medical Center in Missoula County for treatment. While undergoing treatment, Llewellyn was asked by a Montana highway patrol officer to provide a blood sample for analysis pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA (1999). Llewellyn refused and her refusal was documented by the officer. However, during the course of emergency room treatment, blood was drawn from Llewellyn upon the order of a physician for purposes of medical diagnosis and treatment. The lab tests revealed a blood alcohol content above the legal allowable limit. The results were obtained by the prosecution pursuant to an investigative subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">\u00b67 Llewellyn filed a motion to suppress the admission of the blood test obtained for medical diagnosis and treatment purposes claiming that the State could not show compliance with the required administrative procedures in the collection of the blood test for evidentiary purposes; and that she withdrew her consent to a blood test. The State responded and contended that blood tests taken for medical diagnosis and treatment purposes are admissible as \u201cother competent evidence\u201d pursuant to our decision in <em>State v. Newill </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 84, 946 P.2d 134, and \u00a7 61-8-404, MCA (1999). The District Court granted Llewellyn\u2019s motion concluding our decision in <em>Newill </em>was distinguishable from the case at hand since the defendant in <em>Newill </em>consented to a blood test unlike Llewellyn; and thus, admitting Llewellyn\u2019s blood test results obtained for medical treatment purposes would \u201crender null and void her right to refuse consent\u201d provided by \u00a7 61-8-402(4), MCA (1999). The District Court then concluded that \u201cother competent evidence\u201d could include eye witness testimony concerning Llewellyn\u2019s manner of driving, appearance, gait, breath smell, etc., but could not include blood analysis for medical treatment purposes when Llewellyn had previously exercised her statutory right and refused to submit to a blood test for purposes of determining her blood alcohol content (\u201cBAC\u201d). The District Court concluded that to allow the admission of such evidence would permit an end run around the implied consent statutes which the Montana Legislature could not have intended. The District Court did not address whether applicable administrative procedures were followed in collecting Llewellyn\u2019s blood test. Subsequently, the State filed the petition for writ of supervisory control before us contending that the District Court\u2019s order of suppression is directly contrary to our decision in <em>Newill.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">\u00b68 Where the facts are not in dispute, our review of a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress is plenary as to whether the district court correctly interpreted and applied the law. <em>State v. Devlin, </em>1999 MT 90, \u00b67, 294 Mont. 215, \u00b67, 980 P.2d 1037, \u00b67 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">\u00b69 Whether we should exercise jurisdiction in this matter?</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">\u00b610  Supervisory control is appropriate when a \u201cdistrict court is proceeding based on a mistake of law which, if uncorrected, would cause significant injustice, and where the remedy by appeal is inadequate.\u201d <em>Park v. Montana Sixth Judicial District Court, </em>1998 MT 164, \u00b613, 289 Mont. 367, \u00b613, 961 P.2d 1267, \u00b613. Given the State\u2019s limited ability to appeal an evidentiary ruling, we have previously exercised supervisory control to prevent the introduction of evidence where correction of the ruling by a later court decision would be ineffective. <em>State ex rel. Mazurek v. District Court of Montana Fourth Judicial District </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 349, 353, 922 P.2d 474, 477. As subsequently discussed herein, we conclude that the District Court is proceeding under a mistake of law. Additionally, if the District Court\u2019s mistake of law is left uncorrected, the State would be without an adequate remedy on appeal. Accordingly, we grant the State\u2019s petition and accept original jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Article VII, Section 2(2), Montana Constitution, and Rule 17(a), M.R.App.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">\u00b611 Whether the District Court erred in suppressing Llewellyn\u2019s blood test results obtained by medical authorities for emergency treatment purposes when Llewellyn refused to consent to a blood test pursuant to a police officer\u2019s request under Montana\u2019s implied consent statute?</p>\n<p id=\"AjN\">\u00b612 Section 61-8-402, MCA (1999), commonly known as Montana\u2019s implied consent statute, governs the consensual collection of blood or breath test samples from persons arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs pursuant to a request from a peace officer. Subsection (10) expressly states that \u201c[t]his section does not apply to blood ... tests, samples, and analyses used for purposes of medical treatment or care of an injured motorist....\u201d In <em>Newill </em>we specifically addressed the applicability of Montana\u2019s implied consent laws relative to blood drawn for medical diagnosis and treatment of an injured motorist and concluded \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA (1995), does not apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>blood tests taken for medical treatment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\">\u00b613 The Defendant in <em>Newill </em>suffered head injuries in an automobile accident. During treatment at the hospital, the attending physician took a blood sample for diagnostic and treatment purposes as part of normal hospital procedure. Newill had previously consented to a blood sample under implied consent procedures when requested by an officer, but was medically unable to give one. Evidence of Newill\u2019s blood analysis taken by the physician was admitted into evidence and Newill appealed. Newill contended that the blood samples taken for medical purposes should not be admitted as evidence of her blood alcohol content.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">\u00b614 We determined in <em>Newill </em>that the Montana Legislature had provided evidentiary provisions for the admissibility of blood tests taken for medical treatment purposes in \u00a7 61-8-404(1)(a), MCA (1995), which provides \u201cevidence of any measured amount or detected presence of alcohol or drugs in the person at the time of the act alleged, as shown by an analysis of the person\u2019s blood ... is admissible\u201d; and \u00a7 61-8-404(3), MCA (1995), which states that \u201c[t]he provisions of this part do not limit the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing on the question of whether the person was under the influence of <em>alcohol...\u201d Newill, </em>285 Mont. at 88-89, 946 P.2d at 136-137. We also determined that the foundational requirements of \u00a7 61-8-404(1)(b), MCA (1995), were inapplicable to blood tests taken for medical treatment purposes since those requirements applied only to tests administered pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA (1995). <em>Newill, 285 </em>Mont. at 89, 946 P.2d at 137. Then, the only question left for us to determine in <em>Newill </em>was whether the blood test taken at the hospital pursuant to a request by Newill\u2019s treating physician was admissible as \u201cother competent evidence\u201d under \u00a7 61-8-404(3), MCA (1995). Accordingly, we examined the skills of the medical personnel involved and concluded that the blood test was admissible as other competent evidence bearing on whether Newill was under the influence of alcohol. <em>Newill, </em>285 Mont. at 89, 946 P.2d at 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\u00b615 We point out that \u00a7 61-8-404(1)(a), MCA (1995), was amended in 1999 substituting the language stating \u201cthe act alleged\u201d to \u201ca test\u201d. In addition, \u00a7 61-8-404(1)(b), MCA (1995), was amended in 1997, deleting the provision \u201cadministered under 61-8-402\u201d. Section 61-8-404(1)(b), MCA (1999), states \u201ca report of the facts and results of one or more tests of a person\u2019s blood or breath is admissible in evidence if ....\u201d Consequently, the foundational requirements of \u00a7 61-8-404(1)(b)(ii), MCA (1999), and \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA (1999), as necessitated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>competency requirement of \u00a7 61-8-404(1)(b)(ii), MCA (1999), are applicable to the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">\u00b616 Although the statute was amended, the resolution of this petition is controlled by our decision in <em>Newill. </em>While it is true, as the District Court correctly recognized, that Newill did provide consent to the officer to have a blood sample taken for determining her BAC and Llewellyn did not, the criteria for admissibility under \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA (1999), relating to blood tests administered under the implied consent statute are inapplicable to diagnostic blood tests taken by a hospital or treating physician. Therefore, we see no legally relevant distinction between the facts presented here and the facts we confronted in <em>Newill. </em>We thus conclude that the District Court\u2019s order of suppression conflicts with our decision in <em>Newill.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u00b617  Here, there are additional competency requirements, arising from the 1997 amendment to \u00a7 61-8-404, MCA (1995), that were not at issue in <em>Newill. </em>The foundational requirements of \u00a7 61-8-404(1)(b)(ii), MCA (1999), and \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA (1999), must be applied to the case at hand to ascertain competency of the evidence. We note that the administration of a blood test for medical treatment purposes need not be conducted at the request of a peace officer as required by \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA (1999), since such a requirement is only applicable to blood tests conducted pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA (1999), whereby \u00a7 61-8-402(2)(a), MCA (1999), requires that blood tests administered pursuant to that section \u201cmust be administered at the direction of a peace officer\u201d. Further, a defendant charged with driving under the influence of alcohol is entitled to procedural safeguards contained in the Administrative Rules of Montana. <em>See State v. Incashola, </em>1998 MT 184, \u00b68, 289 Mont. 399, \u00b68, 961 P.2d 745, \u00b68 (citation omitted). Accordingly, the Administrative Rules of Montana, specifically Rule 23.4.220, ARM, regarding the collection of blood samples for drug and/or alcohol analysis must be applied to the case at hand to determine if the blood test is competent evidence. However, the requirement of Rule 23.4.220(1), ARM, that a blood sample be collected \u201cupon written request of a peace officer or officer of the court\u201d does not apply to a blood test conducted for medical treatment purposes, as that requirement applies to blood tests conducted pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\u00b618 Hence, the question remaining is whether the medical blood test taken for medical treatment purposes is \u201ccompetent\u201d evidence for purposes of admissibility under \u00a7 61-4-404(3), MCA (1999). The District Court made no determination whether the evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>competent pursuant to the requirements of \u00a7 61-8-404(1)(b)(ii), MCA (1999), \u00a7 61-8-405, MCA (1999), and the Administrative Rules of Montana. Consequently, we are unable to reach a determination of the question presented by \u00a7 61-4-404(3), MCA (1999). Thus, we remand this case for such determination by the District Court. Therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\">\u00b619 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of supervisory control is GRANTED and that this case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\u00b620 The Clerk of Court is directed to mail a copy of this Order to all counsel of record and the Honorable Jeffrey H. Langton.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">DATED this 28th day of December, 2001.</p>\n<judges id=\"b519-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, NELSON, COTTER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b519-7\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"A0n\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">\u00b621 I concur with that part of the majority opinion which concludes that the foundational requirements found at \u00a7 61-8-404(l)(b)(ii), MCA (1999), and \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA (1999), are applicable to evidence of blood alcohol content regardless of whether the source is blood drawn pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, or for purposes of medical treatment. I would add that compliance with applicable administrative regulations is also necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">\u00b622 I dissent from that part of the majority opinion which concludes that blood test results obtained by medical providers are admissible to prove operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs even though the motorist from whom the blood was drawn refused to submit to similar tests when requested to do so by a peace officer and suffered the consequences of that refusal. I would affirm the District Court and reverse our prior decision in <em>State v. Newill </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 84, 946 P.2d 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">\u00b623 I conclude that \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, requires consent of a driver suspected of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol before tests can he administered to prove the presence of alcohol or drugs in a person\u2019s body. The consequences for denying that refusal are set forth in \u00a7 61-8-402(4), MCA. To hold, as the majority has done, that the consent requirement can be circumvented by going to the hospital and subpoenaing records of blood test results drawn -without the driver\u2019s consent renders the procedural requirements in \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, and the sanctions that it provides for failure to give consent meaningless. I would also conclude that the provision in subparagraph (10) which provides that this section does not apply to blood drawn for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>purposes of medical treatment refers to the assumption of consent provided for in subparagraph (1) and the sanctions for withdrawal of that assumed consent in subparagraph (4). To interpret subparagraph (10) as the majority does renders the statute internally inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"AJm\">\u00b624 Finally, I disagree that \u00a7 61-8-404(3), MCA, provides any comfort to the majority\u2019s position. Section 61-8-404, MCA, has simply been enacted to provide that the blood or breath evidence consented to in \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, is admissible in a judicial proceeding if the prescribed procedures are followed and the necessary foundation for admissibility is laid. Subparagraph (a) refers to any evidence of the measured amount of alcohol or drugs present and subparagraph (b) refers to a report of blood or breath test results. All of \u00a7 61-8-404, MCA, other than subparagraph (3), refers to blood or alcohol tests for the presence of alcohol in a person\u2019s body. Therefore, when subparagraph (3) refers to \u201cany other competent evidence,\u201d it necessarily refers to evidence other than breath or blood tests. For that reason, it cannot serve the purpose for which it is used by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\u00b625 Therefore, I dissent from that part of the majority opinion which construes \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-402 and -404, MCA, to permit the admission of blood test results taken for purposes of medical treatment from a motorist who has declined to submit to testing which would measure the presence of alcohol in that person\u2019s body and has already suffered the consequences for that refusal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
