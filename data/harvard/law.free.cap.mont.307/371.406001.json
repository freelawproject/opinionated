Olson and Pamela Olson (Olsons) in their declaratory judgment action. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">\u00b62 The following issue is presented on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">\u00b63 Does \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA, permit an injured employee of an uninsured employer to collect from the employer the amount of compensation the employee would have received had the employer been properly insured if the employee has admittedly received all of the workers\u2019 compensation benefits to which he is entitled from the State of Montana Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund?</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A83\">\u00b64 The parties agree that the material facts of this case are undisputed. The Olsons own Brimstone Creek Ranch (the Ranch) in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>north Lincoln County near Trego, Montana. Daughenbaugh began working at the Ranch as a ranch hand, and in April 1995 Daughenbaugh was thrown from a horse and injured while performing ranch duties. The Olsons did not carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance on Daughenbaugh. However, in October 1995 the parties negotiated a settlement agreement in which the Olsons agreed to pay Daughenbaugh\u2019s salary and medical expenses and to allow him to live on the ranch and continue his duties there for a specific period of time. In turn, Daughenbaugh signed a general release and indemnification agreement releasing all claims against the Olsons and agreeing to indemnify them against any claims arising from his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b65 Notwithstanding the general release and indemnity agreement, Daughenbaugh filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits with the Montana Department of Labor and Industry. Since the Olsons were uninsured, the Montana Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund (UEF) processed the claim and paid wage loss and other benefits to Daughenbaugh.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u00b66 On August 22, 1997, the Olsons filed a lawsuit seeking declaratory relief in the form of an order holding that the general release and indemnity agreement Daughenbaugh signed was valid and enforceable. Daughenbaugh responded that the agreement was unenforceable, and he filed a counterclaim alleging that, pursuant to the independent cause of action provided in \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA, he was entitled to recover directly from the Olsons damages in the amount of compensation that he would have received had the Olsons been properly enrolled in a workers\u2019 compensation insurance plan. Daughenbaugh also alleged negligence against the Olsons.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\u00b67 On May 20, 2000, Daughenbaugh filed a Petition/Order for Compromise and Release Settlement with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court (Petition). In the Petition, Daughenbaugh agreed to accept the sum of $5,000 from the Olsons for attorney\u2019s fees and $38,820.88 from the UEF (inclusive of sums already paid by the UEF) and to fully release and discharge the Olsons and the UEF from all obligations for benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Daughenbaugh acknowledged that the $38,820.88 represented his full entitlement to workers\u2019 compensation benefits arising from the injury had the Olsons been properly enrolled in a compensation plan. The Olsons agreed to reimburse the UEF in the amount of $38,820.88 plus pay a $2400 penalty for their failure to enroll in a proper workers\u2019 compensation plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">\u00b68 Finally, Daughenbaugh agreed to dismiss his pending negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>action against the Olsons. However, he reserved the portion of his counterclaim described above alleging that he was entitled to direct compensation from the Olsons under \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA. The parties agreed to resolve this issue in the district court. The District Court\u2019s decision granting the Olsons summary judgment on this issue is now before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u00b69 Does \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA, permit an injured employee of an uninsured employer to collect from the employer the amount of compensation the employee would have received had the employer been properly insured if the employee has admittedly received all of the workers\u2019 compensation benefits to which he is entitled from the State of Montana Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund?</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u00b610 The District Court\u2019s conclusion that the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>prevents an injured worker from being awarded duplicate compensation in competing forums is a conclusion of law. We review a district court\u2019s conclusion of law to determine if it is correct. <em>Neustrom v. Dept. of Labor &amp; Industry </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 179, 182, 939 P.2d 990, 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">\u00b611 Daughenbaugh\u2019s claim rests upon \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">(1) An injured employee or the employee\u2019s beneficiaries have an independent cause of action against an uninsured employer for failure to be enrolled in a compensation plan as required by this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">(4) The amount of recoverable damages in such an action is the amount of compensation that the employee would have received had the employer been properly enrolled under compensation plan No. 1, 2, or 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">(5) A plaintiff who prevails in an action brought under this section is entitled to recover reasonable costs and attorney fees incurred in the action, in addition to his damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">\u00b612 The District Court held that under the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>and our decision in <em>Neustrom, </em>283 Mont. at 186, 939 P.2d at 994, Daughenbaugh was not entitled to receive the benefits he would have received from the Olsons in an independent action pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA, since he had, admittedly, already received these benefits from the UEF. The court stated, \u201cDaughenbaugh is not now entitled to go back to a different forum to recover the same benefits he already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>received when the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court approved his settlement with the UEF. ... It is not the intent of the law to punish a noncomplying employer by requiring the employer to twice pay benefits and attorney fees for the same injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b613 On appeal, Daughenbaugh argues that this is precisely the intent of the law. Pursuant to the plain language of \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA, and <em>Thayer v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 </em>Fund, 1999 MT 304, 297 Mont. 179, 991 P.2d 447, Daughenbaugh claims that he may pursue an independent action against the Olsons regardless of the fact that the UEF paid him his full entitlement to workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Daughenbaugh contends that there is nothing in a fair reading of \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA, which bars pursuit of an independent cause of action if the injured employee has already received benefits from the UEF. Furthermore, Daughenbaugh insists that the action provided for in \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA, is a \u201cpowerful and new\u201d cause of action independent of any other statutory scheme under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"AoC\">\u00b614 The Olsons, on the other hand, contend that the District Court\u2019s conclusion of law on this issue is correct. They maintain that Daughenbaugh already received his full entitlement to workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the UEF, and that the Olsons agreed to repay the UEF for these sums, pay a penalty fee, and pay $5000 for Daughenbaugh\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. The Olsons assert that they have \u201cpaid their penance.\u201d In addition, they dispute Daughenbaugh\u2019s claim that \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA, is independent from other workers\u2019 compensation statutes, and the Olsons argue that according to the legislative history of \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA, and our decisions in <em>Thayer </em>and <em>Neustrom, </em>Daughenbaugh is not entitled to \u201cdouble dip\u201d workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b615  We agree. Daughenbaugh seeks full compensation for his work-related injury twice-once from the UEF and again from the Olsons. We hold that \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA, does not allow for a double recovery of workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u00b616 At the outset, we address Daughenbaugh\u2019s contention that \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA, is a \u201cpowerful and new\u201d cause of action independent of any other statutory scheme. This is simply not the case. Rather, \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA, is part of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act under \u00a7 39-71-101, MCA. It represents one component of a comprehensive workers\u2019 compensation scheme which provides a <em>quid pro quo </em>for employers who enroll in a workers\u2019 compensation plan and imposes significant and specific penalties upon employers who do not. <em>See Buerkley v. Aspen Meadows Ltd. Partnership, </em>1999 MT 97, \u00b6 16, 294 Mont. 263, \u00b6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>16, 980 P.2d 1046, \u00b6 16; \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-504, -507 and -509, MCA (providing penalties for uninsured employers). Where there are several statutory provisions or particulars, the Court construes them, if possible, to give effect to all. Section 1-2-101, MCA. Accordingly, we construe \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA, in conjunction with other relevant workers\u2019 compensation provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">\u00b617 Having said that, Montana employees, under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, have several options for recovery when they are injured at work and their employer is uninsured. Section 39-71-508, MCA, coordinates these remedies. It states that an injured worker may pursue all remedies concurrently, including but not limited to: (1) a claim for benefits from the uninsured employers\u2019 fund; (2) a damage action against the employer in accordance with \u00a7 39-71-509, MCA; (3) an independent action against an employer as provided in \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA; or (4) any other civil remedy provided by law. Section 39-71-508, MCA. The plain language of this section indicates an injured employee may pursue these remedies concurrently-not duplicatively, as Daughenbaugh suggests. Indeed, Daughenbaugh\u2019s rationale would lead to the absurd result that an injured employee could be compensated four or more times for his injury. This Court has previously held that when construing statutes, the interpretation should be reasonable to avoid absurd results. <em>Doting v. Trunk </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 343, 351, 856 P.2d 536, 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u00b618 Furthermore, despite Daughenbaugh\u2019s assertions to the contrary, there is no indication that the legislature intended to provide for a \u201cdouble recovery\u201d when permitting an injured employee to concurrently seek benefits from the UEF and the uninsured employer. On February 11,1985, the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on House Bill No. 529 regarding proposed statutory amendments drafted to address the compensation problem that injured employees of uninsured employers faced due to the UEF\u2019s insolvency. A proponent of House Bill No. 529 stated that the intent behind permitting concurrent actions in \u00a7 39-71-508, MCA, was to \u201ctake away incentive from employers not to cover and provide an injured person three ways to try to get compensated for their injuries with the understanding that he <em>is only going to be compensated one </em>time.\u201d <em>See </em>testimony of Karl Englund, minutes of hearing on HB 529, House Judiciary Committee, February 11, 1985, p. 5 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u00b619 Our previous decisions mirror this rationale. In <em>Thayer v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>a workers\u2019 compensation claimant received a $100,000 settlement from her husband\u2019s uninsured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>employer. <em>Thayer, </em>\u00b6 9. Subsequently, the UEF discontinued payment of her death benefits under \u00a7 39-71-511, MCA, a setoff provision requiring a claimant to discharge her remaining claims against the UEF if she receives such a settlement. <em>Thayer, </em>\u00b6 10. We held that the claimant was not entitled to recover from both the UEF and the uninsured employer because the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund is merely a safety net which stands in the place of the uninsured employer, and the setoff provisions are uniquely necessary to assure some payment to as many uninsured employees as possible. <em>Thayer, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22, 24. Consequently, a double recovery was not permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b620 Daughenbaugh, however, encourages the Court to focus its attention on the timing of events in <em>Thayer </em>rather than the general proposition that a double recovery is forbidden. He claims that here, unlike in <em>Thayer, </em>the UEF paid all the benefits to which he was entitled <em>before </em>he sought a settlement from the Olsons, and, as such, a double recovery in this case is just. However, our decision in <em>Neustrom, </em>which Daughenbaugh fails to address, explains that regardless of the timing of events, a double recovery is not permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"A5O\">\u00b621 In <em>Neustrom, </em>an injured employee filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits alleging that he was Neustrom\u2019s employee at the time he was injured. <em>Neustrom, </em>283 Mont. at 181, 939 P.2d at 991. He also filed a \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA, independent action against Neustrom. <em>Neustrom, </em>283 Mont. at 181,939 P.2d at 991. Following the UEF\u2019s determination that the alleged employee was in fact Neustrom\u2019s employee, Neustrom petitioned the District Court to vacate this finding. <em>Neustrom, </em>283 Mont. at 181-82, 939 P.2d at 991-92. We held that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to vacate the decision of the UEF. We concluded that, under Montana\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the employee\u2019s independent action and claim for unemployment benefits proceeded along two separate and exclusive tracks: the independent action in the district court and the unemployment benefits action in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. <em>Neustrom, </em>283 Mont. at 186, 939 P.2d at 994. Furthermore, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">The Act\u2019s plain requirement that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court decide issues related to UEF claims and the district court decide issues related to the \u201cindependent action\u201d will not, as is impliedly argued in the briefs, create potentially inconsistent results. The claimant must initiate both claims and is bound by principles of res judicata or collateral estoppel by the decision of the first venue to arrive at a decision. The claimant must take that reality into consideration when making a decision about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>which claim to file, or the timing of each claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><em>Neustrom, </em>283 Mont. at 186, 939 P.2d at 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b622 The doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>is grounded on the principle that litigation must at some point come to an end. It bars the relitigation of an entire cause of action once a final judgment has been entered. <em>Res judicata </em>applies if: (1) the parties or their privies are the same; (2) the subject matter of the action is the same; (3) the issues are the same and relate to the same subject matter; and (4) the capacities of the persons are the same in reference to the subject matter and to the issues. <em>Holtman v. 4-G\u2019s Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc. </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 432, 436, 872 P.2d 318, 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\u00b623  Here, under \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-508 and -515, MCA, <em>Neustrom </em>and the doctrine of <em>res judicata, </em>Daughenbaugh could pursue a claim for benefits from the UEF and an independent action against the Olsons at the same time. However, Daughenbaugh was bound by the decision of the first venue to arrive at a decision-here, the UEF\u2019s decision to pay Daughenbaugh the full the amount of compensation that he would have received had the Olsons been properly insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u00b624  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court correctly concluded that \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA, does not permit an injured employee of an uninsured employer to collect from the employer the amount of compensation the employee would have received had the employer been properly insured if the employee has admittedly received all of the workers\u2019 compensation benefits to which he is entitled from the State of Montana Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund. We affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Olsons.</p>\n<judges id=\"b400-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, TRIEWEILER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
