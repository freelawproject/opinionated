Thereupon defendant, upon affidavits tending to show his residence in this State (among which affidavits were those of his wife, his daughter, and himself), obtained an order requiring plaintiff to show cause why the attachment should not be set aside. Thereupon plaintiff\u2019s attorney served on defendant\u2019s attorney a notice to produce on the hearing of the motion to vacate, affidavits of the defendant, his wife and daughter, as to certain particulars in the notice specified, all bearing on the question of residence. The notice, if complied with, would have operated in some measure as a cross-examination. When the motion came on to be heard, defendant declined to produce the affidavits called for by the notice. Thereupon an order was made, which after reciting the giving of the notice, and the declination of defendant\u2019s attorneys to comply therewith, and that the court was \u201c <em>desirous </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number><em>of being advised on the facts f </em>and that the plaintiff\u2019s attorney applied for an order appointing a referee to take the testimony of defendant, his wife, and daughter, to be used upon motion, and that counsel for defendant had been heard in opposition thereto, did, upon the reading and filing of said notice, and proof of service thereto on the defendant\u2019s attorney, order a reference to take, for the purpose of being used on said motion, the affidavits of defendant, his wife, and daughter, as to the particulars specified in the said notice, and ordered defendant, his wife, and daughter, to appear before the referee for the purpose of such examination, on ten days\u2019 notice to the defendant\u2019s attorney.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-5\">From this order the defendant appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-6\"><em>Wilson &amp; </em>Wallace, attorneys, and <em>William G. </em>Wilson, of counsel for appellant, urged :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWA8\">I. The court had no power to make the order in question. 1. No foundation had been laid for the granting of such order. The Code (\u00a7 401, subdivision 7) furnishes the only authority for such an order, and prescribes the mode in which it can be obtained ; it requires (1) that a party shall intend to oppose a motion ; <em>(2) </em>that it shall be necessary for him to have the affidavit of some person for that purpose ; and (3) that that person has refused to make the same. And the court should be satisfied by \u201ccompetent and sufficient proof,\u201d that these requirements are met in the case before it, before such order can be made (Moses <em>v. </em>Banker, 34 <em>How. Pr. 212 </em>; Cockey <em>v. </em>Hurd, 14 <em>Abb. N. S. </em>183; Erie Railway Co. <em>v. </em>Gould, <em>Id. </em>279). But-in the present case none of these requirements are met. There is no evidence (1) that, the plaintiffs had any intention of opposing the defendant\u2019s motion, or of doing anything more than embarrassing and delay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>ing his application to the court; or (2) that the affidavits asked for, or any affidavits, are necessary to the plaintiff; or (3) that any of the persons named have refused to make the affidavits asked for, or that any affidavits have been drawn or presented to them. The plaintiffs\u2019 application was based solely on the service upon the defendant Snyder\u2019s attorneys of the notice, requiring them, to produce affidavits of the defendant Snyder, and of his wife and daughter, and on the failure of such attorneys to produce such affidavits. This paper is ineffectual for any purpose. 2. It is attempted to save the order by the introduction of the recital; \u201c the court being desirous of being advised on the facts,\u201d but this attempt will be futile. The preceding recitals of the order show that the application was based on section 401 of \u00a1he Code, as in fact it was. But that section gives no authority to court or judge to order a reference, unless the above mentioned requirements have been complied with fully. Nor is there any authority by which the court, of its own motion, can order such a reference. By section 271, subdivision 3, the court may, on the application of either party, or of its own motion, direct a reference \u201cwhere a question of fact, other than upon the pleadings, shall arise upon a motion or otherwise, in any stage of the action.\u201d But this section cannot be held to authorize the order in question, for here there was no question of fact; the motion had never been argued; the facts on which the defendant\u2019s motion was based had not been presented to the court; all that had come before the court was the plaintiffs\u2019 application to procure affidavits with which to oppose such motion when it should come to be argued\u2014necessarily such application is preliminary to any such question of fact arising on the motion. Furthermore, the order itself does not recite that any such question of fact had arisen, but recites the application for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>affidavits, and, in fact, no such question had arisen.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b354-5\"><em>Martin &amp; Smith, </em>attorneys, and <em>Aaron Pennington </em>Whitehead, of counsel for respondent urges :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-6\">I. This reference is made under section 271 of the Code of Procedure: \u201c \u00a7 271. <em>When reference may he compulsorily ordered. </em>Where the parties do not consent, the court may, upon the <em>application of </em>either, <em>or of its own </em>motion, except where the investigation will require the decision of difficult questions of law, direct a reference in the following cases : \u201d...... 3. Where a question of fact other than upon the pleadings shall arise, upon motion or otherwise, in any stage of the action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-9\">II. This case clearly comes not only within the language, but also within the spirit and intent of that section. There was a question of fact to be decided, namely: Where did the defendant, Snyder, live? The court had the right to refer the matter to a referee to take the testimony of the defendant, Snyder, and his wife and daughter, for its own information. The order recites as follows : \u201c And the court being desirous of being advised on the facts.\u201d This subdivision of section 271 of the Code, was framed for the purpose of enabling the court to ascertain the exact facts on a motion, where there was doubt or danger of being imposed upon. The course taken by the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, in serving notice of demand for further affidavits, was for the purpose of bringing the matter in the best manner before the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-10\">III. The order is in furtherance of justice, as the defendant evidently is unwilling to disclose the real fact as to his residence.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"pAB9\"> Notes by Reporters.\u2014The point as to whether the court, either on its own motion or on application of a party, can order a reference under subdivision 3 of \u00a7 271, upon the mere suggestion that a question of fact is involved, or whether it must be satisfied, after a hearing or examination of the papers on the motion, that there is such a conflict of testimony, as, in its discretion, renders a reference either necessary or proper, before it can exercise the power, was not distinctly passed on by the court. The appeal papers did not present it. The recital in the order \u201cthat the court was desirous of being advised on the facts,\u201d carried with it, as held by the court, a declaration not only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>that a question of fact was involved, but that the court had so sufficiently heard or examined the papers, as to determine that a reference was necessary to satisfactorily decide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">The appeal book showed nothing to contravene this effect of the recital in question ; the other recitals not being necessarily in conflict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b351-13\"> A point which may possibly arise under sub. 3 of \u00a7 271, viz.: As to whether the proper form of the order of reference is not to take such evidence as either party may adduce, was not considered or passed on.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b354-11\">By the Court.\u2014Van Vorst, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AF8\">The order appealed from, among other things, recites, \u201cthat the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>court being desirous of being advised on the facts,\u201d ordered that a referee be appointed to take the affidavits of the persons named to be used on the motion. This is only another way of stating that a question of fact had arisen on the motion. In such case the court, upon the application of either of the parties, or upon its own motion, could order a reference (Code, \u00a7 271).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Sach direction is in the interest of truth; the motion being pending, and brought on for hearing, and a conflict as to questions of fact appearing, it was proper for the judge, if he desired further to be advised of the facts, so as properly to dispose of the matter, to direct a reference to ascertain the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Although all the papers are not before us, sufficient appears to indicate what the disputed facts were. They bore upon the question of the residence of the defendant, C. Brown Snyder, against whose property attachments had- been obtained, on the alleged ground of his non-residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The defendants had moved, upon ex parte affidavits, to set aside the attachments, and the court directed a reference, so as to be advised of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">The points as to which inquiry was to be made, are fully stated in the order. They all relate to the question of the residence of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">The order is, however, defective, in directing that the affidavit of the defendant should be taken. King v. Leighton (58 N. <em>Y. </em>883), is an authority to the effect, that a party to an action cannot be compelled to submit to an examination, at the instance of the adverse party, save as a general witness in the cause. The order appealed from should be modified, by striking out the direction to the referee to examine the defendant, and it is otherwise affirmed, but without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">Curtis, J., concurred..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
