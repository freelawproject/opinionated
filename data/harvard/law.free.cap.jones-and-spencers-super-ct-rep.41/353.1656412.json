The defects shown in the notice of motion az'e vital. The defendant is as much in the dark as before the bill of particulars was served. A bill of particulars should set forth with all practicable particularity, the <em>date, amount, </em>and <em>general character </em>of each item (Kellogg v. Paine, 8 <em>How. </em>329. See note to Brewster <em>v. </em>Sackett, 1 <em>Cow. </em>572, where all the cases are collected). Time is material (Quin <em>v. </em>Astor, 2 <em>Wend. </em>577; Humphrey v. Cottleyou, 4 <em>Cow. 54). </em>The rule is the same whether the action is in contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>or tort (See Humphrey v. Cottleyou, last above cited, which was an action in trover. See also Tilton v. Beecher, 59 <em>N. Y. </em>176). The opposing affidavit does not show that it is impossible to give dates. The last three items of damage set forth in the bill should certainly be limited as to the time within which the damages accrued, for they must necessarily have a direct relation to the number of days the plaintiff\u2019s occupation of the premises was interfered with.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-5\">II. The office of the bill of particulars is to limit the proof (Kreiss v. Seligman, 8 <em>Barb. </em>439. See p. 440 S. C., 5 <em>How. </em>425). Under the bill furnished the plaintiff may, in case of evil intent, add indefinitely to the articles alleged to have been damaged, and vary as he may think necessary the articles themselves. The court will at once perceive that there is a wide scope given to the plaintiff to vary his demand to suit the exigencies of his case, while the defendant is kept in as much ignorance as he was before the bill was served. As the matter now stands, it will be impossible for the defendant to show or propose to show that any estimated damage of the plaintiff is incorrect.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b363-6\"><em>Nehrbas &amp; Pitshke, </em>attorneys, and of counsel, for respondent, upon the points decided by the court, urged :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVv\">I. If, in the exercise of judicial discretion, the court sees that the knowledge of the occurrences on which the plaintiff\u2019s claim rests, is more with the defendant than with the plaintiff, it may refuse to require the latter to furnish <em>dates </em>or <em>minute </em>particulars, especially where the defendant has not <em>attempted </em>to dispute or explain the <em>acts </em>with which he is charged (Young v. DeMott, 1 <em>Barb. </em>30 ; Ives v. Shaw, 31 <em>How.). </em>Though the court has the power, it may refuse on the merits (Tilton v. Beecher, 48 <em>How. </em>175) ; this is a matter in the discretion of the judge, upon hearing both parties, and <em>considering all the circumstances of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number><em>case </em>(Humphrey <em>v. </em>Cottelyou, 4 <em>Cow. </em>54). Since a bill of particulars <em>limits </em>the right of recovery to the items stated (Bowman <em>v. </em>Earle, 3 Duer, 691), the court may well accept the plaintiff\u2019s description as sufficient, \u201cas it would often amount to a denial of justice, if a party who had been injured by another should be deprived of all remedy, unless he could <em>describe, </em>with accuracy, every article\u201d (Blackie <em>v. </em>Neilson, 6 <em>Bosw. </em>681).</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-5\">The court might deem it unreasonable to require the plaintiff to go through his entir <em>ebusiness-stock </em>and have the specific injuries estimated as to each, by appraisement\u2014all having been more or less damaged, by the elements, while plaintiff\u2019s premises were <em>open </em>as aforesaid. It is hardly proper to force him to do that by <em>anticipation </em>(Murphy <em>v. </em>Kipp, 1 <em>Duer, </em>659).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b364-6\">By the Court.\u2014Van Vorst, J.</author>\n<p id=\"As0\">The power of. the court to order a bill of particulars of the plaintiff\u2019s claim in an action of this character is not questioned. It is sanctioned by the Code, \u00a7 158, and by authority (Tilton v. Beecher, 59 <em>N. Y. </em>176).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">In Blackie v. Neilson (6 <em>Bos. </em>681), it is stated that in an action for the conversion of personal property the defendant is not entitled, as a matter of right, to require the plaintiff to furnish him with a particular statement or description of the chattels for the value of which the action is brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">But in the discretion of the court such description, -in the nature of a bill of particulars, may be ordered (Fullerton <em>v. </em>Gaylord, 7 <em>Robt. </em>551). Whether a statement of the particulars of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, when furnished voluntarily or by order of the court, is sufficiently explicit, or whether a further one should be ordered, is to be determined by the judge to whom the same is submitted for consideration, and its disposal rests in his sound discretion, on hearing both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>parties, under all the circumstances of the case (Humphrey <em>v. </em>Cottelyou, 4 <em>Cow. </em>54).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">In an action of trespass, by which the personal property and business of a party is damaged and injured, it might be exceedingly difficult to fix an unyielding estimate of specific damage, unless an appraisal was had by persons competent to judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The case differs essentially from <em>that </em>in which items of an account in an action upon contract, is asked for. There precision as to values and amounts can be readily acquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The amount of the plaintiff\u2019s damage to each article is in fact unadjusted, as also to his business, and can be ascertained only by a competent appraisal, or by the evidence on the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">The complaint states with sufficient explicitness the date of the trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">The plaintiff, in his affidavit, read on the motion, states that it would be difficult to give precise dates and amounts, since the aggressions of the defendant were a series of acts ; and that to specify all his injury, an inventory of his business must needs be taken, which would require time and labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">We are not disposed to interfere with the discretion exercised by Sedgwick, J., before whom the motion was heard, and who upon consideration denied the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">The order appealed from is affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">Curtis, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
