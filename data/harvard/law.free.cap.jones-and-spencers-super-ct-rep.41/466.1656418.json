The act of May 17, 1875,\u2014which provides for the discharge of a mechanic\u2019s lien upon a bond being filled,\u2014expressly enacts that its provisions shall not affect any proceedings taken before July 1, 1875. It is probable that this was not pointed out to the learned judge below, as it was only orally stated before the court on appeal, and is not upon the brief of appellant\u2019s counsel. Its effect clearly is to preserve the mechanic\u2019s lien in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-15\">It is also suggested that the proceeding was in fact taken upon July 7, 1875. If this be so, it would be necessary to re-open the motion below, for in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>present affidavits it is stated that the action was begun in June, 1875.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with ten dollars costs and disbursements to be taxed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
