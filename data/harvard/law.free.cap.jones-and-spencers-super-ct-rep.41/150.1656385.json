The plaintiff further gave in evidence the judgment roll in the action of foreclosure, to which the present defendant was a party. The complaint in that action set out enough facts to show that these defendants were liable to pay the amount of the mortgage, upon the covenant, in the deed to their testator, but it did not demand judgment against the defendant for the deficiency: while it did against Goebel, the obligor in the bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-6\">The judgment in foreclosure provided, that the referee appointed for that purpose, pay out of the proceeds of sale specified costs, fees and expenses, \u201cany lien or liens, upon said premises, so sold at the time of such sale, for taxes or assessments,\u201d and then to the plaintiff two thousand five hundred and eight dollars and ninety-eight cents, the amount adjudged to be due to him, and \u2018 \u2018 that if the proceeds of such sale be insufficient to pay the amount so reported due to the plaintiff, with interest and costs as aforesaid, the said referee specify tne amount of such deficiency in his report of sale, and the defendant, William Goebel, pay the same to the plaintiff,\u201d and that the plaintiff have execution therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-7\">The report of the referee was given in evidence, it having been filed ; and it stated, that the plaintiff had become purchaser for nine thousand seven hundred dollars; that the referee had allowed, in closing the purchase, six thousand and ninety-one dollars and twenty-five cents for prior mortgages assumed by him ; \u201c that other allowances had been made; that he had paid over to plaintiff, through his attorneys, one thousand eight nundred and two dollars and eighty-two cents,\u201d leaving a deficiency still due and unpaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>of seven hundred and forty-one dollars and fifty-five cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-5\">No proof was given of the existence at the time of making the report, of the mortgage, the amount of which was allowed. There was no proof that notice of the filing of the report had been given to the parties defendant in the foreclosure action. There was no order confirming the report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-6\">The court dismissed the complaint, on the ground, ' that the plaintiff had no cause of action, and ordered the exception to be heard, in the first instance at the General Term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b161-8\"><em>Kauffman, Tunstall </em>and <em>Wagner, </em>attorneys, and <em>Lewis Sanders, </em>of counsel for plaintiff, argued against the dismissal of the complaint.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANP\">Their printed points, however, do not bear on the questions decided by the court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b161-9\"><em>Stillwell </em>and <em>Swain, </em>attorneys, and of counsel for defendants, on the questions decided, urged:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtV\">I. The report of a referee is not, <em>per se, </em>a record of judicial determination, and does not prove itself, and is not evidence of any fact, against any person. <em>A </em>report of sale is an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding, and has no effect until it is confirmed by the court; and where a party has appeared in the action, this can only be done, and the report be made evidence against him, by showing notice to him <em>(Rules </em>39 and 73 <em>Supreme Court, </em>Griffing <em>v. </em>Slote, 5 <em>How. Pr. </em>205).</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-10\">II. The report of a referee is not, in any case, evidence of anything, except as to matters which have been referred to him. The duties of a referee appointed in a foreclosure suit to sell the property, are ministerial in their nature. He is not authorized to adjudicate upon, or allow, or pay any other liens or claims, except those specified in the judgment, but is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>directed to pay these, and deposit the balance of the proceeds of the sale with the Chamberlain, subject to the order of the court (People v. Bergen, 53 N. <em>Y. </em>404). His report is, therefore, no evidence that there was any other encumbrance by mortgage on the property, or that it was a prior encumbrance, or that it was paid ; and as no voucher is annexed for the six thousand dollars alleged to have been allowed, the declaration of the referee, in the report, is no evidence of the disposition that was made of that amount (See <em>Rule 73, Supreme Court).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-5\">III. There having been, therefore, no evidence of the facts alleged to have been shown by the report of sale, that there were any prior encumbrances on the property, that the proceeds of the sale had been so applied as to leave any deficiency for which the defendant was liable to the plaintiff, or that the plaintiff had been authorized to commence the action, the learned judge properly granted the defendants\u2019 motion for non-suit.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b162-6\">By the Court.-\u2014Sedgwick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5A\">On the argument, the respondent\u2019s counsel argued that the complaint was properly dismissed, because it did not appear, that leave had been obtained to bring this action, and by section 153 of the Revised Statutes, vol. 2, p. 191, after a bill is filed for the foreclosure of a mortgage, \u201c no proceedings whatever shall be had at law, for the recovery of the debt secured by the mortgage or any part thereof, unless authorized by the court,\u201d &amp;c. It seems to me, best not to examine this question, because it is not specifically referred to in the pleadings, and was not upon the trial. If the obtaining of leave was part of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, in a sense that called upon him to plead it and prove it,' then the action of the court below might properly be sustained on that ground; but as the objection is of a nature that a party would be able, upon due notice, to' ask <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>leave to amend, &amp;c., it is best not to rest a determination of the merits upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The plaintiff did not base his action, even if he had a right so to do, upon the liability at law of the defendant\u2019s testator, upon his assumption of the mortgage. The obligor of the bond might, under proper circumstances, have called upon the plaintiff, to apply the value of the security, viz. : the land, to the payment of the bond, as far as it would go, before calling upon him to pay. The plaintiff, voluntarily did this in the action of foreclosure, and the defendants were properly parties, if for no other purpose, in order to bind them by an adjudication, which should, against them, fix what amount would remain due upon the bond and upon the assumption of the mortgage, after the proceeds of the land had been applied towards satisfaction. We advert to no other questions than those which the parties have made in this action. The plaintiff, therefore, proceeded, on the trial of this action, to show that there had been an adjudication in the foreclosure action; that the proceeds of the sale, after making the proper deductions, did not satisfy the debt, but left a deficiency. The* plaintiff was not entitled to recover in this action, if the record did not show that there was a deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">It is plain, that the interlocutory judgment, did not adjudicate that there was a deficiency. It only provided, that the plaintiff should have execution for the amount of a deficiency, if there should be one. For the purpose of ascertaining this, it directed specifically what the referee, who was but a ministerial officer (People <em>ex </em>rel., Day <em>v. </em>Bergen, 53 <em>N. Y. </em>404), should do with the proceeds of the sale; he was to deduct expenses, costs, taxes and assessments; then be was to pay the plaintiff, the amount found to be due to him, and report what surplus there was or what deficiency. In regard to these things, the action of the referee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>being ministerial and not. judicial, it or his report thereon, could not have the binding force of an adjudication. It would have been passed upon judicially, if it had, according to the rules and practice, been confirmed by the court. Filing it, did not give it judicial sanction. The burden of proof is upon the plaintiff. By rule 39, the report does not become \u201cabsolute and stand as in all things confirmed\u201d until notice of filing 1ms been given, and eight days have elapsed after the notice, without exceptions being filed. Evidently, the party against whose interest the report is, is not brought before the court and called upon to make exceptions, or be bound bjr an omission to make them, until he has received notice of filing. Therefore, at least, without deciding in this case what should be the further steps to be taken, if any, the party sustaining the report as an adjudication, should show that notice of filing had been given to the par.ty who has the right to except.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">A reference to the practice before the present rules, will perhaps make this clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The chancellor held, that it was not necessary to wait until after the sale of the mortgaged premises before the contingent decree for the payment of such deficiency could be\" made (McCarthy <em>v. </em>Graham, 8 <em>Paige Ch. </em>480; De Agreda <em>v. </em>Mantel, 1 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>135).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The form of the decree to be entered in such cases expressed with greater accuracy, than is used in the present judgment, the rights of the parties. It adjudged payment of the. deficiency, and authorized an execution to be issued for it, \u201cif there should appear to be one, upon the coming in and <em>confirmation </em>of th\u00e9 master\u2019s report\u201d (Sprague <em>v. </em>Jones, 9 <em>Paige Ch. </em>397).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">In the Bank of Rochester <em>v. </em>Emerson (10 <em>Paige Ch. </em>115), the complainant,had foreclosed a mortgage made by the defendant, and had the usual decree over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>against him for deficiency in case the proceeds of the lands should be insufficient. The bill in the case cited, was a creditor\u2019s bill to obtain satisfaction of the deficiency, and after setting out the proceedings, and decree in foreclosure, further stated that the master reported, that there was a deficiency, &amp;c., \u201cas by the report duly confirmed, &amp;c., would more fully appear,\u201d and that execution had been issued and returned unsatisfied. The defendant pleaded in bar, that the report of the master as to the deficiency, had neither been filed nor confirmed, at the time the execution was issued. The question was whether this was a bar. The chancellor held that it was. He said it was not a case of a mere irregularity in the execution, which could not be examined in a collateral suit. He said, what is particularly in point here, that \u201cthe decree does not direct the mortgagor to pay the deficiency, when it shall be ascertained by the result of the sale, or when the master shall have made out, and signed his report. .Nor does the filing of the report of the master, stating the amount of the deficiency, entitle the complainant to demand the immediate payment of such deficiency, so as to authorize the issuing of an execution therefor. The decree is that the mortgagor or other defendant, who is personally liable for the mortgage debt, pay the amount of the deficiency reported due, upon the coming in and confirmation of the report of the master. Until the master\u2019s report is confirmed as well as filed, therefore, the deficiency is not payable, under the decree,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">In the present case, the judgment does not, in terms, call for the confirmation of the report, but by construction of the law, such is its meaning. The rule 39, applies itself to the judgment, and shows, that the judgment did not finally adjudge the payment of a deficiency reported by a report which was not final.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>By the former practice, and perhaps it should be held to be the practice now, this matter was made definite, by an <em>ex parte </em>order nisi, confirming the report, to become absolute eight days after notice of its entry and of the filing of the report. The present rule, however, provides only, by its words, for notice of filing, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Finally, the report in the present case, is official only in those respects in which the referee obeyed the judgment. It was extra-official, and only personal, in those respects in which he acted without the direction of the judgment. By the words, he was directed to specify the amount of deficiency only, if the proceeds of the sale were insufficient, after he had made the particular deduction directed. He was not directed to allow the purchaser the amount of prior mortgages upon the land, nor even to ascertain if there were such. So far as the record shows, the purchaser\u2019s right as to these alleged mortgages, was if the facts justified him, to refuse to complete the purchases. Therefore when the referee made a deduction greater than the amount reported as deficiency, which he was not authorized to make, it. in substance appears by the report itself, that the proceeds of the sale were not insufficient to pay the amount due to plaintiff, and there was no deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">I am of opinion that the plaintiff\u2019s exception should be overruled, and the defendant have judgment, upon the order dismissing the complaint, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Monell, Ch. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
