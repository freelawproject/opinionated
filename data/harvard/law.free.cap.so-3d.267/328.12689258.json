Code 1975. That action was assigned case no. DR-17-3415 and is hereinafter referred to as \"the protection-from-abuse action.\" It appears from the materials submitted to this court that the wife alleged that Cameron Murray (\"the husband\") had committed an act or acts of domestic violence against her. A pendente lite protection-from-abuse order was entered on December 21, 2017, but that order is not included in the materials before this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On February 12, 2018, the circuit court entered an order scheduling a final hearing on the protection-from-abuse petition. However, before that hearing could take place, the circuit court, on February 15, 2018, entered an order that consolidated the protection-from-abuse action with a divorce action pending between the parties and transferred the protection-from-abuse action to the docket of the judge in whose court the divorce action was pending; the divorce action was assigned case no. DR-18-900019. Among other things, the circuit court ordered that the protection-from-abuse action would be set for a final hearing by the trial judge before whom the divorce action was pending and who would now consider the protection-from-abuse action. For the remainder of this opinion, we refer to the court in which the consolidated actions were pending as \"the trial court,\" and we refer to the court in which the protection-from-abuse petition was originally filed as \"the first trial court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 28, 2018, the trial court scheduled the protection-from-abuse action for a hearing on March 15, 2018. After the hearing, the trial court entered an order on March 15, 2018, in the protection-from-abuse action in which it made final the December 21, 2017, pendente lite order. In its March 15, 2018, order, the trial court noted that the husband had not appeared at the final hearing, and it made a finding, based on the evidence presented at the hearing, that the husband had committed\n   an act of domestic violence against the wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We note that, because the protection-from-abuse action and the divorce action were consolidated in the trial court, the March 15, 2018, order entered in the protection-from-abuse action was not a final judgment.\n   <em>\n    Hanner v.

The trial court ruled in favor of the State, but a year later Looney sought relief pursuant to Rule 60(b), Ala. R. Civ. P., arguing that he had not received service of the State's complaint.

The husband states that \"the record,\" or, rather, the materials he submitted in support of his petition for a writ of mandamus, demonstrates that he was not represented by an attorney at the time the notice of the February 28, 2018, order scheduling the final hearing was issued. In making that argument, the husband appears to rely solely on the fact that the case-action summary does not indicate that an attorney had filed a notice of appearance on his behalf. However, the husband fails to address in his petition for a writ of mandamus the February 12, 2018, order stating that Ferguson represented the husband at the January 2, 2018, hearing or the February 15, 2018, order that stated that the husband had told the first trial court that Ferguson would represent him.

Thus, the actions of the husband led the trial court to believe that the husband was represented by counsel. The husband alleges in his brief submitted to this court that he ultimately did not hire Ferguson; the husband has not submitted any affidavit to that effect. Further, the materials before this court do not indicate that the husband informed the trial court at any point that Ferguson did not represent him, and he has not disputed in his filings before this court the findings in the first trial court's orders pertaining to Ferguson.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \" '[A] judgment is void only if the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of the ... parties, or if it acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law.'\n   <em>\n    Bryant, Inc. v.
