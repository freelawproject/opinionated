James Allen Insurance Brokers (JAIB) and Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London, Subscribing to Certificate No. FRO-100944 (Lloyd's) petitioned this Court for interlocutory review of the Simpson County Circuit Court's order granting partial summary judgment in favor of First Financial Bank (FFB). The trial court held that FFB is entitled to insurance proceeds from a fire loss that occurred at Luther and Freda Feazell's poultry farm, because JAIB and Lloyd's failed to comply with Mississippi law requiring notice of cancellation of property insurance. We affirm the trial court's grant of partial summary judgment in favor of FFB.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62. The Feazells have used Insurance Associates of Magee (IAM) as their local insurance agent to procure insurance coverage on their chicken farm and equipment since 2006. They also are indebted to FFB under promissory notes for loans first issued in 2006 in relation to the farm. The loans are secured by, among other things, four poultry houses on the Feazells' farm,\n   valued at $ 231,750, $ 231,750, $ 150,000, and $ 150,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63. In December 2013, the Feazells, through IAM, requested that a new insurance policy be issued with Lloyd's with an effective date of December 13, 2013. The Feazells needed a new underwriter because their prior carrier would not renew coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64. On December 11, 2013, IAM obtained a quote from JAIB on a policy to be issued by Lloyd's. The quote included a letter entitled \"Non-Admitted Farm Quote Binding Terms: This Quote is Valid for 7 days.\" The letter quoted a premium of $ 7,429.34. The terms provided that a \"binder\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   would issue with an effective date from December 13, 2013, to December 13, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65. The letter contained the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   To issue the policy, we will need all of the following items in our office within 10 days of the binding effective date.\n   <em>\n    Your binding authority is a maximum of 10 days after the effective date. If all items are not received, we will cancel the policy flat with no coverage afforded at anytime and all premium, less the policy fee will be returned.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66. One of the items stated, \"Total premium payment must be received in our office within 10 days of agent's written request to bind coverage in order to retain requested effective date.\" The original due date for the total premium was December 23, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67. To obtain the total premium payment funds, the Feazells entered into a finance agreement with Insurance Premium Financing Solutions (Imperial PFS). Under this agreement, the Feazells would provide $ 2,383.80 of the $ 7,479.33 premium payment, while Imperial PFS would provide the remaining $ 5,095.53. IAM received Imperial PFS's portion of the total premium payment on December 16, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68. FFB provided the remaining portion of the premium to IAM using funds from the Feazells' escrow accounts. FFB's check containing its portion of the premium payment was dated December 18, 2013, and IAM allegedly received it on December 26, 2013. According to JAIB and Lloyd's, despite possessing the funds to pay the full premium, IAM did not send payment or inform JAIB that it had the funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69. On December 20, 2013, JAIB informed IAM, via email, that the Feazells' premium payment had not been received. The email stated that JAIB would \"consider the premium to be on time if received by Friday, Dec. 27[, 2013.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610. On December 27, 2013, again via email, JAIB informed IAM that the premium payment had not been received. This email provided a final payment-deadline extension, stating that the \"full payment must be on\" the desk of Elizabeth Hauser, JAIB's employee, by January 2, 2014, or the effective date would be reset to the date the premium payment was paid with \"no coverage offered in the interim.\" According to JAIB, the additional deadline offered to IAM was a courtesy and was not required of JAIB.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611. FFB claims IAM transmitted full payment of the premium to JAIB on December 30, 2013, in the amount of $ 7,429.33. But JAIB disputes this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612. JAIB claims no proof exists that the premium was transmitted by IAM on December\n   30, only that the premium payment check bore the date December 30, 2013. JAIB claims that it had not received the total premium payment by January 2, 2014, which resulted in a failure to satisfy an express condition of the written terms required to bind coverage for the requested effective date of December 13, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b613. On January 5, 2014, three days after the final premium payment deadline, the Feazells' poultry farm caught fire. All four of the chicken houses used to secure FFB's loan to the Feazells were either destroyed or rendered inoperable. According to FFB, due to the extensive fire damage, the Feazells' poultry operation came to a halt, effectively resulting in complete casualty loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b614. On January 8, 2014, JAIB sent an email to IAM stating,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   We still do not have premium for this policy. The requested date of 12/13 can no longer be honored. You should be aware that at this time there is no coverage due to nonpayment. Full premium must arrive by Friday, January 10 or the binder will be cancelled with a penalty assessed to your commission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b615. FFB claims that JAIB did not send FFB a copy of the January 8, 2014, email, nor did it otherwise notify FFB of any problem with receiving the premium. FFB says it never received a notice of cancellation of the policy from JAIB or Lloyd's at any time during the communications from JAIB to IAM regarding the unpaid premium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b616. JAIB and Lloyd's claim that JAIB did not receive the premium payment check from IAM until January 10, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   JAIB sent IAM an email that same day, stating,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Attached is the revised binder for [the Feazells]. Because premium was not received on time, the effective date of this policy was reset to the date premium was paid. The policy term is 1/10/2014 to 1/20/2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b617. On May 13, 2014, FFB tendered a claim in writing to JAIB requesting that JAIB and Lloyd's honor the binder issued and pay FFB the amount owed for its loss based on its status as the loss payee under the terms of the binder. Neither JAIB or Lloyd's honored the request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b618. In August 2014, the Feazells filed a complaint against IAM, JAIB, and Lloyd's, asserting various causes of action. In March 2015, after the court allowed it to intervene, FFB filed a complaint and cross-claim, asserting (i) breach of contract by the Feazells; (ii) failure of JAIB and Lloyd's to pay FFB insurance proceeds as the contractual and statutory loss payee under Mississippi Code Sections 83-13-9 and 83-5-28 ; (iii) bad faith by JAIB and/or Lloyd's; and (iv) negligent failure to procure insurance by IAM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b619. Following discovery, FFB filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking judgment in its favor on the second count, the alleged failure of JAIB and Lloyd's to pay FFB the amounts due under the insurance binder issued to the Feazells on FFB's collateral. The trial court granted FFB's motion for partial summary judgment and entered an order in December 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b620. In February 2018, on its own motion, the trial court amended the December 2017 order, substituting the following original language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   While the present binder stated that the full premium was payable and due within\n   10 days of the binding effective date[, t]his date was extended on numerous occasions. The binder itself does not contain any terms regarding automatic cancellation or withdrawal of coverage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The following language, which JAIB and Lloyd's contend was proposed by the Feazells, FFB, and IAM, was substituted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The \"Non-Admitted Farm Quote Binding Terms\" document that was attached to a December 11, 2013 email from [JAIB] to [IAM] stated that the premium was due in full within 10 days of the binding effective date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   However, the actual binder that was issued with effective dates of coverage from December 13, 2013 through December 13, 2014 contained no deadline for the payment of the premium and did not contain any terms regarding automatic cancellation or withdrawal of coverage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b621. JAIB and Lloyd's petitioned this Court for interlocutory appeal, which this Court granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b622. Summary judgment granted by the trial court is reviewed de novo.\n   <em>\n    Hardy v. Brock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11342348\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/826/71/#p74\">\n    826 So.2d 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 74 (Miss. 2002). Summary judgment is appropriate if the evidence-admissions in the pleadings, answers to interrogatories, depositions, affidavits, etc.-shows \"that there is no genuine issue\" of material fact \"and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Duckworth v.

R. Civ. P. 56(c) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b623. JAIB and Lloyd's submit that the material facts are not in dispute. They claim that the trial court misinterpreted those facts and the applicable law when it granted partial summary judgment in favor of FFB. They contend that the sole issue is a legal one-whether FFB was owed a statutory notice of cancellation when the policy never was cancelled because the binding terms never were satisfied. They maintain no coverage was in place at the time of the fire loss; without effective coverage, the notice requirements of Mississippi Code Sections 83-13-9 and 83-5-28(1) were not triggered. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b624.

What occurred in the case, according to the\n   <em>\n    AmFed\n   </em>\n   Court, could not be characterized as a cancellation of workers' compensation coverage by the insurer or a manifest intention by the insurer not to renew the insured's policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6785299\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/196/947/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6785299\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/196/947/\">\n    at 961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, the insured's policy simply expired, and its coverage lapsed for the insured's failure to pay the premium on time.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6785299\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/196/947/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b635. FFB contends that\n   <em>\n    AmFed\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable because it turned on the interpretation of a completely different statute and set of circumstances. Section 71-3-77, the statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    AmFed\n   </em>\n   , required notice of cancellation to the insured, with no equivalent requirement to notify an interested third party, such as a loss payee, which Section 83-5-28(1) requires. FFB argues that, as a listed loss payee, it is afforded more protection than the policyholder, as was found to be the case in\n   <em>\n    Scottsdale\n   </em>\n   , in which the Court of Appeals held that although coverage may be cancelled, it \"continue[s] in force for the benefit only of the mortgagee ....\"\n   <em>\n    Scottsdale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11609046\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/733/863/#p865\">\n    733 So.2d at 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2083-13-9\">\n    Miss.

Here, while JAIB and Lloyd's certainly could have contracted to require that the premium be paid before the binder went into effect, they did not do so.

Thus, under this term for the binder, it cannot be said that coverage did not go into effect because JAIB did not receive the premium timely.

Coverage having gone into effect on December 13, 2013, under the terms of the binder, and FFB having been listed in the binder as a mortgagee/loss payee triggered Section 83-5-28(1)'s notification requirements for purposes of FFB.
