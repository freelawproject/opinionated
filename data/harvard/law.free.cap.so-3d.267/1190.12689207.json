The husband filed suit against his estranged wife's lawyer contending that she intentionally coerced his estranged wife into breaching an agreement to sell community property. The attorney filed an exception of no cause of action, which the trial court denied. We find that the trial court erred by denying the exception of no cause of action and remand for amendment. The writ is granted in part, denied in part, and remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Respondent, Luis Musa, filed a petition for damages in which he named as defendants: Shelley Musa (Mr. Musa's estranged wife) and Bernadette Lee, (relator and Ms. Musa's divorce attorney). In the petition for damages, Mr. Musa alleged that Attorney Lee wrongfully filed a notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   and induced Ms. Musa to breach an agreement to sell property (the \"Derby Place property\") that belonged to the community of acquets and gains existing between Mr. Musa and Ms. Musa. Mr. Musa alleged that, as a result of Attorney Lee's legal advice, despite having previously entered into the agreement to sell, Ms. Musa refused to execute the act of sale to transfer the Derby Place property to a third party buyer on the date of the closing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Attorney Lee filed an exception of no cause of action, contending that the claims set forth in Mr. Musa's petition were premised on her actions as counsel for Ms. Musa. Attorney Lee asserted that Louisiana law does not recognize a cause of action against adversarial counsel under the facts alleged in his petition for damages. Mr. Musa opposed the exception, arguing that Attorney Lee's actions were malicious and, thus, a cause of action was recognized under Louisiana jurisprudence. Following a hearing, the trial court rendered judgment, denying the exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     EXCEPTION OF NO CAUSE OF ACTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A peremptory \"exception of no cause of action raises a question of law,\" and a court of appeal reviews the district court's ruling\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC v.

Mr. Musa indicated the notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   filed in St. Tammany Parish was improper because it identified property located in Orleans Parish-the Derby Place property-but not property located in St. Tammany Parish. Mr. Musa also claimed that the notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   filed in Orleans Parish incorrectly stated Ms. Musa had rights in the Derby Place property. Mr. Musa asserted that Attorney Lee knew that Ms. Musa had entered into an agreement to divest herself of any rights to the Derby Place property. Further, Mr. Musa alleged that Attorney Lee knew or should have known that the Derby Place property was subject to a security agreement, and that, as a result, the community existing between Ms. Musa and Mr. Musa possessed no equity in the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In Mr. Musa's opposition to the exception, he contended that La. R.S. 9:4833 provided a cause of action for damages as a result of the filing of the improper notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   . The statute reads, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   A. If a statement of claim or privilege is improperly filed or if the claim or privilege preserved by the filing of a statement of claim or privilege is extinguished, an owner or other interested person may require the person who has filed a statement of the claim or privilege to give a written request for cancellation in the manner provided by law directing the recorder of mortgages to cancel the statement of claim or privilege from his records. The request shall be delivered within ten days after a written request for it is received by the person filing the statement of claim or privilege.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   B. One who, without reasonable cause, fails to deliver a written request for cancellation in proper form to cancel the claim or privilege as required by Subsection A of this Section shall be liable for damages suffered by the owner or person requesting the authorization as a consequence of the failure and for reasonable attorney fees incurred in causing the statement to be cancelled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   La. R.S. 9:4833.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Here, however, Mr. Musa did not allege that he requested that the notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   be canceled. Further, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Montalvo\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Musa was required to allege facts supporting a claim that Attorney Lee acted with malice or intent to cause him harm by filing the notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   . The petition for damages lacks any factual allegation supporting the conclusion that the filing of the notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   in St. Tammany Parish was done with malice or intent to cause harm to Mr. Musa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As to the notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   filed in Orleans Parish, Mr. Musa asserted that Attorney Lee knew that Ms. Musa had no\n   ownership interest in the property due to the agreement to sell and that there was no equity in the property due to the security interest. Mr. Musa contended that the sales price contained in the agreement to sell would have only been sufficient to pay the amount owed to the bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Mr. Musa's conclusion that the agreement to sell divested Ms. Musa of her ownership interest in the property is contrary to law. \"Ownership is the right that confers on a person direct, immediate, and exclusive authority over a thing. The owner of a thing may use, enjoy, and dispose of it within the limits and under the conditions established by law.\" La. C.C. art. 477. To transfer ownership of an immovable such as the Derby Place property, the owner and transferee would need to enter into a contract that purports to transfer ownership. La. C.C. art. 517.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In the petition for damages, Mr. Musa asserted that Ms. Musa breached the agreement to sell by failing and refusing to execute the act of sale transferring the Derby Place property to the buyer. Jurisprudence has established that \"an agreement to sell is not a sale where the execution of a later final act of sale is contemplated by the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Delapaz v. Monem\n   </em>\n   , 01-1234, p. 4 (La. App. 5 Cir. 2/26/02),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9453942\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/811/1062/#p1065\">\n    811 So.2d 1062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1065. Accepting the claim in the petition that Ms. Musa breached the agreement to sell by failing to execute an act of sale as true, the agreement to sell was not a contract of sale purporting to transfer ownership, as the agreement to sell contemplated execution of a later final act of sale. Thus, Mr. Musa's allegation that Attorney Lee knew that Ms. Musa had no ownership interest in the property due to the agreement to sell is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Likewise, there is no factual support for the assertion that Attorney Lee knew that there was no equity in the Derby Place property or that Attorney Lee knew that the sales proceeds would only satisfy the amount owed to the bank. Even taking these allegations as true, the petition contains no other factual allegations to support the assertion that Attorney Lee's filing the notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   on behalf of her client was done with malice or an intent to cause direct harm to Mr. Musa. In the absence of facts showing specific malice or an intent to harm on the part of Attorney Lee, Mr. Musa has not stated a cause of action upon which he may be granted relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Tortious Interference with a Contract\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Mr. Musa alleged that Attorney Lee, through her legal advice, induced Ms. Musa to breach the agreement to sell. He asserted that Attorney Lee's actions were deliberate and malicious because Attorney Lee was aware that Ms. Musa entered into an agreement to sell the Derby Place property. Mr. Musa alleged that Attorney Lee had a duty to refrain from intentionally causing Ms. Musa to breach the agreement. Mr. Musa contended that the tort of intentional interference with a contract should be extended to the facts of this case to hold Attorney Lee liable for damages because she used her legal skill and knowledge to induce Ms. Musa to breach the agreement to sell. Mr. Musa concluded that Attorney Lee lacked reasonable justification for inducing Ms. Musa to breach the agreement to sell, as Ms. Musa was not entitled to any financial benefit from the sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Supreme Court has found that a limited cause of action exists against a corporate officer for tortious interference with a contract.\n   <em>\n    9 to 5 Fashions, Inc. v.

Further, this Court held that \"based on the jurisprudence, it is clear that before an action for tortious interference with a contract will be permitted, the plaintiff must\n   identify a duty existing between it and the alleged tortfeasor, the violation of which would give rise to delictual liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Taxicab Ins.

The petition merely states that Attorney Lee was malicious. Further, the petition concludes that Attorney Lee induced Ms. Musa to breach the agreement to sell the Derby Place property without alleging any facts in support of the conclusion. These allegations are insufficient to invoke the tort of intentional interference with a contract and cannot defeat an exception of no cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Accordingly, after our\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, we find that the trial court erred in overruling the exception of no cause of action.

As such, and without commenting on Mr. Musa's likelihood of prevailing on his petition, the ground of the exception may be removed by alleging facts showing specific malice or an intent to harm by Attorney Lee.

However, Mr. Musa is entitled to amend his petition. Therefore, the matter is remanded for amendment.

I concur in the majority's conclusion that the district court erred in overruling Attorney Lee's exception of no cause of action.

C.C.P. art. 934 for its holding that a district court must permit a litigant to amend a petition when the grounds for sustaining the exception can be removed. Nevertheless, \"if the grounds of the objection raised through the exception cannot be so removed, ... the action ... shall be dismissed.\" La. C.C.P. art. 934.

Mr. Musa's claims are that, in her role as opposing counsel, Attorney Lee (1) gave her client legal advice, which her client followed, and (2) filed pleadings, which were allegedly incorrect and frivolous. Mr. Musa's allegations do not state an actionable claim against opposing counsel under the law of this State. Mr. Musa's mere contentions that Attorney Lee's actions as counsel for his estranged wife were \"deliberate,\" \"intentional,\" and \"malicious\" are insufficient as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montalvo\n   </em>\n   , 93-2813, pp. 6-7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7449699\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/637/127/#p130\">\n    637 So.2d at 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In opposing Attorney Lee's exception, Mr. Musa has not identified any new facts he would plead if granted leave to amend his petition. Likewise, under the circumstances\n   of this case, I can conceive of no facts Mr. Musa could plead if given an opportunity to cure his petition. Thus, I do not find that Mr. Musa can successfully remove the grounds for this exception. Amendment of the petition would be a vain and useless act. Mr. Musa's claims against Attorney Lee should be dismissed as a matter of law without further opportunity to amend his petition for damages.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montalvo\n   </em>\n   , 93-2813, pp. 7-8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7449699\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/637/127/#p130\">\n    637 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   132 ;\n   <em>\n    Vance\n   </em>\n   , 2017-219, p. 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381623\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/235/1263/#p1270\">\n    235 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1270 ;\n   <em>\n    Brookewood Investments Co. v.
