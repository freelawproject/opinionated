Love\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This appeal arose from a remand from the Louisiana Supreme Court. Plaintiff alleged that he sustained serious bodily injuries\n   as a result of a slip and fall on grease while delivering seafood at defendants' restaurant premises. After almost twelve years of litigation, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment contending that the plaintiff had no evidence to support his claims other than his self-serving testimony. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment and dismissed his claims. Plaintiff filed a motion for new trial, averring that newly discovered evidence was not previously available. The trial court denied the motion for new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On appeal, we found that plaintiff only sought review of the denial of the motion for new trial, converted the appeal to a writ, and denied writs. The Louisiana Supreme Court found that we erred by not reviewing the motion for summary judgment and remanded the matter for consideration of the summary judgment on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the trial court erred by granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment because his testimony was sufficient to create genuine issues of material fact for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We find that plaintiff failed to demonstrate factual support to create genuine issues of material fact once the defendants met their burden on a summary judgment. Therefore, the trial court did not err by granting the motion for summary judgment. We also find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying plaintiff's motion for new trial, as the evidence was not \"newly discovered.\" The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Carl Edgefield was employed by New Orleans Gulf Seafood (\"NOGS\") as a delivery man in December 2004, when he allegedly slipped and fell on grease while delivering seafood to the Audubon Golf Clubhouse (\"Clubhouse\"). As a result, Mr. Edgefield alleged that he sustained serious injuries to his back. Mr. Edgefield filed a Petition for Damages on December 22, 2005, against Audubon Nature Institute, Inc.; Audubon Commission; and Scottsdale Insurance Company (collectively hereinafter \"Defendants\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2009, the Louisiana Restaurant Association Self Insurer's Fund and NOGS filed a Petition of Intervention seeking subrogation for $ 80,293.52 paid to Mr. Edgefield in workers' compensation benefits. In 2015, Mr. Edgefield hired new representation and his previous counsel also filed a Petition of Intervention. Subsequently, in 2016, Mr. Edgefield's new representation withdrew and filed a Motion for Summary Judgment for expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2017, Defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment contending that no genuine issues of material fact existed because Mr. Edgefield lacked factual support for his claim. The trial court conducted a hearing and granted Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, dismissing Mr. Edgefield's Petition with prejudice. Both Petitions for Intervention were also dismissed with prejudice. Eight days after the trial court's ruling on the Motion for Summary Judgment, Mr. Edgefield filed a Motion for New Trial alleging that he possessed newly discovered evidence; namely, he found 1) one of the Audubon employees that allegedly helped him stand up after the fall, 2) the plans for the Clubhouse, and 3) an expert report. The trial court denied the Motion for New Trial. Mr. Edgefield's Petition for Devolutive Appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In Mr. Edgefield's first appeal,\n   <em>\n    Edgefield v.

Mr. Edgefield sought review with the Louisiana Supreme Court.

To prevail against a merchant like Audubon, Mr. Edgefield has the burden of proving that: 1) \"[t]he condition presented an unreasonable risk of harm to the claimant and that risk of harm was reasonably foreseeable\"; 2) \"[t]he merchant either created or had actual or constructive notice of the condition which caused the damage, prior to the occurrence\"; and 3) \"[t]he merchant failed to exercise reasonable care.\" La.

While he was unaware if anyone witnessed his fall, he contended that two Audubon employees\n   helped him to his feet. These men also assisted Mr. Edgefield by placing the shrimp back in the box after the shrimp spilled onto the ground. Mr. Edgefield testified that he did not notice anything on the step that day and that it was not raining. However, Mr. Edgefield averred that there was oil on the cement. He was not sure what type of oil it was, but guessed that it was oil from the grease trap. In responses to interrogatories, Mr. Edgefield stated: \"As I was sitting there I saw the grease trap drain and the oil or grease on the concrete. It is on the walk right before you get to the steps. I must have stepped in it and that's why I believe my foot slipped.\" He also alleged to have telephoned his employer from Audubon's kitchen to report the fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Lucinda Greenwood, the Clubhouse kitchen supervisor, testified in her deposition that the fryers in the Clubhouse kitchen were constructed with faucets on the sides for draining the grease. She stated that employees would fill containers with old grease using the faucets and carry it outside to the grease barrels by the gates. Ms. Greenwood also listed the names of some of the former kitchen employees. In regards to Audubon employees cleaning around the grease trap after the vacuum trucks emptied the trap, Ms. Greenwood stated that \"[t]hey never really had to go out there and clean it up because they never - - they didn't spill no grease when the hose - - the hose sucked it all up, so, no, they didn't have to go out there with that.\" However, Ms. Greenwood stated that employees would use a degreaser and hot water to clean off the back porch in the morning and evening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Ms. Greenwood testified that she remembered Mr. Edgefield and that she asked him why he was not using a dolly to bring in the seafood. She stated that he never informed her that he fell because if he had, she would have called \"First Response\" and the manager on duty. Additionally, and contrary to Mr. Edgefield's deposition, Ms. Greenwood stated that the boxes of shrimp he delivered were not broken open. Ms. Greenwood never witnessed grease on the cement or the back porch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Jan Greco, the Clubhouse general manager, testified in her deposition that she was unaware that Mr. Edgefield fell. Ms. Greco described the process of emptying the old grease from the fryers similar to Ms. Greenwood except Ms. Greco stated that the fryers were not equipped with faucets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Once Defendants' evidence pointed \"out to the court the absence of factual support\" as to all three elements essential to Mr. Edgefield's claims, the burden then shifted to Mr. Edgefield \"to produce factual support sufficient to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact or that\" Defendants were \"not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" La. C.C.P. art. 966(D)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In support of his opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, Mr. Edgefield attached a four-page excerpt from his deposition, his affidavit, an affidavit of his former workers' compensation attorney, and a four-page excerpt from Ms. Greenwood's deposition. Mr. Edgefield's deposition excerpt contained the following colloquy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Q. And you say that you slipped when you were on the steps? Is that what you said?

Mr. Edgefield attested that he viewed a stained sidewalk below two faucets, one of which was used to drain grease from the kitchen. Contrary to his deposition testimony, Mr. Edgefield stated that the grease that caused his fall was from the faucets. Mr. Edgefield's workers' compensation attorney attested that he inspected the location of the fall. He observed \"an area [sic] discoloration on the sidewalk beneath the discharge drain pipe.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   When challenged with Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, Mr. Edgefield produced little more than his own self-serving testimony. \"Mere conclusory allegations, improbable inferences and unsupported speculation will not support a finding of a genuine issue of material fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Sears v.

Mr. Edgefield has been litigating the injuries he sustained during the alleged fall for over thirteen years. Mr. Edgefield failed to present any factual support to create genuine issues of material fact regarding his contention that the grease created an unreasonable\n   risk of harm that was reasonably foreseeable to Defendants. There were no expert affidavits or depositions attached in opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. Mr. Edgefield did not present discovery responses evidencing previous falls at the Clubhouse or affidavits from people who had seen grease spots on the porch, steps, or concrete at the back of the Clubhouse. For all of these reasons and following the Louisiana Supreme Court dictates of\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Babin\n   </em>\n   , we find that the trial court did not err by granting Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. Mr. Edgefield failed to produce factual support sufficient to establish genuine issues of material fact existed once Defendant's met their burden on summary judgment. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Mr. Edgefield also contends that the trial court erroneously denied his motion for new trial. As we previously discussed in our original opinion,\n   <em>\n    Edgefield v. Audubon Nature Inst., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 17-1050 (La.

Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying Mr. Edgefield's Motion for New Trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DECREE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For the above-mentioned reasons, we find that Mr. Edgefield failed to present factual support sufficient to create genuine issues of material fact regarding his claims. As such, the trial court correctly granted Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment and dismissed his claims. Also, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying Mr. Edgefield's Motion for New Trial because the evidence did not qualify as newly discovered.

I would reverse the granting of Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In Plaintiff's Original Brief On Rehearing, Plaintiff asserts that the district court erred by granting Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment for the following reasons: 1) the district court ignored Plaintiff's testimony that the grease created an unreasonable risk of harm; 2) the district court ignored Plaintiff's testimony about his fall; 3) the district court ignored Lucinda Greenwood's testimony about how the Defendants' employees worked to keep the area around the grease trap clean; and 4) the district court failed to consider the affidavit of Defendants' employee on the Motion for New Trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that his testimony sufficiently defeated Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. A motion for summary judgment is properly granted if the pleadings, memorandum, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions, together with affidavits, if any, admitted\n   for purposes of the motion for summary judgment, show that there is no genuine issue of material fact, and that the mover is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

A review of the record reveals that Plaintiff demonstrated factual support to create genuine issues of material fact. If there is any doubt as to a dispute regarding a genuine issue of material fact it must be resolved against granting the motion for summary judgment and in favor of a trial on the merits.\n   <em>\n    Oubre v.

He further states that he told someone at Defendants' establishment that he had fallen, and the two men who witnessed the fall (one who was later discovered to be Johnny Polk) asked Plaintiff if he was \"okay,\" and Plaintiff replied \"no.\" Plaintiff asserts that he slipped on grease as a result of Defendants' grease removal process and grease trap, which Defendants had negligently maintained and placed on the pathway to the kitchen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As set forth fully in my previous dissent, the deposition testimonies of Ms. Greenwood (kitchen supervisor) and Ms. Greco (manager) reveal that Defendants' employees were responsible for maintaining the grease trap and the pathway. Both establish that Defendants were responsible for the removal of grease and the degreasing and maintenance of the grease trap and pathway. Accordingly, evidence that Defendants placed the grease trap on the pathway, removed grease by way of the pathway, and maintained the grease trap and pathway on which the alleged hazard occurred is enough to qualify as presenting an unreasonable risk of harm and/or having created a condition under La. R.S. 9:2800.6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, I would reverse the granting of Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment and remand the case to the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Additional support for the reversal of the summary judgment is that Plaintiff's attorney was not afforded a fair opportunity to present his client's claim and complete discovery considering the unique circumstances of this case.
