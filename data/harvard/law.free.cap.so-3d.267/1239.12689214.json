Geiss's health problems and prescription-drug use do not constitute ineffective assistance per se.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b626. To begin, Ronk attributes counsel's ineffectiveness to Geiss's poor health and prescription-drug use. Ronk says Geiss had \"numerous chronic maladies.\" According to Ronk, Geiss retired seven months after the October 4-8, 2010, trial. He died a little more than three years later, on January 22, 2014. The stated cause of death was coronary artery disease ; contributing conditions were renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and diabetes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b627. To show Geiss's debilitating illnesses and how that affected his performance, Ronk offers three pieces of evidence. First, he filed a supplement and exhibits with more than four thousand pages of Geiss's medical records. To interpret those records, he hired Dr. Sheldon Hersh, a board-certified physician in internal medicine. Second, Ronk cites portions of the trial record. Finally, he offers affidavits from attorneys who worked alongside Geiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    1. Dr. Hersh opinion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b628. Dr. Hersh begins by citing the ABA's\n   <em>\n    Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases\n   </em>\n   . Those guidelines, he says, emphasize that defense counsel in capital cases must provide \"high quality legal representation.\" Based on a reasonable degree of medical certainty, Dr. Hersh says that Geiss (a) \"had multiple illnesses, medications, and functional limitations\"; (b) \"was medically unstable, and ... neurologically, cognitively, and physically impaired\"; and (c) \"was unable to provide 'high quality legal representation' required of defense counsel in a complex and demanding capital case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b629. In discussing Geiss's medical instability, Dr. Hersh chronicles Geiss's extensive medical problems:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity-hypoventilation syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, hypertension, acute and chronic renal failure, uremia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, congestive heart failure, diastolic heart failure, arrhythmia, insulin-dependent diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, hyperlipidemia, probable chronic venous insufficiency, anxiety and depression, chronic pain syndrome, gout and gouty arthropathy, and degenerative joint disease. Additionally, he had chronic back, knee, and shoulder pain, along with tremors, edema, nocturia, weakness, and fatigue. He walked with a cane, and he used oxygen for his breathing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Geiss's obesity compounded those problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b630. Dr. Hersh also discusses Geiss's frequent hospital visits. From January 2009 to May 2011, he was hospitalized seventeen times. About two months before Geiss's being appointed counsel in Ronk's case, he had spent a week in the hospital. And from the time he was appointed counsel up until trial, he visited the emergency room once and was hospitalized six times, with ten-, five-, five-, five-, three-, and four-day stays. The latter ended about a month before trial. Dr. Hersh says those \"periods of incapacitation\" would have included the days before and days (or weeks) after each hospitalization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b631. Dr. Hersh identifies four causes of Geiss's neurological and cognitive impairment: (1) \"[c]hronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia, or carbon dioxide retention\"; (2) \"[o]pioid-use disorder\"; (3) \"[c]hronic kidney failure with uremia\"; and (4) \"[p]olypharmacy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b632. Regarding the first cause, Dr. Hersh defines \"hypercapnia\" as \"[a]n elevated blood carbon dioxide level ... [which] causes neurologic and cognitive impairment, manifested by lethargy, drowsiness, coordination difficulty, confusion, and memory loss.\" Records showed that Geiss had \"respiratory, neurologic, and cognitive symptoms\" related to respiratory failure and hypercapnia. Those symptoms included drowsiness, shortness of breath, wheezing, inability to speak, lethargy, and lack of endurance. Despite using supplemental oxygen, he had low blood-oxygen levels as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b633. Dr. Hersh says multiple lung diseases-chronicobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (OHS)-caused Geiss's hypercapnia. Adding to the problem, Geiss did not comply with treatments. He neither quit smoking nor did he lose weight. And he did not use his nighttime breathing machine regularly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b634. Dr. Hersh identified a second purported cause of Geiss's neurological and cognitive impairment: opioid-use disorder. To be diagnosed with that disorder, the\n   <em>\n    Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition\n   </em>\n   (DSM-5), requires that the person have at least two of eleven diagnostic symptoms within a twelve-month period. Dr. Hersh says Geiss met four. According to Dr. Hersh, records showed Geiss took increasing opioid dosages from 2009 to 2011. Using the Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) formula, Dr. Hersh calculated Geiss's daily opioid dosage at 220 MME in 2010. As perspective, Dr. Hersh says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that doctors \" 'use extra precautions' when prescribing an opioid dosage of 50 MME or greater per day\" and to \" '[a]void or carefully justify' increasing the opioid dosage to 90 MME or greater per day.\" He also cites a study showing that people \"who died of opioid overdose, were prescribed an average of 98 MME/day ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b635. Dr. Hersh says physicians repeatedly suggested that Geiss either decrease or stop using opioids. But he kept using them, even as his respiratory failure and hypercapnia worsened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b636. Dr. Hersh alleged a third cause of Geiss's neurological and cognitive impairment: chronic kidney disease. Dr. Hersh estimates Geiss had stage IV to stage V kidney disease. As kidney failure worsens, he says, uremia-a \"toxic buildup of waste products the kidney can no longer excrete\"-develops. Uremic symptoms include fatigue and decreased memory and concentration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b637. The final cause Dr. Hersh advances for Geiss's neurological and cognitive impairment is polypharmacy. He describes that as \"the use of multiple medications, including over-the-counter and herbal supplements, in a single patient.\" Records showed Geiss was taking twenty-five medications in December 2010, including three different \"opioid-containing medications.\" Dr. Hersh says two of the medications were improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b638. In addition to Geiss's neurological and cognitive impairment, Dr. Hersh says Geiss had multiple physical ailments that decreased his strength, stamina, and concentration. Those included shortness of breath; edema, i.e., swelling in his legs; weakness and fatigue; joint pain; diabetic symptoms; peripheral neuropathy, i.e., painful nerve damage in his legs; and tremors and asterixis. Geiss also had chronic pain. Sometimes he was fine; other times, he complained of pain in the seven-to-ten range on the Visual Analog Pain Scale, which measures pain on a scale from zero (meaning no pain) to ten (being the worst pain imaginable). The Warren Grant Magnuson Clinic Center at the National Institutes of Health defines the seven-to-ten range as \"severe pain [that is so] disabling [that a person would be] unable to perform [activities of daily living].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b639. The State attacks Dr. Hersh's opinion on several grounds. In part, it challenges his reliance on ABA guidelines and devotes much effort to showing discrepancies between the records he reviewed and his opinion, especially the opioid-use-disorder diagnosis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b640. In an affidavit accompanying Ronk's rebuttal, Dr. Hersh responds to the\n   State's critique. He concludes with a five-point summary:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \u2022 Reviewing contemporaneous medical records is a well-accepted and useful method to examine a deceased person's medical problems.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   \u2022 Mr. Geiss was taking too much opioid medication for his non-cancer pain; there was little documentation to justify this medication in the extensive medical records I reviewed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   \u2022 Just because a physician prescribes opioids, it does not mean that the opioids are appropriate or harmless.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \u2022 Mr. Geiss had multiple medical problems, which had a negative cumulative effect on his physical, neurologic, and cognitive abilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   \u2022 Multiple medical providers stated that Mr. Geiss'[s] narcotics were worsening his impairments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    2. Trial record\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b641. In addition to Dr. Hersh's opinion, Ronk says the debilitating effects of Geiss's illness are evident throughout the record. He gives thirteen examples:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \u2022 At Ronk's arraignment, attorney Lisa D. Collums \"stood in\" for Geiss because he was recovering from some illness/medical problems. The day before, he had been discharged from the hospital following a ten-day stay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   \u2022 At a pretrial motion hearing, the court told Geiss he could sit if he needed to. Geiss replied, \"No. I get my medicine going and I get dry mouthed.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   \u2022 At a pretrial motion hearing, Geiss explained how some duplicate motions had been filed due to confusion that arose as he tried to coordinate filings by phone while hospitalized. Ronk cites ... those duplicate motions and ... motions signed by non-participating counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   \u2022 In record-reconstruction proceedings during voir dire, the court noted Geiss \"ha[d] been excused for a personal reason.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   \u2022 During voir dire examination, shortness of breath affected Geiss. \"You'll have to forgive me,\" he said, \"I get really short of breath.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   \u2022 After the State rested, the court excused the jury. With the jury out, the court asked Geiss if he had anything. He answered no, but said Ronk needed to be told about his right to testify. The court proceeded to tell Ronk of that right and then granted a recess so Ronk could discuss the decision with counsel. Immediately after the recess, Geiss said, \"I'm just really not having a good day. The defense, of course, has some motions before we get to the thing of [Ronk] testifying.\" At that point, Geiss moved for a directed verdict. From that series of events, Ronk emphasizes Geiss's statement, \"I'm really not having a good day.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   \u2022 During a jury-instruction conference, the court listed several proposed instructions that still had to be considered. The court then asked Geiss if he had any additional instructions. Geiss said, \"No. I'm terribly confused.\" The court later recessed for the evening and said the remaining instructions would be considered the next morning. From that exchange, Ronk highlights Geiss's \"terribly confused\" comment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   \u2022 During closing arguments at the guilt phase, shortness of breath affected Geiss. In mid sentence, he remarked, \"[E]xcuse me I'm short of breath,\" and then continued.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   \u2022 Stewart, who was second-chair counsel, handled sentencing-phase jury instructions even though he had not otherwise participated in that phase.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   \u2022 Stewart represented Ronk at the post-trial hearing on Ronk's motion for new trial or judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Stewart affirmed Geiss was unable to attend due to illness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   \u2022 In January 2012, as Ronk's direct appeal was pending, the trial court held a hearing on several motions, including motions to correct and supplement the record. The court noted Geiss had been \"ill for many years\" and had retired sometime after Ronk's trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   \u2022 At that same January 2012 hearing, the court, in recalling certain events during voir dire, noted \"Geiss ha[d] been excused for a personal reason.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   \u2022 At the January 2012 hearing, the court said some breaks were taken during trial to accommodate Geiss. \"Geiss was on some medication, I believe, that required him to drink water and go to the rest room [sic],\" the court said.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    3. Affidavits\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b642. Finally, Ronk provides affidavits from Matthew Busby and Ramiro Orozco. Busby, who served as an unpaid volunteer attorney for Ronk's defense team, says Geiss was \"in extremely poor health\" during pretrial and trial proceedings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   [Geiss's] health declined visibly, and I would not have been surprised if he had passed away anytime during his last two years at the Public Defender's Office. He was in and out of the hospital several times. Toward the end of that time, I believe that Mr. Geiss was doing only routine, low-stress tasks such as preparing preliminary files so that he could get enough time in for disability retirement. He spent a significant amount of time in the office watching movies on DVDs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   During the trial, Mr. Geiss's health declined precipitously. He was often red-faced and winded, huffing and puffing. He had fluid on his lungs and a heavy cough. He was a big, heavy-set man. He often sat in a chair with his hands resting on a cane.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   It was difficult for Mr. Geiss to visit clients at the Harrison County Adult Detention Center due to his health. (Jail visits were somewhat arduous even for those of us in good health.) When he did visit Mr. Ronk, the meetings were not long.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Busby believes Geiss's poor health contributed significantly to Geiss's inadequate preparation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b643. Orozco, a former Harrison County Assistant Public Defender, worked with Geiss from 2006 to 2008. He says Geiss \"was always ill\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   I believe it was a serious, chronic illness, or illnesses. I do not know the exact nature of his maladies, but I do know he was under the treatment of a physician for heart related matters and was deteriorating at the time of my leaving the Public Defender's office in 2008. I was aware that Mr. Geiss began to be hospitalized frequently after my departure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Orozco recalls an early experience he had serving alongside Geiss:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   A few weeks after I began working at the Public Defender's office, [which would have been late 2006,] I was assigned as second chair on a murder trial. Mr. Geiss was first chair.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   I was able to observe Mr. Geiss and his poor health was apparent, to the point\n   that on the first day of trial he showed up to the wrong court room.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   Mr. Geiss did not meet with the client until the Friday before the Monday start of the trial and now that I have been practicing for several years I am of the opinion that his performance was substandard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   On the first morning of the trial, at about 9:15, Mr. Geiss still had not appeared in the courtroom, keeping everyone waiting. I went to look for him. I found him sitting in an empty courtroom. No one else was in that room. He did not seem to realize that he was in the wrong room. He looked ill.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Mr. Geiss called no witnesses, he failed to make objections and made inappropriate comments during his closing argument.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   I believe that Mr. Geiss'[s] health issues had a detrimental effect in his ability to effectively prepare, present and defend matters for trial. His lack of awareness, stamina[,] and mental clarity were always at issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b644. Altogether, Ronk argues that Dr. Hersh's opinion, the trial record, and Busby's and Orozco's affidavits show Geiss's health problems and prescription-drug use caused counsel to be ineffective. Busby adds \"there was no fully functional leader\" for the defense team. \"No one was calling the shots or directing defense team members what to do,\" he says. Ronk says that conflicts with ABA guidelines, which say \"[l]ead counsel bears overall responsibility for the performance of the defense team, and should allocate, direct, and supervise its work in accordance with these Guidelines and professional standards.\" Am.

Ronk says Geiss's performance was like counsel's performance in\n   <em>\n    Edge\n   </em>\n   : Both could not adequately perform, had decreased mental alertness, and were medicated and fatigued. It is true that Geiss never sought a recess or a continuance. But instead, he simply let other counsel fill in. By doing so, he failed to fulfill his duties as lead counsel.

Here, Ronk's mitigation case consisted of the following.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   \u00b668. Pretrial, he moved for Dr. Smallwood to conduct a psychiatric/psychological evaluation \"to determine whether he knew right from wrong at the time of the alleged incident, whether he [was] competent to assist counsel in the trial of his case and[ ] whether or not a psychological evaluation would reveal any mitigating circumstances.\" The trial court granted the motion, authorizing counsel to hire Dr. Smallwood. The order permitted Dr. Smallwood, in part, \"to prepare a mitigation study.\" At a motions hearing weeks later, however, Geiss explained he was only requesting a psychological evaluation at that time. \"I don't know if there is anything that [Dr. Smallwood] can provide to us that would have any particular use by way of mitigation,\" he said. \"If that arises during her psychological evaluation we will instruct her to proceed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   \u00b669. At sentencing, the State reintroduced all testimony and evidence from the guilt phase and offered a sentencing order showing Ronk's prior guilty-plea conviction for grand larceny. Ronk called one witness: Dr. Smallwood. Her twenty-five page psychological evaluation was entered into evidence, and she testified as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   \u00b670. Dr. Smallwood evaluated Ronk to determine (1) whether he knew right from wrong when the crime occurred; (2) whether he was competent to stand trial; and (3) his level of intelligence. She found that (1) he had mental disorders but knew right from wrong; (2) he was competent to stand trial; and (3) his IQ was 114, in the \"high average category.\" Early on, she explained she had not done a full mitigation study. \"That's outside of the scope of my practice,\" she said. Still, she said some information she had uncovered was relevant for sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   \u00b671. Ronk was adopted at three days old. His adoption caused resentment; he felt he was a mistake, and he tended to direct anger toward his adoptive parents. He threatened them and would hit or \"mess up\" walls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   \u00b672. Between ages ten and thirteen, he began abusing alcohol, marijuana, and eventually methamphetamine. Alcohol and drug abuse, Dr. Smallwood said, likely enhanced his behavioral problems over the years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   \u00b673. According to Ronk's parents, with whom Dr. Smallwood spoke, Ronk began having \"significant problems\" at age ten. Throughout his life, he had numerous hospital stays for mental problems. In one stay, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, and attention deficit with hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Dr. Smallwood said his symptoms, which included several suicide attempts, were consistent with those disorders. All his life, he had exhibited \"impulsive\n   behavior, aggressive and threatening kind of behavior, not thinking before he made decisions\"-\"[h]allmarks of both [bipolar] disorder and ADHD.\" She defined bipolar disorder as \"a serious mental disorder that is based on an imbalance in brain chemistry in which the person has severe depression at times and then may be manic at times.\" It is uncommon, she said, and requires \"a very specific set of criteria.\" \"[O]nly .4 percent to 1.6 percent of the population is, in fact, bipolar,\" she explained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   \u00b674. In addition to bipolar disorder and ADHD, Dr. Smallwood said Ronk appeared to have a \"conduct disorder\" in his childhood. She explained that it was not just \"a little bad behavior\" but \"a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or age appropriate norms are violated.\" \"It can involve aggression to people or animals, it could involve destruction of property, deceitfulness and threat of serious violation of rules ...,\" she said.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   \u00b675. She conveyed that Ronk's \"[v]ery severe problems from many, many, many years back\" are still evident. His bipolar disorder and ADHD left him prone to make wrong decisions and, compared to the average person, made it much more difficult for him to control his impulsive behavior. That said, Ronk's conditions did not render him unable to control his behavior. \"[M]y evaluation did find that [Ronk] did not have a mental disorder that overpowered his will to the point that he did not know right from wrong,\" she said.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   \u00b676. On cross-examination, Dr. Smallwood added antisocial personality disorder as a diagnosis. Symptoms Ronk exhibited were \"failure to conform to social norms about lawful behavior\"; \"deceitfulness and lying behavior\"; \"impulsivity\"; \"failure to plan ahead\"; \"irritability and aggressiveness\"; \"reckless disregard for the safety of himself or others\"; \"consistent irresponsibility\"; and \"often rationaliz[ing] his behavior.\" When asked if antisocial personality disorder is a synonym for \"sociopathic,\" she explained that \"sociopathic\" is \"[s]ometimes ... kind of a lay term that's used when we say antisocial personalities.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   \u00b677. As part of her evaluation, she tested whether Ronk was malingering, i.e., exaggerating or faking psychological symptoms. Of the eight malingering subtests she administered, he scored in the \"honest range\" for two, \"probably feigning\" in two, and indeterminate in the other four. In short, he was not completely honest with her. She knew that, though, and acknowledged the fact on cross-examination. But neither his exaggeration nor his lying altered her opinion. \"The diagnosis was made early in his life, and it doesn't change my observations of whether he met the criteria,\" she said.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   \u00b678. Her report provided more details.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   \u00b679. The initial background information said that Ronk was born in Flowood, Mississippi. A New Jersey couple, Susan and Robert Ronk, adopted him. His relationship with them \"has been strained most of his life, as he has 'been a drug and alcohol addict since ten.' \" Years before, he had learned from his biological mother that he \"was born as the result of a rape.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   \u00b680. Ronk is married but had separated from his wife. He attributed their separation to her addiction. They have no children together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   \u00b681. Educationally, Ronk dropped out of school in twelfth grade. He claimed he scored a \"genius IQ\" in fifth grade, but school bored him. He hardly went and did not do his homework. At age eighteen, his parents kicked him out of the house \"because of his addiction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   \u00b682. Occupationally, Ronk worked various jobs throughout his life. He bartended,\n   assisted a veterinarian, led praise and worship at a church, managed clothing stores, waited tables, worked construction, landscaped, sold cars, changed tires and aligned brakes, climbed poles for a cable company, and owned a marketing firm. He claimed to have built the marketing firm and sold it for $150,000 in just seven months. Otherwise, he never kept a job more than six months because he would get restless and bored.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   \u00b683. Ronk's legal history included prior convictions for first-degree theft of property and grand larceny. At the time of Craite's murder, he had been on house arrest for grand larceny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   \u00b684. Medically, Ronk reported an \"extensive history of mental health problems and mental health treatment.\" Over the years, he was treated in sixteen different hospitals across the country for \"being severely depressed, h[ear]ing voices telling him to hurt himself or others, and chemical addictions.\" During one stay, he reported having seizures and blacking out whenever he lost his temper. Five times he went to rehabilitation programs, including a two-year stint at one point. He would do okay for a while, but then he would relapse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   \u00b685. Ronk either exhibited or spoke about several mental-health issues. He showed symptoms of depression, e.g., low mood, weight gain, hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, irritability, and concentration problems. He also had a history of suicide attempts. And although he did not report having been diagnosed as bipolar, he had symptoms that \"could be indicative of episodes of mania\" or of amphetamine use:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   [Ronk] reported that he has sometimes not slept for four or five days at a time. During those periods, he feels that \"no one can touch me. I can do anything.\" He does not believe he will get in trouble. He is talkative and has pressured speech. He reports flight of ideas and racing thoughts \"99% of the time, even when I'm depressed.\" He endorses distractibility and psychomotor agitation. He reported that he was a \"cutter\" for a while, revealing the scars on his arms and chest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Ronk also struggled with anxiety, panic attacks, and auditory hallucinations. He claimed he had heard voices saying, \"They are out to get you. Kill them before they kill you. Those people don't like you. Kill yourself. No one cares. All will be happier. You can rob that house and get away with it. No one will know.\" Even so, Dr. Smallwood saw no sign of psychosis during her examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   \u00b686. In addition, Ronk had \"a long substance abuse history.\" At age ten, he stole beer, got drunk, and tried marijuana. \"When I smoked weed, I felt normal. I didn't hear voices any more,\" he said, \"I started smoking every day. I stole from my parents to support the habit.\" Through the years, his drug use progressed. At age fourteen, he started taking acid; at sixteen, cocaine; at eighteen, heroin; and at twenty, methamphetamine. Methamphetamine became his drug of choice until 2005. Since then, he has only drunk alcohol. He claimed he drank \"a minimum of a quart of Jaegermeister a day, a maximum of a gallon.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   \u00b687. When asked about past traumas, Ronk identified four. First, his adopted parents said they wished he had never been born. Later in the report, he gave some context:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   My parents put me in counseling in fourth grade because my grades were slipping. They told me that the biggest mistake they made was adopting me, and they wish I wasn't born. I started rebelling. I was adopted at three days old. I was a straight A student, and I guess I caught them on a bad day because\n   m[y] breaking a dish pushed them over the edge, and they said that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Second, he learned from his biological mother that he was conceived as a result of rape. Since learning that, he has felt like a mistake. That knowledge led him to attempt suicide. Third, in fourth grade he was put in accelerated classes, which caused his friends to think he was a nerd and to stop talking to him. Finally, he cited his marriage's demise. After he and his wife separated, he tried to hang himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   \u00b688. When Dr. Smallwood asked Ronk a series of questions about his psychological history, he responded as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   \u00b689. In third grade, he started smoking. So his parents put him in counseling. There, he was diagnosed with ADHD. He refused to take his medication, however, because \"they wanted me to [take it].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   \u00b690. In fourth grade, his parents put him in counseling again because his grades were slipping. Altogether, he spent eight years in counseling. He alleged that on one occasion, a counselor picked him up by the throat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   \u00b691. At any rate, Ronk said he \"wasn't doing good in school, [was] very rebellious, and still smoking.\" At age sixteen, following a fight with his mom, his parents sent him to a psychiatric facility for two-and-a-half weeks. There, he was diagnosed with anger problems, mild seizures, and ADHD. He received medication, but nothing changed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   \u00b692. At some point, Ronk went to a military school. There, \"[he] did whatever [he] wanted\"-smoked weed, made acid, snuck out, fought, and got drunk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   \u00b693. In his first senior year, he and some friends made bomb threats, called fire drills, and started fires to avoid exams. During his second senior year, he got a job at a retail store and decided to quit school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   \u00b694. After quitting school, he attempted suicide by overdosing on pills. That led to a three-week stay in intensive care, followed by several weeks at a country-club-like facility in New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   \u00b695. When he got out, he returned home. Eventually, though, his parents kicked him out, and he started living on the streets. Around that time he got arrested for the first time for making \"terroristic threats\" against his mother. They had gotten in a fight, and she alleged he had threatened to kill her. The charges were later dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   \u00b696. At age eighteen, Ronk began working in construction, followed by stints as a car salesman, auto mechanic, and cable utility pole worker. During that time, he was drinking and smoking marijuana. He was also introduced to \"X (Ecstasy), meth, Special K, GHB.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   \u00b697. He ended up living under a bridge. At that point, he called his parents for help. They got him in a faith-based rehabilitation program. He loved it. \"I found God. I was introduced to music for the first time, and I enjoyed being there. I wish I could go back,\" he said. After seven months, however, he was kicked out for having a relationship with a girl in the program. The discharge put him in violation of his probation for a shoplifting conviction, so he spent forty-five days in jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   \u00b698. Upon being released from jail, Ronk again called his parents. They found him a job at Old Navy, but he quit after about nine months because \"they wouldn't give [him] a raise or benefits.\" From there, he worked at another retail clothing store and then bartended for about a year and a half. \"The profits,\" he said, \"were either going down my throat or up my nose. I was actually buying cocaine from my manager.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   \u00b699. Ronk claimed he witnessed the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New\n   York City and helped remove dozens of bodies from the debris. \"I still have nightmares about the smell of burning flesh. I worked doing that for about [a] month,\" he said.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   \u00b6100. As his drinking increased, he realized he needed help and checked himself back into the same faith-based program that had kicked him out. Six months later, he got mad and left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   \u00b6101. He returned to heavy drinking and methamphetamine use. He tried rehabilitation again in December 2002 and managed to get off methamphetamine. Eventually, he went back home and tried to make amends with his parents. He lived in a homeless shelter, but saw them every week and ate dinner and attended church with them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   \u00b6102. During that period, Ronk reconnected with his biological mother, whom he had not seen since he was a teenager. That experience proved disappointing. \"She showed me the hospital where I was born and asked me to leave because I was the result of a rape, and it was too many bad memories,\" he said. After leaving his biological mom, he \"felt like a mistake\" and tried to kill himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   \u00b6103. After that, Ronk continued working, drinking, and trying to live life even though he did not want to. Through it all, he experienced \"a lot\" of failed relationships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   \u00b6104. Ronk said he entered his last rehabilitation program in 2005. There, he met and married his wife. After only three months, she started smoking crack and cheating on him, and their relationship ended. That led him to try to hang himself. He sought help and was diagnosed with \"[s]ituational [d]epression.\" Eventually, he managed to get a job and checked himself into a halfway house in Mobile, Alabama.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   \u00b6105. While in Mobile, he sought to reconcile with his parents. He moved back in with them and got a job. He was doing well when a job opportunity arose in Mobile. He moved back to Mobile for the job, but did not get it. So he started waiting tables and tried, unsuccessfully, to save his marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   \u00b6106. Eventually, he returned to New Jersey at his parents' urging. There, he waited tables and drank heavily.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   \u00b6107. Dr. Smallwood concluded her report as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   It is my opinion, to a reasonable degree of psychological certainty, that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-183\">\n   a) ... Ronk knew right from wrong at the time of the alleged crimes;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-184\">\n   b) [Ronk] is competent to assist counsel in his defense;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-185\">\n   c) the level of intelligence of [Ronk] is in the High Average range, with a Full Scale IQ of 114.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n   In addition to the above findings, it must be noted that many variables which may provide mitigation are reportedly found in this man's psychological and medical history. However, I do not have the benefit of those medical records. It is highly recommended that these and other relevant records be secured and that collateral witnesses be interviewed. The present examination is not a mitigation study, which is outside the scope of my current practice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-187\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-188\">\n   With respect to the above questions posed by the [c]ourt and addressed in the previous section, no further evaluation is needed. However, as noted, a mitigation study is recommended.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   \u00b6108. Ronk argues no mitigation investigation was done. Dr. Smallwood made clear that she did not do a mitigation study, which is outside the scope of her practice. She recommended that one be\n   done, however, and that did not occur. As support, Ronk attaches affidavits from his adoptive mom, Susan; his biological mom, Jackie Burrell; and Busby. Susan says she was unaware of any mitigation investigation. Her affidavit, alongside Burrell's, support that counsel did not\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-190\">\n   \u2022 interview Ronk's adoptive parents about his background or seek contact information for his friends, teachers, church members, or other family members;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-191\">\n   \u2022 attempt to contact mental-health professionals Ronk had seen beginning when he was in fifth grade;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-192\">\n   \u2022 try to reach Burrell, who has lived at the same address since 1999; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-193\">\n   \u2022 seek to learn about Ronk's biological dad.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Busby says counsel did not develop available mitigation evidence. He says he acquired Ronk's \"voluminous\" medical records at his own expense; those records are attached as an exhibit to his affidavit. Busby says he showed them to Geiss, but Geiss simply shoved them aside and never used them. Ronk claims those records \"show a long history of trauma and serious mental-health problems that, if they had only been put before the jury, would have had a reasonable probability of resulting in a different outcome.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   \u00b6109. The records attached to Busby's affidavit concern a four-day hospital stay from late December 2007 to early January 2008. Ronk was hospitalized after having been kicked out of a facility for stealing cigarettes. At the time, he was facing grand-larceny charges for stealing music equipment from his biological sister; his adoptive parents had bailed him out. A \"Discharge Summary\" notes, in part, his \"chronic mental health history\"; a July 2007 commitment to Whitfield; \"multiple polypharmacy psychotropic medication regimens\" with compliance issues; \"suicidal ideations\"; \"multiple suicide attempts\"; depression; homelessness; and \"history of impulsivity when manic, including gambling, sexual promiscuity, stealing, and drug abuse, primarily crystal meth, although he has been in remission ... since December 31, 2002.\" On discharge, he was diagnosed with Axis I bipolar disorder and polysubstance dependance and Axis II \"borderline, antisocial, and narcissistic personality traits.\" Another document shows that the hospital spoke with Ronk's adoptive parents, who said that he had a \"long history of erratic impulsive behavior\" beginning in fifth grade. They also said he had been diagnosed with \"frontal lobe problems\" when he was younger and that his biological sister \"is reportedly bipolar.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   \u00b6110. In addition to the records from Busby, Ronk attaches nearly one thousand pages of additional medical records. They show, in part, the following: drug-abuse treatment, bipolar diagnoses, homelessness, history of mental illness, hearing voices, depression, substance abuse, suicidal ideations, conflict with parents, multiple psychiatric hospitalizations, personality disorder, anxiety, \"depressive disorder,\" \"adjustment disorder,\" multiple suicide attempts, homicidal ideation, schizophrenia or \"schizoaffective disorder,\" hallucinations/delusions, and ADHD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   \u00b6111. Those records include an isolated mention of child molestation. Elsewhere, however, the records say no physical or emotional abuse was suspected. One \"Progress Note\" specifically says, \"[Ronk] denies any history of physical, sexual, emotional abuse or neglect.\" Moreover, Ronk says nothing in his motion about having been molested as a child. Nor is childhood sexual abuse among the risk factors identified by Dr. James Garbarino, who examined Ronk at post-conviction counsel's request and whose findings are discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   \u00b6112. Another record says Ronk \"apparently met a girl on-line,\" visited her, and she became pregnant. He identifies \"seeing his 6[-]month[-]old daughter for the first time\" among \"[p]reciptiating stressors.\" Other records, however, say that he has no children, but that one of his former girlfriends did. The possibility of his having a child is further negated by a remark he made to Dr. Garbarino. He told Dr. Garbarino that he had always wanted to be a father, but that he thought it was good he had not become one \"because a kid shouldn't have a dad on death row.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   \u00b6113. In addition to claiming counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and obtain or use available records, Ronk alleges counsel was ineffective for failing to hire a qualified expert-more specifically, a mitigation specialist. He claims mitigation specialists are \"indispensable in capital cases,\" and their \"requirement\" is well settled. As support, he cites a law review article by a federal district court judge that, in turn, cites the 2003 ABA Guidelines, which say, \"the capital defense team should consist of at least two attorneys, an investigator, and a 'mitigation specialist.' \" Honorable Helen G. Berrigan,\n   <em>\n    The Indispensable Role of the Mitigation Specialist in A Capital Case: A View from the Federal Bench\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20Hofstra%20L.%20Rev.%20819\">\n    36 Hofstra L.

Ronk attacks Dr. Smallwood's merely recounting the contents of her report as insufficient-the data had to be\n   <em>\n    explained\n   </em>\n   by a qualified expert.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508607\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/362/#p396\">\n    529 U.S. at 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508607\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/362/#p396\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he entire postconviction record, viewed as a whole and cumulative of mitigation evidence presented originally, raised 'a reasonable probability that the result of the sentencing proceeding would have been different' if competent counsel had presented and\n   <em>\n    explained\n   </em>\n   the significance of all the available evidence.\") (emphasis added).

As an example of a qualified expert, Ronk offers Dr. Garbarino, a developmental psychologist. At post-conviction counsel's request, Dr. Garbarino interviewed Ronk for two-and-a-half hours. He prepared a fifteen-page affidavit explaining his findings, summarizing them as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-202\">\n   Ronk is best understood as a troubled child inhabiting a young man's body. His troubled development appears to flow from some combination of temperamental vulnerabilities combined with disrupted family relationships linked to parental rejection. Despite the generally positive family and community environment provided by his adoptive parents, the unresolved issues of his adoption and his reaction to that adoption had a serious negative effect on [Ronk's] emotional\n   life and development. His problems with attachment and a resulting \"emotional neediness\" and oppositional and defiant behavior flowed from this disconnect and deteriorated in adolescence. This in turn led to chronic maladjustment, substance abuse, and delinquent behavior leading up to the crime for which he was sentenced (to death row). His developmental problems came to fruition during adolescence and early adulthood as very serious issues with identity, socio-emotional immaturity, deceitfulness, substance abuse, and depression.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Ronk emphasizes the statement that he \"is best understood as a troubled child inhabiting a young man's body.\" That statement alone, he says, might have given jurors pause because society does not condone killing children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   \u00b6116. Essential to Dr. Garbarino's analysis are three principles. The first is that \"a single risk factor or developmental asset\" is rarely, if ever, decisive in child development. A risk factor's impact depends on the larger context; \"it is the accumulation of risk factors that tells the story.\" Second, \"[c]hildren differ temperamentally in how and to what degree they will react to and generate particular experiences, including abuse and trauma.\" Finally, parental rejection is powerful:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-205\">\n   The experience of parental rejection has been found across cultures to lead to disrupted development, an effect so powerful that the most prominent research in this field refers to it as \"a psychological malignancy.\" Cross-cultural research indicates that parental rejection accounts for approximately 25% of the variation in bad outcomes for children and youth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   \u00b6117. According to Dr. Garbarino, research shows \"adopted children are disproportionately represented in a wide range of developmental issues-ranging from depression to delinquency.\" For Ronk, \"adoption has been the central fact of his life.\" At age seventeen, he met his biological mother and her family. She told him that she was only sixteen when he was born and that he was conceived as a result of \"date rape.\" The date rape occurred at a church-based program for troubled teens. Her father served as the program's chaplain. After she became pregnant, she and her mom lived in a remote trailer until he was born.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   \u00b6118. When Dr. Garbarino asked Ronk about his worst childhood memory, Ronk responded, \"When I overheard my parents say they wished they had not adopted me.\" More specifically,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-208\">\n   [Ronk] reports that at age six he overheard his parents talking about him, and that he heard them say that \"I was the biggest mistake in their whole lives.\" And, \"I wish you were never born.\" And, \"I wish we had never adopted you.\" At age 9, he remembers his mother saying, \"the biggest mistake I ever made was adopting you.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Those two comments-wishing that Ronk had not been born or adopted-\"combine the two most devastating things any child can hear from a parent,\" Dr. Garbarino says. And they affected Ronk, giving rise to sadness, manifesting as depression, and rage, manifesting as aggression. Multiple times, he \"attacked\" his parents, leading them to install dead-bolt locks on their bedroom door. That rage also manifested in Ronk's hostility and resentment toward his biological father, whom he has never met. \"If I ever met [my biological dad],\" he said, \"I would beat the dog piss out of him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   \u00b6119. \"For [Ronk],\" Dr. Garbarino says, \"the idea that both his biological and adoptive mothers 'didn't want [him]' [was] overwhelming.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   \u00b6120. Dr. Garbarino discusses a risk-factor assessment, endorsed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that gives an \"Adverse Childhood Experiences\" (ACE) score. While not comprehensive, the assessment includes inquiries about \"childhood experience of physical, sexual, and psychological maltreatment; poverty; domestic violence; household substance abuse; parental separation or divorce; depression or suicide in a family member; and incarceration of a family member.\" ACE has proven powerful in accounting for differences in negative outcomes, \"accounting for 65% of the variation in suicide attempts, 40% for depressive disorders, and 56% of illicit drug use problems.\" All three, Dr. Garbarino says, are relevant for understanding many killers' lives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   \u00b6121. Dr. Garbarino says Ronk's ACE score appears to be four. For perspective, \"[s]ome 36% of the general population reports an ACE score of zero\"; \"[s]ome 26% report one\"; \"[16%] report two\"; and \"10% report three.\" \"Only 13% report four or more,\" he says. He identifies four risk factors affecting Ronk's ACE score: (1) \"being put down by his parents\"; (2) \"being physically spanked with a wooden spoon leaving marks\"; (3) \"feeling rejected and unloved in his family\"; and (4) \"having a parent with mental health problems (his mom being diagnosed with depression).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   \u00b6122. Dr. Garbarino admits Ronk lacks the \" 'classic' accumulation\" of risk factors common among murderers-e.g., \"physical neglect, poverty, domestic violence, parental divorce, parental incarceration, sexual abuse, and parental alcoholism.\" In Dr. Garbarino's experience, their scores often range from eight to ten. Ronk's \"developmental story,\" in contrast, \"appears to be linked to the special issues he faced as an adopted child.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   \u00b6123. Another assessment Dr. Garbarino cites is the Search Institute's research on \"40 Developmental Assets.\" Weighing such factors as positive elements with family, school, the community, cultural activities, and positive belief systems, the assessment gives \"a compelling picture of the role that positive influences and attributes have on pro-social development in general, and upon violent and aggressive behavior in particular.\" Among youth with thirty-one to forty of those assets, only 6 percent are involved in antisocial aggression, as opposed to 61 percent of youth with zero to ten. Ronk had thirteen assets-four less than the average youth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   \u00b6124. While acknowledging the difficulty of assessing Ronk's temperament during infancy, Dr. Garbarino says the fact that his biological mom did not want him \"may have affected his intrauterine experience.\" His adoptive parents reported \"attachment issues\" early on. \"[Ronk's adoptive parents] explained that he was very uncomfortable being hugged and would run out of the room if physical contact was offered,\" Dr. Garbarino says.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   \u00b6125. Because early, adverse attachment issues often result in developmental harm that is \"not readily observable,\" Dr. Garbarino deems unsurprising that the impact of Ronk's adoption went unrecognized at trial and sentencing. \"It appears to have been masked by the apparent normality of his external social life (e.g., participating in church youth groups) and his intellect and early academic success (e.g., IQ testing at 130 and placement in a 'gifted' program in elementary school),\" he says.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   \u00b6126. Dr. Garbarino says Ronk's childhood problems with attachment and rejection sensitivity extended into adulthood. \"[Ronk's] life has been driven by an intense emotional 'neediness,' \" he says. Ronk's craving for emotional acceptance led him to impulsive, and mostly unsuccessful,\n   relationships. For example, he rushed into marriage with a young woman he met in a drug-rehabilitation program. They separated after only a few weeks, however, because Ronk cheated on her with her best friend. Notably, that account differs from what Ronk told Dr. Smallwood: he told her that he and his wife had separated because she was using drugs and cheating on him. Another example was his relationship with Craite. Ronk described her as \"a millionaire, a cougar, and a drunk.\" He \"rushed into a relationship with [her] ... both because she offered to support him so he could pursue his music and because she offered 'all the sex you could want.' \" Sex, Dr. Garbarino explains, offered Ronk a proxy for intimacy. Yet another example of Ronk's impulsivity in relationships was his decision to leave Craite for a woman he met online.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   \u00b6127. Dr. Garbarino characterizes the first thirty years of Ronk's life as \"an emotional mess\" because Ronk struggled emotionally and in making good decisions. \"[Ronk] speaks of a lifelong desire to 'fit i[n],' to 'be like everyone else,' 'to have friends,' and 'to be accepted,' that seems to reflect this overall emotional neediness,\" Dr. Garbarino says. Ronk spoke fondly of the time a therapist accepted him into her family. In addition, he currently is writing a novel that projects his feelings of isolation and rejection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   \u00b6128. Dr. Garbarino also discusses Ronk's struggles with \"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity\" and depression. Ronk has received counseling since elementary school, although the experiences were neither effective nor all positive. He alleges one therapist grabbed him by the neck; another disclosed confidences to his mom. At school, Ronk's intelligence left him bored: he claimed he would read the textbooks the first few days of school and be bored from then on.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   \u00b6129. Dr. Garbarino says Ronk communicated a \"chronic pattern of negative behavior toward himself and others that began in childhood and continued through adolescence into adulthood.\" Such behavior included the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-221\">\n   <strong>\n    Substance abuse.\n   </strong>\n   From marijuana at age 11, he progressed to meth at 13 and then cocaine at 17.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-222\">\n   <strong>\n    Self-destructive behavior.\n   </strong>\n   He engaged in \"cutting\" and \"suicidal gestures such as overdosing on pills.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-223\">\n   <strong>\n    Defiance against parents.\n   </strong>\n   At age 15, he embarked on a \"master plan to defy [his] parents.\" He became \"a boy at war with his immediate family.\" His plan included \"deliberate academic failure, as well as chronic stealing and lying.\" In a psychological evaluation conducted at that time, he described his dad as \"a perfectionist dictator.\" And he labeled his younger, adopted sister as a \"stuck-up conceited rat.\" He also expressed homicidal intentions against his mom. Though he had threatened her numerous times before, this time he said he meant it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-224\">\n   <strong>\n    Defiance against others.\n   </strong>\n   He once broke up with a girl and \"left with her car and her dad's guns.\" And while managing a clothing store, he stole $20,000 in cash.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   \u00b6130. Reflecting back, Ronk said he had no moral compass. \"I stole from the collection plate at church-I would put in a dollar bill and secretly take out a ten dollar bill.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   \u00b6131. Dr. Garbarino adds that Ronk had a long history of psychiatric hospitalizations since age fifteen. At the same time, he notes that Ronk used voluntary hospitalization to alleviate homelessness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   \u00b6132. Dr. Garbarino concludes his affidavit as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-228\">\n   Ronk's behavior in the attack on [Craite] is best understood as the product of\n   developmental disruptions that began in childhood and escalated in adolescence and adulthood, disruptions that created a person who is both extremely \"emotionally needy\" and in chronic conflict with society. His experience was already \"at risk\" by virtue of the fact that he was an adopted child. It was undermined significantly by his perception of being rejected by his adoptive parents and compared negatively with his sister, who was also adopted. As [Ronk] put it, \"She was the good child and I was the bad child.\" His temperament and attachment issues appeared to have launched him on an increasingly negative path in childhood that became a pattern of chronic alienation, disengagement, anti-social behavior, and substance abuse in adolescence and adulthood, which culminated in the crime for which he is currently incarcerated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   He then adds, \"[t]hese issues constitute significant mitigating factors in any informed sentencing decisions ... and should have been considered in [Ronk's] original sentencing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   \u00b6133. In addition to Dr. Garbarino's affidavit, Ronk offers an affidavit from Dr. Bhushan S. Agharkar. Dr. Agharkar, who interviewed Ronk for about two hours, says it appeared \"[Ronk's] history involved one of trauma and abandonment.\" And \"the symptoms [Ronk] reported may be consistent with [b]ipolar [d]isorder or at least a major mood condition.\" Yet Dr. Agharkar says he needs more time to review Ronk's social history and to conduct more interviews to confirm his clinical suspicions. No supplemental affidavit or report from Dr. Agharkar is provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   \u00b6134. An affidavit from Ronk's adoptive mother Susan says they provided Ronk \"a very stable, structured home.\" The family attended church, went camping, and took vacations. Early on, they told Ronk he was adopted, and he knew what that meant. When he got older, they took him to meet his biological mother. He learned his mother had been raped. Afterwards, he struggled coming to terms with being adopted. He wrestled with rejection and his feeling that he was \"a mistake.\" Although they sought counseling for him beginning in fifth grade, his behavior steadily grew worse as he got older.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   \u00b6135. Ronk's biological mother Burrell's affidavit confirms he was conceived as a result of \"date rape.\" She identifies the biological father, but says that she does not know his whereabouts. At age eighteen, Ronk told Burrell he wished she had kept and raised him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   \u00b6136. Ronk argues that if counsel had conducted a mitigation investigation and hired a qualified expert, then counsel could have presented and explained the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-234\">\n   \u2022 \"the story of [his] adoption and troubled childhood and adolescence-of his conception out of wedlock as the result of a what he believed was a rape\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-235\">\n   \u2022 the consequences of his learning of his adoption and his believing he was conceived as the result of rape;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-236\">\n   \u2022 \"his traumatic experiences of feeling rejection, of coming to believe that he was not wanted by either his biological or his adoptive parents\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-237\">\n   \u2022 \"his mental illnesses, and how they exacerbated the effects of trauma\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-238\">\n   \u2022 \"[his] repeated, failed attempts at treatment\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-239\">\n   \u2022 his child-development issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   Had the jury heard such mitigating evidence, he says, a reasonable probability exists that the result would have been different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   \u00b6137. Arguably, counsel's mitigation investigation was deficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   \u00b6138. On one hand, we disagree with Ronk in three respects. First, contrary to his assertions, Dr. Smallwood was qualified to provide mitigating evidence. While she did admit that a mitigation study is outside the scope of her practice, she also said some information she uncovered was relevant to mitigation. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Wiggins\n   </em>\n   , in which the psychologist's reports \"revealed nothing ... of [the] petitioner's life history,\"\n   <em>\n    Wiggins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898384\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/510/#p521\">\n    539 U.S. at 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898384\" index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/510/#p521\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Dr. Smallwood's report contained information about Ronk's life. In addition, she evaluated his mental-health issues, which Ronk admits is a primary task for mitigation specialists. And unlike\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   , in which Dr. Smallwood admitted lacking expertise about PTSD's effects, she never suggested Ronk's mental-health issues were beyond her expertise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   \u00b6139. Second, we disagree that counsel did\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   mitigation investigation. They did some. For one, they moved to have Dr. Smallwood evaluate Ronk, in part, \"to determine ... whether or not a psychological evaluation would reveal any migrating circumstances.\" She spoke with his parents and uncovered information relevant to sentencing. For another, they acquired some records. Pretrial, the trial court granted a continuance to give Dr. Smallwood more time to review \"records\n   <em>\n    from a number of institutions\n   </em>\n   regarding [Ronk's] past psychological treatment.\" (Emphasis added.) Later, Geiss referenced a \"big binder full\" of medical and psychological records. Busby's affidavit shows he acquired records as well. Although they apparently went unused for the most part-in her list of sources, Dr. Smallwood cited records from only one hospital-at least some were obtained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   \u00b6140. Third, we disagree that the\n   <em>\n    requirement\n   </em>\n   of a mitigation specialist is well settled. That is untrue.\n   <em>\n    Hill v. Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12137927\" index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/910/\">\n    842 F.3d 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 945 n.15 (6th Cir. 2016) (stating ABA Guidelines do not establish a constitutional right to a mitigation specialist for the sentencing phase);\n   <em>\n    Honie v.

There is no \"per se rule that trial counsel is ineffective at mitigation unless a particular type of expert is retained.\"\n   <em>\n    Carter v. Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6045760\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/443/517/#p527\">\n    443 F.3d 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 527 (6th Cir. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   \u00b6141. On the other hand, Dr. Smallwood's report and the records that were obtained arguably would have led a reasonable attorney to investigate further. Her report clearly signaled that more was needed. She said \"many variables which may provide mitigation are reportedly found in [Ronk's] psychological and medical history. However, I do not have the benefit of those medical records.\" So whatever records were in the \"big binder\" Geiss referenced, Dr. Smallwood either did not get them or they were all from one hospital. Because she lacked his other records, she \"highly recommended\" that they and \"other relevant records be secured and that collateral witnesses be interviewed.\" What is more, she specifically said her examination was not a mitigation study and recommended that one be done. Counsel, apparently, did not heed her advice. Ronk presents evidence that counsel neither interviewed collateral witnesses nor did counsel conduct a full mitigation study. Susan says that counsel never contacted her or her husband about Ronk's background or contact information for his friends, teachers, church members, or other family members. To her knowledge, Geiss \"did not conduct any sort of mitigation investigation.\" Burrell, likewise, said\n   counsel never contacted her. And Busby says trial counsel \"did not develop the mitigation evidence that was available.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   \u00b6142. Furthermore, Busby says the records he collected warranted further investigation. They note Ronk's \"chronic mental health history\"; prior commitment to Whitfield; suicidal ideations and attempts; homelessness; drug abuse; history of behavioral problems dating back to fifth grade; \"frontal lobe problems\" as a youth; and bipolar-disorder and polysubstance-dependance diagnoses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   \u00b6143. Although we find counsel's mitigation investigation arguably was deficient, that satisfies only half the test-he must also make a substantial showing of prejudice. In that regard, we find he falls short.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   \u00b6144. The new evidence Ronk provides is mostly cumulative: Dr. Smallwood's testimony and report referenced his adoption; conception as a result of rape; sense of rejection and feeling like a mistake; hearing his parents say they wish he had never been born or that they had not adopted him; substance abuse; mental-health and behavioral issues beginning around age ten; extensive mental-health history and hospitalizations; bipolar-disorder and ADHD diagnoses; suicide attempts; depression; and failed relationships, including a failed marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   \u00b6145. To be sure, Dr. Garbarino better explains and connects Ronk's behavior to child-development issues that included his adoption, sense of parental rejection, temperament, and attachment issues. But Dr. Smallwood conveyed many of those things. She explained how his adoption and feelings of being a mistake provoked anger. \"[Ronk] apparently had resentment about [his] adoption, feeling that he was a mistake, and he tended to take that anger out on his adoptive parents,\" she said. In speaking to Dr. Smallwood, Ronk acknowledged that adopted children frequently grapple with rejection issues. \"I know that 98 percent of adopted kids have rejection issues,\" he told her. And in recalling past traumas, he cited learning of his conception's being the result of rape and hearing his adoptive parents say they wished he had never been born.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   \u00b6146. Dr. Smallwood attributed Ronk's impulsive, aggressive, and threatening behavior to his bipolar disorder and ADHD. \"Ronk had a history throughout his life of impulsive behavior, aggressive and threatening kind of behavior, not thinking before he made decisions, and that is something that certainly, you know, are [h]allmarks of both manic depressive disorder and ADHD,\" she explained. Later, she added that \"the presence of the bipolar disorder and ADHD, which he has, would make it much more difficult for him to control than the average person.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   \u00b6147. Ronk's homelife was not horrid. His adoptive mom Susan speaks of their attending church, going camping, and taking vacations. Even Dr. Garbarino says Ronk's adoptive parents provided a \"generally positive family and community environment.\" And without excusing or minimizing the impact of their alleged hurtful comments, Dr. Smallwood's report gives some context to at least one such instance. Ronk says he \"caught them on a bad day because [his] breaking a dish pushed them over the edge, and they said [the biggest mistake they made was adopting me, and they wish I wasn't born].\" In other words, such comments apparently were not commonplace-otherwise, he could not have had a generally positive family environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   \u00b6148. Overall, the evidence casts Ronk's adoptive parents as frustrated but still supportive. More than once, he \"attacked\" them, which led them to install dead-bolt\n   locks on their bedroom door. He admitted devising a \"master plan\" to defy and oppose them by deliberate academic failure, stealing, and lying. Despite all that, they assisted him in getting into rehabilitation programs and in finding a job. They provided financial assistance and bailed him out of jail. They also housed him for a time and tried to house him several times over the years, but they eventually gave up. In a 2006 medical record, Ronk's adoptive dad said Ronk could not return to live with them because \"we've tried that too many times and it just doesn't work.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   \u00b6149. To the extent the new evidence Ronk provides is beneficial, it is equally damaging. On one hand, Dr. Garbarino discusses how Ronk's being an adopted child put him \"at risk.\" And he explains Ronk's above-average ACE score and below-average number of developmental assets. On the other hand, he concedes Ronk lacks the \" 'classic' accumulation\" of risk factors common among murderers-his ACE score is four whereas theirs often ranges from eight to ten. Even Ronk's numerous hospital stays are questionable: Dr. Garbarino says Ronk \"used voluntary hospital admission as a way to alleviate issues associated with homelessness.\" Then there are the bad acts-taking his ex-girlfriend's father's car and guns, stealing a large sum of money from an employer, and removing money from the church offering plate. Maybe most damaging are Ronk's comments about Craite. According to Dr. Garbarino, he called her \"a millionaire, a cougar, and a drunk,\" and said, essentially, that he used her for sex and to support his music career/hobby. Those comments cast him as selfish, manipulative, contemptuous, and unrepentant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   \u00b6150. In sum, Dr. Smallwood covered the basic mitigating evidence supporting Ronk, and nothing offered now is new or different. In reweighing all the aggravating and mitigating evidence, no reasonable probability exists that at least one juror would have struck a different balance. The new evidence merely expounds on or rounds out facts that were presented to the jury. Moreover, this double-edged evidence is nowhere near the magnitude of the undiscovered evidence in cases like\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wiggins\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Rompilla\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   <em>\n    2. Counsel was not ineffective for \"opening the door\" to damaging evidence during the sentencing phase, for eliciting otherwise inadmissible and prejudicial prior-bad-acts evidence from Dr. Smallwood, and for failing to anticipate and/or meet additional non-statutory aggravating evidence the State elicited from her during cross-examination.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   \u00b6151. Mitigation evidence can be double-edged-so much so that counsel, following a constitutionally adequate investigation, may reasonably choose to offer none.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burger v. Kemp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28169\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/776/#p788\">\n    483 U.S. 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 788-95,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28169\" index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/776/#p788\">\n    107 S.Ct. 3114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 3123,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28169\" index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/776/#p788\">\n    97 L.Ed.2d 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987).

Dr. Smallwood testified that Ronk's history was \"congruent\" or \"consistent with\" bipolar disorder and ADHD. She described his history of \"impulsive behavior, aggressive and threatening kind of behavior, not thinking before he made decisions\" as \"[h]allmarks\" of bipolar disorder and ADHD. Counsel elicited additional testimony about a \"childhood conduct disorder\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-261\">\n   [Geiss]: Okay. Based upon your interviews and testing did you find that Mr. Ronk had any kind of what we would call a conduct problem, conduct disorder, anything like that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-262\">\n   [Dr. Smallwood]: Right. This was not documented in his records, but as I look back to the history that was given it appears that he would have had a conduct disorder in his childhood.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-263\">\n   [Geiss]: What with regard to Mr. Ronk would that be?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-264\">\n   [Dr. Smallwood]: Well it's -- conduct disorder is not just having a little bad behavior, which a lot of kids have, but, in fact, it's a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or age appropriate norms are violated. It can involve aggression to people or animals, it could involve destruction of property, deceitfulness and threat of serious violation of rules, and all of those were present in Mr. Ronk.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   To summarize, Dr. Smallwood said Ronk had \"[v]ery severe problems from many, many, many years back,\" which remain evident today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   \u00b6155. Counsel then delved into whether Ronk's disorders prevented him from controlling his actions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-267\">\n   [Geiss]: [T]he bottom line is here would it be fair to say that Mr. Ronk confronted with a stressful situation or a situation in which things are not going his way would be prone to act or make the wrong decision and not really be totally in control of that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-268\">\n   [Dr. Smallwood]: That's a two-part question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-269\">\n   [Geiss]: Yes, it is?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-270\">\n   [Dr. Smallwood]: So let me respond to those separately. That he would be prone to act and make the wrong decision. Certainly he would have the vulnerability to do that both based on his -- the diagnosis that I have described and just behavioral habits. Was he -- I think the second part of the question was could he control that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-271\">\n   [Geiss]: Yes, ma'am?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-272\">\n   [Dr. Smallwood]: Not totally, but my evaluation did find that he did not have a mental disorder that overpowered his will to the point that he did not know right from wrong.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   \u00b6156. On cross-examination, the State had Dr. Smallwood concede that Ronk had not been \"overcome by some kind of organic mental disorder or anything like that,\" but that he had made \"a behavioral choice\" when he killed Craite. She also reaffirmed his history of impulsive, aggressive, threatening, manipulative, and, perhaps, unlawful behavior. Further, the State questioned her about Ronk's malingering. She said he had not been completely honest with her. Later, the State asked her about a letter Ronk wrote Hindall while he was in prison awaiting trial. In the letter, he discussed a plan to escape from jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   \u00b6157. Toward the end of its cross-examination, the State asked Dr. Smallwood if she had an opinion about Ronk's being antisocial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-275\">\n   [State]: Does your opinion rise to the level that he would be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-276\">\n   [Dr. Smallwood]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-277\">\n   [State]: Is that -- pardon my ignorance of the medical terminology, but is a synonym for that diagnosis someone who is sociopathic?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-278\">\n   [Dr. Smallwood]: Sometimes that's kind of a lay term that's used when we say antisocial personalities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-279\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-280\">\n   [State]: ... So you would diagnosis him as antisocial personality disorder ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-281\">\n   [Dr. Smallwood]: Yes. I didn't see that in any of the medical records that I had, but when I look at the behavior as I assessed it I think he does meet those criteria.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   \u00b6158. On redirect, counsel focused on Ronk's possible malingering:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-283\">\n   [Geiss]: I want to specifically ask because [the State] dwelled on it, the malingering test?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-284\">\n   [Dr. Smallwood]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-285\">\n   [Geiss]: You took into consideration the fact that he could have been exaggerating or even lying?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-286\">\n   [Dr. Smallwood]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-287\">\n   [Geiss]: And that still did not change your diagnosis?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-288\">\n   [Dr. Smallwood]: The diagnosis was made early in his life, and it doesn't change my observations of whether he met the criteria.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-289\">\n   [Geiss]: In other words, he didn't pull the wool over anybody's eyes, did he?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-290\">\n   [Dr. Smallwood]: We knew that he was not being completely truthful.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   \u00b6159. In closing arguments, the State noted Dr. Smallwood's testimony that Ronk was able to control his actions and knew right from wrong. Geiss, however, urged jurors to read Dr. Smallwood's report and to consider her testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-292\">\n   [Y]ou heard Dr. Smallwood, and I would again urge you when you get back there, you will have her report, and I ask all of\n   you to please read through it carefully. Dr. Smallwood told you basically that ... Ronk doesn't possess the same tools all of us seem to possess. When he was confronted with a situation his responses are not the same as ours would be. .... [Ronk] is not insane. He is just incapable of making what would be in this kind of a situation a rational decision, and acting rationally under the circumstances. Remember what she told you. This is not an imaging thing. We talked to her a lot about what exactly it means to be bipolar because everybody today is bipolar. So that's not true. It's a very small percentage of the population that is truly suffering from this ailment, and that's what it is. It's a defect of the mind. It's a chemical imbalance. And what it does and what it did in the case of ... Ronk was push him to make all the wrong decisions from the very beginning just as he's probably been making a lot of wrong decisions for most of his life, but it's not something that he wholly controls. If he's fed medications then he's planed out or leveled out or whatever it is that these medications do. I personally still do not understand bipolar disorder fully, but I do understand that it's treated. And if it is not treated it causes problems. Those problems, like Dr. Smallwood told you, cause people that are aggressive or [Ronk] in this case, to act aggressively in a threatening manner and impulsively, and that I would submit to you is what happened here.... Ronk acted on impulse, and because he has a chemical imbalance his impulses were all wrong.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   \u00b6160. In its rebuttal closing, the State revisited Dr. Smallwood's testimony and report:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-294\">\n   [T]he testimony that you heard from Dr. Smallwood, and I submit to you her report is quite telling. And what she told you herself in addition to what's contained in her report likewise is quite telling. Because if you recall when I asked her in cross-examination whether these behavioral problems, behaviors[ ] that the defendant has exhibited over the course of adolescence and adulthood or his childhood, his impulsive behavior, his manipulation, his aggressive behavior, his inability to conform his behavior to the norms of society, the rules by which everyone in this courtroom must live, his inability over the course of his lifetime to do that. Someone years back diagnosed him as ADHD and bipolar. Well she agreed with me that that's a classic clear example of someone who has antisocial personalty disorders. And in my inability to talk to her on the same level I said is that the same thing as sociopathic, and she agreed. And that's the same kind of recklessness and indifference to the value of human life, impulsiveness that landed us in this courtroom and landed ... Craite deceased. Take that into consideration please. Don't allow bad childhood to be a crutch.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   \u00b6161. Ronk argues that counsel's minimal investigation caused Dr. Smallwood's testimony not only to be weak, but also to be prejudicial. She only had medical records from one institution; without his full medical and psychological treatment history, she was unable to diagnose him-the most she could say was that his behavioral history was\n   <em>\n    consistent with\n   </em>\n   bipolar disorder and ADHD. And to show that, she had to discuss \"otherwise inadmissible and extremely dangerous information\" concerning prior bad acts. For example, she cited his history of impulsive, aggressive, and threatening behavior. Even more damaging, according to Ronk, were the behaviors she associated with his childhood-conduct disorder-a persistent pattern of violating others' rights and age-appropriate norms; aggression towards people or animals; destruction\n   of property; deceitfulness; and the \"threat of serious violation of rules.\" Ronk maintains that none of that would have been admissible had the State offered it to establish his bad character. And to worsen the situation, instead of realizing Dr. Smallwood's limitations, Geiss compounded the damaging information by eliciting from her that Ronk \"did not have a mental disorder that overpowered his will.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   \u00b6162. With the door opened, the State expanded on Ronk's history of misbehavior. It elicited his law breaking, manipulation of others, and planned escape from jail-a \"highly prejudicial\" accusation standing alone, Ronk says. What is more, the planned jail escape originated from a letter that was never introduced. Nor had Dr. Smallwood seen it beforehand. The State's cross-examination then culminated with its getting Dr. Smallwood to label Ronk a \"sociopath\" with \"anti-social personality disorder.\" Those labels, Ronk says, were stronger and more stigmatizing than her earlier opinions that his history was \"consistent\" or \"congruent\" with bipolar disorder and ADHD. The labels also supported the State's \"heinous, atrocious, and cruel\" aggravator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   \u00b6163. Ronk adds that counsel not only opened the door for the State to elicit damaging information on cross-examination, but also failed to object when the State elicited rank speculation. He gives two examples. First, the State asked if Ronk's \"violation of norms\" included \"violation of the law.\" Dr. Smallwood answered perhaps. Second, it asked if it would \"probably be a fair statistic that the overwhelming majority of adopted children don't stab and kill somebody and burn their house.\" Dr. Smallwood affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   \u00b6164. On redirect, rather than trying to ameliorate the damage, counsel had Dr. Smallwood stand by her opinions even though she knew Ronk was not being candid. Citing\n   <em>\n    Ferguson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11951192\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/507/94/#p96\">\n    507 So.2d 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 97 (Miss. 1987), Ronk says a lawyer's endorsing a client's untruthfulness requires reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   \u00b6165. Then in closing remarks, Ronk says the State used Dr. Smallwood's testimony to cast him as \"an 'evil,' manipulative, exploitative sociopath hiding behind nothing more than a 'bad childhood,' rather than a traumatized, disturbed child who grew up to have a serious mental illness that contributed to his committing the crime.\" Counsel's closing argument, in contrast, consisted of Geiss's tepidly saying that Ronk lacked normal control due to mental illness and asking jurors \"to listen to Dr. Smallwood, read her report, and follow their consciences.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   \u00b6166. Ronk likens his case to\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   , an insufficient mitigation investigation led counsel to call mitigation witnesses whose testimony opened the door to damaging, prejudicial information. Ronk also cites\n   <em>\n    Rompilla\n   </em>\n   , asserting that \"[f]ailure to anticipate damaging evidence that the State is likely to adduce ... is prejudicial ineffectiveness standing alone.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   \u00b6167. We find Ronk fails to make a substantial showing that counsel was ineffective as alleged here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   \u00b6168. Notably, Ronk does not argue that counsel should have presented no mitigating evidence of mental illness or life history; rather, he argues that counsel should have prepared better and known more about Dr. Smallwood's findings in order to realize her limitations and to anticipate the damaging information she would present and open the door to. Had counsel done that, they could have presented the good minus the bad through a more qualified expert-like Dr. Garbarino.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-303\">\n   \u00b6169. Counsel surely knew Dr. Smallwood's testimony could have positive and\n   negative effects. Her report gave examples of Ronk's impulsive, aggressive, threatening behavior-e.g., prior crimes; \"trouble being around people\"; substance abuse; getting into fights; making bomb threats; threatening or fighting his mother; and \"a lot of failed relationships.\" In addition, weeks before trial, the State provided Geiss copies of letters from Hindall. At the same time, however, Dr. Smallwood's report said nothing about a childhood-conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder, or sociopathy. Nor is it clear if the letters Geiss received mentioned Ronk's jail-escape plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-304\">\n   \u00b6170. At any rate, counsel's actions were not deficient. The decision to present Ronk's behavioral problems in the context of his mental illness fell within the realm of trial strategy. Of course, those problems were subject to attack once presented.\n   <em>\n    Hansen v.

Even if what Ronk argues is true, Dr. Garbarino's affidavit shows he would have testified no differently than Dr. Smallwood did. We fail to see how his testimony would not present equivalent bad acts and open the door for the State to present the very same evidence. He speaks of Ronk's \"delinquent behavior leading up to [Craite's murder]\"; his rage; his attacking his parents; his \"impulsive (and largely unsuccessful) efforts to find connection\"; his impulsivity; his struggling to make good decisions; his \"chronic pattern of negative behavior towards himself and others that began in childhood and continued through adolescence into adulthood\"; his defiance toward his parents; his threats to kill his mother; his \"deliberate academic failure\";\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   his \"chronic stealing and lying\"; his taking his girlfriend's dad's car and guns; his stealing from his employer; his stealing from the church collection plate; and his \"anti-social behavior.\" All that shows impulsive, aggressive, threatening, nonconforming, destructive, deceitful, manipulative, and unlawful behavior.

No such circumstances exist here. Geiss was not calling Ronk a liar; he was emphasizing that Ronk's truthfulness, or lack thereof, to Dr. Smallwood was immaterial. He sought to bolster her opinions after the State had tried to discount them by cross-examining her about Ronk's malingering. Geiss's point was that she knew Ronk was malingering, but her opinions remained unchanged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-308\">\n   <em>\n    3.

Ronk argues counsel was ineffective for failing to discover, put on, and properly explain evidence of his mental disorders. He says research shows that such evidence significantly affects jurors. An extensive study by the Capital Jury Project, for example, showed that if the jury had known a defendant had a history of mental illness, 26.7 percent of them were \"much less likely,\" and 29.5 percent were \"slightly less likely,\" to vote for death. Stephen P.

And if they had known a defendant \"had been in institutions but was never given any real help,\" 20.1 percent were \"much less likely,\" and 28.1 percent were \"slightly less likely,\" to vote for death.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"294\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20Colum.%20L.%20Rev.%201538\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-310\">\n   \u00b6174. We find Ronk fails to present a substantial showing that counsel was ineffective in this regard. Dr. Smallwood said Ronk had symptoms consistent with bipolar disorder and ADHD. And at least three times, she said he had mental disorders. First, in discussing her initial findings, she said, \"[h]e did have mental disorders.\" Second, when asked about his ability to control his impulses, she said \"the presence of the bipolar disorder and ADHD,\n   <em>\n    which he has\n   </em>\n   \" made impulse control much harder for him than the average person. (Emphasis added.) And finally, she affirmed that she would diagnose him with antisocial personality disorder. In addition, she explained the meaning of ADHD and bipolar disorder, noting that true bipolar disorder is rare, affecting .4 percent to 1.6 percent of the population. She also said that Ronk had had \"numerous hospital stays over the course of his lifetime\" for mental problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-311\">\n   <em>\n    4. Counsel was not ineffective for a brief, tepid, and incomplete opening statement and closing argument at sentencing.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-312\">\n   \u00b6175. Ronk argues that Geiss was ineffective for his \"brief, tepid, and incomplete opening statement and closing argument\" at sentencing. He says Geiss's opening statement was six sentences (minus \"Ladies and gentlemen\" and \"Thank you\") and only 127 words:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-313\">\n   Ladies and gentlemen. You will recall way back Monday when we started this process I talked about them making a decision about whether or not the State should take someone's life. You would want to know as much as possible about that individual, and that is what we're going to try and get across to you today, this morning. we will do that through the testimony of Dr. Beverly Smallwood who was a psychologist -- is a psychologist and conducted an evaluation on Mr. Ronk. I'm not going to belabor what it is. She will testify, you will hear that yourselves. But I do ask that you pay attention because some of it is medicalese. And I will try and make sure that Dr. Smallwood explains that as simply as possible. Thank you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-314\">\n   Ronk insists that Geiss should have erred on the side of saying too much rather than choosing not to \"belabor\" whatever it was he had in mind. Ronk, again, emphasizes counsel's duty not only to present mitigating evidence, but also to explain it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-315\">\n   \u00b6176. The State disagrees that Geiss's opening statement was either too brief or ineffective in explaining why death was unwarranted. It says Ronk's insistence that more should have been said is subjective: no mandatory minimum number of sentences or words is required. Opening statements are not even mandatory. Miss. Code.

The State also disputes that Geiss's opening statement was unclear. His point was simple: He was telling the jury that, through Dr. Smallwood, he would provide them the information they needed to decide whether death should be imposed. And he strategically chose neither to detract from that point nor to risk losing the jury's attention by wading into the minutiae.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-317\">\n   \u00b6178.

Ronk also complains that, for some reason, Geiss spent eighty-six words explaining Ronk was not legally insane. And Geiss never\n   mentioned Ronk's adoption-the central fact of his life, according to Dr. Garbarino. What is more, Geiss told the jury to read Dr. Smallwood's report, but he did not explain what it meant. To the contrary, he said he did not understand it:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-321\">\n   If he's fed medications then he's planed out or leveled out or whatever it is that these medications do. I personally still do not understand bipolar disorder fully, but I do understand that it's treated. And if it is not treated it causes problems. Those problems, like Dr. Smallwood told you, cause people that are aggressive or [Ronk] in this case, to act aggressively in a threatening manner and impulsively, and that I would submit to you is what happened here....

He gives two examples.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   \u00b6186. First, at one point during the jury-instructions conference, Geiss said he was \"at a loss of how to argue the case.\" And later, he said he was \"terribly confused.\" Not long after that, he said it had been defense counsel's position that the jury would find Ronk guilty of something.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-339\">\n   \u00b6187. Second, in his closing argument, Geiss said, \"We are hard pressed to tell you this is a good solid self-defense case ....\" Ronk calls that remark \"inexplicable.\" He insists self-defense was his strongest primary defense. Evidence was presented to support it, and the jury was instructed accordingly. Ronk suggests that illness may have caused that remark: earlier, Geiss had said, \"[E]xcuse me I'm short of breath.\" Regardless, Ronk says the jury's hearing Geiss say the main defense theory was no good surely made a big impression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-340\">\n   \u00b6188. We find Ronk fails to present a substantial showing that Geiss was ineffective during the guilt phase. Geiss's remarks must be considered in context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-341\">\n   \u00b6189. The jury-instructions conference began in the late afternoon. Geiss offered instructions on self-defense, imperfect self-defense manslaughter, deliberate-design murder, and heat-of-passion manslaughter. The parties and the trial court discussed at length which were proper. One of Geiss's defense theories was that Craite was murdered before the arson; if so, he argued, Ronk could be guilty of either murder or manslaughter, but not capital murder. The State discredited that theory based on the one-continuous-transaction doctrine, i.e., it did not matter if the arson occurred before, during, or after the killing. The trial court said it was inclined to agree. It added that it understood that \"the defense primarily was one of self-defense\" and that it saw no evidentiary support for deliberate-design murder. The State then asserted that it did not believe evidence supported imperfect self-defense manslaughter either. Notably, the imperfect self-defense-manslaughter instruction was eventually denied.\n   <em>\n    Ronk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6860294\" index=\"311\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/172/1112/#p1121\">\n    172 So.3d at 1125-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When the trial court asked Geiss if he wished to say anything else, he replied, \"I'm somewhat at a loss of how to argue the case.\" At that point, the trial court proposed recessing for the evening, allowing both sides to research further, and reconvening the next morning. In doing so, it voiced uncertainty and said it had \"serious concerns\" about which self-defense instructions were proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-342\">\n   \u00b6190. After the jury was excused, the parties and the trial court discussed jury instructions a bit more. Toward the end of that discussion, the trial court tried to pinpoint the unresolved issues. When it asked Geiss if he knew of any additional unresolved instructions, he replied, \"No. I'm terribly confused.\" The court again asked, \"Do you know of any others?\" He said, \"No, ma'am.\" With that, the court recessed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-343\">\n   \u00b6191. The next morning, the trial court said its research, along with the authorities provided by both sides, yielded \"no clear answer.\" Geiss elaborated on his theory that no continuous course of conduct had occurred. After the trial court discussed\n   several cases in trying to determine if a lesser-included-offense instruction was proper, Geiss interjected as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-344\">\n   Your Honor, perhaps I should point out now that taking away any of the lesser included from the defendant and making it an all or not guilty argument basically takes away from him any defense whatsoever. It's been our position, and I'm sure the jury would find, that, you know, Mr. Ronk is guilty of something. Our argument has just been it is not capital murder, but it could be murder and it could possibly be manslaughter, and that they should be entitled to at least that option, one or the other.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-345\">\n   The trial court understood but disagreed that Ronk would be left with no defense. \"I believe he still has the defense of self-defense, which as I understand is his primary defense in this case,\" it said. Still, out of an abundance of caution, it granted a lesser-included-offense instruction on murder and arson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-346\">\n   \u00b6192. We find that Geiss's remarks about being \"at a loss\" and \"terribly confused\" do not show deficient performance. The \"at a loss\" remark probably reflected his frustration amidst a complex debate about which self-defense instructions were proper and what effect the refusal of certain instructions would have on his trial strategy. The trial court itself said that \"no clear answer\" was apparent. And the \"terribly confused\" remark was understandable given the nature of the discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-347\">\n   \u00b6193. Further, Geiss's comment that the defense believed the jury would find Ronk guilty of something did not constitute deficient performance either. Given the overwhelming evidence, that statement was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-348\">\n   \u00b6194. In any event, no prejudice is shown. Ronk received not only a self-defense instruction, but also a lesser-included-offense instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-349\">\n   \u00b6195. In its closing argument, the State conceded that it did not know exactly what had happened in the bedroom in which Craite died. Still, it discredited Ronk's assertion that he thought Craite was going to retrieve a gun inside the closet, because no evidence of any gun was found inside the bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-350\">\n   \u00b6196. In his closing argument, Geiss touched on self-defense, but emphasized the lesser-included offenses more:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-351\">\n   There is an instruction in here on what is deliberate design which would support murder, and I don't want you -- because the instruction points out don't confuse deliberate design with any kind of premeditation because under the law in the deliberate design part you come up like that. And that basically is what happened here.... Ronk in the blink of an eye lashed out when he thought that [Craite] was going to do what to him? And that's another issue. We are hard pressed to tell you this is a good solid self-defense case, but we don't have to prove that. It's rather the State's burden to prove that there was not self-defense, and I don't think they have put up anything that says this was not self-defense. All that we have are what ... Ronk himself has told everyone from the beginning, and told them over and over again. That [Craite] attacked him, he thought she was going for the shotgun, which he thought was in the bedroom closet, and so he stabbed her. Now that right in and of itself if you think that is what happened takes this immediately out of being a capital crime, we think, and puts it four square on the lesser[-]included offense. Ladies and gentlemen, we would submit to you that is what the evidence shows here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-352\">\n   [W]e can't condone a lot of what ... Ronk did. On the other hand, I don't think we can find him guilty of a murder for which he risks losing his own life. We knew from the very beginning that [Ronk] was not going to be walking out of the door when this was over, but I would submit to you what the true facts indicate in this case are punishment for lesser[-]included offenses that you have been instructed about. It's that simple, and we ask that you so find.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-353\">\n   \u00b6197. We find Geiss's remarks in closing argument do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. As stated already, we are hesitant to vacate a sentence based on defense counsel's closing argument.\n   <em>\n    Havard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8426224\" index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/928/771/#p796\">\n    928 So.2d at 796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And despite Geiss's comment, the elements instruction for capital murder required the jury to find that Ronk had not acted in self-defense. Ronk received self-defense instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-354\">\n   \u00b6198. Whether Geiss should have argued self-defense more forcibly is a matter of trial strategy. And he faced a dilemma. To find Ronk acted in self-defense, the jury had to find he had reasonable grounds to apprehend \"a design on the part of [Craite] to kill him or to do him some great bodily harm\" and that such danger was\n   <em>\n    imminent\n   </em>\n   . Evidence showed that Craite kept two guns in a studio apartment attached to the carport, but no trace of any gun was found in the bedroom where she died. Not only had the State highlighted that in its closing argument, but the trial court had denied Ronk's imperfect-self-defense manslaughter instruction. It was not unreasonable then for Geiss to (a) admit that the self-defense argument was not solid; (b) say that, nevertheless, it remained plausible; and (c) urge the jury to consider the lesser-included offenses of murder and arson-crimes that would at least spare him a death sentence. What is more, under the lesser-included-offense instruction, the jury still had to find that Ronk had not acted in self-defense in order to convict him of murder. Conceivably, then, the jury could have found him not guilty of murder, but guilty of arson only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-355\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Ronk's challenge to the disproportionality of his sentence is barred by the doctrine of res judicata.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-356\">\n   \u00b6199. On direct appeal, Ronk claimed his death sentence was \"excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Ronk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6860294\" index=\"313\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/172/1112/#p1121\">\n    172 So.3d at 1148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Following Justice Breyer's lead, Ronk says that since October 1976, 57 of Mississippi's 82 counties have accounted for all 213 death sentences.

A study by the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO), for example, found that \"individuals accused of murdering white victims, as opposed to black or other minority victims, are more likely to receive the death penalty.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"378\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/#p2755\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"378\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/#p2755\">\n    at 2760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ronk says the same is true for Mississippi: of the 250 victims since 1976, 182 were white (72.8 percent) (including the victim here); 55 black (22 percent); 7 Asian (2.8 percent); 5 unknown (2 percent); and 1 Hispanic (.4 percent). Yet according to the United States Department of Justice and the Wall Street Journal, approximately 70 percent of homicide victims in Mississippi are black. \"These statistics,\" Ronk says, \"strongly suggest that a defendant who is convicted of the capital murder of a white person is much more likely to receive the death penalty than when the victim is a person of color.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-378\">\n   \u00b6212.

We noted the record was silent on the racial composition of the venire, making it impossible for us to determine if a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge was warranted, and if so, whether counsel's failure to make such challenge caused prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But we said even if the State had indeed struck all five African-American venire members, Wilcher still failed to show prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 820.

While I concur with the majority's analysis and conclusions on all other issues, I would grant Ronk's motion to proceed with his petition for post-conviction relief on the sole issue of whether his counsel was ineffective during the sentencing phase of trial. Therefore, I dissent in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-399\">\n   \u00b6228. The majority notes that, \"Arguably, counsel's mitigation investigation was deficient[,]\" but concludes that Ronk in not entitled to relief because he has not made a substantial showing that he was prejudiced by the deficiencies. Maj. Op. \u00b6\u00b6137, 143. However, the majority downplays the issues with the mitigation investigation and subsequent presentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-400\">\n   \u00b6229. According to the majority, Dr. Smallwood's testimony was sufficient as to mitigation because she uncovered \"some information ... relevant to mitigation.\" Maj. Op. \u00b6 138. Dr. Smallwood was not asked to conduct a mitigation study, and she testified specifically that she had not done a mitigation study. Dr. Smallwood's own report stated\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-401\">\n   It must be noted that many variables which may provide mitigation are reportedly found in this man's psychological and medical history. However, I do not have the benefit of those medical records. It is highly recommended that these and other relevant records be secured and that collateral witnesses be interviewed. The present examination is not a mitigation study, which is outside of the scope of my current practice .... However, as noted, a mitigation study is recommended.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-402\">\n   The majority also disagrees with Ronk's contention that\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   mitigation investigation occurred-\"They did some.\" Maj. Op. 139. The majority again relies on Dr. Smallwood's\n   evaluation as evidence of the mitigation investigation, but as discussed above, Dr. Smallwood did not consider her evaluation of Ronk to be a mitigation study. The majority acknowledges that \"Dr. Smallwood's report and the records that were obtained arguably would have led a reasonable attorney to investigate further.\n   <em>\n    Her report clearly signaled that more was needed\n   </em>\n   .\" Maj. Op. \u00b6 141 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-403\">\n   \u00b6230. However, in spite of Dr. Smallwood's repeated attempts to convey that her evaluation was not a mitigation study and that Ronk's history warranted a mitigation study, Ronk's counsel, and now the majority, consider her testimony and report to be good enough. I am not persuaded by the majority's \"good enough\" approach. Ronk has submitted affidavits from his adoptive mother, his biological mother, and a member of his trial attorney team, and all the affidavits indicate that Ronk's adoptive parents, friends, teachers, church members, family members, or medical professionals were not interviewed. While the majority would find that the medical evidence Ronk submitted is \"mostly cumulative,\" given the lack of meaningful investigation and the extent of Ronk's mental history that was not explored or presented to the jury, I cannot agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-404\">\n   \u00b6231. Mississippi Code Section 99-39-27(5) - (6) (Rev. 2015) provides that the Court is empowered to grant a petitioner leave to proceed on his motion for post-conviction relief in the trial court if there is a \"substantial showing of the denial of a state or federal right ....\" Recently, in\n   <em>\n    Keller v. State\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381621\" index=\"446\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/229/715/\">\n    229 So.3d 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2017), the Court granted Jason Lee Keller's motion for leave to proceed with his petition for post-conviction relief. Keller argued that his trial attorneys were ineffective for failing to investigate, collect, and present mitigation evidence. Keller provided affidavits from family, friends, acquaintances, former teachers and classmates, attorneys, and physicians to demonstrate the mitigation evidence that an effective counsel would have discovered and presented during Keller's sentencing. The Court acknowledged that \"Keller specifically points to the failure of trial counsel to obtain a mitigation expert, even though Dr. Beverly Smallwood, a psychologist, who evaluated Keller for the circuit court before trial, recommended doing so.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381621\" index=\"447\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/229/715/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381621\" index=\"447\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/229/715/\">\n    at 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-405\">\n   \u00b6232. For the above reasons discussed and due to the similarities between the instant case and\n   <em>\n    Keller\n   </em>\n   , Ronk has presented a substantial showing that a denial of a state or federal right may have occurred. I would grant his motion for leave to proceed with his petition for postconviction relief in the circuit court on the sole issue of ineffective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-406\">\n   KITCHENS, P.J., AND KING, J., JOIN THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
