The emergency medicine physician who treated the victim testified that the injuries required a direct blow of great force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The victim testified that Appellant had lived with her and her two young-adult children for a short time and had previously threatened to kill her if she ever tried to leave him. After Appellant moved out of\n   the victim's house at the request of the victim and her son, the victim obtained an injunction for protection against domestic violence against Appellant. Nine hours after he was served with that injunction, at a time when he was aware from having lived with the victim that she would be leaving her house alone to prepare to leave in her car, Appellant was waiting for her and attacked her. The victim saw him begin beating her with the weapon, although the severity of the beating prevented her from remembering the remainder of the attack. The victim's son heard her call out, and was an eyewitness to part of the attack. He saw Appellant with the weapon in his hand and confronted him. The victim's daughter saw Appellant walking away from the attack carrying an object matching the description of the weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The weapon was found a short distance away, between the victim's house and the place where law enforcement found Appellant. The weapon was found to have the victim's DNA on both ends and Appellant's DNA on one end. Although the weapon was the handle to a hydraulic jack, no such jack was found anywhere near the victim's house or surrounding area, supporting the conclusion that Appellant had brought it with him. The presence of the weapon, together with the evidence of Appellant's having been served with the domestic violence injunction just hours earlier, his timed arrival at the victim's house, and his lying in wait for her, also supported the conclusion that Appellant had planned the attack in advance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellant did not testify at his trial, but neither the fact of the attack nor Appellant's identity as the attacker was disputed. There was evidence that upon being informed of the charges including use of a crowbar as a weapon, Appellant spontaneously denied having used a weapon; but there was no evidence explaining how the victim's serious injuries including a deep gash down to her skull could have been inflicted with bare hands. Defense counsel argued to the jury that the attack was not premeditated, Appellant had no intent to kill the victim, and the evidence was insufficient to establish that Appellant had used the jack handle as his weapon for the attack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The jury was instructed on the following offenses in the following order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   - attempted first-degree premeditated murder with a weapon (the charged offense);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   - attempted first-degree premeditated murder;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   - attempted second-degree murder with a weapon (the offense of conviction);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   - attempted second-degree murder;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   - attempted voluntary manslaughter with a weapon (the erroneous instruction);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   - attempted voluntary manslaughter;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   - aggravated battery with a deadly weapon or great bodily harm;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   - felony battery with great bodily harm; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   - battery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Appellant argues that the trial court committed fundamental error by using a jury instruction on the lesser-included crime of attempted voluntary manslaughter by act that the Florida Supreme Court had invalidated several years earlier for incorrectly including an element of intent to kill.\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, the\n   <em>\n    Dean\n   </em>\n   court applied a harmless error analysis, agreeing with Justice Polston's observation that even the failure to give a requested instruction on a necessarily lesser-included offense is harmless \"because the defendant is not entitled to an opportunity for a jury pardon.\"\n   <em>\n    Dean\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12369880\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/230/420/#p425\">\n    230 So.3d at 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying the same reasoning, the giving of the instruction for attempted manslaughter by act deemed erroneous under\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   is harmless error. The evidence adduced below strongly supports that conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The jurors here were correctly instructed that \"If you return a verdict of guilty, it should be for the highest offense which has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Fla. Std. Jury Instr. (Crim.) 3.12. The jurors were correctly instructed that attempted second-degree murder involved intentional commitment \"of an act which would have resulted in the death of [victim].\" The instruction for attempted second-degree murder also correctly noted that \"it is not necessary for the State to prove the defendant had an intent to cause death.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Appellant's counsel did not challenge identity or the fact of the attack, but argued lack of intent to kill, lack of premeditation, and no use of a weapon. The jury received evidence that could support a finding of intent to kill in the victim's testimony that Appellant had previously threatened to kill her if she left him, and in the brutality of Appellant's attack. The jury received evidence of premeditation in the timing of the attack as a response to the domestic violence injunction, in Appellant's traveling to the victim's house in spite of the injunction and timing his arrival to coincide with a part of her known routine that left her alone and vulnerable, and in his bringing a jack handle with him for the attack. The jury received evidence that the jack handle bore the DNA of both Appellant and his victim, improbable beyond staggering odds unless Appellant had, in fact, beaten the victim with the jack handle. Appellant's counsel nevertheless succeeded in persuading the jury not to return a verdict for the crime charged, attempted first-degree premeditated murder. Appellant has already avoided a life sentence by the jury's finding of guilt as to attempted second-degree murder with a weapon, without intent to kill. The evidence very strongly supports the offense of conviction. We affirm Appellant's conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    II. WAIVER .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As noted above, even if the Florida Supreme Court had not abrogated the jury pardon doctrine, we would adhere to our original holding that the giving of the jury instruction held to be erroneous in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   is an error that can be waived, and that it was waived on the specific facts presented here. We emphasize that our waiver analysis is limited to the specific factors at play here. These factors include the legal anomaly that results when counsel's failure to object to a fundamentally erroneous jury instruction has the legal effect of benefiting the defendant; the fact\n   that this jury instruction had been declared erroneous and replaced with a valid instruction several years before this trial; and the fact that experienced counsel represented to the court that he had read and had no objections to the jury instructions, and was actively involved in reviewing and revising the jury instructions as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Error: Intent To Kill Is Not An Element Of Manslaughter\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The erroneous jury instruction used in this case had been invalidated several years before this trial occurred; and while we do not hold that the passage of time alone can create a waiver of objection to an erroneous instruction, we find that it is one among several factors that are appropriately considered. The Florida Supreme Court held in 2010-nearly four years before the trial in this case-that the standard jury instruction then in effect for voluntary manslaughter by act erroneously included an element of intent to kill, by instructing that the defendant must have committed an act or procured the commission of an act that was \"intended to cause the death\" of the victim.\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7039712\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/39/252/#p259\">\n    39 So.3d at 259-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (approving this Court's 2009 decision reaching the same conclusion,\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v.

Although Appellant trivializes his counsel's involvement in development of the final instructions, counsel's involvement went well beyond the superficial. This was not a situation of a word or phrase missing from an instruction that could be overlooked easily, nor was it a situation where both sides superficially agreed to the proposed instructions and never revisited them. Rather, the entire incorrect instruction was present from the beginning, and the record reflects that counsel was actively, repeatedly involved in reviewing and revising the instructions multiple times from before the trial through submission of the case to the jury. Counsel for both parties had discussed jury instructions before the charge conference and had agreed on some changes. Defense counsel asserted at the beginning of trial that\n   <em>\n    he had read and had no objections to\n   </em>\n   the jury instructions. As the discussion developed, he requested changes and additions, adding three lesser battery offenses to the instructions and verdict form, and thereby gave the jury plenty of opportunities to exercise its pardon power if it was inclined to do so. He consulted with his client, and made a stipulation to obtain instructions on more favorable lesser offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   During a recess after the state rested, the parties placed on the record additional changes to the jury instructions discussed between counsel with respect to the instruction for aggravated battery and the definition of a weapon for the weapon aggravation instruction, specifically including the voluntary manslaughter instruction. Defense counsel agreed to have the court read the instructions to the jury before closing arguments. No other discussion focused on the manslaughter instruction in general or specifically on the erroneous intent-to-kill language in that instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The court orally instructed the jury prior to closing arguments, without objection from either party. The court instructed the jury on the original charge of attempted first-degree premeditated murder with a weapon, and on\n   <em>\n    eight\n   </em>\n   lesser offenses: attempted first-degree premeditated murder, attempted second-degree murder with a weapon, attempted second-degree murder, attempted voluntary manslaughter with a weapon, attempted voluntary manslaughter, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon or great bodily harm, felony battery with great bodily harm, and battery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Closing arguments focused on the charged crime of attempted first-degree premeditated murder, with the state arguing among other things that intent to kill was obvious from the evidence including the nature and severity of the victim's injuries. Defense counsel argued several times that the evidence did not prove Appellant intended to kill the victim. After closing arguments, the trial court called to counsels' attention several discrepancies where the instructions did not list all lesser-included offenses, and the court proposed to instruct the jury to note those instances and refer to the verdict form for complete information. Defense counsel agreed with the proposal. The jury returned a verdict finding Appellant guilty of attempted second-degree murder with a weapon. Defense counsel polled the jury, which confirmed its verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The parties dispute whether these facts support a finding that defense counsel\n   waived the error in the manslaughter instruction. Neither\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   addressed the question of whether the fundamental error in giving the improper jury instructions was waived.

The instructions were given with no objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On our review of Moore's direct appeal, we concluded that the facts established a waiver of the fundamental error arising from including the element of intent in the manslaughter instruction.\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7003553\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/114/486/#p489\">\n    114 So.3d at 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Other facts may suffice to demonstrate a waiver, and we find the facts and circumstances of this case demonstrated a waiver.

Unjustified retrials of criminal cases impose pain and suffering on crime victims and their families, who must unnecessarily undergo the trauma of another jury trial, along with the decrease of public confidence in the administration of justice.

The wisdom of this decision is just as valid today. Thus, I concur in the decision to deny rehearing en banc in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Makar, J., dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Criminal defense lawyers take heed: you may have thought that a waiver of your client's known rights required that you voluntarily and intentionally relinquish them or engaged in conduct that implied such a waiver because, after all, that has been the well-worn, long-accepted legal standard. No longer. Now your mere participation in the jury instructions process is sufficient to imply, according to the panel majority, the waiver of any fundamentally erroneous instruction contained therein; that is so even if no one-neither you, the prosecutor, nor the trial judge-knew of or was made aware of the error, transforming what had been known as \"unknowing acquiescence\"-which precedent says is not a waiver-into a voluntary and\n   intentional abandonment of your client's rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   As Judge Wolf's dissent explains, the panel's decision formulates an entirely new approach to implied waiver that cannot be reconciled with our precedent, making this case\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   en banc-worthy, notwithstanding the original en banc motion garnering one-third of the Court's support and a renewed motion on the panel's revised opinion slightly less.

As the primary dissent does, this dissental addresses why the newly-crafted standard for implied waiver is inconsistent with precedent, thereby making en banc review necessary on this issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   To begin, everyone agrees that precedent requires that waiver be demonstrated by facts establishing \"the voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right, or conduct which implies the voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right.\"\n   <em>\n    Major League Baseball v.

On the other hand, waiver was found as to one proposed jury instruction in\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   where the \"trial court specifically brought to counsel's attention the problem of the intent language in the proposed jury instruction and offered to strike that language\" but counsel insisted on inclusion of the specific erroneous instruction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7003553\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/114/486/#p489\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This case is controlled by\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   and related precedents because defense counsel's active participation in the jury instruction process did not extend to approval of the specific erroneous instruction at issue (he failed to object); and he did not approve or insist upon use of the specific erroneous instruction, which was not brought to his attention. This is nothing more than \"unknowing acquiescence\" by defense counsel and all other participants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The \"facts of this case\" demonstrated a waiver, the majority claims, yet it takes speculation and insupportable attribution of ill motive to defense counsel to reach this conclusion on the sparse record presented.\n   <em>\n    Knight II\n   </em>\n   , op. at 49-50. It skeptically finds it \"difficult to believe\" that defense counsel \"was unaware\" of changes to the jury instructions, implying that defense\n   counsel was in fact aware of the changes such that his failure to object to the defective instruction was intended to inject error.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47-48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   But defense counsel's actual knowledge of the law is not addressed anywhere in the record, which reflects only that he-as well as the trial judge and prosecutor-made the same mistake in overlooking the erroneous jury instruction. Why impute intentional inaction and ill motive to defense counsel when neither the prosecutor nor the trial judge caught the error? We should not censoriously impute that a lawyer engaged in an intentional \"tactical manipulation\" without supporting evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47. Indeed, by symmetric thinking, presumably both the trial judge and the prosecutor-who also have an obligation to stay abreast of changes in the law-were aware of the erroneous jury instruction and intentionally overlooked it, rather than being merely remiss or inattentive; each shares some degree of responsibility for ensuring the correctness of jury instructions used in criminal cases of this type where a retrial would necessarily impose avoidable costs on the judicial system, great inconvenience for witnesses, and further trauma to victims. The crime here was atrocious, making it all the more important for the trial judge, defense counsel, and prosecutor to apply the correct law and avoid a retrial and its collateral costs and impacts on those involved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The majority opinion originally said that on the few facts presented, \"counsel's agreement to the erroneous instruction was\n   <em>\n    intentional\n   </em>\n   , and therefore that he waived Defendant's right to now object to the instruction in order to obtain a new trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Knight I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204036091\">\n    2017 WL 4036091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (emphasis added). Notably, the majority opinion now\n   <em>\n    eliminates\n   </em>\n   all reference to its prior conclusion that the purported waiver was \"intentional.\"\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Knight I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204036091\">\n    2017 WL 4036091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Knight II\n   </em>\n   , op. at 40. The only mention of the word \"intentional\" in the new opinion is its statement of the standard for establishing waiver.\n   <em>\n    Knight II\n   </em>\n   ' op. at 46. It is not mentioned thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Rather than say that an \"intentional\" waiver occurred, the majority takes a different approach, concluding that waiver exists because \"experienced\" defense counsel\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have had a \"\n   <em>\n    plausible strategic reason\n   </em>\n   \" for overlooking the erroneous jury instruction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204036091\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ---- (\"Very significant to our analysis is the existence of a\n   <em>\n    plausible strategic reason\n   </em>\n   for allowing the instruction to go to the jury.\") (emphasis added). But there are \"plausible strategic reasons\" for most everything; that a \"plausible strategic reason\" for inaction\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   exist doesn't mean a lawyer acted accordingly, unless one assumes so or has proof. It is just as plausible, if not most likely on this record, that defense counsel unknowingly acquiesced in the erroneous instruction, especially given that neither the trial judge nor the prosecutor knew of or pointed out the error: everyone made the same mistake. \"Plausible strategic reasons\" may underlie inadvertent prosecutorial errors, but courts don't rotely impute bad motives in those situations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The \"plausible strategic reason\" standard also uproots the existing implied waiver standard in this way. No case says that a mere\n   <em>\n    likelihood\n   </em>\n   that defense counsel\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have acted intentionally for strategic reasons is sufficient to establish an intentional waiver by implication; a\n   <em>\n    likelihood\n   </em>\n   of this sort theoretically exists in every case, making this an empty standard when the \"voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right\" must be proven.\n   <em>\n    May have\n   </em>\n   is no substitute for\n   <em>\n    must have\n   </em>\n   when it comes to waiver of legal rights. To conclude that defense counsel must have known the jury instruction\n   was erroneous, and cunningly ignored it as a stratagem (thereby ascribing knowledge, bad motive, and intentional conduct), is pure speculation on this record. Having deemed defense counsel a crafty mastermind seeking to inject reversible error, the majority declares that \"[r]eviewing courts should not countenance counsel's\n   <em>\n    tactical inaction\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47 (emphasis added). Of course we shouldn't, but nothing in the record supports a conclusion of intentional \"tactical inaction\" or sandbagging by defense counsel. Other than supposition, nothing suggests that defense counsel failed to challenge the erroneous instruction as a deliberate tactic or ploy for strategic advantage. At most, the record establishes \"unknowing acquiescence,\" which precedent holds is not an intentional waiver. The majority originally dubbed it \"silent acquiescence,\"\n   <em>\n    Knight I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204036091\">\n    2017 WL 4036091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5, (the phrase is now gone) but every fundamental error of this type necessarily arises from a failure to object, which is typified by silence. Unknowing acquiescence is the legal standard that governs this case, where no intentionality is shown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Two final points. First, it is incorrect to say that defense counsel agreed to the specific erroneous instruction; he did not. As in\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   , he agreed to the instructions\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   and did not accede knowingly to the\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   erroneous instruction at issue; the former \"cannot waive fundamental error.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7003553\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/114/486/#p489\">\n    114 So.3d at 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Had the specific instruction and its error been brought to defense counsel's attention, and yet he still insisted on its inclusion, a waiver may exist under\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7003553\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/114/486/#p489\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (stating that the \"trial court specifically brought to counsel's attention the problem of the intent language in the proposed jury instruction and offered to strike that language\"). The majority sidesteps\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   , concluding that counsel's agreement to the set of jury instructions\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   , not to the specific erroneous instruction, is sufficient to constitute a waiver.\n   <em>\n    Knight II\n   </em>\n   , op. at 48-49. It characterizes this general agreement as \"Counsel's Approval and Involvement\" in the jury instructions used, and deems it sufficient for imputing intentional waiver. But merely approving instructions generally or having involvement in them generally, without the type of specific waiver as in\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   , is insufficient under our precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Second, the new implied waiver standard, which is based on \"experienced\" counsel's failure to object to an erroneous instruction for a \"plausible strategic reason,\" raises a range of factual considerations relevant to the implied waiver inquiry that should be considered (but aren't in this case), such as: How long must defense counsel have practiced criminal law to be considered \"experienced\"? How many times has he handled this type of case? Has he made the same mistake before? Is this the first time he has represented a client on such a matter? How old must the legal development be to justify imputing knowledge and intentional conduct? Was this the first or hundredth trial for the judge and prosecutor? What was their knowledge of the law? Had the trial judge given, or the prosecutor not objected to, the erroneous instruction before? What version of the judges' bench books and lawyers' form libraries may have been consulted, and were they updated in recent years? And so on. Let's not forget that the waiver issue was first raised on appeal in this Court, such that no notice and hearing has been accorded to flesh out the facts and adjudge credibility. All we have is an inanimate trial transcript, which neither addresses nor sheds light on these or related factual matters, making an appellate crystal ball a necessity to glean voluntariness and intentionality in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Waiver is designed to be difficult to establish, else valuable rights-civil or criminal-are lost unintentionally and involuntarily. But the majority's new approach to implied waiver creates a tautological forfeiture of such rights: a fundamentally erroneous jury instruction is impliedly waived because it is\n   <em>\n    assumed\n   </em>\n   that defense counsel\n   <em>\n    knew of the erroneous instruction\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    acted tactically and intentionally\n   </em>\n   in allowing it. This approach turns our precedent on its head, changing what has long been fundamental error into no error at all. We have previously said that \"[m]erely failing to object cannot waive fundamental error,\"\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7003553\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/114/486/#p489\">\n    114 So.3d at 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , yet the panel majority says the opposite: defense counsel had the \"responsibility\" to object to the erroneous jury instruction and his failure to do so amounts to an implied waiver because he may have acted tactically. This is another way of saying goodbye to the fundamental error doctrine; how else can fundamental error exist but for the lack of an objection?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In short, this is not a case where defense counsel asked for or invited an erroneous instruction; neither he-nor the prosecutor or judge-were aware of it. And nothing in the record supports imputation of a voluntary and intentional waiver of a known right, let alone bad motive or tactical premeditation. Imputing waiver without a non-speculative factual basis in the record for doing so violates precedent and takes away a defendant's right based solely on appellate surmise. Because the majority's new implied waiver formula (general participation/involvement in jury instructions process + imputed knowledge of law/imputed bad motive = waiver) is at odds with our precedents, en banc review is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Short of en banc review, this type of dramatic shift in judicial precedent ought to be done, if deemed appropriate, by our supreme court. It is for that court, not a district court, to decide in the first instance whether to chart a new course on a topic as well-established as waiver of a client's rights in a criminal case. Long ago, in\n   <em>\n    Hoffman v. Jones\n   </em>\n   , a district court \"exceeded its authority\" by holding that comparative negligence displaced contributory negligence, a change in the law that only the supreme court was allowed to make (under its view of separation of powers at the time).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   District courts must follow existing law, but are empowered to suggest reforms: if they have doubt or believe existing law should change, they \"are free to certify questions of great public interest to [the supreme court] for consideration, and even to state their reasons for advocating change.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 434. The panel majority does the opposite of what\n   <em>\n    Hoffman\n   </em>\n   requires: it has leapfrogged precedent, altered the law of waiver, and now asks our supreme court to bless its handiwork. Our appellate judicial system operates structurally on getting permission, not asking for forgiveness; that our supreme court didn't answer the question certified in\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   doesn't empower us to alter the contours of waiver law unilaterally with the hope that a future supreme court will change course and see it our way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   All this said, a certified question-now added to the panel's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Knight II\n   </em>\n   -is appropriate to allow the supreme court to consider the issues raised, understanding\n   that it may choose to reframe them. This case factually is a poor vehicle for a finding of implied waiver, but the supreme court may be able to provide guidance on whether implied waiver can be adjudged for the first time on appeal without an evidentiary record or a fact-finding hearing bearing on the matter; it may also weigh in on what facts must be established in support of an implied waiver, such as the actual knowledge and trial experience of the defense counsel, whether defense counsel has made this same oversight in other cases, the length of time a jury instruction has been invalidated, and so forth. Waiver by implication is not favored, but future cases may exist with adjudicated facts establishing that defense counsel acted voluntarily and intentionally to create error by knowingly and strategically withholding an objection to a fundamentally erroneous jury instruction simply to get a new trial. On the record presented, this is not such a case.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    <em>\n     Knight II\n    </em>\n    passes upon the previously-raised waiver issue as well as a new issue raised by the panel as to the jury pardon doctrine, affirming Knight's conviction and sentence on those \"two alternative grounds.\"\n    <em>\n     Knight II\n    </em>\n    , op. at 40. This dissental addresses only one of these grounds: the waiver issue, which was the subject of motions for rehearing en banc in 2016 and 2018. The alternative ground for affirmance, under the jury pardon doctrine, is newly issued and has not been subject to rehearing or rehearing en banc. Either of the alternative grounds are properly subject to en banc review because \"[w]hen the record presents several questions, and the court considers and deliberately decides each one, the case is precedential for them all. Both of two or more explicitly alternative holdings count as holdings-not as dicta.\" Bryan Garner et. al., The Law of Judicial Precedent 115 (2016) (Chapter 10. \"Multiple questions decided\").
