R.S. 47:301(14)(b)(i)(aa). For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   AMC Theaters is a business headquartered in Leawood, Kansas, operating movie theaters nationwide, with three locations in Jefferson Parish.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pertinent to this case, on April 1, 2011, AMC introduced a loyalty rewards program to its patrons called the \"Stubs Rewards Program,\" which allows those patrons who purchase a Stubs Rewards membership for $ 12 per year to accrue \"virtual rewards\" on the purchases of goods and services at the theaters. For every $ 100 Stubs Rewards members spend on goods and services at AMC, they accrue a virtual reward of $ 10 that they can use toward the future purchase of goods and services at the theaters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stubs Rewards members also get free upgrades on fountain drinks and popcorn and waiver of certain online ticketing fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 29, 2015, the Sheriff commenced an audit of AMC's three Jefferson Parish locations for sales/use taxes, for the audit period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its November 2, 2015 audit reports, the Sheriff determined that AMC owed sales taxes on both the sale and the renewal of the membership fees in its Stubs Rewards Program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 23, 2015, the Sheriff issued a \"Notice of Delinquent Taxes - Formal Assessment\" to AMC for each of its Jefferson Parish theater locations, noting the\n   amount of taxes due and notifying AMC that it had thirty calendar days from the date of the notice to appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals for redetermination of the assessments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, AMC filed a \"Petition for Redetermination of Formal Assessment\" with the Board of Tax Appeals, arguing that the sale of memberships in the Stubs Rewards Program does not constitute the purchase of a taxable service. Following motion practice and discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. After a hearing on the cross-motions for summary judgment, the Board of Tax Appeals judge rendered a written judgment on March 12, 2018 granting AMC's motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his judgment, considering the cross-motions for summary judgment, the Board of Tax Appeals judge found that there was no genuine issue of material fact that the annual fees for membership in AMC's Stubs Rewards Program are not subject to Jefferson Parish sales taxes because those fees are not for the sales of tangible personal property or for sales of any taxable services. Further, there was no genuine issue of material fact that those fees are not for admissions to places of amusement, and are not for \"the furnishing, for dues, fees, or other consideration, of the privilege of access to clubs or the privilege of having access to or the use of amusement, entertainment, athletic, or recreational facilities\" for purposes of La. R.S. 47:301(14)(b)(i)(aa). Additionally, the Board of Tax Appeals judge found that the assessments that were issued on December 23, 2015 were made in error and no additional sales and/or use taxes, penalty, or interest was owed by AMC. This timely appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After an opportunity for adequate discovery, a motion for summary judgment shall be granted if the motion, memorandum, and supporting documents show that there is no genuine issue as to material fact and that the mover is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

The burden is on the adverse party to produce factual support sufficient to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact or that the mover is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

R.S. 47:301(14)(b)(i)(aa). The Sheriff contends that the sales of the memberships and the annual renewals thereof are taxable services because the memberships provide the privilege of access to clubs and the privilege of access to or the use of an amusement and entertainment facility. According to the Sheriff, the Stubs Rewards Program is a \"club\" because participants must be members to receive benefits and are organized for the common purpose of enjoying access to the benefits of membership not available to the general public. The Sheriff also argues that although not exclusive, the Stubs Rewards Program membership provides members with financial and physical benefits of access to and use of the theater facilities not available to non-members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Taxing statutes must be strictly construed against the taxing authority.\n   <em>\n    Goudchaux/Maison Blanche, Inc. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit considered whether memberships to Sam's Clubs were taxable services within the scope and purpose of La. R.S. 47:301(14)(b)(i)(aa). The court found the definition of \"club\" to\n   be \"a group of people organized for a common purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1158, citing\n   <em>\n    The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\n   </em>\n   , Fourth Edition. The Sheriff maintains that the Stubs Rewards Program organizes itself as a \"club\" since participants must be members to receive benefits, and the program is organized for a common purpose-to enjoy access to the benefits of membership not available to the general public. The Sheriff contends that the statute does not require that the \"club\" be linked to a physical facility to make the sales of memberships a taxable service, again relying on\n   <em>\n    Wal-mart Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , where the court found that the clause pertaining to the privilege of \"access to clubs\" was independent of the clause concerning the privilege of having access to or the use of certain types of facilities.\n   <em>\n    Wal-mart Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9355944\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/836/1155/\">\n    836 So.2d at 1159-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In response, AMC argues that to determine the definition of the word \"club\" as used in the statute, it is necessary to look at the context in which it is used. Although AMC points out that the statute provides that membership fees for the privilege of \"access to clubs\" would be taxable, it contends that use of the phrase \"access to clubs\" shows that the statute contemplates that a physical location must be physically entered by an individual for the membership fees to be taxable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Upon\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, we first find the present case distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Wal-mart Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Wal-mart Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , after considering the definition of \"club\" to be \"a group of people organized for a common purpose,\" the court noted that members of Sam's Clubs are recruited and organized into the business structure; their participation is vital to the business; a common purpose of the members is to have access to \"a no frills place of business for making purchases of products sold for cheaper prices in bulk\"; and through the membership fees, the members pay to have access to a special shopping facility that is not open to the general public. The court stated that although the members might not be acquainted with one another, or have designated times for meetings at the facility, this did not preclude their collective memberships from constituting a \"club.\"\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9355944\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/836/1155/\">\n    836 So.2d at 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, unlike a membership to Sam's Clubs, the Stubs Reward Program is not vital to AMC's business. Also, unlike Sam's Clubs where everyone is required to be a member to have access to and enjoy the benefits that Sam's Clubs provide to its members, members of the general public are not required to be members of AMC's Stubs Reward Program to gain access to or use of the movie theaters. AMC's movie theaters are open to the general public and access to the movie theaters is allowed when a movie ticket is purchased, rather than when a Stubs Rewards membership is purchased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Further, the court in\n   <em>\n    Wal-mart Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   relied solely on the definition of \"club.\" However, in order to determine the context in which the word \"club\" is used in the statute, it is necessary that we also consider the definition of \"access.\" \"Access\" is defined as a \"way of approach or entry\" and a \"right or opportunity to reach or use or visit; admittance.\"\n   <em>\n    The Oxford American Desk Dictionary and Thesaurus\n   </em>\n   , Second Edition, 2001. Considering these definitions, we find that the phrase \"access to clubs\" as used in this particular statute is not clear and unambiguous. Rather, there are multiple meanings that \"access to clubs\" could be interpreted to be, including as a \"way of approach or entry\" or \"admittance\" to a physical location (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the subject AMC theaters). Here, as noted above, it is undisputed that members of the general public are not required to purchase a Stubs Rewards Program membership to \"approach\" or gain \"entry\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   or \"admittance\" to the subject theaters. Again, taxing statutes must be strictly construed against the taxing authority; where a tax statute is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation, the construction favorable to the taxpayer is to be adopted.\n   <em>\n    Goudchaux/Maison Blanche, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Considering that there is ambiguity surrounding the meaning of \"access to clubs\" in the subject statute, we must adopt construction of the statute favorable to the taxpayer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Sheriff also argues that although Stubs Rewards members do not enjoy exclusive access to or use of AMC's theaters, they are provided with financial and physical benefits of access to and use of the theater facilities that aren't available to non-members. Although we recognize that Stubs Rewards members are potentially benefited by their membership in the Stubs Rewards Program with concessions upgrades, virtual rewards, or waiver of online fees (if and when they actually purchase a ticket or a concession item), we do not find that the member's ability to receive those benefits means that payment of the Stubs Rewards Program membership fee is paying for the \"access to or use\" of the subject theaters. Rather, we find that the language of the statute does not clearly and unambiguously express the intent to apply the statute to the AMC Stubs Rewards membership fees present in this case.\n   <em>\n    Cleco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we find that the Board of Tax Appeals judge did not err in granting AMC's motion for summary judgment, and, as such, did not err in finding that the annual membership fees for AMC's Stubs Rewards Program are not a taxable \"sale of service\" for purposes of La. R.S. 47:301(14)(b)(i)(aa). This assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER TWO\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In his second assignment of error, the Sheriff argues that if AMC's Petition for Redetermination was filed on January 27, 2016, as shown on the filing stamp mark on the first page of the petition, then it was filed late because the filing occurred more than thirty calendar days from the date of notice of the formal assessment. Consequently, the Sheriff argues, the Board of Tax Appeals judge had no jurisdiction to redetermine the assessments, his decision thereon must be vacated, and the petition must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   La. R.S. 47:1431(C) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   If a taxpayer disputes an assessment made by a local collector, or a local collector's action or failure to act on a claim for a refund or credit of an overpayment, the taxpayer may appeal to the board for a redetermination of the assessment or a determination of the alleged overpayment, by filing a petition with the board as provided in R.S. 47:337.51, 337.53, or 337.81.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   La. R.S. 47:337.51(A)(1)(b) provides that a tax collector shall send a notice of the assessment to the taxpayer and shall inform the taxpayer that he has \"thirty calendar days from the date of notice\" to appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals for redetermination of the assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In the present case, the Sheriff issued a \"Notice of Delinquent Taxes - Formal Assessment\" to each of AMC's Jefferson Parish theaters on December 23, 2015. A supplement to the record reveals that AMC \"fax filed\" its Petition for Redetermination on January 22, 2016,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , within thirty calendar days from the date of the notice of assessment, in accordance with the Board of Tax Appeals'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   rules.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we find that AMC's Petition for Redetermination was timely filed. This assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, because no genuine issue of material fact remains and AMC is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the judgment of the Board of Tax Appeals judge which granted AMC's motion for summary judgment, finding that the annual membership fees for AMC's Stubs Rewards Program are not subject to Jefferson Parish sales taxes because those fees are not a taxable \"sale of service\" for purposes of La. R.S. 47:301(14)(b)(i)(aa), is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     AFFIRMED\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    At the hearing of this matter before the Board of Tax Appeals judge, the parties noted that Mr. Normand was no longer Sheriff, having been succeeded by Sheriff Joseph Lopinto.
