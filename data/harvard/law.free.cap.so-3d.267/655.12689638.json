Brown )\n </judges>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Judge Rosemary Ledet\n   This is a suit on a promissory note. From the trial court's judgment granting the motion for summary judgment filed by the plaintiff, SBN V FNBC LLC (\"SBN\"), the defendant, Vista Louisiana, LLC (\"Vista\"), appeals. Vista also seeks review of the trial court's interlocutory judgment denying its motions for new trial and to compel discovery. The issues before us on this appeal are two-fold: (i) whether the trial court prematurely granted summary judgment without allowing Vista adequate discovery; and (ii) whether the trial court erred in finding that SBN was entitled to summary judgment on its claims against Vista. Because SBN's motion for summary judgment revolves around two legal determinations-construction of a contract (the Business Loan Agreement) (the \"Contract\") and interpretation of a statute (the Louisiana Loansharking Statute, La. R.S. 14:511 ) (the \"Statute\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   -we find the trial court did not prematurely rule on SBN's summary judgment motion. On the merits, we find no legal error in the trial court's rejection of Vista's defenses. For these reasons, we affirm the trial court's judgment granting SBN's summary judgment motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On July 15, 2015, Vista executed a promissory note payable to the order of First NBC Bank (\"FNBC\") (the \"Note\"). The original principal amount of the Note was $ 1,000,000.00. The Note was payable \"in full immediately upon Lender's demand\" or, if no demand was made, \"no later than February 28, 2016.\" The Note had a variable interest rate. Contemporaneously with the execution of the Note, Vista executed the Contract with FNBC. Pursuant to the Contract, Vista provided a Letter of Credit (the \"LOC\"), which was in the same amount as the Note, as security for the Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In April 2017, FNBC closed; and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the \"FDIC\") was named as FNBC's receiver. At that time, the Note was in default. In October 2017, the FDIC entered\n   into a loan sale agreement with SBN. Pursuant to that agreement, SBN purchased from the FDIC a pool of loans, which included the Note. On the allonge attached to the Note, the FDIC endorsed the Note to the order of SBN.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In January 2018, SBN commenced this suit on the Note against Vista. In its petition, SBN averred that it was the holder of the Note and that it had the rights of a holder in due course. In its petition, SBN prayed for a judgment against Vista for the following five items: (i) the unpaid principal balance of the Note-$ 1,000,000.00; (ii) the accrued unpaid interest due on the Note through January 5, 2018-$ 75,104.16; (iii) additional default interest of 21% from January 6, 2018, until paid;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (iv) late charges-$ 2,000.00; and (v) attorneys' fees of 25% of the total sum due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In March 2018, Vista answered the suit asserting the following two defenses: (i) off-set based on FNBC's failure to timely draw down on the LOC (the \"LOC Defense\"); and (ii) absolute nullity based on the Statute (the \"Loansharking Defense\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Shortly after Vista's answer was filed, SBN filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that it was a holder in due course. In support, SBN provided an affidavit of Kelli Wood, SBN's custodian of records. In her affidavit, Ms. Wood identified the Note and the facts surrounding SBN's acquisition of the Note. Attached to her affidavit and identified in it were copies of the Note and the Contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Opposing the motion, Vista acknowledged the validity of the Note and the Contract; however, it disputed SBN's status as a holder in due course. On the merits, Vista asserted the same two defenses it asserted in its answer-the LOC Defense and the Loansharking Defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In support, Vista attached to its opposition affidavits from the following three people: (i) Lawrence Starkman, Vista's manager; (ii) John Seago, Vista's attorney; and (iii) Rene Meaux, a certified public accountant retained by Vista. Mr. Starkman attested that Vista had \"filed Interrogatories, Requests for Production of Documents and Admissions of Fact which requested SBN to provide the exact amount SBN paid for the Vista loan\" (the \"Discovery Requests\"). Mr. Seago attested that he prepared the Discovery Requests. Attached to and identified in Mr. Seago's affidavit was a copy of the Discovery Requests. Mr. Meaux attested that he performed calculations based on the average price paid in each pool for each loan and that he concluded the rate of return sought by SBN exceeded 45% per annum.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Attached to Mr. Meaux's affidavit were copies of his report and a summary of his calculations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 11, 2018, the summary judgment hearing was held. At the hearing, SBN conceded, contrary to the allegation in its petition, that it was not a holder in due course; and Vista requested a continuance to conduct discovery. Vista stressed that, on April 17, 2018, it filed the Discovery\n   Requests; that SBN had not yet answered them; and that SBN's responses were not due until May 17, 2018, six days after the hearing. At the hearing, the trial court orally granted SBN's motion for summary judgment and, by implication, denied Vista's request for a continuance. Although the trial court granted SBN's summary judgment motion at the hearing, two weeks later (on May 25, 2018), Vista filed a motion to compel, seeking a response to the Discovery Requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 1, 2018,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the trial court rendered a written judgment granting SBN's summary judgment; the judgment was in favor of SBN and against Vista for the amounts prayed for in the petition with the one exception.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Five days later (on June 6, 2018), Vista filed a motion for new trial, asserting the same two defenses that it raised in its answer and its opposition to the motion for summary judgment. The trial court denied both the motion to compel and motion for new trial. Vista appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"Summary judgments are reviewed\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   on appeal, with the reviewing court using the same criteria that govern the trial court's determination of whether summary judgment is appropriate; whether there is any genuine issue of material fact, and whether the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Here, Vista asserts two defenses in opposing SBN's motion for summary judgment-the LOC Defense and the Loansharking Defense. As noted at the outset, both defenses present purely legal issues, which can be resolved by applying rules of contractual interpretation and statutory construction. Therefore, this is a case in which additional discovery would be fruitless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Reaching this result, the trial court, in its reasons for judgment, observed that \"[n]o amount of additional discovery on Vista's asserted defenses would create a genuine issue as to which reasonable persons could disagree.\" We agree. Vista's reliance on the multi-factor test is misplaced. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the request to continue and the motion to compel discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    The LOC Defense\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Vista's first defense on the merits is that it is entitled to a set-off, based on FNBC's failure to exercise its rights under the LOC before it expired, which LOC would have paid the Note in full. FNBC's failure to exercise its rights under the LOC, Vista contended, was both a breach of the Contract and negligence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   SBN counters that the parties agreed in the Contract that FNBC had no duty to draw down the LOC. Given that FNBC had no duty to do so, SBN contends that there could be no breach of duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Rejecting the LOC Defense, the trial court, in its written reasons for judgment, reasoned that \"[a]s the [Contract], signed by Vista, did not require FNBC to seek set-off from the [LOC], Vista cannot now raise the failure to do so as a defense.\" We reach the same result for the following two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   First, the unambiguous language of the Contract supports the trial court's finding that FNBC was not required to seek a set-off from the LOC. The Contract provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Lender shall have the additional right, again at its sole option, to file an appropriate collection action against Borrower and/or against any guarantor or guarantors of Borrower's Loan and Note, and/or to proceed or exercise any rights against any Collateral\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   then securing repayment of Borrower's Loan and Note. Borrower and each guarantor further agree that Lender's remedies shall be cumulative in nature and nothing under this Agreement or otherwise, shall be construed as to limit or restrict the options and remedies available to Lender following any event of default under this Agreement or otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Except as may be prohibited by applicable law, all of Lender's rights and remedies shall be cumulative and may be exercised singularly or concurrently. Election by Lender to pursue any remedy shall not exclude pursuit of any other remedy, and an election to make expenditures or to take action to perform an obligation of Borrower or of any Grantor shall not affect Lender's right to declare a default and to exercise its rights and remedies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Under the unambiguous terms of the Contract, the lender, FNBC, had the option to proceed against the collateral, the LOC, but was not required to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Second, a contract to provide security for an outstanding obligation is an accessory contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, the LOC is the accessory obligation; the principal obligation is the Note. As SBN points out, \"[w]hile a surety, under some conditions may, by requesting discussion of the property of the principal, require a creditor to pursue the principal before pursuing the surety, La.

For these reasons, we find, agreeing with the trial court, that Vista's LOC Defense is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    The Loansharking Defense\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Vista's second defense is that the rate of return or \"compensation\" that SBN realized on the Note violated the maximum compensation allowed under the Statute-45% per annum-and thus amounts to criminal usury-loansharking. Vista contends, as the trial court noted, that \"because SBN was able to acquire the [N]ote for pennies on the dollar, it received an 'unconscionable' amount of 'compensation' considering the standard interest combined with the bonus resulting from its acquisition of the [N]ote at a discount.\" Vista contends that when SBN purchased the Note, it became the new lender for this loan. According to Vista, \"[t]he difference between what [SBN] paid for Vista's loan and what it is requiring Vista to pay back is 'other compensation' referred to in the Statute.\" Vista contends that given SBN's actions violate the Statute, SBN's attempt to obtain a money judgment on the Note was void as against public policy and that the Note was an absolute nullity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   SBN's counters that the Note is exempt from the Statute. According to the Note itself, \"[t]o the extent not preempted by federal law, this business or commercial loan is being made under the terms and provisions of La. R.S. 9:3509,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   \" It notes that this loan was made pursuant to the statutory authority granted in both Title 6 and Title 9 of the Revised Statutes. SBN further notes that the Statute was enacted in 1995, yet no court has seen fit to strike down a commercial loan contract on the grounds that the interest rate was unconscionable under the Statute. SBN also argues when a third party purchases a note, and then enforces it according to its terms, the maker of the note is not being forced to do anything more than he contracted to do-pay the principal amount of the note, representing the money he was loaned, plus interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Agreeing with SBN, the trial court, in its written reasons for judgment, observed that Vista's interpretation of the Statute \"would effectively outlaw the common practice of purchasing notes at a discount\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that \"purchasing a note at a discount, no matter how large the windfall that might accrue on successful collection, is not loansharking as contemplated by La. R.S. 14:511.\" The trial court also noted that \"Vista does not appear to cite nor could this Court find any case that supports such an interpretation.\" The trial court thus determined that the Statute was not violated by Vista purchasing the Note from the FDIC at a discount and enforcing the Note according to its terms. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In construing the Statute, we first note the well-settled principle that \"criminal statutes are to be strictly construed.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Vogel\n   </em>\n   , 18-0174, p. 12 (La.

We further note that the term loansharking is defined as \"[t]he practice of lending money at excessive and esp. usurious rates, and often using threats or extortion to enforce repayment.\" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Because there are no cases construing or citing the Statute and because loansharking is criminal usury, we look for guidance to jurisprudence construing the Louisiana civil usury law. The jurisprudence has observed that the usury laws of this state have historically exempted commercial discounting.\n   <em>\n    Lafayette Royale Apartments\n   </em>\n   , 397 F.2d at 381 (observing that \"[c]ommercial discounting ... is permissible under Louisiana law\"). Given the usury law jurisprudence and strictly construing the Statute, we conclude that the commercial practice of buying a note at a discount, here from the FDIC, is not the type of act the Louisiana Legislature was seeking to prevent in enacting the Statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   When a note is purchased at a discount, and then enforced according to its terms, the maker of the note is being called upon to do nothing other than what the maker contracted to do. For this reason, the general rule is that \"the sale or purchase of negotiable or assignable commercial paper or another chose in action or evidence of indebtedness transferable in trade and business transactions, for valuable or legal consideration after its first negotiation, is not usurious even though the price or other consideration determined upon is less than the nominal or face value of the instrument purchased.\" 44B Am.Jur.2d\n   <em>\n    Interest and Usury\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 95 (citing\n   <em>\n    First All.

The court further observed that when the lender purchased the Primary Loan, its principal value was $ 1.48 million and that the borrowers enjoyed full use of that $ 1.48 million. The court thus found the borrowers' usury argument unpersuasive, reasoning that \"it is not usurious for a borrower to pay interest on the full amount that it borrowed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"860816\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/222/524/#p524\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

It implicitly contends that it is not being allowed to share in the built-in profit that SBN will receive on the Note, which it purchased at a discount. The built-in profit-the difference between the amount a purchaser pays for a note and the face amount of the note-is what Vista seeks to label \"other compensation\" under the Statute. There is a difference, however, between additional charges that are added to the principal amount of a note-discounted interest and other charges-and the amount a purchaser pays for a note, with the option of enforcing the note according to its terms-the well-established practice of commercial discounting. This is a commercial discounting case. SBN purchased the Note from the FDIC at a discount and is seeking to enforce the Note according to its terms. Repeating the trial court's remark, \"purchasing a note at a discount, no matter how large the windfall that might accrue on successful collection, is not loansharking.\" For this reason, the amount that SBN paid the FDIC for the Note simply is not relevant to the criminal usury analysis.
