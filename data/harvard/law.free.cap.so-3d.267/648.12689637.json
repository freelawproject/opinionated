Chase\n   Nathaniel Lambert (hereinafter \"Mr. Lambert\") appeals the trial court's denial of his motion to quash, motion for discharge, and motion to reconsider sentencing pertaining to the resentencing of his convictions for aggravated rape and aggravated crime against nature. He asserts two counseled assignments of error. First, Mr. Lambert maintains the seventeen-year delay in resentencing is unreasonable, warranting a discharge of his convictions for aggravated rape and aggravated crime against nature. Second, he contends the sentences imposed are excessive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Additionally before us is Mr. Lambert's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   writ, seeking review of the trial court's denial of his motion to correct an illegal sentence - life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence - for his conviction of aggravated burglary enhanced by virtue of being adjudged a quadruple offender. We have consolidated this writ with this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons that follow, we affirm Mr. Lambert's sentences and deny his writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    RELEVANT FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 1997, Mr. Lambert was charged by grand jury indictment of aggravated rape ( La. R.S. 14:42 ), aggravated burglary ( La. R.S. 14:60 ), and aggravated crime against nature ( La. R.S. 14:89.1 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A twelve-person jury found him guilty on all counts. Mr. Lambert was sentenced to life imprisonment without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence for the charge of aggravated rape; thirty years for the charge of aggravated burglary; and fifteen years for the charge of aggravated crime against nature. The State then filed a multiple bill on the aggravated burglary conviction. After a habitual offender hearing, the trial court vacated the thirty-year sentence and resentenced Mr. Lambert as a recidivist offender to life imprisonment. He appealed. This Court affirmed all of Mr. Lambert's convictions, but vacated the sentences on his convictions of aggravated rape and aggravated crime against nature, and remanded for resentencing because the trial court sentenced him prior to hearing his motion for new trial.\n   <em>\n    Lambert\n   </em>\n   , 1998-0730, p. 45, 749 So.2d at 767. Although the trial court ruled on other post-conviction relief, it never resentenced Mr.\n   Lambert on his convictions for aggravated rape and aggravated crime against nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In September 2017, Mr. Lambert filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion to clarify sentences averring that his \"RAP sheet\" incorrectly reflected two life sentences and should be amended to only reflect the life sentence resulting from the enhanced sentence on aggravated burglary. The trial court denied the motion for clarification as premature and appointed Mr. Lambert counsel for a resentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The resentencing hearing occurred on April 3, 2018. In conjunction with the hearing, Mr. Lambert filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion to quash and\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion for discharge from custody based on the delay in resentencing. These motions were denied and the court resentenced Mr. Lambert to life imprisonment without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence on the count of aggravated rape, and fifteen years on the count of aggravated crime against nature, with both sentences to run concurrently, with credit for time served. After his motion to reconsider the sentences was denied, Mr. Lambert timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the appeal was lodged in this Court, Mr. Lambert filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion in the trial court to correct his multiple offender sentence on the aggravated burglary conviction on the grounds of retroactive application of La. R.S. 15:308 and\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Esteen v. State\n   </em>\n   , 2016-0949 (La. 1/30/18),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12664550\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/239/233/\">\n    239 So.3d 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court denied the motion in a written ruling, finding Mr. Lambert would be ineligible for relief. Since he was resentenced to life imprisonment for the charge of aggravated rape, the retroactive application would not ameliorate his circumstances. La. R.S. 15:308(B). Mr. Lambert filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   writ to this Court seeking supervisory review and further requesting a stay of his appeal or consolidation of his writ into his appeal. As disposition of this claim is germane to the appeal of his life sentence for aggravated rape, we ordered the writ to be consolidated with the instant appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A trial court's ruling on a motion to quash involving factual determinations should not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

That there was a delay of seventeen years prior to Mr. Lambert's resentencing is not disputed. Mr. Lambert contends this delay should be considered as presumptively unreasonable and that, coupled with alleged prejudice stemming from his loss of prison privileges, the appropriate sanction is discharge of his convictions of aggravated rape and aggravated crime against nature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bourgeois\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9551464\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/380/63/\">\n    380 So.2d at 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On resentencing, Mr. Lambert was subject to the same mandatory sentence he originally received. Moreover, during the seventeen-year delay, Mr. Lambert was concurrently serving his life sentence for aggravated burglary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mr. Lambert also argues that he suffered prejudice through the loss of privileges due to the prolonged pendency of resentencing. The privileges include being prevented from enrolling into school to obtain a GED, working at the Angola Rodeo, receiving trustee status and enrolling in educational/trade programs. While we do not dispute the value of such privileges, we find they do not constitute prejudice as contemplated by the jurisprudence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Hancock\n   </em>\n   , 1999-0293, pp. 8-9 (La.App. 3 Cir. 11/24/99),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11500550\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/748/549/#p554\">\n    748 So.2d 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 554 (prejudice where delay in sentencing on prior conviction prevented eligibility for parole to a half-way house). On resentencing, Mr. Lambert would not have stood to gain the benefit of parole or early release. Accordingly, we find this assignment of error without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    COUNSELED ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 2: EXCESSIVE SENTENCE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In Mr. Lambert's second counseled assignment of error, he argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to reconsider sentences. We find the resentencing of Mr. Lambert to life imprisonment for his conviction of aggravated rape is not excessive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In determining the excessiveness of a sentence, appellate courts apply a two-pronged test.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The first prong, ensuring adequate compliance with the sentencing guidelines of La. C.Cr.P. 894.1, is inapplicable to this case as \"failing to articulate reasons for sentencing when imposing a mandatory sentence is not an error because such action would be an exercise in futility.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial court was not required to justify its imposition of a mandatory sentence under the sentencing guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The second prong focuses on the constitutional determination of whether the sentence imposed is too severe in light of the particular defendant and circumstances of the case.\n   <em>\n    Barbain\n   </em>\n   , 2015-0404 at p. 29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6839726\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/179/770/#p787\">\n    179 So.3d at 787-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A rebuttal results in a downward departure from the mandatory sentence. Mr. Lambert has failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he was entitled to a downward departure of the mandatory life sentence for aggravated rape.

Mr. Lambert's motion to reconsider sentence, filed immediately after resentencing, does not articulate any factual basis for a downward departure under\n   <em>\n    Dorthey\n   </em>\n   . Nor did Mr. Lambert or his counsel make an oral argument regarding any exceptional circumstances at the hearing prior to the trial court's resentencing. Consequently, we find no error in the trial court's determination that no factual grounds exist under\n   <em>\n    Dorthey\n   </em>\n   to reconsider the sentences.
