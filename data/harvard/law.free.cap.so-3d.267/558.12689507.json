Cooper\n   </em>\n   , 43 Fla. L. Weekly S508,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205116564\">\n    2018 WL 5116564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. Oct. 19, 2018). Upon reconsideration, we issue the following opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2009, Cooper was charged with aggravated battery, a second-degree felony, and was sentenced under the Youthful Offender Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 958.04, Fla. Stat. (2009). The Act subjects an offender to a maximum incarceration period of six years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 958.04(2). Consistent with that six-year cap, Cooper was sentenced to 479 days in prison, followed by 18 months of community control and a subsequent term of 18 months of probation. After the revocation of his community control for a substantive violation, the trial court sentenced Cooper to a minimum mandatory term of 20 years in prison pursuant to section 775.087(2)(a), Florida Statutes (the 10-20-Life statute). The judgment and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    Cooper v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=56%20So.%203d%20783\">\n    56 So. 3d 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 5th DCA 2011). Cooper's sentence was later amended to reflect that he maintained his youthful offender status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Cooper has challenged his sentence on several occasions. In his most recent challenge, he filed a \"Motion to Correct Illegal Sentence\" pursuant to rule 3.800(a) of the Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure. In the motion, he claimed that the minimum mandatory term was illegal because it exceeded the maximum sentence he could have received for a second-degree felony as a youthful offender.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 775.082(3)(d), Fla. Stat. (providing 15-year maximum sentence for second-degree felony). The trial court denied the motion, and Cooper appealed. Agreeing with Cooper that his sentence was illegal, we held that a sentencing court lacks statutory authority to impose a mandatory minimum term upon a youthful offender who substantively violates probation or community control.\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12380278,12380287\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/235/1034/\">\n    235 So.3d at 1036-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reaching this holding, we adhered to dicta in\n   <em>\n    Christian v.

Thus, after revoking a youthful offender's probation or community control for a substantive violation, the sentencing court may sentence a probationer or offender to either of the two options it had at the original sentencing hearing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12673491\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/248/1097/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court may impose a sentence under the six-year cap pursuant to the youthful offender designation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12673491\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/248/1097/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Alternatively, the court may impose an adult sanction, \"in which case it would be required to also impose any minimum mandatory provisions associated with the offense(s).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12673491\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/248/1097/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, when the court chooses to impose a sanction that exceeds the six-year cap, the sentence becomes an adult sentence and the defendant no longer retains his or her youthful offender status.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12673491\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/248/1097/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12673491\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/248/1097/\">\n    . at 1102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In so holding, the Florida Supreme Court expressly disapproved of\n   <em>\n    Christian\n   </em>\n   to the extent that it held otherwise.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12673491\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/248/1097/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12673491\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/248/1097/\">\n    at 1098, 1102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In this case, Cooper committed a substantive violation of community control. The trial court chose not to resentence Cooper to a youthful offender sentence and instead imposed an adult sanction. Thus, according to\n   <em>\n    Eustache\n   </em>\n   , the trial court was also required \"to impose any minimum mandatory provisions associated with the offense(s).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12673491\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/248/1097/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12673491\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/248/1097/\">\n    at 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court did so in this case. Because the twenty-year minimum mandatory term did not render Cooper's sentence illegal, the trial court properly denied the motion to correct his illegal sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Accordingly, we affirm the denial of Cooper's motion to correct his illegal sentence. We remand to the trial court to remove the \"youthful offender\" designation from his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   AFFIRMED and REMANDED with instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ORFINGER, COHEN, and GROSSHANS, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    \u00a7 958.14, Fla.
