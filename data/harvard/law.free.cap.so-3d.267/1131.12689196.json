Considering the unusual circumstances of this case, we find the district court's ruling was consistent with the authority granted by La. R.S. 13:3044(C) and was equitable to all parties. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeal is reversed, and the judgment of the district court is reinstated. The case is remanded\n   to the district court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
