The district court's ruling dismissing petitioner's actual innocence and ineffective assistance of counsel claims is reversed, and the claims are remanded for consideration after an evidentiary hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La.C.Cr.P. art. 930.8(A)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Following inculpatory statements to law enforcement officers coupled with a demonstration of how she shook her infant son (to death), Relator Brittany Tyson was charged with First Degree Murder. She pled guilty to a reduced charge of manslaughter; in doing so, she waived all non-jurisdictional defects. See\n   <em>\n    State v. McKinney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9540397\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/406/160/\">\n    406 So.2d 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La. 1981). She did not seek direct review and later filed an untimely application for post-conviction relief which alleges non-DNA claims of actual innocence and ineffective assistance of\n   counsel. I would deny both on untimeliness grounds and alternatively on the merits under the rationale set forth in\n   <em>\n    State v. Pierre\n   </em>\n   , 13-0873 (La. 10/15/13),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6998707\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/125/403/#p409\">\n    125 So.3d 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <em>\n    State v.
