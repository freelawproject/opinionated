Former wife cross-appeals, claiming error in the denial of her request for attorney's fees. We affirm as to all issues on the appeal and cross-appeal except the life insurance issue, which we now discuss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   A trial court is authorized to order a party to purchase or maintain a life insurance policy \"to the extent necessary to protect an award of child support.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2061.13\">\n    Fla.

We agree with the former husband that the trial court did not make the requisite factual findings (a point the former wife does not address in her answer brief), and we are unable to determine whether this error was harmless.\n   <em>\n    Winney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8382827\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/979/396/#p400\">\n    979 So.2d at 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
