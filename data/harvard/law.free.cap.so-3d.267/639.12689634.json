Following a hearing, the trial court took the motion for summary judgment under advisement and permitted the parties to submit post-hearing memoranda.

There are five elements to the duty-risk analysis that the plaintiff must prove to be successful in a negligence claim: (1) that the defendant had a duty to conform his conduct to a specific standard; (2) that the defendant's conduct failed to conform to the appropriate standard; (3) that the defendant's substandard conduct was a cause in fact of the plaintiff's injuries; (4) that the defendant's substandard conduct was a legal cause of the plaintiff's injuries; and (5) actual damages.\n   <em>\n    Lemann v.

The court must weigh \"[t]he foreseeability of the crime risk on the defendant's property and the gravity of the risk to determine the existence and extent of the defendant's duty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This test is applied to the facts and circumstances surrounding each case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A key factor in determining the foreseeability of the crime risk is the past occurrence of similar incidents. However, the inquiry does not end there. The court must also consider the location, nature, and condition of the property. Additionally, if management or employees of the business had knowledge that a third party's intended injurious conduct was about to occur, there is a duty to act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ballew v. Southland, Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7606196\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/482/890/\">\n    482 So.2d 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La.App. 2 Cir. 1/22/86).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In this case, the trial court found that the plaintiffs did not meet their burden of establishing the Hotel owed a duty to protect them under the circumstances presented. To prove that the plaintiffs could not establish that a duty was owed, the Hotel offered the affidavit of its General Manager, Mark Wilson. Mr. Wilson attested to the fact that he had no knowledge about incidents involving alleged criminal activity at the Bourbon Orleans Hotel or in the area immediately surrounding the hotel. Further, he stated that there had been no reported assaults or robberies in the common areas of the hotel or in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. According to Mr. Wilson, the November 21, 2013 armed robbery was the first and only such reported violent crime at or near the hotel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In opposition to the Hotel's motion for summary judgment, the plaintiffs provided an affidavit from a safety and security expert, Raymond Pendleton. Mr. Pendleton has thirty years of experience in the fields of security and investigations. He stated that he reviewed and analyzed documents, discovery responses, and various\n   reports detailing the facts and circumstances surrounding the incident at the Bourbon Orleans Hotel. One of the reports authored by a Bourbon Orleans Hotel employee indicated that the \"night auditors had noticed 5 'shady' looking guys walk passed [sic] the front desk to the elevators. Security also noticed them on the monitors in PDX. Security radioed the front desk and asked where they were going.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The auditors claimed the elevator stopped on several floors. After walking a few of the floors, security was unable to locate the men. Then, the front desk received a noise complaint from guests on the fifth floor. Security and the night auditor went to the fifth floor where they claimed to have heard a commotion and someone shouting \"get on the floor! Put your head down #$&amp;*%!.\" At that time, security chose to disengage and call the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   That evidence, together with the Bourbon Orleans Hotel's central location in the French Quarter, resulted in Mr. Pendleton's conclusion that the risk of crime and the potential for violent and non-violent criminal activity was reasonably foreseeable. He further found that the failure of the Bourbon Orleans Hotel's employees and security staff to intervene and prevent the criminal activity amounted to inadequate security measures. Notably, the Hotel did not offer any evidence to controvert Mr. Pendleton's expert conclusions provided in the affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This Court, guided by\n   <em>\n    Jones v. Estate of Santiago,\n   </em>\n   2003-1424 (La. 4/14/04),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9276953\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/870/1002/\">\n    870 So.2d 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , has reasoned that \"summary judgment should be denied when the movant, herein Appellees, fail to offer any scintilla of evidence that controverts the testimonial evidence offered by Appellant's expert witness.\"\n   <em>\n    Guy v. Howard Hughes Corp.,\n   </em>\n   2018-0413, p. 4, n.1 (La.App. 4 Cir. 12/19/18),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12685186\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/262/327/\">\n    262 So.3d 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, the Louisiana Supreme Court has reasoned that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   If a party submits expert opinion evidence in opposition to a motion for summary judgment that would be admissible under\n   <em>\n    Daubert-Foret\n   </em>\n   and the other applicable evidentiary rules, and is sufficient to allow a reasonable juror to conclude that the expert's opinion on a material fact more likely than not is true, the trial judge should deny the motion and let the issue be decided at t trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Independent Fire Ins. Co. v. Sunbeam Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 1999-2181, p. 17 (La. 2/29/00),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11527599\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/755/226/#p236\">\n    755 So.2d 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 236.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Accordingly, after reviewing the evidence presented together with the applicable law, we find that the trial court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs effectively established a genuine issue of material fact as to the extent of the duty owed to these plaintiffs. The trial court's ruling is reversed, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED AND REMANDED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   ATKINS, J., CONCURS WITH REASONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   ATKINS, J., CONCURS WITH REASONS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   I agree with the majority's opinion as to the result and hereby assign additional reasons why the reversal of summary judgment and remand is appropriate. Although the majority states that businesses have a duty to take reasonable precautions to protect customers from criminal acts, I further note that jurisprudence shows that\n   hotels are required to exercise \"a higher degree of care\" to protect their guests.\n   <em>\n    Salafian v.
