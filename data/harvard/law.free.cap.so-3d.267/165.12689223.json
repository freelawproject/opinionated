For the first two citations issued to Mid-City on March 19 and September 1, 2015, administrative fines of $250.00 and $300.00, respectively, were assessed under\n   LAC 55:I.1907(A)(4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the third citation on September 22, 2015, Mid-City's storage inspection license was suspended for thirty days under LAC 55:I.1907(A)(5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mid-City unsuccessfully appealed the suspension of its license in a separate proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Thereafter, on April 11, 2016, Mid-City filed this suit for declaratory and injunctive relief under La.

R.S. 32:1736 when towing vehicles from private property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Act provides that a tow truck operator who tows a vehicle in violation of La.

Suspension or revocation of a storage inspection license is not provided for in the Act. Nevertheless, under the regulations promulgated by the Office of State Police, Mid-City's storage inspection license was suspended for its third violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Mid-City argues that the Schedule of Fines in LAC 55:I.1907(A)(4) is invalid because the legislature's delegation of authority to the Office of State Police in La. R.S. 32:1714(3) to adopt and levy fines for violations of the Act or any rules or regulations adopted pursuant thereto was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to an administrative agency. Mid-City also argues that the license suspension and revocation provisions of LAC 55:I.1907(A)(5) and (6) are invalid because they exceed the scope of the authority granted to the Office of State Police by La. R.S. 32:1714 and because they are unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Administrative Procedure Act provides that the validity or applicability of an agency rule may be determined in an action for declaratory judgment in the district court of the parish in which the agency is located. La. R.S. 49:963(A)(1). In such an action, the district court shall declare the rule invalid or inapplicable if it\n   finds that the rule: (1) violates constitutional provisions, (2) exceeds the statutory authority of the agency, or (3) was adopted without substantial compliance with required rulemaking procedures. La. R.S. 49:963(C). If a plaintiff's challenge to the validity of a particular rule is based on one of these specific grounds, then an action for declaratory judgment under La. R.S. 49:963 is the appropriate and only procedural vehicle by which to challenge the rule.\n   <strong>\n    Liberty Mutual Insurance Company v. Louisiana Insurance Rat\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    ing\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    Commission,\n   </strong>\n   96-0793, p. 9 (La.App. 1 Cir. 2/14/97),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11997869\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/696/1021/\">\n    696 So.2d 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1027 ;\n   <strong>\n    Louisiana Chemical Association v.

However, prior to seeking declaratory judgment in district court under La. R.S. 49:963, the plaintiff must satisfy the following prerequisites set forth in Subsection D of that statute: (1) the plaintiff has requested agency review of the validity or applicability of the rule; (2) review in a contested adjudicated case would not provide an adequate remedy; and (3) application of the rule would inflict irreparable injury. Thus, if a regulated party can attack a rule in connection with an enforcement, license revocation, restriction, denial, or other contested adjudicative action, and receive a remedy of reversal based on the invalid rule, he has no standing under La. R.S. 49:963(D). In other words, if relief is available to a plaintiff under La. R.S. 49:964,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   he cannot use the declaratory judgment provisions under La.

R.S. 49:963(D) requires a plaintiff to request agency review of the validity or applicability of a rule prior to seeking declaratory judgment, where the allegations of invalidity or inapplicability of the rule are based on constitutional grounds, agency review is\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   a prerequisite to filing a declaratory judgment action in district court, since an administrative agency lacks jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionality of its own rules.\n   <strong>\n    Louisiana Chemical Association\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7508779\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/577/230/#p233\">\n    577 So.2d at 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, Mid-City was not required to seek administrative review of its allegations regarding the invalidity of the Schedule of Fines in 1907(A)(4) prior to filing this suit, since the basis for the assertion of invalidity is that the rule is unconstitutional due to an improper delegation of legislative authority. Likewise, Mid-City was not required to seek prior administrative review of its allegation that the license suspension and revocation provisions in 1907(A)(5) and (6) are invalid because they are unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous. However, Mid-City's assertion that LAC 55:I.1907(A)(5) and (6) are invalid because they exceed the statutory authority of the agency is not excepted from the administrative review provisions of La. R.S. 49:963(D), and Mid-City was required to provide proof that it satisfied the requirements of La. R.S. 49:963(D) before petitioning the district court for declaratory relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Mid-City alleges that it filed an administrative appeal of the fines and suspension of its storage inspection license and raised, briefed, and argued its challenges to the rule and its enabling statute before the administrative law judge, but no ruling was made in that proceeding concerning the constitutional challenge because the administrative law judge lacked jurisdiction to decide the constitutional issues. The Office of State Police denies that the provisions of the rule relating to administrative\n   fines were even at issue in the proceeding before the administrative law judge, as that proceeding was strictly an administrative appeal of the suspension following the third violation, and no fines had been assessed for Mid-City's third violation. Despite Mid-City's assertion that it sought the review required under La. R.S. 49:963(D) prior to seeking declaratory judgment in district court, that administrative record was not made a part of the record herein, and we are unable to verify whether the requirements of La. R.S. 49:963(D) were satisfied. Accordingly, we must remand in order for the district court to determine whether Mid-City satisfied the requirements of La. R.S. 49:963(D). See\n   <strong>\n    Louisiana Chemical Association\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7508779\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/577/230/#p233\">\n    577 So.2d at 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the portion of the judgment in this matter upholding the validity of the license suspension and revocation provisions, LAC 55:I.1907(A)(5) and (6), is vacated, and this matter is remanded to the district court for a determination of whether Mid-City satisfied the requirements of La. R.S. 49:963(D). Because the constitutional grounds for invalidity under La. R.S. 49:963 did not have to be submitted to agency review as a prerequisite to a petition for declaratory judgment, it was properly considered by the district court and we will consider those issues on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Although the district court in a declaratory judgment proceeding under La. R.S. 49:963 is limited to review of the administrative record when the issue is whether the rule is invalid or inapplicable because it exceeds statutory authority or was adopted without substantial compliance with rule making procedures, when the issue is the constitutionality of the rule, the scope of review is somewhat more complicated, since agency review is not a prerequisite to seeking declaratory judgment in district court.\n   <strong>\n    Louisiana Chemical Association,\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7508779\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/577/230/#p233\">\n    577 So.2d at 233-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This court has previously addressed the scope of review where the ground for invalidity raised under La. R.S. 49:963 is the unconstitutionality of the rule:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The question remains as to the method or standard of review by the district court in a suit for declaratory judgment. In most instances the record of the promulgation of the rule should be sufficient for the district court to make a determination of constitutionality since the constitutionality of the rule on its face will normally be the issue. If the constitutionality of the rule as applied is the issue this will, in most instances, arise from an adjudication and the record of that adjudicatory hearing will furnish the reviewing court with a sufficient record to make a determination of constitutionality. In those limited instances where the district court needs additional evidence there is no reason why the matter could not be remanded to the agency to specifically supplement the record by receiving the needed evidence without making any findings with reference to that evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Consequently, we hold that the district court is limited to a review of the record in determining issues presented under La. R.S. 49:963.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Limiting the district court to a review of the record is not contrary to La. Const. Art. V, \u00a7 16 vesting the district courts with original jurisdiction. District courts may exercise original jurisdiction by reviewing an administrative record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    Louisiana Chemical Association\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7508779\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/577/230/#p233\">\n    577 So.2d at 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Citations omitted). Although review is limited to the administrative record, La. R.S. 49:963(B) provides that the district court may allow additional evidence to be presented under certain circumstances:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (1) If, before the date set for hearing, application is made to the court for leave to present additional evidence, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there were good reasons for failure to present it in the proceeding before the agency, the court may order that the additional evidence be taken before the agency upon conditions determined by the court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (2) The agency may modify its findings and decision by reason of the additional evidence and shall file that evidence and any modifications, new findings, or decisions with the reviewing court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In the instant matter, the district court conducted a bench trial at which testimony and evidence were presented. Although counsel for Mid-City stated at the start of the trial that it would like to \"offer and introduce the entire record that we have,\" the record of the administrative proceedings, which is presumably what counsel was referring to, is not included in the record on appeal. On remand, if the district court determines that Mid-City satisfied the prerequisites of La. R.S. 49:963 in order to have the court consider its allegations that LAC 55:I.1907(A)(5) and (6) exceed the statutory authority of the agency, the district court is instructed to limit its review to the agency record, unless it determines that the taking of additional evidence is appropriate under La. R.S. 49:963(B). Nevertheless, because the administrative law judge did not have authority to consider the constitutionality of the rule, and because Mid-City's assertion is that the Schedule of Fines is unconstitutional on its face, the administrative record is unnecessary to our review of that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Determining whether a statute is constitutional is a legal question and thus reviewed de novo.\n   <strong>\n    Krielow v.

However, as an exception to this rule, the Louisiana\n   Supreme Court has recognized that the legislative branch has the authority to delegate to administrative boards and agencies of the State the power to ascertain and determine the facts upon which the laws are to be applied and enforced. Such a delegation of administrative functions is necessary because of the vast amount of governmental functions that are vested in the legislative branch, which cannot possibly enact and re-enact detailed laws to cover every situation during rapidly changing times.\n   <strong>\n    Krielow,\n   </strong>\n   13-1106 at pp. 5-6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6998677\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/125/384/#p387\">\n    125 So.3d at 388-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

So long as the regulation or action of the official or board authorized by statute does not in effect determine what the law shall be, or involve the exercise of primary and independent discretion, but only determines within prescribed limits some fact upon which the law by its own terms operates, such regulation is administrative and not legislative in its nature.

Under this test, a delegation of authority to an administrative agency is constitutionally valid if the enabling statute (1) contains a clear expression of legislative policy; (2) prescribes sufficient standards to guide the agency in the execution of that policy; and (3) is accompanied by adequate procedural safeguards to protect against abuse of discretion by the agency.\n   <strong>\n    Alfonso\n   </strong>\n   , 99-1546 at pp. 7-8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11450579\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/753/156/#p160\">\n    753 So.2d at 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Application of the\n   <strong>\n    Schwegmann\n   </strong>\n   three-prong test ensures the elected members of the Legislature retain all legislative power by insisting that they, and not their delegates in the executive branch, make the difficult policy choices for which they are accountable to the public through the democratic process.\n   <strong>\n    State v.

Furthermore, by insisting that the enabling legislation prescribe not only the legislative policy to be enforced by the agency, but also sufficient standards to guide the agency's execution of the legislative will, the\n   <strong>\n    Schwegmann\n   </strong>\n   test ensures that the statute delegates only administrative or ministerial authority and guards against delegations of unbridled legislative discretion. Additionally, because even delegations of administrative or ministerial authority require agencies to exercise some discretion in executing the legislative will, the requirement of adequate procedural\n   safeguards ensures the agency exercises that discretion in accordance with the policy and standards prescribed in the enabling statute and consistent with democratic values served by public participation and judicial review.\n   <strong>\n    All Pro Paint\n   </strong>\n   , 93-1316 at p. 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11325256\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/639/707/#p712\">\n    639 So.2d at 712-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In the present case, Mid-City alleges that the legislature's delegation of authority to the Office of State Police to adopt and levy fines is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative, rather than merely administrative or ministerial, authority. Applying the\n   <strong>\n    Schwegmann\n   </strong>\n   test, we must first determine whether the Act contains a clear expression of legislative policy. Once the legislature has defined its policy, the State, acting under its police power to protect the health, welfare, and safety of the people, may confer upon administrative officers or bodies the power to adopt the rules and regulations to effectuate the legislative will. Thus, the requirement of a clear expression of legislative policy ensures the regulatory scheme constitutes a valid exercise of the State's police power to protect the health, welfare, and safety of the people, thereby permitting an administrative agency to make rules and regulations necessary for the administration and enforcement of that policy.\n   <strong>\n    All Pro Paint\n   </strong>\n   , 93-1316 at p. 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11325256\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/639/707/#p712\">\n    639 So.2d at 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Act declares its policy as follows in La.

The standards which must accompany delegations of authority must not be unlimited, unreasonable, or permit arbitrary action by the administrative body.

The Office of State Police argues that it relied on La. R.S. 32:1725, which set the maximum criminal fine for a violation of the Act at $500.00, as guidance from the legislature as to the maximum administrative fine which should be imposed. However, the Act provided for the imposition of both criminal\n   <strong>\n    and\n   </strong>\n   administrative fines for violations,\n   and La. R.S. 32:1724, which provides for the assessment of an administrative fine for a violation, does not impose any limits on the amount of the administrative fine that may be assessed. Thus, we do not agree that sufficient standards to guide the Office of State Police may be reasonably inferred from \u00a7 1725. Because the legislature provided no guidance or limits on the amount of fines which could be set, the delegation of legislative authority fails to satisfy the second prong of the\n   <strong>\n    Schwegmann\n   </strong>\n   test. This unfettered discretion makes the exercise of the delegated authority by the Office of State Police legislative, rather than administrative, in nature; therefore, the Schedule of Fines contained in LAC 55:I.1907(A)(4) is not constitutionally valid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Because we find that the Schedule of Fines in LAC 55:I.1907(A)(4) is invalid because it violates constitutional provisions, Mid-City is entitled to an injunction against further enforcement of the fines.

Declaratory judgment is hereby rendered in favor of plaintiff, Mid-City Automotive, LLC, declaring that this provision is invalid due to an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to the Office of State Police, and an injunction is granted against further enforcement of fines under LAC 55:I.1907(A)(4). The district court judgment is vacated insofar as it held that the storage license suspension and revocation provisions of LAC 55:I.1907(A)(5) and (6) do not exceed the scope of the statutory authority of the agency, and this matter is remanded to the district court for further proceedings as set forth herein.

With respect to the validity of the license suspension and revocation provisions set forth in LAC 55:I.1907(A)(5) and (6), in my opinion, since the Office of State Police is authorized to issue licenses for nonconsensual tows of vehicles from private property, then they are authorized to suspend or revoke those licenses for violations of established rules and regulations. Thus, the revocation or suspension of any license is within the legislative mandate and constitutional. However, since the record in the administrative appeal is not in the record before us, we are unable to determine whether the suspension by the Office of State Police was appropriate,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether it was for the failure to pay the administrative fine or whether it was for Mid-City's third violation.
