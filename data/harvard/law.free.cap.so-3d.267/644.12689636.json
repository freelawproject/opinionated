At the time of the offense, Mr. Henry was sixteen years old. He and Mr. Williams were indicted for first degree murder and convicted of second degree murder. On September 30, 1994, the district court imposed on both of them the statutorily-mandated sentence of life imprisonment without the benefit of parole. On appeal, their convictions and sentences were affirmed.\n   <em>\n    State v. Williams\n   </em>\n   , 96-0131 (La.

In light of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Henry sought to have his sentence corrected. Although the district court granted Mr. Henry's motion, the Louisiana Supreme Court reversed, finding that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   did not apply retroactively.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Like Mr. Henry's counsel, we find no non-frivolous issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Nonetheless, Mr. Henry moved for, and was granted, leave to file a supplemental brief. Mr. Henry assigns six errors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Pro Se\n    </em>\n    Supplemental Assignment of Error 1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mr. Henry asserts that the district court \"violated the Supremacy Clause and the Eighth Amendment when it disobeyed a constitutional command recognized by the Supreme Court.\" Essentially, Mr. Henry contends that the district court erred in sentencing him to life imprisonment because\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   forbid life sentences for juvenile offenders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Mr. Henry's argument is premised on a mistaken reading of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   . Neither case held that the federal constitution forbids a sentence of life imprisonment for juveniles; rather, as noted elsewhere in this opinion, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   held only that \"the Eighth Amendment forbids a sentencing scheme that\n   <em>\n    mandates\n   </em>\n   life in prison\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   possibility of parole for juvenile offenders,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/#p479\">\n    567 U.S. at 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/#p479\">\n    132 S.Ct. at 2469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the narrow focus of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   (made retroactive by\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ) was parole eligibility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In this case, the district court sentenced Mr. Henry to life imprisonment with the benefit of parole-a sentence unquestioned by either\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   . This assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Pro Se\n    </em>\n    Supplemental Assignment of Error 2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Mr. Henry asserts that the district court \"imposed a rehabilitation rationale as punishment instead of a penalty prescribed by the Louisiana Legislature.\" Essentially, Mr. Henry contends that, because\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   invalidated life sentences for juvenile offenders, the district court was required to\n   impose a determinate sentence. As discussed elsewhere in this opinion, however,\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   did not invalidate life sentences for juvenile offenders; thus, Louisiana courts have rejected this argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Pro Se\n    </em>\n    Supplemental Assignments of Error 3 and 4.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mr. Henry asserts that the district court \"denied [him] 'fair notice' protection when it imposed the 'unforeseeable and retroactive judicial expansion' of [La.] R.S. 15:574.4(E) in place of the penalty invalidated by\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   .\" Mr. Henry also asserts that the district court \"violated the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause when it applied a legislative enactment not in existence at the time this offense occurred to the defendant at sentencing.\" Essentially, Mr. Henry contends that because La. R.S. 15:574.4 -which governs the timing of parole eligibility for juvenile offenders-was enacted after his crime, retroactive application of the limitations set forth in the statute violates his constitutional right to due process and the protection against the\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   application of law. Louisiana courts have rejected these arguments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   These assignments of error are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Pro Se\n    </em>\n    Supplemental Assignments of Error 5 and 6\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Mr. Henry asserts that, because the district court \"fail[ed] to fashion an 'individualized sentence,' \" the district court \"imposed an excessive sentence in violation of [the] Eighth Amendment and the La. Constitution Article I, \u00a7 20.\" It is, however, well settled that the only relief available at a\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   hearing is a determination of whether the previously-imposed life sentence is to be served with or without the benefit or parole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court, which imposed a sentence of life imprisonment with the benefit of parole, was without authority to impose on Mr.\n   Henry any more lenient sentence.
