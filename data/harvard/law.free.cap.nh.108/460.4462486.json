Similarly the Court could properly find that the cause arose while the parties were domiciled in this state (RSA 458:6) and that it was in existence at the time of the filing of the petition. RSA 458:8.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">Evidence of cruelty or other misconduct by the defendant before the parties came to New Hampshire was properly received to explain the plaintiff\u2019s apprehension concerning the defendant\u2019s conduct toward her while they were domiciled here. Contrary to the suggestion of the defendant\u2019s brief, tire evidence of conduct injurious to health was not confined to \u201cone selected instance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">The testimony presented issues of fact which were peculiarly for the Trial Court <em>(Morgan </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>101 N. H. 470, 471) whose determination is binding here, since there was evidence to support it. <em>Szulc v. Szulc, </em>96 N. H. 190; <em>Buck </em>v. <em>Buck, </em>97 N. H. 178; <em>Kotarba </em>v. <em>Kotarba, </em>97 N. H. 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">Much of the extended hearing was devoted to examination of the assets of the parties, with respect to which the Court ordered a division of property. The defendant has questioned the order for allowance toward the fees of plaintiff\u2019s counsel. Although the authority of the Court to make such an order does not appear to us to be questionable, it is to be exercised with reasonable restraint.
