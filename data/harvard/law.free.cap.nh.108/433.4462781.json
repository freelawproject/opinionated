Trial by the Court <em>(Loughlin, </em>J.) resulted in a finding that the insurer was obligated to defend the tort action and pay any judgment therein. The case was reserved and transferred by the Presiding Justice upon the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">On July 11, 1964 the defendant Harrington suffered injuries from an explosion at the town dump in West Swanzey which resulted in loss of an eye. The plaintiff first received notice of the accident from Harrington\u2019s counsel thirty-three days later, on August 13, 1964. The insurance policy provided: \u201cWhen an accident occurs written notice shall be given on behalf of the insured to the company or any of its authorized agents as soon as practicable.\u201d It also provided that no action should lie against the company \u201cunless as a condition precedent thereto, the insured shall have fully complied with all the terms of the policy . . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">In response to the plaintiff\u2019s requests, the Trial Court found that \u201call the elements of the occurrence of July 11, 1964, including the nature of the conduct upon which liability might be predicated were known to the Selectmen of the Town of Swanzey immediately following the accident,\u201d and that the town \u201cnever gave notice of the accident\u201d to its insurer. It also ruled that the policy requirement of notice \u201cwas not complied with\u201d by the town. The Court found however that the insurer \u201cwas not prejudiced by the notice it received and is obligated to defend [the tort action] and.to pay any judgment\u201d therein. Thereafter the plaintiff moved to set aside the verdict and for a decree in its favor. After hearing, the Court denied the motion, and found \u201cas a question of fact that the policy was not breached.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The plaintiff takes the position that the \u201cdelay of thirty-four days in giving notice of an accident\u201d was a breach of the notice condition of the policy, and that as a matter of law the plaintiff was thereby relieved of liability. Its argument assumes, if it does not concede, that the insured may have the benefit if any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>notice given by the injured third party. The plaintiff argues that no excuse was offered for the town\u2019s failure to give notice. The granting of the plaintiff\u2019s request for a finding that the selectmen knew \u201cthe nature of the conduct upon which liability might be predicated\u201d <em>(Pawtucket Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lebrecht, </em>104 N. H. 465, 470) was not a finding that they reasonably should have appreciated that a claim of liability might be predicated upon that conduct and that the insurer should therefore be notified. While the Court could have found the selectmen justified in not associating the explosion with possible liability for negligent failure to regulate the dumping of explosive articles, it did not do so. See <em>Pawtucket Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lebrecht, supra, </em>471.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">We are of the opinion that the findings and rulings of the Trial Court are sustainable upon the record. The finding that the insurer was not prejudiced is attacked by the plaintiff, but was warranted by the evidence. The company had notice within thirty-four days, and counsel for the injured party supplied the company with the information in his possession. The names of witnesses were furnished on August 17, 1964. However the insurer neither interviewed nor sought to interview them until after suit was brought on October 15, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The <em>Pawtucket </em>case, <em>supra, </em>signalled this court\u2019s departure from the view that \u201call notices . . . which are not given immediately or within a short time after the accident are prejudicial to the insurer . . . . \u201d <em>Pawtucket Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lebrecht, </em>104 N. H. 465, 471. The opinion in <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Head, </em>90 N. H. 58, relied upon by the plaintiff, recognized that immediate notice may be excused where the insured \u201cis ignorant of the fact that an accident has happened\u201d or \u201cthat his property or servant has been involved.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>62) In other respects however the decision is in conflict with principles today adopted in <em>Sutton Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Notre Dame Arena, Inc., </em>108 N. H. 437, and is hereby overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In support of its motion to set aside the verdict, both in the Trial Court and this court, the plaintiff has pointed to the ruling of the Trial Court, in response to its request, that the requirement of \u201cnotice as soon as practicable following an accident was not complied with by the Town.\u201d Relying upon the statement in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number><em>Pawtucket </em>case, supra., that where a breach of the notice condition has been found to have occurred, \u201cthe question of whether the insurer was prejudiced would be immaterial\u201d <em>(Pawtucket Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lebrepht, supra, </em>471-472), the plaintiff argues, in effect, that the quoted ruling entitled it to a decree as a matter of law and regardless of any issue of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">The Trial Court\u2019s reiteration of its finding of no prejudice coupled with its finding \u201cas a question of fact that the policy was not breached\u201d came in response to this argument. The Court expressly stated that its finding of no breach was made \u201cso manifest justice will be attained . . . and plaintiff\u2019s counsel will not attain what might be an unfair advantage.\u201d The quoted dictum of the <em>Pawtucket </em>case upon which the plaintiff relies was intended to mean that prejudice to the insurer is a material consideration only in determining whether the insured has complied with the notice requirement of the policy, by giving notice within a reasonable time under all the facts and circumstances of the case. <em>Sutton Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Notre Dame Arena, Inc., </em>108 N. H. 437, <em>supra. </em>The action of the Trial Court upon the plaintiff\u2019s motion made it plain that in finding that the \u201cpolicy was not breached\u201d the Court took into account \u201cthe character of the assured\u2019s conduct and the importance of its probable effect upon the interest of the insurer\u201d, as the <em>Pawtucket </em>case held proper. <em>Id., </em>472. This finding further demonstrated that the Court intended thereby to prevent any conclusive effect from attaching to its prior ruling that the condition of notice was not complied with by the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">In sum, it is reasonably plain that the Trial Court considered that under the circumstances the failure of the town to notify the company of the accident was not a material breach of the policy which would excuse the company from performance of its undertakings. We hold that this conclusion was neither erroneous nor unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
