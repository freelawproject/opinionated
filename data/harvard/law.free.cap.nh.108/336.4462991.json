H. 149, 150); and that the offense with which he is charged is not sodomy or a \u201ccrime against nature\u201d in violation of RSA 579:9, <em>supra. </em>In essence he argues that the offense charged does not involve \u201csexual relations ... in an <em>unnatural </em>manner\u201d as required by section 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">A similar contention was made, although with respect to different facts, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Vredenburg, </em>91 N. H. 372. It was there pointed out that the statute (then P. L., <em>c. </em>386, <em>s. </em>9) is \u201cconstrued to be more comprehensive than the common law in the scope of the conduct prohibited.\u201d See also, <em>State </em>v. <em>Desilets, </em>96 N. H. 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">In the cases last cited, the perverted sex conduct complained of was deemed to be within the purview of the statute. The conduct with which this defendant is charged, was doubtless a misdemeanor under the statute prohibiting gross lewdness or lascivious behavior, RSA 579:3 <em>(State </em>v. <em>Lizotte, </em>101 N. H. 494) and \u201cin deviation of accepted customs and manners.\u201d <em>Jacquith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>331 Mass. 439, 442. However it does not fall within the class of offenses charged in <em>Vredenburg </em>and <em>Desilets, supra (</em>see Briefs &amp; Cases, Nos. 3237 and 3915), and was not within the statutory term of an \u201cunnatural . . . act,\u201d or the common-law definition of the crime against nature.
