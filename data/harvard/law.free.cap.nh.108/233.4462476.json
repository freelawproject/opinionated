Reinhart </em>(by brief and orally), for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b275-8\">Duncan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A86l\">A fundamental argument advanced by the defendant is that there \u201cwas no evidence upon which the Master could support its finding that the wall in question was upon the Plaintiff\u2019s land. \u201d The argument is based primarily upon the proposition that the deeds under which the parties claim contain no measurements and refer to no monuments other than the sidelines of adjacent streets, so that the division line between the adjoining properties cannot be located with accuracy upon the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">The twelve inch brick wall erected against the defendant\u2019s eight inch brick wall in 1936 or 1937 presumably was to satisfy an easement of support appurtenant to the defendant\u2019s property. See <em>Wadleigh </em>v. Cline, 99 N. H. 202; <em>Bean </em>v. Dow, 84 N. H. 464. There was evidence that because of its height the defendant\u2019s brick wall would not stand without such support. In finding that the twelve inch wall was located upon the plaintiff\u2019s property, the master had before him in addition to the evidence obtained at the view, the description contained in the deed to the plaintiff, which antedated the deed to the defendant, and bounded the plaintiff\u2019s property along the boundary in question as follows: \u201cthence . . . to the center of the original 8-inch brick Easterly wall of the Brick building on said last mentioned land [now owned by the defendant]; thence through the center of said original brick wall to said State Street. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">Since the twelve inch wall in question was easterly of the \u201c original 8 - inch brick Easterly wall \u201d mentioned in the deed, the finding of the master that the twelve inch wall was on the plaintiff\u2019s land was amply warranted. The deed under which the defendant claimed offered no contradiction since it bounded the defendant\u2019s property on the easterly side simply \u201c by land now or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>formerly of Charles M. Dale\u201d (now belonging to the plaintiff). Since the evidence warranted the finding made, the finding is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The balance of the defendant\u2019s argument is devoted to the contention that the decree requiring the defendant to restore the wall is oppressive and inequitable, since the plaintiff suffered no material damage, while the defendant \u201c acted in good faith, believing that the window which was cut through the wall was entirely upon her premises \u201d and she will be put to substantial expense to restore the wall, in order to remedy a \u201c harmless encroachment. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The evidence did not compel a finding that the defendant acted in good faith. There was evidence that she requested permission of the plaintiff which was denied, and that installation of the window was later accomplished in a short time by working from the inside of the defendant\u2019s own building, so that the plaintiff had no opportunity to halt the work before completion.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Relying upon <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>64 N. H. 572, the defendant argues that the damage which will be caused to the defendant by reason of \u201c an innocent mistake as to the line . . . will be greatly disproportionate to the injury of which the plaintiff complains. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">This court has frequently recognized that injunctive relief in equity does not follow automatically from findings that rights of the moving party have been invaded. See <em>Johnson </em>v. Shaw, 101 N. H. 182, 183-189, and cases cited. There is no reason in the case before us however, to assume that the master and the Trial Court failed to weigh the factors which enter into a determination of whether an injunction should issue. Restatement, Torts, <em>ss. </em>936-941. The issue of damages was considered by the master and a finding with respect thereto was made. The authorities support the granting of affirmative relief in analogous circumstances. <em>Normille </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>159 Mass. 427; <em>Bonney </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>96 Me. 335, 347; 2 Thompson on Real Property (1961 Replacement) <em>s. </em>403; 5 Powell on Real Property, s. 690, <em>p. </em>345; See also, <em>Beaudoin </em>v. <em>Sinodinos, </em>313 Mass. 511, 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">It cannot be said upon the record in the case before us that entry of the injunction was erroneous as a matter of law. Accordingly the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
