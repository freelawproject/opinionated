As one officer approached the car on foot, he saw the defendant sitting in thedriver\u2019s seat slumped over. He shouted, but receiving no response, opened the door, awakened the defendant, smelled alcohol and had him step out of the car. The defendant, according to the police officer, was unsteady on his feet, his face was flushed, and his speech slurred. He arrested him for drunkenness under the statute. The questions of law raised by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>the denial of defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss at the close of the State\u2019s case were transferred by <em>Chretien, </em>J. under authority of RSA 502-A:17-a (supp).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">There is no question but that Elm Street is a place to which the statute is applicable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>36 N. H. 59, 63. See <em>State </em>v. <em>McConnell, </em>70 N. H. 294. The issue is whether the defendant was in \u201ca street or other public place\u201d when he was in the automobile which was in the public street. He cannot be convicted for his presence in the street outside the car after he had been ordered there by the officer and no such contention is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">As was said in <em>State </em>v. <em>Desmarais, </em>81 N. H. 199, 201 the statute punishes \u201cpublic drunkenness.\u201d We hold that, in being drunk in his automobile parked in the public street where he was open to the public view of pedestrians passing by, the defendant was in violation of the statute. See Annot. 8 A. L. R. 3d 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The officer or his superior could have released the defendant after seeing to his safety and that of the public, without further proceedings, in the exercise of their discretion under RSA 594:18-a (supp) and defendant orally argued that since this would give adequate protection to both the defendant and thepublic we should not extend the application of RSA 570:14 to the facts of this case. The fact that the police had an alternative can have no effect upon the sufficiency of the evidence to support the charge made.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
