The plaintiff submitted a letter dated May 12, 1964 which was a \u201csummary of the agreement\u201d between the parties which was signed by the defendant\u2019s agents May 21, 1964. Trial by the Court resulted in a \u201cverdict for the defendants\u201d and plaintiff\u2019s bill of exceptions was allowed and transferred by <em>Dunfey, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-15\">At the trial the plaintiff contended \u201cthat the contract on the face of it is indivisible as a matter of law.\u201d Particular reliance is placed on that part of the letter which reads as follows: \u201c . . . you [defendant] have agreed that our [plaintiff] minimum compensation for the year beginning May 11, 1964 and ending May 10, 1965 shall be $2,500 providing for a minimum payment of $200 in each month of that year.\u201d The parties have stipulated that no work was undertaken by the plaintiff prior to date of the letter of agreement. It was the defendant\u2019s contention at the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>\u201cthat the contract, when considering all the surrounding circumstances relating thereto, is divisible\u201d and that if there was a technical breach, \u201cthat the defendant has fully performed on a quantum meruit basis.\u201d Particular reliance is placed on that part of the letter which reads as follows: \u201c . . . you [defendant] have agreed, that for our [plaintiff] time spent in travel and consultation with you, the generation of ideas, and their execution, you would pay us on a time basis. Your monthly invoice will, therefore, be determined by the amount of time actually spent in your behalf with a minimum of $200, for any single month.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">On or about August 26, 1964 the defendant discontinued production of suction box covers and its general manager resigned and notified the plaintiff. This terminated plaintiff\u2019s services for the defendant. It was stipulated that the defendant had paid in full the invoices submitted by the plaintiff for May, June, July and August totaling $1,043.83 of which $750 represented services and $293.83 represented costs and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The Trial Court was not requested to make any findings of fact by the parties and he made none. The court\u2019s verdict for the defendant obviously rejects tire plaintiff\u2019s claim that he was entitled to a minimum fee of $2,500 minus the $750 already paid by the defendant. 5 Williston, Contracts (Rev. <em>ed.</em>) <em>s. </em>1358 (1937). There was evidence from which it could be found that the parties assumed that the plaintiff\u2019s services would be required for one year and as long as that condition existed the defendant would be billed monthly. See 6 Williston, Contracts (Jaeger <em>ed. </em>1962) s. 862, <em>pp. </em>273-274; 5A Corbin, Contracts, s. 1127 (1964). There was no evidence as to plaintiff\u2019s damages or losses under the contract. Where no findings appear which render an order of the Trial Court improper, all required findings necessary to justify it were presumably made. <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Langley, </em>99 N. H. 158, 159; <em>Ware </em>v. <em>Company, </em>99 N. H. 19, 21. \u201cSince the presumptions are that the findings necessary to support the verdict were made by the Trial Court, and the record discloses no error of law\u201d <em>(Joachim </em>v. <em>Andover Silver Co., </em>104 N. H. 18, 22), the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
