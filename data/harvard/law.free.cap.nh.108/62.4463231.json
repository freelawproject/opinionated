Recent decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States compel us to advise you that that Court would hold invalid under the Constitution of the United States the oath submitted to us with your resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>In <em>Baggett </em>v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360 the Supreme Court of the United States had before it an oath required by a State of Washington statute which contained language almost identical to that of the oath submitted to us. The Court held (Ib., 368) that oath too vague to meet the due process requirement of the Constitution of the United States and said in part: \u201c The susceptibility of the statutory language to require forswearing of an undefined variety of \u2018 guiltless knowing behavior \u2019 is what the Court condemned in <em>Cramp. [Cramp </em>v. <em>Board of Public </em>Instruction, 368 U. S. 278]. This statute, like the one at issue in Cramp, is unconstitutionally vague. \u201d The Court also said <em>(Ib., </em>369) \u201c The Washington statute suffers from additional difficulties on vagueness grounds. A person is subversive not only if he himself commits the specified acts but if he abets or advises another in aiding a third person to commit an act which will assist yet a fourth person in the overthrow or alteration of constitutional government. \u201d See also, <em>Sweezy </em>v. <em>New </em>Hampshire, 354 U. S. 234, 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">We can see no way to distinguish the oath before us from the oath declared invalid in <em>Baggett </em>v. Bullitt, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The provisions relating to membership in subversive organizations are defective in two other respects. They make mere membership in the organizations described a bar to employment or appointment without requiring knowledge of their aims or an intent to further their unlawful purposes. In the case of <em>Wieman </em>v. <em>Updegraff </em>344 U. S. 183 (1952) an Oklahoma loyalty oath statute was held invalid because it barred employment to persons for mere membership \u201c regardless of their knowledge concerning the organizations to which they had belonged. \u201d The Court said in part: \u201cBut membership may be innocent. A state servant may have joined a proscribed organization unaware of its activities and purposes. In recent years, many completely loyal persons have severed organizational ties after learning for the first time of the character of groups to which they had belonged ....</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\u201c There can be no dispute about the consequences visited upon a person excluded from public employment on disloyalty grounds. In the view of the community, the stain is a deep one; indeed, it has become a badge of infamy. Especially is this so in time of cold war and hot emotions when \u2018 each man begins to eye his neighbor as a possible enemy. \u2019 Yet under the Oklahoma Act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>the fact of association alone determines disloyalty and disqualification; it matters not whether association existed innocently or knowingly. To thus inhibit individual freedom of movement is to stifle the flow of democratic expression and controversy at one of its chief sources . . . Indiscriminate classification of innocent with knowing activity must fall as an assertion of arbitrary power.\u201d <em>Ib., </em>190, 191. See also, <em>Sweezy </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>354 U. S. 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">In the very recent case of <em>Keyishian </em>v. <em>Board of Regents, </em>87 S. Ct. 675, 685, 686, decided January 23, 1967, the Supreme Court said: \u201c Mere knowing membership without a specific intent to further the unlawful aims of an organization is not a constitutionally adequate basis for exclusion from such positions as those held by appellants ... In <em>Elfbrandt </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>384 U. S. 11, we said, \u2018Those who join an organization but do not share its unlawful purposes and who do not participate in its unlawful activities surely pose no threat, either as citizens or as public employees. \u2019 We there struck down a statutorily required oath binding the state employee not to become a member of the Communist Party with knowledge of its unlawful purpose, on threat of discharge and perjury prosecution if the oath were violated ... As we said in <em>Schneiderman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>320 U. S. 118, 136, \u2018[U]nder our traditions beliefs are personal and not a matter of mere association, and . . . men in adhering to a political party or other organization do not subscribe unqualifiedly to all of its platforms or asserted principles. A law which applies to membership without the \u201cspecific intent\u201d to further the illegal aims of the organization infringes unnecessarily on protected freedoms. It rests on the doctrine of \u201cguilt by association\u201d which has no place here.\u2019\u201d See also, <em>Aptheker v. Secretary of State, </em>378 U. S. 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The defects held by the Supreme Court of the United States to be fatal to the statutes considered in the foregoing cases are inherent in the oath accompanying your resolution and the statute upon which it is based, which are therefore unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">As a matter of information, we add that the Supreme Court of the United States again has under attack before it a Maryland oath which it upheld in 1951 in the case of <em>Gerende </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>341 U. S. 56. That oath states only that the candidate \u201c is not a person who is engaged in one way or another in the attempt to overthrow the government by force or violence. \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>See <em>Whitehill </em>v. <em>Elkins, </em>258 F. Supp. 589 (D. Md., 1966). <em>Cf. Pedlosky </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Institute of Technology </em>( Mass. 1967 ) 224 N.E. 2d 414. We of course do not predict the outcome.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b107-11\"><em>Robert H. Reno </em>and <em>Richard B. Couser </em>for affirmative answer.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A5Z\"><em>George S. Pappagianis, </em>Attorney General, also for affirmative answer.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">We wish to make it clear that the oath of civil officers prescribed by the Constitution of this State ( Const., Pt. II, <em>Art. </em>84) is not involved here and we mean to cast no doubt upon its validity. Nor do we mean to cast doubt upon the power of the State to safeguard itself from disloyal employees. The Supreme Court of the United States has said: \"... we do not question the power of a State to take proper measures safeguarding the public service from disloyal conduct. But measures which purport to define disloyalty must allow public servants to know what is and is not disloyal. \u201d <em>Baggett </em>v. Bullitt, 377 U. S. 360, 379, 380. <em>Cramp </em>v. <em>Board of Public Instruction, </em>368 U. S. 278.</p>\n<judges id=\"b107-6\">Frank R. Kenison.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b107-7\">Laurence I.
