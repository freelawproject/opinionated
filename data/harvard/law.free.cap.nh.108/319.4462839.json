The planning board in its report unanimously recommended the adoption of the proposed ordinance, stating that it had originally recommended this area be zoned as an apartment house district in 1963 and that events since that time further substantiated this recommendation. The planning board did, however, recommend a change in the description of the area for the sake of accuracy by substituting the words \u201capproximately 130 feet northerly of the intersection of Ormond Street with Prescott Street, which point is also on a line which is a straight line westerly extension of the existing general residence district boundary line parallel to and 100 feet northerly ... of Burns Avenue,\u201d in place of the words \u201capproximately 230 feet northerly of the intersection of Ormond Street with Prescott Street, which point is also on the boundary line of a general residence area as it now exists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">This amendment was adopted and the ordinance in its amended form was passed by the board of aldermen on March 14, 1966, after the public hearing, without further notice being published.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">RSA 31:63 provides for a public hearing at which parties in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>interest and citizens may be heard before such an ordinance change shall become effective. The notice requirement of that section is as follows: \u201cAt least 15 days\u2019 notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in a paper of general circulation in such [city.]\u201d It is not contended that notice of the time and place of the hearing was not published in accordance with the statute. While there is no specific statutory requirement that the description of the zoned area be published, a notice would be meaningless unless it included some reference to the area involved sufficient to give the reader reasonable warning that his interest may be affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">A comparison of the ordinance as originally proposed and published with that finally enacted reveals that both descriptions describe the same property. It is clear that the westerly boundary in both descriptions is the center line of Ormond Street and its northerly extension, and that the southerly boundary is a line \u201cparallel to and 100 feet northerly of the northerly line of Burns Avenue . . . . \u201d extended some 600 feet to the center line of Ormond Street. It is also clear from both descriptions, each taken as a whole, that the starting point was intended to be the point where the westerly and southerly boundaries intersect in the center of Ormond Street. These boundaries are definitely ascertainable and their actual point of intersection would control over the approximate distance location of that point which the original description placed too far north and which it is claimed was placed too far south in the amended description. <em>Harmon </em>v. <em>Kennett Company, </em>103 N. H. 219; <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>Green, </em>59 N. H. 101; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>36 N. H. 569. <em>See Pettee </em>v. <em>Chapter, </em>86 N. H. 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">There is, therefore, no variance between the property described in the notice and that which was rezoned. This ordinance was not invalid because of any want or defect in the notice of the public hearing. This also disposes of the subsidiary contention that the ordinance as enacted does not describe the area rezoned with sufficient certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The plaintiffs contend that the ordinance is invalid because it constitutes \u201cspot zoning.\u201d An area is spot zoned when it is singled out for treatment different from that of similar surrounding land which cannot be justified on the bases of health, safety, morals or general welfare of the community and which is not in accordance with a comprehensive plan. <em>Bosse </em>v. <em>Portsmouth, </em>107 N. H. 523. The mere fact that an area is small and is zoned at the request of a single owner and is of greater benefit to him than to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>others does not make out a case of spot zoning \u201cif there is a public need for it or a compelling reason for it.\u201d <em>Edgewood Civic Club </em>v. <em>Blaisdell </em>95 N. H. 244, 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The area rezoned, except for that part of it which is owned by the State, was designated a multifamily residential area, another term for apartment house district, in the land use plan which was certified to the board of aldermen by the planning board on August 3, 1964. That portion which is owned by the State was designated by the planning board as \u201cinstitutional use\u201d which permits use for office buildings, dormitories, and similar uses compatible with apartment home use. The area is situated in the \u201cConcord Heights\u201d area and lies a few hundred feet northerly of Loudon Road which is the Route 4 entrance to the city. Both sides of Loudon Road are classified as business districts. Just easterly of the rezoned area, there exists a substantial apartment house complex which has been built in recent years, known as Lexington Manor, and also an older apartment building, known as Eastern Apartments. Within the rezoned area, there is a substantial apartment house complex for the aged being constructed by the New Hampshire Conference of the United Church of Christ under a variance granted in September 1965, authorizing construction of eight apartment buildings, an administration building, and a forty-eight bed nursing home, all on an eight-acre tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">There was evidence of a growing need for garden-type apartment house dwellings in Concord and that it is very difficult to find suitable space for them under existing zoning. The planning director testified that the land previously zoned agricultural was so zoned to hold it for future rezoning as conditions warranted and that in his opinion the land in the rezoned area was more appropriate for apartment house use.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The burden is upon the plaintiffs to prove that the action of the board of aldermen was \u201cunreasonable or unlawful.\u201d RSA 31:78. The evidence did not warrant a finding that the action of the board of aldermen constituted spot zoning or was otherwise unreasonable or unlawful, and the Trial Court was correct in dismissing the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b363-9\">Griffith, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
