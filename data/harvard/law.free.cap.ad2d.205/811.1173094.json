Claimant was terminated because of repeated absences and failure to call in and report his absences, despite prior warnings. Significantly, the Board was free to disbelieve claimant\u2019s explanation of his conduct and to credit the testimony of the employer\u2019s witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Mikoll, J. P., Crew III, White, Yesawich Jr. and Peters, JJ., concur. Ordered that the decision is affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
