Section 134 specially relates to the mode of assessing property of corporations, while the provisions of section 133 are general, and it is a cardinal rule of construction that the more general must yield to the more specific.

In the event of repugnancy between the provisions of section 133 and section 134, \"the latter must control, in that the rule of interpretation, long recognized, is that in cases of repugnancy between two provisions of a statute which can not be reconciled, the later in position should control as being the last expression of the legislative will. Railway v. Rambolt, 67 Texas, 657, and cases cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-6\">There are no other sections of the charter of the city of Dallas capable of exercising any influence upon the question, and it is respectfully submitted, therefore, that because of section 134, the city council of the city of Dallas is, under its charter, powerless to assess the property of corporations in any mode other than that prescribed by the State law upon the subject. By the State law it is provided (article 5062), \u201cReal property, for purposes of taxation, shall be construed to include the land itself, whether laid out in town lots or otherwise, and all buildings, structures and improvements or other fixtures of whatsoever kind thereon, and all of the rights and privileges belonging or in anywise appertaining thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-7\">Construing this statute, in State v. Railway, 62 Southwestern Reporter, 1050, this court said: \u201cIt seems to us the plain purpose of the article last quoted is to require that in assessing real estate for taxation, whether held by a natural person or a corporation, there shall not only be included in the valuation the value of the land itself, merely as land, together with the improvements thereon, but also all franchises and privileges appurtenant thereto, and all the advantages for a profitable prosecution of the business to which it is appropriated.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-8\">From the unchallenged findings of fact of the trial court it affirmatively appears that some of the ordinances of the city of Dallas, under and by virtue of which defendant in error acquired its franchise, prescribed the annual payment of a fixed sum, denominating the same \u201ca franchise tax.\u201d We concede the rule to be, as stated by the Supreme Court of the United States, in Erie Railway v. Pennsylvania, 21 Wallace, 498, that the surrender of the right to tax can not be inferred from ambiguous language, but from this it does not follow that exemption from further taxation may not arise by necessary implication from the language employed. Railway v. Sabin, 26 Pa. St., 244, cited with approval by the Supreme Court of the United States in Railway v. Pennsylvania, 21 Wall., 499 and 500.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-9\">When the privilege of operating street cars upon certain streets in the city of Dallas was granted by an ordinance, which in terms prescribed the payment annually of a given sum as a franchise tax, the legitimate inference is that those who accepted the privilege, under the terms prescribed by the ordinance, rightfully assumed that no other or additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>franchise tax would be imposed. Such, of course, can not be maintained with reference to privileges extended by ordinances imposing the payment annually of fixed sums purely as a bonus.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-3\">The position of the counsel for the plaintiffs in error is that the Legislature was powerless, in view of certain provisions of the Constitution,, to invest the city council with authority either to exempt from or commute ad valorem taxes. Doubtless this, is a correct proposition, but we1 deny its application to this case, for the reason that, in the very nature of things, the value of a franchise is incapable of approximate, much less exact, ascertainment, nor have any rules for the ascertainment of such values been prescribed by the Legislature. It was therefore competent for the city council, acting in good faith, at the time of the granting of the franchise, to fix, determine, and agree, with those .to whom the. franchise was granted, upon the value thereof, and the amount of revenue that the city should annually derive therefrom. \u25a0 Ho abuse of such discretion is-even suggested, much less shown.' The city council, therefore, by definitely ascertaining in advance the value of the franchise granted and the amount of the revenue that the city should annually derive therefrom, was neither exempting the franchise from taxation nor commuting the taxes thereupon. But if this position is not sound, yet the fact remains that the city should not be permitted to recover a double franchise tax, one imposed, in the first instance, by ordinance, and the other, in the second instance, by assessment, and if the action of the city council in prescribing in- advance the amount off the annual franchis\u00e9 tax to be paid, exceeded its authority, it would follow that a subsequent and independent assessment of such franchise tax would in law operate to discharge the liability of the defendant in error from making the annual payment of the franchise tax as prescribed by the ordinance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-4\">The cardinal rule is that taxes must be equal and uniform, and this rule is violated whenever the taxpayer is subjected to double taxation, and if both the assessment as made by the assessor and that as made by the city council by ordinance are to stand, it inevitably follows that defendant in error has been, and throughout the life of its corporate existene\u00e9 will continue to be, doubly taxed, a result which we submit this court Will not permit.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b291-5\">GAINES, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"A10\">This case was brought to the Court of Civil Appeals of the Fifth Supreme Judicial District by a writ of error, and was transferred to the Court of Civil Appeals for the Fourth District. The opinion of the latter court gives a clear and succinct statement of the case, which we adopt, and which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">\u201cPlaintiff in error, the Dallas Consolidated Electric Street Railway Company, instituted this suit to enjoin the city of Dallas and Ford -House, its tax collector, from collecting a certain tax imposed by said city on its franchise as a street railway. The cause was tried by the court and resulted in a judgment dissolving the temporary injunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>theretofore granted and in favor of the city on its plea in reconvention for the sum of $2865.50.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-3\">\u201cThere being no statement of facts in the record, the findings of fact made by the trial judge must necessarily be adopted by this court as the facts proven on the trial.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">\u201cPlaintiff in error is a private corporation chartered by the laws of Texas and permitted by the ordinances of the city of Dallas to operate its line of railway on certain streets. In the ordinances granting that right, the street railway company was required to pay annually to the city certain fixed sums, designated in some of the ordinances as a franchise tax and in others as a bonus, and in others it is not given any specific name. The aggregate of the sums fixed in the ordinances amount to $2600 or $2700 annually. These sums were fixed regardless of the value of the property. It was also provided in the ordinances that all-policemen and firemen of the city, while on duty, should be carried free of charge, and plaintiff in error has also been compelled by the city to pave and repair the pavement on the streets on which its cars are operated, the expense for such work to plaintiff in error during the years 1898 and 1899 amounting to $8000. An ad valorem tax was levied on the property, of every description, of plaintiffs in error for the years 1898 and 1899, and it rendered for taxation all of its property, except the franchise, and the franchise was added to the list of property by the city assessor. The property rendered by plaintiff in error consisted of its real estate and all its tangible personal property. The contest in this case is over the sum of $2865 imposed by the city on what is denominated the \u2018franchise to operate and maintain lines of street railway\u2019 over certain streets.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The trial court held that plaintiff (the Dallas Consolidated Electric Street Railway Company) was liable for the tax, and dissolved the injunction. The Court of Civil Appeals reversed this judgment and rendered judgment for the plaintiff, making the injunction perpetual.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The leading question in the case is: Did the charter of the city of Dallas authorize the assessment of the franchise of a street railway company as a separate item in the rendition of its property for taxation? Construing our general laws in reference to the method of rendering the property of railroad companies for taxation for State purposes, we held in the case of The State v. Austin &amp; northwestern Railroad Company, 94 Texas, 530, that the franchise of a railroad was not assessable as a separate distinct entity from its physical property. But we neither held that such franchise was nonassessable, nor that, under the statutes then in question, its value was not to be estimated in determining the valuation of the property of the company for the purposes of taxation. Here we have a different question. The city of Dallas is incorporated by special law, and the question is, whether the charter of the city authorizes the tax upon the.company\u2019s franchise and its assessment as a separate item of property. The provisions of the charter which, we think, bear upon the question are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AER\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>\u201cSec. 118. The city council shall have power to levy and collect the ordinary municipal taxes upon the roadbed, rights, franchises, and all other property of street railroads of every kind, whether their motive power be steam, horse, mule, electricity, or otherwise.\u201d * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AomA\">\u201cSec. 134. The city council shall have power to assess the property and shares of corporations, companies, banks, and such other institutions as the same are now or may be assessed by the State law in such cases made and provided, and shall have full power to enforce the collection of such taxes in such manner as by said council may be deemed neeessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0c\">\u201cSec. 135. The city council shall have power by ordinance to regulate the manner and mode of making out tax lists, inventories, and appraisements of property therein, and to prescribe the oath that shall be administered to each person on rendition of his property, and prescribe how, when, and where property shall be rendered, and prescribe the numr ber and form of assessment rolls, and fix the duties and define the powers of city assessor, and adopt such measures as the council may deem advisable to secure the assessment of all property within the city limits, and collect the tax thereupon, and may provide a fine and imprisonment, or either, for all persons neglecting, failing, or refusing to render their property for taxation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-14\">It is clear that the part of section 118 just quoted authorizes a tax upon the franchise of a street railway company. If section 135 be detached from its context, it is equally clear, as we think, that its only proper construction should be that the city council were empowered to require the assessment of such franchise to be made either as a part of the tangible property of the corporation and to be estimated in assessing the value of the whole or to be separately assessed and valued as a distinct article of property. The language, \u201cto regulate the manner and mode of making out tax lists, inventories, and appraisements of property therein, * * * and prescribe how, when, and where property shall be rendered,\u201d of itself hardly admits of any other construction. But it is contended on behalf of the defendant in error that section 134 shows that such was not the meaning,\u2014that it makes manifest that the purpose was to require the assessment to be made in conformity to the law for assessing State taxes. If this contention could.be sustained, and if a street railway be real property and its franchise of a use of the streets a part of the realty, the present case should be determined by the ruling in the case of the State v. Austin &amp; Northwestern Railroad, supra. But we are of the opinion that such was not the purpose of the Legislature. The terms of the section literally construed are not mandatory. The language is, \u201cthe city council shall have the power to assess,\u201d etc., not that they shall assess. It has been held, however, that the word \u201cmay,\u201d which is ordinarily a word of permission and not of command, when used with reference to the functions of a public officer, may imply a duty and may make the law mandatory; and the thought suggests itself that the same rule should apply in a case like the present, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>where, instead of using the words \u201cshall\u201d or \u201cmay,\u201d the language is \u201cshall have the power to\u201d do a certain act. But if the rule be applicable in such a case, the construction must ultimately depend upon what was the intent of the Legislature as deducible from the nature and subject matter of the statute, its context and other laws referred to therein. That the section is not mandatory is shown by the next section (135), which, as w\u00e9 have seen, confers the power upon the council to prescribe the manner of rendering and assessing property for the purpose of taxation by the city. This is made the more apparent when we consider the statutes of the State then in force for assessing the property of certain corporations, together with the history of the legislation upon that subject. Under the Revised Statutes of 1879, the property of a corporation, as a general rule, was assessed in the name of the corporation and the corporation paid the taxes thereon in the same manner as an individual. Art. 4688. This applied to banking corporations. In 1885, presumably for the reason that such corporations were evading the law or had some undue advantage under it, the statute was amended as to companies incorporated for banking purposes and it was provided in effect that such corporations should rende! 'or taxation their real estate only and that the shareholders should re\u00ed ir their respective shares in the corporations and should pay the taxes \u00bfereon. The shareholder, in estimating the value of his shares for taxation, was allowed a proportionate deduction for the value of real estate rendered by such corporation itself. Laws 1885, p. 106. This law has ever since been continued in force. Rev. Stats. 1895, art. 5080. Besides, under the Revised Statutes of 1879, article 4684, every banker, broker, dealer in exchange, and stock jobber was required, in listing his property, to furnish a more specific statement as to its money, credits, and liabilities than was required of the ordinary taxpayer. The same law, with some amendments relating especially to national banks, exists to-day. Laws 1895, p. 37. In the light of these laws, let us carefully note the language of section 134. \u201cThe city council shall have power to assess the property and shares of corporations, companies, banks, and such other institutions as the same are or may be assessed by the State laws,\u201d etc. It being the general rule under the State law that a corporation should render for taxation and should pay the taxes upon all its property subject to taxation, and exception having been made in case of banking corporations requiring them to render only their real estate and -the shareholders to render their shares, it is evident that in conferring power upon the city council \u201cto assess the property and shares of corporations\u201d the Legislature had in mind the exception as to banking corporations and that it was their purpose to authorize the assessment of the shares of such corporations in the manner of assessments under the State law. The words \u201care or may be\u201d also indicate that it was the intention to confer the power to follow the State law in ease an exception should thereafter be made as to any other class of corporations. The mention of \u201cbanks and such other institutions\u201d (meaning, as we think, such 'other institutions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>\u25a0of a like character) also tends to show that the purpose was to authorize the council to require such institutions to make the same character of \u25a0statement as to their assets and liabilities as was required of such institutions under the statutes we have previously cited. The purpose of these statutes was not to confer special privileges upon banking corporations, bankers and the like, but was to impose duties upon them so as to prevent evasions of the law and to secure that equality and uniformity \u25a0of taxation which the Constitution enjoins. Hence, in our opinion, the Legislature, in enacting section 134 of the charter of the city, did not intend to make it obligatory but to grant a discretionary power. But we also think that the section does not apply to any other corporations, -except such as were made by the State law subject to especial requirements as to the mode of assessing their assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\">Our conclusion upon this branch of the case is that the city council Lad the power to require the franchise of a street railway company to be assessed separately from its tangible property.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">But it is insisted on behalf of defendant in error that since under ihe ordinances by which defendant in error acquired the right to operate its line over the streets of the city, it is required to pay an annual sum for the privilege, it can not be held liable to pay a tax for the franchise. In other words, the contention seems to be that the sums required to be paid annually are a franchise tax or are in lieu of such tax, and that the exaction of the tax now in question is double taxation. As to that matter, the findings of the trial court are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">\u201c2. Its (meaning the plaintiff's) right so to operate over the streets upon which its cars were being run in the years 1898 and 1899 was secured to it by its charter and by certain ordinances of the city of Dallas .and of the city of Bast Dallas, a municipal corporation which was annexed to the city of Dallas in the year 1889, each of said ordinances granting the right only as to the street or streets or parts of streets named in such ordinances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">\u201c3. By the terms of some of said ordinances, the street railway company is required to pay annually to the city a certain fixed sum of money for the privilege therein granted; and in some of these ordinances, the \u25a0fixed annual charge so imposed is called a franchise tax; in others it is -called a bonus, and in still others it is simply imposed without being called by any name, l't is not stipulated in any of these ordinances that ihe said annual charge therein imposed shall be in bar of nor in lieu of an ad valorem tax on plaintiff\u2019s property or any part thereof. The aggregate of these fixed annual charges is between $2600 and $2700 per annum.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">It is clear that the ordinances which simply impose the annual payment as a condition of the grant and those which call such payment a Bonus do not import a contract for exemption from- taxation of the franchises granted. As to those in which the annual payments are called a \u2022franchise tax, the construction is not so clear. But we hardly think that such designation of itself is sufficient to show such clear and unmis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>takable purpose to contract for an exemption from taxation as the authorities hold necessary to show a contract for such exemption. Railway v. Pennsylvania, <em>21 </em>Wall., 492. But we are not called upon to decide that question in this case. It was held by this court in the case of the City of Austin v. The Austin Gas Company, 69 Texas, 180, that in the absence of legislative authority, a city had no power either to exempt property from taxation or to contract for a commutation of taxes'legally assessable upon it. We have been referred to no provision in the charter of the city of Dallas or that of East Dallas which gives such authority, and we take it for granted that none exists. It would seem, however, that the fact that the defendant in error is required to pay a sum annually for the use of the street is an important matter to be considered in assessing the value of its franchise. It is evident that a franchise burdened with such an exaction is not as valuable as it would be-\u2022did no such burden exist. But the questidn of the correctness of the valuation is not before us'in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">But the point is also made that the assessment in this case is also illegal for the reason that, as the court finds, the franchises were not assessed in the name of the plaintiff company but in that of the companies to whose rights it has succeeded. But the defendant in error was the-appellant in the Court of Civil Appeals and failed to assign the ruling-upon that question in that court. Therefore, the error, if eror it were,, was waived and the question is not before us for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Eor the reasons given, we are of the opinion that the Judgment of the-Court of Civil Appeals should be reversed and that of the District Court should be affirmed, and it is accordingly so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\n<em>Reversed and judgment of District Court affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
