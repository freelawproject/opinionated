Phelps, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARF\">The Court of Civil Appeals erred, in sustaining the action of the court below in the admission of the testimony of the witness McGuffin,- who testified for the plaintiff in regard to the market value of said cattle at Caney, Kan., at the date of their receipt there, over the objection of appellant that the said witness had not qualified himself as knowing the market value of said cattle at Caney, Kan. To authorize one to testify to market value it must be first shown, if the question of competency is raised, that the witness himself knows the market value from personal knowledge of sales, or that he has investigated from people that know and have shown themselves to be competent, and a witness\u2019 statement that he testifies from his own knowledge does not qualify him. Railway v. Staton, 49 S. W. Rep., 277; Railway v. Wright, 21 S. W. Rep., 80; Railway v. Cocreham, 30 S. W. Rep., 1118; Railway v. Word, 21 S. W. Rep., 607; Lawson, Exp. and Op. Ev., 439, 440.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-10\">The Court of Civil Appeals erred in sustaining the lower court\u2019s .action in refusing to permit the testimony of plaintiff sought to be \u25a0drawn out on cross-examination, which was as follows: Plaintiff toeing on the. stand in his own behalf was asked by appellant what like \u25a0cattle as those shipped by him could have been bought for in the market at Sabinal at the time he purchased the cattle shipped by him out \u25a0of which shipment this suit grew; if he did not pay for said cattle the \u25a0sum of $20 per head; and if said cattle were not shipped by him at a \u25a0cost of $2 per head. Which was excluded on objection by appellee on the ground that the same was irrelevant, that he purchased said cattle at Sabinal, Texas,' just prior to their shipment at $20 per head, and kept them from April to August at a cost of 75 cents per head and \u25a0sold them at $30. When the question of market value at a certain point is in doubt, then an investigation as to the market value at adjacent points is proper; and on cross-examination of the party contesting the market value sought to be shown, an investigation into any fact .\u2022tending to throw light upon the real value of the cattle and at the point \u25a0where the value must be fixed is legitimate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Nearness of market is not measured necessarily by miles, but more properly by facilities of access. The market value of an animal at some point where there is no market value can be shown by fixing the market value of like animals at the point of shipment, and adding therto the cost of transportation to the terminal point where no market value has been fixed by sales.

Martin to testify to the entire contents of a bill of lading without accounting for its absence, over defendant\u2019s objection. Secondary evidence of the contents of a written instrument is only admissible when shown to be lost or destroyed, or when the paper is in the hands of the opposite party, after notice to produce has been given, and not complied with.

The 3 plaintiff recovered a judgment, which was affirmed in the Court of Civil Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The cattle were received by the Galveston, Harrisburg &amp; San Antonio Railway Company, destined to Caney, Kan., and were routed over the line of the receiving carrier to its connection with the San Antonio &amp; Aransas Pass Railroad, thence over the latter line to the defendant\u2019s road at Waco, thence over the defendant\u2019s road to its junction with the Missouri Pacific Railroad, and thence over the Missouri Pacific to their destination. The charges for the entire transportation were paid in advance to the initial carrier, and the fact that the freight had been paid was noted on the waybill which accompanied the shipment to Waco. There was some evidence tending to show unnecessary delay in transporting the cattle over the defendant\u2019s line. When the cattle reached Caney, Kan., they were not delivered, for the reason that it did not appear to the agent of the Missouri Pacific company at that station that the freight had been paid. They were placed in muddy stock pens and held for about thirty hours, by reason of which they were deteriorated in value.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>During the progress of the trial, the deposition of one Martin, the-local agent of the San Antonio &amp; Aransas Pass Railway Company, was offered in evidence, in which, \u201chaving been asked to attach the contract or waybill upon which the cattle were shipped,\u201d he testified: \u201cThat-said cattle came into the possession of the San Antonio &amp; Aransas Pass-Railway Company on a bill of lading issued by the Galveston, Harrisburg &amp; San Antonio Railway at Sabinal, Texas, in which said bill of lading the said cattle were contracted to be delivered at Waco, Texas. That the bill of lading had not been issued beyond that point for the reason that the Galveston, Harrisburg <em>&amp; </em>San Antonio .Railway Company did not have through billing arrangements with the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway Company beyond Waco.\u201d The defendant, by counsel, objected to the testimony on the ground \u201cthat said bill of lading was th\u00e9 best evidence of the terms of the contract upon which the cattle were shipped from Sabinal'to Waco and its absence was not sufficiently accounted for to authorize secondary proof of its contents.\u201d The objection was overruled and the testimony admitted. In this we think there was no error. The statement of facts shows that-the witness was asked to attach the papers to the deposition and that\" he declined to do so, for the reason that the rules of the company did not permit it. It is to be inferred from his deposition that the witness was, at the time of its taking, agent of the San Antonio &amp; AransasPass Railroad Company at Waco, and that his deposition was taken in McLennan County. At all events, it does not appear that he resided in Caldwell County, in which the case was tried, and, in the absence of proof, we should have to assume, in support of the court\u2019s ruling, that such fact did not exist. The point therefore falls within the rule laid down in the case of Sayles v. Bradley, <em>92 </em>Texas, 406, in which, under similar circumstances, it was held that secondary evidence of the contents of a writing was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The question of the admissibility of the testimony of De Witt, the agent of the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, at Caney, Kan., is a more difficult one. His deposition was taken and offered in evidence, and, as shown by the bill of exceptions, contained the following testimony: \u201cThat said cattle reached their destination at Caney, Kan., upon a bill of lading issued by the Missouri, Kansas <em>&amp; </em>Texas Railway Company of Texas at Waco, Texas, or that said bill of lading showed that no freight had been prepaid, and that there was due upon said cattle the entire freight from Sabinal, Texas, to Caney, Kan.\u201d The statement of facts shows that the witness testified as to the contents of the waybill and not of the bill of lading, but we think this discrepancy unimportant. The testimony was objected to on the ground \u201cthat the same was hearsay and would be permitting the witness to testify to the contents of a written instrument without first properly accounting for the nonproduction of said instrument.\u201d The objection was overruled and the answers read. The testimony was clearly not hearsay. In this instance, however, it does not appear that any effort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>was made to procure the original paper or that the witness was asked to attach it to his answers. There are two lines of decisions upon the question of the admission of secondary evidence as to the contents of a written instrument when it is beyond the jurisdiction of the court. In some of the courts, it is held that it must be shown that some effort has been made to procure the original, but the weight of authority \u25a0seems to be that such showing is not necessary. Young v. Railway, 80 Ala., 100; Bozeman v. Browning, 31 Ark., 364; Kleeberg v. Schrader (Minn.), 72 N. W. Rep., 59; Manning v. Maroney, 87 Ala., 563; Waller v. Cralle, 8 Mon., 11; Shepard v. Giddings, 22 Conn., 282; Otto v. Trump, 115 Pa., 425; Zellerbach v. Allenberg, 99 Cal., 57; Bowden v. Achor, 95 Ga., 243. The showing, if any, must be made to the trial judge, and we are of opinion that where the circumstances are such as to indicate that an effort to procure the original writing would be unavailing no proof o'f such effort is necessary. No good reason is seen for requiring a party to do a futile thing. The writing in this case was in the possession of officers of the Missouri Pacific Railway Company and was a voucher, useful in keeping their accounts, 'and it seems to us that it was not at all probable that they would have consented to part with its possession. Clearly the witness, if he still had it in his possession, was not authorized to yield it up. We conclude that the court did not err in admitting the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">One McGuffin, a witness for the plaintiff, was permitted to testify, over the objection of the defendant, that the value of the cattle on the day of their arrival at Caney was $25 per head, and that on the day after they were worth only $22.50. The objection was urged, after, in response to a question by defendant's counsel, he had answered in effect, that he only knew the market value at that place by reason of the facts that on the day of their arrival \u201ca fellow asked him if they could be bought for $25 per head, and that on the next day the same party told him he would give $22.50 for said cattle.\u201d We think that these facts were not sufficient to justify the court in admitting in evidence this opinion of the witness as to the value of the cattle, and that .it was error not to exclude the testimony. But the effect of the evidence was merely to show the deterioration in value of the cattle by reason of their detention in the pens, and there were two other witnesses who testified without objection upon the same point,\u2014each of whom testified to as much or a greater depreciation in value from the \u2022same cause as did McGuffin. There was no other testimony upon the point. The testimony of this witness was merely corroborative of that of the others, each of whom testified that the cattle were depreciated by the detention $3 or $4 per head. The verdict of the jury itemized the damages awarded by them and allowed only $1.50 per head on this account. It is apparent, therefore, as we think, that the \u2022admission of the testimony could not have influenced the verdict to the prejudice of the defendant and that therefore it was harmless. There \u2022 was no error in refusing to admit testimony as to the price which plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>tiff paid for the cattle at Sabinal, or as to what they cost him delivered at Caney. This was an immaterial matter. His damage was the aamp no matter what they may have cost him.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Finding no error in the proceedings for which the judgment should be reversed, the judgment of the trial court and that of the Court of Civil Appeals are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
