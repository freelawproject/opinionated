Instead of delivering the message to Percy Cobb, it was promptly delivered to the clerk of the Brown Hotel, where he roomed and boarded. The evidence, however, failed to show that it was the custom of its clerk to receive telegrams for the hotel guests, and the evidence affirmatively showed that Percy Cobb had not in fact given said hotel clerk any such authority unless it was conferred by his taking lodging and board at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>hotel. Unless the delivery to the clerk was a sufficient delivery, the company was undoubtedly guilty of negligence and liable in damages for the injury sustained, but if the delivery to the hotel clerk was a sufficient compliance with its contract, appellee was not entitled to recover.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">\u201cError is assigned to the court\u2019s refusal to give the following instruction at the request of appellant: Tf you find and believe from the evidence that the defendant\u2019s messenger boy, upon the receipt of the message in question in this case, delivered the same to the clerk of the Brown Hotel where Percy Cobb, the addressee of said message, roomed and boarded, then you are instructed that such delivery was a full and \u2022complete discharge of the defendant\u2019s duty in reference to the delivery \u25a0of said message, and you will find for the defendant.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">\u201cUnless there was error in refusing this charge, the judgment must be affirmed, and we deem it advisable, in response to request of counsel \u25a0for appellant, to certify the material question thus raised,\u2014that is, whether a hotel clerk has implied authority from the guests of the hotel to receive telegrams for them, and whether the court erred in refusing \"to so charge in the absence of evidence showing the custom of the Brown Hotel, or hotels generally, in this respect. In this connection, we refer \"to the case of Western Union Telegraph Company v. Trissell, 98 Indiana, 556.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">The question presented is whether or not the mere relation of hotel keeper and lodger and boarder creates, in law, an authority in the former or his clerk to receive telegrams addressed to the latter. It must be answered in the negative. Since there is no evidence stated from which it might be inferred as a fact that Cobb had constituted the clerk of the hotel his agent or servant for such purposes, there is nothing to be considered but the fact that he boarded and lodged at the hotel. If such \u25a0an authority arose from that fact alone, it could only be because the performance of such services by the keeper of the hotel was among the duties imposed on him by law towards those so boarding with him. Should it be assumed that the full relation of innkeeper and guest existed (which does not appear), and that all of the duties arising from it rested on the keeper of this hotel, we know of no authority that would include among them that of receiving and assuming the responsibility \u2022of safely delivering telegrams. We can see no reason why such a duty would exist, if not voluntarily assumed, any more than that of receiving other notices or of transacting other business for the boarder.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
