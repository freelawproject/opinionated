Rev. Stats., art.. 3312; Railway v. Rucker, 59 Texas, 587; Railway v. Daniels, 62 Texas, 70.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-18\">The averments in appellant\u2019s second amended petition show said shops, to be a part of the equipment of said appellee\u2019s railway, and that said shops and railway were subject to the lien claimed by the appellant, which averments made an issue of fact which the court could not determine on demurrer, and therefore erred in sustaining appellee\u2019s general demurrer to appellant\u2019s second amended petition and rendering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>judgment against appellant. Same authorities; also People v. Railway, 45 N. E. Rep., 826; Rubey v. Coal Co., 21 Mo. App., 159.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-4\">The averments in appellant\u2019s second amended petition showed that the claim for money set out in said petition was for work and labor done by the parties to whom said due bills were issued, described in exhibit \u201cA\u201d referred to in its petition, for the appellee railway company, and is a lien on the railroad and its equipment, and therefore the court erred in sustaining the demurrer of appellee to said second amended petition and rendering judgment against appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-6\">The court erred in sustaining the general demurrer to plaintiff\u2019s petition because it appeared from the averments of said petition that plaintiff had a lien under article 3294 of the Revised Statutes securing the indebtedness declared on, said lien existing notwithstanding there is no averment that any steps had been taken to secure it other than the bringing of this suit.

Brown, 30 S. W. Rep., 936; Bassett v. Mills, 89 Texas, 162; Trammel v. Mount, 68 Texas, 213; Wilson v. Bank, 103 U. S., 770.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-9\">We think that our contention, that under article 3312 the species of railway property on which plaintiff claims lien is included, is more consistent with the liberal rule of construction recognized in the authorities above cited. In other words we think that, applying the proper rule of construction, the words \u201cany railroad, locomotive, car, or other equipment of a railroad\u201d include roundhouses and machine shops, especially when it is shown, as in this case, that roundhouses and machine shops are necessary in the operation of the railroad, and are so intimately connected with it that they are useless for any purpose except for railroad purposes, and when they are situated upon land which has in fact become a part of the right of way of the railroad company. Our statute on the subject of taxation, article 5082, Revised Statutes, subdivision 2, says: \u201cRailroad shall include right of way, roadbed, superstructure, depots, and grounds upon which said depots are situated, and all shops and fixtures of every kind used in operating said road.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-11\">Webster says that the term railroad includes the road, tracks, etc., with all the lands, buildings, rolling stock, etc., pertaining to them and consisting of one property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-12\">In the Century Dictionary and Encyclopedia it is said that, in common and accepted usage, the meaning of the term railroad and railway have been extended to include not only the permanent way, but every thing necessary to its operation, as rolling stock and buildings, including stations, roundhouses, locomotives, locomotive shops, car shops, and repair shops.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-13\">In the case of Railway v. United States, 93 United States, 442, the Supreme Court says: \u201cLord Chancellor Cottenham, in the case of Cother v. Railway, 2 Phillips, 473, said: \u2018The term railway, by itself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>includes all works\" authorized\" to be constructed, and, for the purpose of constructing the railway, the company are authorized to construct such stations and other works as they may think proper/ 1 Bedf. on Bail-ways, see. 105. The 'works\u2019 referred to by the lord chancellor were those permanent and immovable appendages which constitute parts of the completed structure.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-5\">In the case of St. John v. Railway, 22 Wallace, 138, the Supreme Court says in passing upon the question as to what was meant by net earnings of the road: ''Upon what ground can it be claimed that the category 'net earnings of the road\u2019 was not intended to embrace the net earnings of all the business of the company for the time being, whether done upon one or\"many roads?\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-6\">In the case of Railway v. Williams, 54 Pennsylvania State, 107, the court says in construing an act authorizing a company to construct and locate \"a railroad: \u201cThis grant of power unquestionably carries with it the power to construct turnouts, sidings, stations, and engine houses, and all the works and appendages usual in the convenient operation of a railway.\u201d A railway without switches, sidings, turnouts, and buildings for coal, water, engines, stations, etc., would be useless in a great measure. They are essential to the operation of the road and the transportation of freight and passengers with security and dispatch.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-7\">In the case of the United States v. Chaplin, 31 Federal Reporter, 895, the court says: \u201cIn common parlance a railway consists of 'the road\u2019 and the 'rolling stock.\u2019 The former includes everything that is immovable or affixed to the soil\u2014such as station houses, roundhouses, platforms, watertanlcs; and machine shops. The road can not be operated without these, or considered constructed until they are built.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-8\">In Boisot on Mechanic\u2019s Lien, section 191, it is said: \u201cWhether depots and buildings erected and used by a railroad company are to be treated as other buildings, or as a part of the road, is a question on which the authorities \u00e1re not entirely harmonious. The prevailing view, however, is to treat them as a part of the road so that a lien for work done on them would extend over the road as an entirety.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b196-10\"><em>Crane &amp; Greer, </em>for defendant in error Moss; <em>Adams &amp; Truelove, </em>for defendants in error James, Capps, and Carter; <em>J.

The substance of the plaintiff\u2019s allegations, in so far as a lien is sought to be established, is that the Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Railway Company contracted with Evans &amp; Hoshour for the latter to build for it, in the town of Cleburne, certain machine shop, work shop, paint shop and <em>boiler </em>house, chimney and pattern house, and also to build in the town of Temple a round house or boiler house, said structures to be erected on land belonging to said company which adjoins the right of way and \u2018is a part of same\u2019 and connected with said right of way by \u2018numerous switches, turnouts and side tracks, and said switches, turnouts and side tracks are used in connection with the business and operations of the said railway company and are necessary to the conduct of said business of said company in the operation pf its said line of road, and they extend from the main line into and upon said strip of land aforesaid, which, as aforesaid, had been added to the right of way.\u2019 That said structures are a part of said railway and inseparably connected therewith, \u2018and are used for and in connection with the operation of said railway and are bnilt upon and over a portion of its said tracks, switches and turnouts, and are a part of said works and are used for no other purpose than of operating said railway, and are useless for any other purpose, and are such works as are necessary, usual, and common in the operation of railroads.\u2019 That the contractors, Evans &amp; Hoshour, employed a large number of laborers and mechanics to labor and work for them in the construction of said structures, and that for the value of the labor performed by them, the contractors issued to them due bills or pay checks which were transferred to plaintiff for a valuable consideration, etc. Plaintiff sues to recover of the contractors on the due bills or pay checks outstanding, and to foreclose an alleged lien on the property of the company, which is claimed by virtue of the work and labor performed on said structures. Ho lien is claimed by plaintiff to have been fixed by the filing of a contract or itemized statement as required by the Act of 1895, articles 3294 et seq., Revised Statutes, but is claimed to have been fixed by filing suit within twelve months after the labor was performed, as-provided by article 3313, Revised Statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">\u201cThe allegations of the two lumber companies (which are adopted by plaintiff as to liability of the sureties on bond), seeking to recover on the contractors\u2019 bond executed to the railway company, set forth, in substance, the furnishing of material to the contractors, etc., the execution of the contract and bond, and the provisions thereof. The effect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>contract alleged was that the contractors would construct the buildings for a specified consideration and deliver the same to the company Tree and discharged of all liens, claims, or charges whatever, completely finished on or before the first day of November, 1898.\u2019 The stipulations of the bond pertinent to the issues herein are as follows: \u2018And whereas, in the treaty of said contract, it was agreed that this bond or obligation should be entered into as an additional security to the said Gulf, Colorado <em>&amp; </em>Santa Fe Railway Company for the due performance of said articles of agreement and of all and every the covenants, matters and things therein contained on the part and behalf of the said above bounden E.

Such corporation shall have the right to erect and maintain all necessary and convenient buildings and stations, fixtures and machinery for the accommodation and use of passengers, freights, and business interests, or which may be necessary for the construction or operation of its railway; but no railway shall have the power, either by its own employes or other persons, to construct any buildings along the line of their railroad to be occupied by their employes or others, except at their respective depot stations and section houses, and at such places only such building as may be necessary for the transaction of their legitimate business operations, and for shelter of their employes, nor shall they use, occupy, or cultivate any part of the right of way over which their respective roads may pass, with the exception aforesaid, for any other purpose than the construction and keeping in repair of their respective railways.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The power to construct roads in this State between any points, and to erect upon the right of way all buildings, machinery, and other things .necessary for the \u201caccommodation and use of passengers or business interests, or for the construction and operation of its railway,\u201d together <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>with the \u201cright to lay out its road not exceeding two hundred feet in width, and to construct the sam%\u201d recognizes the right of way as the Toad and operates as a designation of that right of way and structures upon it as the \u201croad\u201d or \u201crailroad\u201d of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">We have given careful consideration to the authorities cited by the honorable Court of Civil Appeals in support of its judgment upon this point, but we find no one of them that involved a state of facts similar to this case, and the broad declarations appropriate in those cases can not be accepted as authority in this.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">We conclude that the term \u201crailroad,\u201d as used in article 3312, is confined to the limits of the right of way of such railroads. We think that this construction is supported by the fact that all claims for construction of every other class of buildings or improvements of any character whatever were, at the passage of this act and are now, amply secured by the terms of article 3294 of the Revised Statutes, and the terms of the two articles do not indicate that the Legislature intended that either of them should cover both subjects of legislation, but they are so framed as to show that each is restricted in the main to the subject indicated by the section of the Constitution under which the law was framed.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">We are not prepared to hold that the railroad company might not have required of the contractors a bond binding them and sureties to pay all debts contracted with persons for labor, material or other things necessary to the performance of the contract, whether the claims might .be asserted against the railroad company\u2019s property as a lien or not; and that under such a contract, if it had been made, the materialmen and the laborers might sustain an action against the contractors and their sureties upon the bond. The terms of the contract involved in Jordan v. Eavanaugh, 63 Iowa, 157, were much more specific than in this case. But we find in the bond under consideration no provision which will justify such interpretation. The only support for that construction is ithe following language: \u201cNow, the condition of this obligation is such that if the above bounden E. B. Evans and 0. A. Hoshour shall well and \u25a0faithfully pay all laborers, mechanics, materialmen, and persons who supply such contractors with provisions or goods of any kind, all just .debts due to such persons or to any person to whom any part of such work is given, incurred in carrying on such work agreed to be done and performed by the said above bounden E. B. Evans and C. A. Hoshour.\u201d There is not in this clause any promise by Evans and Hoshour to pay those persons who might contract with them during the progress of the work; it is simply the expression of a condition upon which their liability to the railroad company is defined and for a breach of which they would be liable to the company itself. Standing alone, the clause would \u2022not support the claim. The character of the instrument as a bond of indemnity to the railroad company is clearly established by the language which precedes that clause, which is, in substance, that the bond is intended and given as additional security to the railroad company for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>performance of the contract, and by the clause which immediately follows that relied upon, viz: \u201cAnd also shall well and truly save and keep harmless the said Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Eailway Company from the payment of any and all liens, claims, demands, costs, suits, judgments, and executions that may be made, taken, rendered, had, or obtained against the said Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Eailway Company, or its property, by reason of the nonpayment of any of the debts, claims, or demands of any of the several parties hereinbefore mentioned and provided, and shall duly perform and observe all the stipulations and agreements contained in said contract and on his part to be performed. * * * then this obligation shall be null and void; otherwise, to be in full force and virtue.\u201d If there were doubt as to the meaning of the language first quoted, it is surely dispelled by the full expression of intention contained in the context of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">No liability of the railroad to plaintiffs nor lien upon its property being shown, there has been no breach, therefore no right of action upon the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">We therefore answer the first question, that the liens which the parties to this suit might have asserted against the railroad company are provided for in article 3294, Eevised Statutes, and are not included in article 3312.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">The instrument submitted is an indemnity bond to the railroad company and does not give a right of action to the laborers and material-men against the sureties upon the bond.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
