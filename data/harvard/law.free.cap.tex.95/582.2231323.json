The record imports verity and can not be attacked in this collateral proceeding. Cannon v. Hemphill, <em>7 </em>Texas, 184; Wright v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 3; Freem. on Judg., sec. 50e; Crim v.

A minute not so signed nor in any way established can import no verity and does not show that it has ever received judicial sanction, and the entry does not indicate what land was to be sold. All this must appear in the record for the purpose of giving the judgment a specific operation and effect. Hart. Dig., art. 316.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b601-6\">If the signature of the judge to the minutes can be dispensed with, if the mere writing in a book for which no one appears to be responsible can take the place of a record, duly signed and approved, and become of equal force, then why did the Legislature say they should be approved and signed by the judge ? If it be a mere irregularity and imports verity, then why is the language used that they shall be signed by the judge ? Not only is the approval and the signature of the judge wanting, but the petition and the purported order taken together describe nothing and leave it to conjecture as to what in fact was done or what was intended to be done, if anything. Who vouches for the judge? Where is the attestation of the clerk who wrote the pretended order? Where is the evidence that the book offered in evidence was ever a probate record of Red River County? Without some of these earmarks of identification, how could the trial court know that the book was a probate minute book, that the orders were made and the land was the land described in plaintiff\u2019s second amended petition? And how can this court know these things?</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b601-7\">BROWN, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Aoz\">Court of Civil Appeals of the Third Supreme Judicial District has certified to this court the following statement and question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">\u201cThere is now pending in this court cause No. 2792, styled P. T. Norwood v. W. K. Snell et al., an action of trespass to try title by the appellant against the appellees. Judgment of the trial court was in favor of the appellees, defendants below. Appellant deraigned title through the administration of the estate of one R. C. Hemmingway, whereof John H. Caudle was administrator, formerly pending in the District Court of Red River County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-9\">\u201cPlaintiff offered in evidence so much of the probate records of the February term, 1868, of the County Court of Red River County as tended to show an order of the court to sell the land in controversy. Preceding this order was an application and petition for the sale of the land in controversy. The order offered in evidence is as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-10\">\u201c \u2018February Term, 1868, W. M. Harrison v. The Estate of R. C. Hemmingway, deceased.

And further, no application by the administration was shown to sell said land, but the order was made on application of a creditor, without requiring the administrator t\u00f3 show cause -why he should not. apply for said order; which objections were by the court sustained and said \u2022order of sale was excluded, to which ruling of the court the 'plaintiff then and there excepted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">' \u201cAppellant also offered in evidence so much of the probate records as show an order entered at the June term, 1868, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">\u201c \u2018J.

And further, that the minutes of that term '\u25a0of the court were not signed and approved by the presiding judge, and no \u25a0evidence was introduced to prove the authenticity of said order; which objections were by the court sustained, and said order of sale excluded, \u2022to which ruling of the court the plaintiff excepted, and tendered his bill \u2022of exception, which bills of exception in both instances above stated were approved by the trial court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-10\">\u201cThese orders were necessary to be established by plaintiff as part of his evidence of title, and this court has concluded that the trial court erred in not admitting these orders in evidence, unless the ruling of the court below can be sustained oh the ground that the orders were not admissible because the judge of the court before whom they were rendered :did not sign and approve the minutes of the court that contained these \u25a0 orders.

Each county court shall cause to be procured and kept in the clerk\u2019s office, suitable books, in which it shall be the duty of the clerk to record all the proceedings of each term of the court; which record shall be read over and signed by the chief justice or the member of the court presiding, at the end of each term; and the clerk shall also record all the proceedings of such court that are authorized to take place in the vacations between the terms; and such records shall be read over on the first day of the term of the proper court next after such proceedings took place, and shall be signed by the chief justice, or member of the court presiding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-9\">\"Art. 1383.

Black on Judg., sec. 109; Bartlett v. Lang, 2 Ala., 161; Rollins v. Henry, 78 N. C., 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">The Court of Criminal Appeals in our State has adopted the view expressed by the latter decisions. Lockhart v. State, 32 Texas Crim. Rep., 149; Wright v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">We are of opinion that the decisions which hold the law to be directory are supported by the better reason. We can see no sound reason for the rule which makes the failure of a judge to perform such a duly fatal to the judgments and orders actually pronounced and entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
