Held, that the statute requiring notice before forfeiture applied to the payment of the extension note as well as to that of the original premium for which it was given, and a forfeiture for nonpayment of the note, declared without having given such notice, was inoperative.

That, the statutes does not by express terms apply to notes given in settlement of past due premiums whereby the parties contracted that the policy shall be extended conditionally, the condition being that the note shall be. paid upon maturity. <em>2. </em>That if the statute applies it must result from a particular construction of the statute and in determining the construction placed upon the statute by the New York courts, we contend (1) that the burden is on Mrs. English to show any construction by the New York courts changing the plain import and language of the statute, which-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>burden has not been discharged in this case; and (2) that in the absence of such a showing in the record, this court will do one of two things: (a) Follow the plain language of the statute; or (b) look to the New York court\u2019s decisions as advisory and give to the statute the construction given it by the New York courts, unless such construction is palpably wrong.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-5\">In presenting these contentions we submit the following propositions:</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-6\">First Proposition. The policy in express terms conditionally bound the company to pay to Mrs. English $3000 in installments upon the death -of William E. English, the conditions expressed being: (1) As shown in the third stipulation that the sum of $72.30 should be paid in advance on the 5th day of April of each year after the delivery of the policy with a grace of one month; and (2) that the policy should lapse and be no longer in force after the premium remained unpaid for thirty days after its maturity, as is shown by the following language: \u201cIf any premium is not paid on or before the day when due, this policy shall become void and all payments previously made shall remain the property of the company.\u201d The- obligation of the company to pay this insurance under this policy, therefore, never became absolute upon the death of English, because the premium due April 5, 1900, has never been paid and by its terms the policy was no longer in force after default in the payment of this premium.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-9\">Second Proposition. Under the New York statute, which is a part of the contract of insurance, the policy could not be forfeited for the failure to pay the premium maturing April 5, 1900, without the notice required by that statute; but this notice was given and the requirements of the law complied with; hence, under the terms of the contract of insurance, the policy would have ceased to be in force after May 5, 1900, the premium being then unpaid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-10\">Third Proposition. The company and the insured so construed the contract of insurance, and began negotiations to prevent its lapse on May 5, 1900. These negotiations resulted in a new contract conditionally continuing the policy for another year, the condition being that the policy should remain in force for another year if the note given in part payment of the premium should be paid at maturity; but if the note should not be paid when due, it was specifically agreed between the assured and the company that the policy should then cease to be in force, \u25a0and all claims to insurance and to the premiums paid were immediately \u2022to cease and be forfeited to the company, as is evidenced by the language in the note: \u201cThis note is given in part payment of the premium \u25a04-5-1900 on the above policy, with the understanding that all claims to further insurance and all benefits whatever which full payment in cash \u25a0of said premium would have secured shall become immediately void and forfeited to the New York Life Insurance Company if this note is not paid at maturity;\u201d and the language of the receipt, which, after \u25a0acknowledging the payment of some money and the execution of the .note, recites: \u201cWhich continues said policy in force until the 5th day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>\u25a0of April, A. D. 1901, at noon, in accordance with, its terms and conditions, provided the above note is paid at maturity.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-3\">Under the terms of this new contract the lapse of the policy was suspended until the maturity of the note, but the obligation of the company to pay this insurance never became absolute upon the death of English, because the premium note due October 5, 1900, was not paid and the policy was thereafter no longer in force under the express provisions of the renewal contract. This contract was valid and a complete defense to Mr. English\u2019s action on the policy unless the Hew York statute required notice to be given of the maturity of the note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-4\">Fourth Proposition- The \u00a1\u00a1New York statute invoked by Mrs. English to annul the renewal or last contract and prevent its terms from defeating her recovery does not apply. That statute by express terms is limited to premiums maturing at a fixed date in the face of the policy as is shown by its language: \u201c\u00a1\u00a1No insurance corporation doing business in this State shall, within one year after the default in payment of any premium, installment of interest, declare forfeited or lapsed any policy hereafter issued or renewed. * * * \u00a1\u00a1Nor shall such policy be forfeited or lapsed by reason of nonpayment of any premium, interest or installment, or any portion thereof, required by the terms of the policy to be paid, within one year from the failure to pay said premium, interest or installment, unless a written or printed notice stating the amount of snch premium, interest or installment or portion thereof due on such policy, * * * shall have been duly addressed and mailed * * * at least fifteen and not more than forty-five days prior to the day when the same is payable. * * * If the payment demanded by such notice shall . be made within its time limited therefor, it shall be taken to be in full compliance with the requirements of the policy in respect to the time of such payment.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-8\">This deals with premiums, interest and installments required to be paid by the policy; it does not deal with a. note given for a premium maturing by the terms of the policy on a fixed day and in settlement of that premium; nor is it declared that this supplemental contract providing for the lapse of the policy for failure to pay the note shall be void unless a notice is given of the maturity of the note. The statute deals with the policy and payments required by its terms at fixed dates, whether in their entirety or in installments or portions thereof, not with additional contracts made with reference to past due premiums settled by note extending its time of payment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-9\">Fifth Proposition. If in construing this statute the courts of \u00a1\u00a1New York have extended its requirements so that notice must be given of the maturity of notes given in settlement of premiums past due, then the burden is upon Mrs. English asserting this particular construction, to allege and prove the \u00a1\u00a1New York decisions so extending the statute, and this she has not discharged, and can not therefore avail herself of any construction of the statute not within its plain import and language.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-10\">Sixth Proposition. In the absence of pleading or proof of a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>construction of the Yew York statute by the courts of that State, this court will limit the statute to its plain meaning or look to the decisions of the courts of last resort in Yew York State as advisory and persuasive in construing the Yew York statute, and if this is done it will be found that those courts hold that the statute in question does not apply to cases like this and hold that no notice is required to forfeit under the renewal or additional contract, stipulating that the policy shall lapse for failure to pay a note given for past due premiums.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-3\">We have cited the Yew York authorities in our brief in this case. They are: Conway v. Insurance Co., 140 N. Y., 80; Holly v. Insurance Co., 105 N. Y., 441; Banholzer v. Insurance Co., 77 N. W. Rep., 295; Forbes v. Insurance Co., 51 N. E. Rep., 84.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-4\">It is therefore apparent that the appellee in this case invoked the Yew York law to defeat the terms of the contract of insurance providing for the lapse of this policy by reason of the failure to pay the note given for the past due premium, which note matured oh October 5, 1900.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-5\">The statute does not by express terms require notice to be given of the maturity of the note in question, and she therefore asked the court to construe the statute so as to extend this requirement to the maturity of notes and additional or supplemental renewal contracts, as well as to premiums primarily maturing under the terms of the policy. In other words, the statute deals with the policy and the premiums required to be paid by it. The appellee asks to apply that statute to supplemental or additional contracts and to notes given in settlement of premiums required to be paid by the policy. She asks this strained construction of the statute without referring to the construction given the statute by the Yew York -courts, and so far as this certificate is concerned the court will have to look to those decisions as advisory or persuasive in determining what construction it will give the Yew York statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-6\">The appellee evidently bases her hope of recovery in this case upon Judge Hunter\u2019s decision in the case of New York Life Insurance Company v. Orlopp, 61 S. W. Rep., 339. That case is not a. parallel case to the one at bar by any means.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b412-7\"><em>F. Vandervoort, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Alu\">The notice given by appellant of the maturing of the premium of April 5, 1900, is fatally defective, because it states that if such premium shall not be paid by or before the day it falls due, the policy will become forfeited, with an exception not applicable to this case, and the policy itself substantially states that such forfeiture can not occur until thirty days thereafter, and the statute does not allow such forfeiture until thirty days notice has been given. Insurance Co. v. Dingley, 93 Fed. Rep., 153.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-8\">Appellant, after the maturity of the April 5, 1900, premium, accepted of the insured the $18.10 in cash and his note for. $54.20, and thereby waived any forfeiture of said policy and canceled the effect of the notice given him of the due date of said premium. Insurance Co. v. Smith, 41 S. W. Rep., 683.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>The acceptance of the note and cash for the premium of April 5, 1900, by appellant did not constitute a lapsing of the policy or its being forfeited by the company without other statutory notice to the insured, because said note was given for a portion of said premium, and the Eew York statute requires such notice to be given of the due date of a portion as well as of a whole premium. Insurance Co. v. Orlopp, 61 S. W. Rep., 336; Strauss v. Insurance Co., 67 N. Y. Supp., 509; Banholzer v. Insurance Co., 77 N. W. Rep., 295, and 78 N. W. Rep., 244; Conway v. Insurance Co., 140 N. Y., 79.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-5\">It must be assumed that the money represented by the note is a \u201cportion\u201d of the-April 5, 1900, premium; otherwise, if the note be considered a payment, it and the cash would have paid the premium in full, and consequently the policy would have been fully paid up to April 5,1901, or long after the death of the insured.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-6\">In Conway v. Insurance Company, a note was given for an entire premium, but the authority of the agent to take such note was questioned. The'court held that the statute requiring notice did not apply to that case, but there is nothing to show how the court would have held had the taking of the note been authorized.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-7\">In Banholzer v. Insurance Company, it was held that the statutory notice of the due date of a note given in part payment of a premium need not be given (against the judgment of four of the five members of the court, and on a rehearing one of the members handed down a vigorous dissenting opinion). The court so held on authority of the Conway case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-8\">In Insurance Company v. Orlopp, it is plainly held that the statutory notice of the due date of a premium note must be given to entitle the Insurance Company to the benefits of a forfeiture. The Conway case is discussed and not considered satisfactory.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-9\">And finally, in Strauss v. Insurance Co., the Eew York Supreme Court has held that such notice must be given. A note in that case had been given for a part of a premium, and contained a forfeiture clause if not paid at maturity. The court held it was ineffective and could be given no greater force than in the policy itself, because the statute limits the operation of such agreements of forfeiture so that they can only take effect after the prescribed notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-10\">The appellee is the beneficiary in said policy, and has a vested interest therein. She did not sign the note, and the \"forfeiture clause is not binding on her except as controlled by the provisions of the policy and statute. Buxer v. Insurance Co., 49 Law. Rep.

Orlopp, 61 South<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>western Reporter, 336, rested upon the same state of facts in every material particular as appear from the certificate in this case, and the Court of Civil Appeals held in that case that the same law which is set out in the certificate applied to a note given under similar circumstances and in the same language, except dates, amounts, and number of policy, and the words \u201cwithout grace,\u201d which do not appear in the note in that case. The Yew York Life Insurance Company applied to this court for a writ of error, which was refused. The sole ground upon which the application rested was <em>that </em>the court erred in holding that the law of Yew York, which is now under investigation, required the insurance company to give the notice therein specified upon the failure of the insured to pay the note given for a part of the premium as in this case. The refusal of the application necessarily involved the concurrence of this court in the decision in that case in which Justice Hunter ably and elaborately discussed the whole question, and we shall not extend this discussion beyond what is necessary to express tersely our reasons for the answer given to the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The statute of Yew York is properly before us by pleading and proof on the part of the appellee, and we will construe it as if it were a domestic statute, looking to the decisions of the State of Yew York for such light as they may throw upon the question.. This, in substance, is the proposition submitted in the argument of the counsel for appellant, and we think correctly states the duty of this court in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">When the premium upon the policy, $72.30, fell due on April 5, 1900, the agent of the company in Texas very kindly proposed to English, \u201cIf you will send me one-half or even one-fourth of the amount of the premium, I will extend the balance for six months.\u201d English paid $18.10 on the premium and gave his note for the balance, $54.20, which recited that it was given in part payment of the premium, \u201cwith the understanding that all claims to further insurance and all benefits whatever which full payment in cash of said premium would have secured shall become immediately void and forfeited to the Yew York Life Insurance Company if this note is not paid at maturity, except as otherwise provided in the policy itself.\u201d The renewal receipt provided that if the note was paid at maturity the policy would be continued in force until April 5, 1901. We have grouped these facts as a basis for the proposition that the $54.20 expressed in the note was and continued to be \u201ca portion\u201d of the premium which became due April 5, 1900. The agent understood that payment of a portion of the premium was postponed. English accepted the proposition and acted upon it, and the future life of the policy was made to depend upon the payment of the note. By the payment the benefits of the policy would be secured as if paid when first due and failure would cause just such loss under the policy as would have resulted if the note had not been given. We think that there can be no doubt on the question that the $54.20 embraced in the note was a part of the premium which fell due on the 5th of April, 1900.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">The law of the State of Yew York under consideration was not enacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>for the benefit of the insurance companies, but was passed to prevent forfeitures of policies, and must be liberally construed to accomplish the purpose. Seiders v. Life Assn., 93 Texas, 200. By the terms of the Hew York statute before quoted, no insurance company can forfeit any policy of insurance except it be \"weekly premiums or term insurance, for one year or less,\u201d on account of the failure of the insured to pay any premium or \"any portion thereof,\u201d within one year from the failure, except notice as required by that statute has been given. The amount secured by the note was a portion of the premium required by the policy to be paid and is within the very letter of the law. There is nothing in the statute which would exclude a note like this; on the contrary, it seems to have been framed with a view to cover all cases of failure to pay the premium on a policy of life insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">We are referred to the case- of Conway v. Insurance Company, 140 New York, 79, as placing a different construction upon this statute. We have examined that case carefully, and we are of opinion that the decision is not entitled to be regarded as the law of the State of Hew York. (1) Because the case had been decided and fully disposed of upon the proposition that the note was taken without authority on the part of the agents and that the company was not bound by it as an- extension of the time of the policy. (2) Because the subject of notice is disposed of in such a manner as to show that it had received no careful consideration by the court. The whole subject is disposed of in this language: \"Ho further notice was required from the company to the deceased. The notice provided to be given by the statute as a condition of its right to declare a policy lapsed for nonpayment of an annual premium was not necessary, inasmuch as it had duly given the notice before the premium became due, which the statute has provided for. The statute does not apply to this case.\u201d Ho reasoning is indulged in to show why the note is not embraced in the plain terms of the statute, and in fact it is not entirely clear that the opinion refers to this particular point in the statute. (3) The statement of that case shows that the note was given to the general agents, who withheld the renewal receipt. The court held that the agents did not have authority to extend the time of payment; the note did not belong to the company, and, having disposed of the case upon that ground, it would follow that no notice was required to be given by the company as to that note. This is all the court said with reference to notice, which does not in terms nor in spirit embrace a note given by authority of the company upon which the policy was actually; renewed as in this case. In Strauss v. Insurance Company, 67 New York Supplement, 509, in which a note like this had been given by the insured, and, upon failure to pay it, the company claimed a forfeiture of the policy, which the Supreme Court of that Sate held could not be maintained against the assignee to whom notice had not been given of the failure to pay the premium, and in concluding the opinion upon the question of the forfeiture claimed under the terms of the note, the court said: \u201cThe condition in the unpaid note given for part of the premium that the pol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>icy should 'without notice to any party or parties interested therein be null and void on the failure to pay this note on maturity,\u2019 was ineffective. It has to be coupled with the like condition in the policy itself that the policy shall be null and void on failure to pay any premium or note given therefor on the day it comes due, and can be given no greater force. The statute limits the operation of such agreements of forfeiture so that they can only take effect after the prescribed notice of forfeiture. It is prohibitive and can not be evaded.\u201d This brief and cogent statement of the law upon the subject of the note seems to us to be in direct conflict with the construction sought to be placed upon the loose statement in the case-previously decided, and is entitled to more weight in determining the meaning of that statute. That decision was affirmed by the appellate' division of that court, which is inferior in jurisdiction to the Court of Appeals, but it shows that the Supreme Court, which decided and affirmed that case, did not understand Conway v. Insurance Company as-it is interpreted by counsel for appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
