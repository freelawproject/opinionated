The deed by Randall, Mayor, of 2168 lots out of 2394 to four persons, not in severalty as occupants, but as tenants in common, was a violation of the trust imposed upon him by law.

Stat. U.

If not, however, the change of the word cannot help the plaintiffs. This trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>has been passed upon in a number of cases, and it has been uniformly held that \u201coccupants\u201d meant actual <em>bona fide </em>occupants, and that none but such an occupant was entitled to a deed from the mayor. <em>Ricks </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>19 Cal. 551; <em>Treadway </em>v. <em>Wilder, </em>8 Nev. 98, 9 Nev. 67; <em>Lechler </em>v. <em>Chapin, </em>12 Nev. 66; <em>Cofield </em>v. <em>McLellan, </em>16 Wall. 331; <em>Hussy </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>99 U.

Citing Secs. <em>4, </em>5, 6, 7, 9, and 11 of the Townsite Act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-5\">Section 11 of the Act, continuing in harmony with the preceding sections, provides that \u201cAll persons who select and lay out a townsite and their assigns, shall be deemed occupants thereof and of the lots embraced therein within the meaning of the above mentioned Act of Congress and deeds shall be made accordingly.\u201d The objection to this section of the act is, that it is an attempt on the part of the Legislature to define and construe the word occupant as used in the Act of Congress, so as to embrace a class not contemplated by that act, and to that extent is in conflict with the paramount law and therefore void. It is not contended, however, that the rights conferred upon these constructive occupants under the act in any way conflict with the rights of individual claimants who occupied townsite lands at the time of the entry, but they assert that all lands not actually occupied at the date of the entry belong to the community to be disposed of, and the proceeds to be applied to public uses. Section 12 of the Act of the Legislature provides that, \u201cAll moneys collected under the provisions of this act and not paid out for expenses, as herein provided, but remaining as surplus, shall be expended for the benefit of such town,\u201d etc. Moneys collected, here referred to, are such as would be received from the sale of lots, as provided in section 9, when the persons to whom they were allotted had failed to pay the tax assessed to them, but no provision is made in the act for the sale of vacant lots, because, under the policy of the Territorial la.w, none existed. As the Act of Congress makes no provision for the disposal of vacant lands within a townsite, we fail to understand how a statute of the Territory, defining constructive occupancy of lands to which there is no other claimant, can be in conflict with the Act of Congress.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-6\">The idea of constructive occupancy has been in practice for years, and should not be abandoned as it prevents the success of the lawless element who would otherwise be jumping every attractive piece of land, made valuable by the labor of others and to which it had not contributed. The Territorial Legislature, having in view the preservation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>the peace and good order of the inhabitants of the new towns springing up within its borders, enacted section 11 of the Town Site Statute to enforce and effect the common usage so generally prevailing in all the States and Territories of the west and it only remains for the courts to enforce the law as written in the statutes.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b197-5\">BARNES, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8K\">This was a suit to recover six lots in the city of Tombstone, Cochise county. The case was tried by the court without a jury. The case comes up on the findings of the court below, and it is not necessary to look carefully into the evidence. Errors were assigned upon the admission of evidence, but, in the view we take of the case, it is not necessary to consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The findings are that on March 20, 1880, the corporate authorities of the town of Tombstone, made application for a patent for lands for a town-site, as is provided in section 2387, Rev. St. TJ. S. On September 20, 1880, a patent was issued, which recites that the mayor and eouncilmen of the town of Tombstone, in trust for the several use and benefit of the inhabitants of the town, had purchased said premises; and the United States conveys and grants to Alder Abner Randall, mayor as aforesaid, in trust as aforesaid, and to his successors and assigns, in trust as aforesaid, subject to all the conditions contained in section 2387, supra; that on November 8, 1880, said Alder Abner Randall, mayor as aforesaid, duly executed a deed as such mayor, whereby he, for a valuable consideration, granted and conveyed unto James S. Clark, M. E. Clark, M. Gray, and John D. Rouse a large number of lots and blocks, situated on said Tombstone town-site, including the premises in controversy; that plaintiffs are grantees from the above grantees; that on the eight day of November, A. D., 1880, more than.three-fourths of the lots within the town-site of Tombstone were wholly vacant, unoccupied and unimproved, and a number of the remaining lots had been improved'by, and were in the actual occupation of, parties other than the grantees in said deed from Randall, mayor; that when defendant entered upon said lots sued for, the same were wholly vacant, unoccupied and unimproved, and that neither plaintiffs, nor any one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>through whom they claim, had been in the actual occupation thereof; that as a matter of law, plaintiffs acquired the legal title to said premises by said deed of Randall, mayor, and had the right of possession; and that defendant never had any right in said premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The rights of the plaintiffs and this whole case hang on the validity of the deed from Randall, mayor. The deed is an indenture between the common council, the corporate authorities, of the town of Tombstone, the parties of the first part, and J. S. Clark, M. E. Clara, M. Gray, and J. D. Rouse parties of the second part, and recites that Alder Randall was mayor, and Gray and others eouncilmen, when said deed was made; and that said grantees had claimed the lots thereinafter conveyed, and that they were the owners and occupants thereof; and in consideration of the premises, and of $5.80, granted,' bargained and sold to the parties of the second part 2,168 lots out of the total 2,394, composing the whole town-site, to have and to hold the same, J. S. Clark, an undivided one fifth; M. E. Clark, two-fifths; J. D. Rouse, one-fifth; and M. Gray, one-fifth; Signed \u201cAlder Randall, Mayor/\" etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The act of congress (Rev. St. U. S. \u00a7 2387) provides that the \u201ccorporate authorities\u201d may enter at the proper land-office land settled and occupied, in trust for the several use and benefit of the occupants thereof; the execution of which trust as to the disposal of the lots in such town, and the proceeds of the sales thereof, to be conducted under such regulations as the state or territory may by law provide. The deed by Randall, on its face, was a violation of the trust imposed upon him by law. Out of 2,394 lots he deeded 2,168 to four persons, not in severalty as occupants, but to them as tenants in common. The findings of the court show that at the time said deed was made three-fourths of the lots were vacant, including the lot sued for. The mayor held the title to these lots in trust for the occupants. He had no power to convey the title to anyone but to occupants. The legislature of the territory had the power to regulate the manner of disposal of the lots and the execution of the trust. But there was no power to change or alter the conditions of the trust. The very object and purpose of the law was to prevent any pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>vate person or corporation from getting title to the lots included in such a town-site, and holding the same for purposes of speculation. If any profit was to accrue from the sale of such lots, it was carefully guarded for the benefit of the inhabitants of the town. Here was a bold attempt to transfer substantially this whole town-site to four persons which would! enable them to speculate off of the present and future inhabitants of the town. It was a legal and actual fraud which- ought not to be countenanced for a moment. The deed conveyed to parties no other title than Randall had, and so the title remained in whoever held the legal title in trust for the \u201cseveral use and benefit of the occupants\u201d of the said town.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Any act of the legislature which would create a breach of such trust is void. This same question was before the supreme court of Kansas in the cases of <em>Winfield Town Co. v. Maris </em>11 Kan. 128, and <em>Independence Town Co. </em>v. <em>De Long, </em>11 Kan. 153. In that state there existed the same statute as our section 11, c. 80, Comp. Laws, viz: \u201cAll persons who select and lay out a town-site, and their assigns, shall be deemed occupants thereof, and the lots embraced therein, within the meaning of the above-mentioned act of congress, and deeds shall be made accordingly.\u201d That court holds that, so far as that section gives a town company or persons who select and lay out a town-site any advantage over any other occupant, it is inoperative. \u201cThe legislature, in prescribing the rules for the execution of the trust, cannot change it by substituting other parties to receive its benefits than those indicated in the law of congress.\u201d If individuals or town companies choose to lay out lands for town-site, and make money by that means, there is no law to prevent it; but they cannot pre-empt the public domain for that purpose under the law of congress. That law was made for the benefit of the occupants of the town, and not for speculators. The law of congress has received a construction similar to that which we have given it, in the case of <em>Cash </em>v. <em>Spalding, </em>6 Mich. 193; and while the court was divided on one of the questions raised, yet on this point both the opinion of the court and the dissenting opinion agree. Reference is made to <em>Leech </em>v. <em>Ranch, </em>3 Minn. 448, (Gil. 332,) and <em>Castner </em>v. <em>Gunther, </em>6 Minn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>135, (Gril. 63,) as making a different ruling; but tbe decisions do not sustain tbe opinion claimed for tbem. In tbe last-cited case tbe learned judge wbo delivered tbe opinion of tbe court states that be bolds with tbe decision in Michigan, but that point was not before tbe court.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Tbe judgment of tbe court below is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
