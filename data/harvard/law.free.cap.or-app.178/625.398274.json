At trial, fault hinged on the answer to one question: Did the van slide into the truck\u2019s lane, or vice versa? The juiy returned a verdict in favor of the truck driver and his employer, Simplot. The van driver and his employer appeal, challenging the trial court\u2019s order granting respondents\u2019 motion <em>in limine </em>that excluded any reference to a particular accident reconstruction expert. However, appellants\u2019 only argument before this court is one that they did not make below and which we therefore do not address. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">In the first of these consolidated cases, Rand Aubry (Aubry), driver of the truck, brought an action against Gregory Bornhoft (Bornhoft), the van driver; Alan Crandall, his passenger; and Geo-Centers, Inc., their employer. In the second, Bornhoft brought an action against Aubrey and his employer, J. R. Simplot Company (Simplot). Simplot filed a counterclaim against Bornhoft and a third-party claim against Geo-Centers, Inc. The cases were consolidated for trial, and judgment was entered on a jury verdict in favor of Aubry and Simplot on all claims and counterclaims. Bornhoft and Geo-Centers, Inc. now appeal. For simplicity\u2019s sake we will refer to Bomhoft/Geo-Centers, Inc. as appellants and Aubry/Simplot as respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">In earlier Washington state litigation regarding the accident at issue in this case, respondents had retained Dr. Blotter, an accident reconstruction expert, and obtained from him a deposition containing his opinion about how the accident occurred. Subsequently, at a pretrial hearing in this case, respondents announced that they would not be calling Blotter as a witness and filed a motion <em>in limine </em>seeking to preclude any and all references by any party, witness, or counsel to him, to his Washington testimony or opinions, or to the fact that he had been retained. Respondents argued that, because they were not going to call Blotter as a witness in these cases, any comment on or reference to his earlier testimony or opinions would be inadmissable hearsay. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>argued that, although an expert may base an opinion on facts and data not admitted into evidence, he or she may not testify as to those underlying facts and data if they are not otherwise admissible. OEC 703; <em>Stevens v. Horton, </em>161 Or App 454, 465, 984 P2d 868 (1999), <em>rev den </em>331 Or 692 (2001) (\u201cNothing in OEC 703 suggests that otherwise inadmissible evidence is admissible simply because it was the basis for the expert\u2019s opinion.\u201d); <em>State v. Knepper, </em>62 Or App 623, 661 P2d 560 (1983) (same). Respondents thus sought to exclude not only the opinion of Blotter and the fact that respondents had retained him but also any otherwise inadmissible data generated by Blotter during his investigation of the crash site.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">At oral argument on the motion, appellants maintained that they did not intend to put Blotter\u2019s opinion into evidence and therefore did not object to the motion insofar as it sought to exclude evidence of Blotter\u2019s theory of how the accident happened. Appellants argued, however, that they should be allowed to refer to Blotter\u2019s investigation and previous retention by respondents during opening and closing argument. Appellants apparently wanted to argue that respondents\u2019 theory of how the accident happened had changed over time, in part in response to the findings and opinions of Blotter \u2014 which appellants\u2019 counsel represented \u201ccould not support\u201d Aubry\u2019s version of events. Appellants also argued that, if they had known respondents would not be calling Blotter as an expert, they would have subpoenaed him themselves to testify as a fact witness, because Blotter visited the scene shortly after the collision. Finally, appellants argued that they should be allowed to use Blotter\u2019s findings and opinions to cross-examine respondents\u2019 new expert. In support of that argument, appellants asserted that respondents\u2019 new expert \u201ccertainly is relying on and has seen [Blotter\u2019s] report,\u201d although that assertion was pure conjecture.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Despite the fact that respondents\u2019 motion <em>in limine </em>was based on the theory that the evidence they sought to exclude would be hearsay, respondents did not argue that the deposition (which appellants had lawfully obtained through discovery under Washington law) was admissible under OEC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>804(3)(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or ORS 45.250(2)(c),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> statutes that may permit admission of depositions under some circumstances. Nor did they disclose the contents of that deposition testimony or details of Blotter\u2019s opinion as to how the accident occurred, other than to represent that it differed from that of appellants\u2019 own expert and presumably from respondents\u2019 new expert as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">On appeal, however, appellants focus their argument on the admissibility of Blotter\u2019s deposition testimony; indeed, their sole argument on appeal is that the deposition was admissible under ORS 45.250(2)(c) and OEC 804(3)(a) and that its exclusion was prejudicial to their case. Respondents contend that appellants did not make that argument to the trial court, that they made no adequate offer of proof, and that, in any event, ORS 45.250(2)(c) and OEC 804(3)(a) do not apply in the circumstances of this case. We agree with respondents that appellants\u2019 argument was not properly preserved. We therefore do not reach the question of whether appellants made an adequate offer of proof or of whether Blotter\u2019s deposition was wrongly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Appellants never argued to the trial court that Blotter\u2019s deposition is within the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule \u2014 the specific legal grounds for admission of the deposition that they advance on appeal. Neither during argument on respondents\u2019 motion <em>in limine, </em>nor at any other time prior to appeal, did appellants refer to ORS 45.250(2)(c), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>OEC 804(3)(a), or any other hearsay exception. As the Oregon Supreme Court has held, \u201c[a] party owes the trial court the obligation of a sound, clear and articulate motion, objection or exception, so as to permit the trial judge a chance to consider the legal contention[.]\u201d <em>Shields v. Campbell, </em>277 Or 71, 77, 559 P2d 1275 (1977). Here, for example, the trial court had no opportunity to explore or evaluate the factual predicate to appellants\u2019 arguments on appeal \u2014 that Blotter was unavailable for live testimony. Thus, appellants\u2019 argument to this court that the deposition was admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule was not adequately preserved for review. <em>State v. Wilson, </em>323 Or 498, 512, 918 P2d 820 (1996), <em>cert den </em>519 US 1065 (1997) (failure to argue and cite particular objection to admission of hearsay evidence at trial precludes raising it on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Respondents also request damages under ORS 19.445, which provides for a penalty of 10 percent of the judgment if the Court of Appeals affirms and finds that there was not \u201cprobable cause for taking the appeal.\u201d The standard for \u201cprobable cause\u201d under ORS 19.445 is \u201cwhether any reasonable lawyer would conclude that any of the legal points asserted on appeal possessed legal merit.\u201d <em>Broyles v. Brown, </em>295 Or 795, 801, 671 P2d 94 (1983). We deny respondents\u2019 request.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b674-6\"> OEC 804(3) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-7\">\u201cThe following are not excluded * * * if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-8\">\u201c(a) Testimony given as a witness * * * in a deposition taken in compliance with law in the course of the same or another proceeding, if the party against whom the testimony is now offered * * * had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b674-9\"> ORS 45.250(2) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-10\">\u201cAt the trial or upon the hearing of a motion or an interlocutory proceeding, any part or all of a deposition, so far as admissible under the rules of evidence, may be used against any party for any purpose, if the party was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or had due notice thereof, and if the court finds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-11\">\u00ab* * $ * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-12\">\u201c(c) The party offering the deposition has been unable to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoenal.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
