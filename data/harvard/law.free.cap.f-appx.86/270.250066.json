They believed that he lived at 6228 Cahuenga Boulevard in North Hollywood, California, but had conflicting information on whether he lived downstairs (in apartment A), or upstairs (in apartment B). They therefore sought and received a search warrant for both apartments on the ground that they believed Lugo to be in \u201ccontrol\u201d of both apartments. When they executed the warrant, they found plaintiff Monica Duarte in apartment B and, despite her protests that she did not know Lugo and that he did not live there, continued to search her entire apartment for graffiti- and gang-related items.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Duarte brought this \u00a7 1983 suit against the executing officers and the City of Burbank seeking damages as a result of the search. Following discovery, defendants moved for summary judgment. The district court found that no material facts were in dispute and that the police retained probable cause to search apartment B throughout the search. On this ground, the district court granted summary judgment to all defendants on all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Duarte\u2019s case is predicated on a single claim: Once the officers realized that they might have been in an apartment erroneously included within the terms of the search warrant (i.e., apartment B), the continued search of the apartment violated her Fourth Amendment rights as elaborated in <em>Maryland v. Garrison, 480 U.S. </em>79, 107 S.Ct. 1013, 94 L.Ed.2d 72 (1987). She asserts that <em>Garrison </em>stands for the proposition that officers are required to discontinue a search, even if pursuant to a warrant, when \u201cput on notice of the risk that they might be in an [apartment] erroneously included within the terms of the warrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87 (emphasis supplied). It is undisputed that the police continued to search Duarte\u2019s apartment after they were \u201con notice\u201d that Lugo \u201cmight\u201d not live there, and even after they concluded that Lugo in fact did not live there.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">Nevertheless, the doctrine expounded in <em>Garrison </em>is not founded on whether the police were \u201con notice\u201d that they \u201cmight\u201d be in the wrong apartment but, rather, whether they acted in an objectively understandable and reasonable manner. <em>See Garrison, </em>480 U.S. at 88 (\u201cthe validity of the search of [Garrison\u2019s] apartment ... depends on whether the officers\u2019 failure to realize the overbreadth of the warrant was <em>objectively understandable and reasonable.\u201d) </em>(emphasis supplied); <em>see generally </em>U.S. Const, amend. IV (prohibiting \u201cunreasonable\u201d searches and seizures).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">The search warrant did not describe the premises to be searched as \u201cLugo\u2019s apartment\u201d but, rather, \u201capartments A and B\u201d at \u201c6228 Cahuenga Bl.\u201d on the grounds that the affiant had \u201cformed the opinion that [Lugo] has <em>control </em>of both apartments A and B.\u201d (emphasis supplied). Given this opinion \u2014 accepted by the judge that issued the warrant \u2014 it was objectively reasonable under <em>Garrison </em>for the police to believe that, even if Lugo lived in apartment A, or even if he lived elsewhere, that he sufficiently controlled apartment B that their search remained within the scope of the warrant. Thus, the police were not obliged to discontinue the search of apartment B even after they concluded that Lugo did not reside there.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">As the individual officer defendants acted objectively reasonably, Duarte\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>against them must fail. Because her claim against the City of Burbank is dependant on her claim against the officers, that claim must likewise fail. The grant of summary judgment to defendants is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b301-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
