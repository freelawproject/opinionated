Drones argues that the district court erred in applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2, the aggravated assault guideline, to determine his base offense level. Drones further argues that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2A2.2(b)(2)(C) on the ground that the use of a dangerous weapon had been threatened.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-16\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s findings of fact at sentencing for clear error and its application of the sentencing guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>174 F.3d 515, 524 (5th Cir.1999). Because Drones\u2019s assault involved both the presence of a dangerous weapon, Michael Duncan\u2019s service firearm, and the intent to cause bodily injury with that weapon, the district court did not clearly err in finding that his offense constituted aggravated assault. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2A2.2, comment. (n.l). The district court could (and did) properly infer Drones\u2019s intent to do bodily harm with Duncan\u2019s firearm from Drones\u2019s actions\u2014 lunging at Duncan, hitting Duncan about the head, and grabbing Duncan\u2019s firearm with both hands in an attempt to gain control of the weapon, in addition to Drones\u2019s initial attack upon Steven Steele. <em>See United States v. Morris, </em>131 F.3d 1136, 1138 (5th Cir.1997). Although Drones disputes the district court\u2019s finding that he attempted to wrestle the firearm away from Duncan, he has failed to produce any evidence to the contrary to demonstrate that the presentence report was inaccurate. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>54 F.3d 234, 242 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Lage, </em>183 F.3d 374, 383 (5th Cir.1999). Thus, applying \u00a7 2A2.2 to set the base offense level was proper. Because Drones threatened the use of a dangerous weapon by attempting to gain control of Duncan\u2019s firearm, the district court did not err in enhancing Drones\u2019s sentence in accordance with \u00a7 2A2.2(b)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b715-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
