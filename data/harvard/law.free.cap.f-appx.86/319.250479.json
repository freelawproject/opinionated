We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Cruz contends that the district court erred in admitting hearsay evidence in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. We review <em>de novo </em>whether the denial of an opportunity to confront a witness violated Cruz\u2019s due process rights at the revocation hearing, <em>see United States v. Havier, </em>155 F.3d 1090, 1092 (9th Cir.1998), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-23\">Cruz contends that the district court improperly admitted the statement that on the night in question, a neighbor had heard a fight between Cruz and the alleged victim. However, the record demonstrates that the district court properly applied a balancing test between Cruz\u2019s right to confrontation and the government\u2019s witness unavailability submission before admitting into evidence this undisputed hearsay statement. <em>See United States v. Comito, </em>177 F.3d 1166, 1170 (9th Cir.1999). The admission did not violate Cruz\u2019s right of confrontation. <em>See United States v. Martin, </em>984 F.2d 308, 311 (\u201c[t]he more significant particular evidence is to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>finding, the more important it is that the [probationer] be given an opportunity to demonstrate that the proffered evidence does not reflect verified fact\u201d). Moreover, even without the challenged hearsay statement, the other evidence presented at the revocation hearing supports the district court\u2019s determination that Cruz committed a violation of his probation. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>978 F.2d 1133, 1135 (9th Cir.1992) (district court\u2019s credibility determination afforded \u201cgreat deference\u201d on review).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b349-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
