We lack jurisdiction to review this decision because the district court\u2019s explanation of its decision indicates that it recognized its authority to depart on this ground and denied the request, in its discretion, based on the facts presented. <em>United States v. Lipman, </em>133 F.3d 726, 731-32 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Torres contends that a downward departure is also warranted because of the disparity between Torres\u2019 federal sentence and the sentence he could have received in state court. To the extent Torres raised this contention in the district court as part of his request for the government-misconduct departure, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s discretionary denial. <em>Id. </em>To the extent this ground for a departure was not raised in the district court, we decline to entertain it for the first time on appeal. <em>United States v. Antonakeas, 255 </em>F.3d 714, 720 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Torres did raise for the first time on appeal his contention that the federal-state sentencing disparity amounts to a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. There was no plain error. <em>See United States v. Rearden, </em>349 F.3d 608, 614 (reviewing for plain error constitutional challenge to Sentencing Guidelines raised for the first time on appeal); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>282 F.3d 679 (9th Cir.2002) (acknowledging that the Guidelines do not expressly prohibit a downward departure on the basis of federal-state disparities, but reversing a departure based on the federal-California disparity because otherwise \u201cevery federal sentence would become dependent on the practice of the state within which the federal court sits.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b327-38\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
