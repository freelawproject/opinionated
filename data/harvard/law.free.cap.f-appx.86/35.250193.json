Freeman, the former Chief Executive Officer of the Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority, was convicted of theft from a federally funded program, mail fraud, and .making false statements to a financial institution in connection with a loan application. On appeal, Freeman contends that: (1) the jury instructions were improper; (2) the district court improperly enhanced her sentence pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines for using \u201cmore than minimal planning\u201d; (3) the district court improperly enhanced her sentence pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines for \u201cabusing a position of trust\u201d; and (4) her counsel provided ineffective assistance. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AvQ\">A. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b66-16\">On February 13, 2002, Claire E. Freeman was found guilty by a jury on three counts: (1) theft of a federally funded program in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666; (2) mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341; and (3) making a false statement to a financial institution in connection with a loan application in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-17\">At the sentencing hearing on April 24, 2002, the district court determined Freeman\u2019s offense level to be 17 and her Criminal History Category I, yielding a sentencing range of 24 to 30 months. The district court granted Freeman a two-level downward departure and sentenced her to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment to be followed by two years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-18\">B. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b66-19\">On October 23, 1989, while working for the Department of Housing and Urban <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Development (\u201cHUD\u201d), Freeman purchased a $225,000 townhouse located at 1414 Leslie Avenue (the \u201ctownhouse\u201d) in Alexandria, Virginia. Freeman took out mortgages on the townhouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">In 1990, Freeman and Ronnie Davis, also a HUD employee, relocated to Cleveland, Ohio to work, respectively, as Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) and Chief Financial Officer of the Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority (\u201cCMHA\u201d). Davis later became CMHA\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (\u201cCOO\u201d). CMHA was created to provide affordable housing to residents of Cuyahoga County, Ohio. It is overseen by a board of five commissioners (the \u201cBoard\u201d) and its budget consists almost entirely of federal funds from HUD.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Freeman\u2019s 1990 employment contract was approved by the Board and included a provision concerning relocation expenses, which stated: \u201cCMHA shall fully reimburse the executive director for all expenses incurred in connection with her relocation for this position and will pay the reasonable cost of a relocation firm engaged by the executive director to assist in her relocation activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">In December 1993, Freeman refinanced the mortgage on the townhouse through Merrill Lynch Credit Corporation (\u201cMerrill\u201d). As part of her loan application, and in order to receive a more favorable loan package, Freeman submitted a fictitious federal income tax return. Freeman falsely stated that the townhouse was her primary residence when, in fact, she rented out the townhouse and lived in Ohio during the relevant time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">In processing her application, Merrill independently determined that Freeman\u2019s primary residence was in Ohio. In order to receive the more favorable loan package, Freeman executed a \u201cSecond Home Rider\u201d in which she agreed not to rent the townhouse and to use it only as a personal, secondary residence. Nevertheless, Freeman continued to rent the townhouse to tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">In addition, when Merrill raised concerns about Freeman\u2019s payment history with respect to the original mortgage, Freeman submitted to Merrill a handwritten cover letter, explaining that CMHA had \u201cworked out a method of payment that will correct the late payment history.\u201d Attached to the cover letter was a letter on CMHA stationery, dated December 22, 1993, and addressed to Davis. This letter purported to authorize Davis, as COO of CMHA, to make interest payments on Freeman\u2019s loan a perquisite of her employment contract. The letter appeared to have been signed by three of the five CMHA commissioners \u2014 Karen H. Coats, Dwayne Browder, and Dr. Consuelo Sousa. However, at trial, Coats, Browder, and Sousa each denied signing the letter and testified that the Board never authorized payments to be made on Freeman\u2019s mortgage out of public funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">Freeman did ultimately obtain a mortgage from Merrill, and CMHA made regular payments \u2014 totaling $49,607.17 \u2014 on it. Of these payments, CMHA check number 2749, in the amount of $2,068, was sent via the United States Postal Service to Merrill\u2019s Illinois office.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-12\">In August 1993, Freeman applied for and obtained a $50,000 \u201cbridge loan\u201d from Society National Bank (\u201cSociety\u201d), which is now known as Key Bank. In support of her loan application, a letter, dated July 17, 1993, purportedly signed by Coats, Browder, and Sousa, was sent to Ronald Warzel of Society, authorizing the COO of CMHA to pay quarterly interest on a bridge loan in the amount of $50,000 to $60,000 for the townhouse. At trial, Coats, Browder, and Sousa denied signing this letter as well and testified that the Board never ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>proved CMHA\u2019s paying interest on Freeman\u2019s personal loan. Society, however, had never verified the authenticity of the letter, and it approved the loan based on the guarantees in the purportedly forged letter from CMHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Between August 1993 and November 1995, Freeman caused $4,053.42 in CMHA funds to be paid to Society as quarterly interest payments on her personal loan. The CMHA commissioners denied authorizing these payments. On November 3, 1995, Freeman caused CMHA check number 2081, in the amount of $50,689.00, to be issued to Society to make a final payment on this loan. This' check was paid by CMHA out of the CMHA Veteran\u2019s Housing Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Count One of the Indictment alleged that Freeman converted public funds exceeding $5,000 by causing mortgage payments to be made on the townhouse out of the CMHA Veteran\u2019s Housing Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Count Two alleged that Freeman used the United States mails to transmit documents with the purpose of defrauding Merrill and CMHA. In furtherance of the alleged scheme to defraud, it was alleged that Freeman made a materially false statement that the townhouse was her primary residence; sent a forged letter from CMHA to Merrill to appease Merrill\u2019s concerns about her late payment history; caused CMHA to make payments on her Merrill loan; and used the United States mails to send at least one of these payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Count Three alleged that Freeman made materially false statements to Society in order to obtain the $50,000 bridge loan by sending Society a forged letter from CMHA, falsely indicating that CMHA had authorized interest payments on this loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">At trial, despite the testimony of Board members to the contrary, Freeman maintained that CMHA had authorized all of the disputed expenditures as part of her executive compensation package. Freeman denied that she had forged any signatures, although she admitted submitting a fictitious income tax return to Merrill.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"Al\">We now address Freeman\u2019s claims that: (1) the jury instructions were improper; (2) her sentence should not have been enhanced for using \u201cmore than minimal planning\u201d; (3) her sentence should not have been enhanced for \u201cabusing a position of trust\u201d; and (4) her counsel provided ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-13\">A. Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b68-14\">Freeman contends that the jury instruction for Count One, the charge pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666, which criminalizes \u201ctheft concerning a federally funded program,\u201d improperly precluded the jury from considering Freeman\u2019s defense, namely, that the funds and benefits in question had been authorized by the CMHA pursuant to the terms of her employment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-15\">To prove a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(1)(A), the government must demonstrate that: (1) the defendant is an agent of an organization, State, local or tribal government, or an agency of such a government; (2) the defendant embezzles, steals, obtains by fraud, or otherwise without authority knowingly converts to the use of any person other than the rightful owner or intentionally misapplies, property that \u2014 (i) is valued at $5,000 or more, and (ii) is owned by, or is under the care, custody, or control of such organization, government, or agency; and (3) such organization, government, or agency receives at least $10,000 in federal assistance in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>one year period. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(1)(A), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(c) exempts certain conduct from the reach of a \u00a7 666 violation. Specifically, \u00a7 666 \u201cdoes not apply to bona fide salary, wages, fees, or other compensation paid, or expenses paid or reimbursed, in the usual course of business.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(c). Freeman claims that the jury instruction failed to make clear that the jury should acquit her if it concluded that she received the funds in question as \u201cbona fide salary ... or other compensation paid ... in the usual course of business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\u201cOur inquiry into jury instructions is limited to whether, taken as a whole, the instructions adequately inform the jury of the relevant considerations and provide the jury with a sound basis in law with which to reach a conclusion.\u201d <em>United States v. Wells, </em>211 F.3d 988, 1002 (6th Cir.2000). \u201cThis court may reverse a judgment on the basis of improper jury instructions only if the instructions, when viewed as a whole, were confusing, misleading and prejudicial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We do not judge a particular jury instruction \u201cin artificial isolation,\u201d rather, we view it \u201cin the context of the overall charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Cupp v. Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 146-47, 94 S.Ct. 396, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">However, where no objection to the jury instructions was raised below, this Court reviews the instructions for plain error. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>108 F.3d 668, 670 (6th Cir.1997) (en banc); <em>see </em>Fed. R.Crim. P. 52(b). Finding plain error requires a court to make the following determinations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-8\">First, it must conclude that the district court committed unwaived error. Second, the error must be plain, that is, clear and obvious under current law. Third, the court must find that the error affected a substantial right of the defendant by prejudicially influencing the outcome of the district court proceedings. Where these conditions are met, the court will find plain error if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-10\"><em>United States v. Taylor, </em>102 F.3d 767, 770 (6th Cir.1996) (internal citations and quotations omitted). \u201cAn instruction is not plainly erroneous unless there was \u2018an egregious error, one that directly leads to a miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. King, </em>169 F.3d 1035, 1040 (6th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>United States v. Busacca, </em>863 F.2d 433, 435 (6th Cir.1988)). Freeman concedes that counsel failed to object to all but one aspect of the jury instructions she now challenges on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">With respect to the count concerning 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666, the district court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-12\">Count 1, as I said, accuses the defendant of theft concerning a program receiving federal funds. The relevant statute on this subject is Section 666 of Title 18 of the United States Code. That statute provides, in pertinent part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-13\">Whoever, if the circumstances described in subsection (b) of this section exists [sic]: 1. Being an agent of an organization, or of a state, local or Indian tribal government, or any agency thereof, embezzles, steals, obtains by fraud, or otherwise without authority, knowingly converts to the use of any person other than the rightful owner or intentionally misapplies property that, 1, is valued at $5,000 or more, and 2, is owned by, or is under the care, custody or control of such an organization, government or agency, shall be guilty of an offense against the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-14\">Now subsection (b) says:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>The circumstances referred to in subsection (a) of this section is that the organization, government or agency receives, in any one-year period, benefits in excess of $10,000 under a federal program involving a grant, contract, subsidy, loan, guarantee, insurance, or other form of federal assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">(J.A. 229-30.)</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The district court summarized the allegations set forth in Count One of the Indictment and then set forth the elements of a \u00a7 666 offense as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">In order to sustain a conviction for this offense, the government must prove the following three essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt: First, that the defendant was an agent of the CMHA at the time of the offense. Second, that the defendant embezzled, stole, obtained by fraud, willingly converted, or intentionally misapplied property worth at least $5,000, which was under the control, care, or supervision of CMHA. And, third, that the offense occurred during a time in which CMHA received in excess of $10,000 in federal assistance in any one-year period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\n<em>(Id.)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">The district court then defined the various relevant terms pursuant to the statutory definitions and the definitions set forth in the Eighth Circuit\u2019s model jury instructions. <em>See </em>Eighth Circuit Model Jury Instruction, Elements of the Offense, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(1)(A) (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">The district court explained the exception pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(c) and discussed how the jury should consider Freeman\u2019s various defenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-10\">With regard to the $5,000 amount mentioned in the statute, this amount does not apply to bona fide salary, wages, fees, or other compensation paid, or expenses paid or reimbursed in the usual course of business. \u201cIn the usual course of business\u201d refers to acceptable commercial and business practices. So, for example, the value of a yearly salary, if bona fide, should not be considered in establishing the $5,000 valuation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-12\">If you find that the government has proved all of the elements of theft concerning a program receiving federal funds beyond a reasonable doubt, then you should find the defendant guilty. If, on the other hand, you find that the government has not proved even one of these elements beyond a reasonable doubt, then you should find the defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-13\">The defendant asserts that the CMHA board authorized all of the expenditures at issue in this case. Specifically, the defendant asserts that the board affirmatively authorized: 1, payment of the interest on the mortgage for her Virginia property; 2, certain payments in connection with a bridge loan obtained from Key Bank; and 3, the use of Title V funds for all purposes for which they were used. If you find the CMHA board authorized the payments that the government now claims were wrongful, you may consider that authorization in connection with your assessment of whether the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted willfully, deliberately, or with the intent to deceive or misappropriate CMHA property, or engaged in otherwise unauthorized or unjustified acts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-14\">Absent board authorization, however, it is not a defense to the crime of theft concerning a program receiving federal funds to say that the CMHA board was negligent or sloppy, or could have done something more than it did to prevent misapplication, embezzlement, conversion, or fraud. In other words, if you find that the government has proved all of the elements of theft concerning a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>program receiving federal funds beyond a reasonable doubt, you must find the defendant guilty even if the misapplication, embezzlement, conversion, or fraud might not have occurred if the board had better internal controls or had acted with greater care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">(J.A. 283-35.)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">First, Freeman claims that 18 U.S.C. 666(c) is an element of a \u00a7 666 offense that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. This claim is without merit. Section 666(c) is an exception to a \u00a7 666 offense; it is not an element of the offense. <em>See, e.g., McKelvey v. United States, </em>260 U.S. 353, 356-57, 43 S.Ct. 132, 67 L.Ed. 301 (1922) (stating the rule that \u201can indictment ... founded on a general provision defining the elements of an offense need not negative the manner of an exception ... it is incumbent on one who relies on such exception to set it up and establish it.\u201d). This Court has previously defined the elements of a \u00a7 666 offense precisely as the district court did in this case. <em>See United States v. Valentine, </em>63 F.3d 459, 462 (6th Cir.1995); see <em>also United States v. Phillips, </em>219 F.3d 404, 410 (5th Cir. 2000); Eighth Circuit Model Jury Instruction, Elements of the Offense, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(1)(A) (2003). Thus, the district court properly described the elements of a \u00a7 666 offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Second, Freeman claims that the instructions were erroneous in stating that \u201cthe statute prohibits a defendant from intentionally misapplying or misappropriating funds, even if the funds are used for otherwise legitimate purposes.\u201d At trial, counsel made a specific objection to this portion of the instruction, so plain error review of this claim is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">The language used by the district court was based on the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Urlacher, </em>979 F.2d 935, 938 (2d Cir.1992). The Eighth Circuit model instruction uses similar language and also cites to <em>Urlacher. </em>Eighth Circuit Model Jury Instruction, Elements of the Offense, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(1)(A) (2003). As the court in <em>Urlacher </em>properly explained, while the first four prohibitions in \u00a7 666 \u2014 the prohibitions against embezzling, stealing, obtaining by fraud, and converting \u2014 concern any possible taking of money for one\u2019s own use or benefit, the fifth prohibition \u2014 -the prohibition against the \u201cintentional misapplication\u201d of funds\u2014 must include the intentional misapplication of funds for legitimate purposes in order to avoid statutory redundancy. <em>Urlacher, </em>979 F.2d at 938. As such, the district court\u2019s instruction \u201cprovide[d] the jury with a sound basis in law with which to reach a conclusion\u201d and therefore, was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">Third, Freeman claims that the district court improperly suggested to the jury that it may disregard the nature of the funds, even though \u00a7 666(c) renders the criminal statute inapplicable to funds stemming from a bona fide salary or other compensation paid in the usual course of business. We note that trial counsel failed to object to this aspect of the jury instructions and so we review for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">Viewing the instruction as a whole, we find no plain error. <em>In toto, </em>the instructions clearly convey that if Freeman legitimately obtained the Board\u2019s authorization for the expenditures she did not violate \u00a7 666. The district court did not invite the jury to find Freeman guilty regardless of whether the Board approved the expenditures merely by instructing that the jury \u201cmay consider\u201d \u2014 rather than \u201cmust consider\u201d \u2014 Board authorization in determining whether Freeman acted with criminal intent. Moreover, Freeman has not explained how the district court\u2019s alleged failure to refer specifically to subsection (c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>while discussing Freeman\u2019s authorization defense prevented the jury from considering this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Fourth, Freeman claims that the district court improperly limited subsection (c) by describing it as applying only to the determination of whether the $5,000 threshold had been met. She asserts that this error precluded the jury from considering her defense that the Board had approved the payments. We have previously explained that subsection (c) applies to the entirety of \u00a7 666, <em>United States v. Mills, </em>140 F.3d 630, 633 (6th Cir.1998), and, arguably, when read in isolation, the district court\u2019s instruction erroneously limits subsection (c)\u2019s purview. However, taken as a whole, the jury instructions clearly communicated Freeman\u2019s authorization defense, and we find no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Finally, Freeman claims that it was error to conclude that the Board\u2019s inattention is of no consequence because the Board\u2019s diligence is necessary to determine what constitutes the \u201cnormal course of business\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 666(c). Because trial counsel failed to object to this instruction at trial, we review only for plain error and conclude that this argument is without merit. Even if the Board was not diligent in monitoring the CMHA funds, a finding that the Board could have acted with greater care would not negate a finding that Freeman acted intentionally to misapply CMHA funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">B. More Than Minimal Planning</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Freeman contends that the district court erred when it concluded at sentencing that the offense at issue involved more than minimal planning pursuant to \u00a7 2B1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d or the \u201cGuidelines\u201d). This Court reviews a trial court\u2019s sentencing enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 for clear error. <em>United States v. Lutz, </em>154 F.3d 581, 590 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">Pursuant to the November 1, 1997 edition of the Sentencing Guidelines, which the district court deemed applicable to Freeman\u2019s sentencing, a trial court is permitted to increase an offense level by two points if the offense involved \u201cmore than minimal planning.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(4)(A) (1997). The Guidelines define \u201cmore than minimal planning\u201d as \u201cmore planning than is typical for commission of the offense in a simple form\u201d and explain that it is \u201cdeemed present in any case involving repeated acts over a period time, unless it is clear that each instance was purely opportune.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, cmt. n. 1(f) (1997). This Court has explained that \u201c \u2018[m]ore than minimal planning\u2019 can be deduced by more planning than is typical, repeated acts, and steps to conceal the crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Ellerbee, </em>73 F.3d 105, 108 (6th Cir.1996). This Court has also noted that to be \u201cmore than minimal planning\u201d the offense merely need be \u201csomething more than the crime in its simplest form.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">The district court\u2019s conclusion that the offense at issue involved \u201cmore than minimal planning\u201d was not clearly erroneous. To the contrary, that conclusion is supported by substantial evidence in the record. Freeman\u2019s conduct in this case occurred over a period of five years and involved a well-planned pattern of misrepresentation and outright forgery concerning loan applications, federal income tax returns, and the financial activities of the CMHA. Her activities resulted in numerous checks being wrongfully paid out by CMHA on her behalf over a substantial period of time. In light of these facts, the district court\u2019s conclusion that this offense involved more than minimal planning was justified and, therefore, not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>C. Abuse of a Position of Trust</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s \u201cabuse of a position of trust\u201d determination <em>de novo. United States v. White, </em>270 F.3d 356, 371 (6th Cir.2001) (citing <em>United States v. Tribble, </em>206 F.3d 634, 635 (6th Cir.2000)). Section 3B1.3 of the Guidelines provides that: \u201cIf the defendant abused a position of public or private trust, or used a special skill, in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense, increase by 2 levels.\u201d U.S.S.G. Manual \u00a7 3B1.3 (1997). In assessing whether this enhancement applies, this Court must determine \u201cwhether the defendant held a position of trust, and whether the position of trust facilitated the commission of the crime.\u201d <em>White, </em>270 F.3d at 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Freeman claims that she did not have independent authority to approve the payments at issue. She claims that she was an administrator, not a fiduciary, and that Davis made the financial decisions for CMHA with which she would merely concur. Freeman also contends that, ultimately, the Board would issue the final approval concerning all CMHA decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Freeman was CEO of CMHA and acted as would a senior executive of a private company. As such, Freeman and CMHA had an officer-organization relationship. The Sentencing Commission clearly contemplated U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3 applying to that type of relationship. As we have previously explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\">The trust relationship arises when a person or organization intentionally makes himself or itself vulnerable to someone in a particular position, ceding to the other\u2019s presumed better judgment some control over them affairs. Indeed, the guideline examples of where the enhancement is appropriate correspond to the types of relationships where fiduciary duties are often implied: physician-patient, lawyer-client, officer-organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-10\"><em>Id. </em>(internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">As CEO, Freeman held the highest ranking position within CMHA. Although she contends that she and Davis made joint decisions, the evidence suggests that Freeman had authority over Davis. Moreover, a Board member testified that he did not question or verify what Freeman did as CEO.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">The level of discretion accorded an employee \u201cis to be the decisive factor in determining whether his position was one that can be characterized as a trust position.\u201d <em>United States v. Tribble, </em>206 F.3d 634, 637 (6th Cir.2000). The position must be one that is \u201ccharacterized by substantial discretionary judgment that is ordinarily given considerable deference.\u201d <em>United States v. Ragland, </em>72 F.3d 500, 503 (6th Cir.1996). It is clear that Freeman had a tremendous amount of discretion and was able to commit the offenses of which she has been convicted by virtue of that discretion and her position of power and trust at CMHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">Accordingly, the district court did not err in granting a sentencing enhancement for abuse of a position of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-14\">D. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b73-15\">Finally, Freeman argues that trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective because he failed to object to the jury instructions on Count One, in connection with the \u00a7 666 violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-16\">This Court generally does not review ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct review. <em>See United States v. Turner, </em>324 F.3d 456, 463 (6th Cir.2003). However, if a sufficiently developed factual record exists from which to review the defendant\u2019s allegations, we will allow the claim to be brought on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Goodlett, </em>3 F.3d 976, 980 (6th Cir.1993). The record in the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>case has not been adequately developed to permit us to consider Freeman\u2019s ineffective assistance claim. Accordingly, we decline to address this issue on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
