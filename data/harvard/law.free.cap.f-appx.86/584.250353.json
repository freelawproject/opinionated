He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Our review of the docket sheet reveals that the district court entered an oral order denying the motion as moot and directing the Clerk of the Court to docket the motion and forward it to this Court for disposition. Accordingly, because the district court has recently decided Singletary\u2019s case, we grant Singletary leave to proceed in forma pauperis but deny the mandamus petition as moot. We also deny the Government\u2019s motion to consolidate this case with <em>United States v. Singletary, </em>Case No. 03-7259. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
