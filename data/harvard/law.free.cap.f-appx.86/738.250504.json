Devita contends: (1) her attorney rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object to Devita\u2019s appearance before the jury in jail clothing; and (2) the evidence was insufficient to support her conspiracy conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-18\">Devita\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel argument was not presented to the district court, and Devita fails to identify portions of the record that provide substantial details about her attorney\u2019s conduct. Accordingly, as is our usual practice, we decline to address this issue on direct appeal. <em>See, e.g, United States v. Bounds, </em>943 F.2d 541, 544 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-23\">Because Devita failed to move for judgment of acquittal in district court, her sufficiency challenge with respect to her conspiracy conviction \u201cis limited to determining whether there was a manifest miscarriage of justice\u201d. <em>United States v. McIntosh, </em>280 F.3d 479, 483 (5th Cir.2002) (citation omitted). Consistent with the elements for this very narrow standard of review, the record is not devoid of evidence pointing to guilt \u2014 far from it. In fact, evidence was adduced at trial with respect to every element of the conspiracy offense. In short, there was no manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b768-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b768-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
