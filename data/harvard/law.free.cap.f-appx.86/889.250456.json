For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-19\">Helton was arrested during his attempt to sell 2 ounces of cocaine hydrochloride through an intermediary to a confidential informant cooperating with the Chattanooga Police Department. After Helton\u2019s arrest, the police obtained his consent to search his apartment, which was located several miles from the scene of his arrest. In the bedroom closet, the police founds pound of marijuana, a cutting board with suspected cocaine residue, and a safe. The officers removed the safe and subsequently opened it with Helton\u2019s key, finding 100 grams of methamphetamine, two bags of cocaine powder weighing approximately 60 grams, four bags of marijuana weighing approximately 250 grams, one bottle of suspected \u201cSpecial K\u201d (Ketamine), distribution size baggies, and a loaded Llama .22 caliber semi-automatic handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-20\">Helton was indicted on charges of conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, cocaine hydrochloride, and marijuana (Count 1), attempt to distribute cocaine hydrochloride (Count 2), possession of cocaine, marijuana, and methamphetamine with intent to distribute (Counts 3-5), possession of a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking as charged in Counts 3-5 in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (Count 6), and possession of a firearm by an individual who has been convicted of a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (Count 7). After entering an initial plea of not guilty, Helton entered into a plea agreement pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2), permitting him to plead guilty to Count 1 (conspiracy to distribute) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>and Count 6 (possession of a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking offenses), and reserving his right to file a motion to dismiss the firearms charge and to appeal any denial of that motion. Pursuant to the agreement, the government dropped all of the other counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Helton filed the motion to dismiss the \u00a7 924(c) charge and a memorandum of law, which, among other arguments, highlighted the Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Emerson, </em>270 F.3d 203 (5th Cir.2001) (adopting an individual rights interpretation of the Second Amendment). The district court denied the motion, whereupon Helton was sentenced to 97 months of incarceration, 60 months of which related to his five year consecutive penalty for violation of \u00a7 924(c). Helton then brought this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">Helton\u2019s guilty plea was, as we have noted above, a conditional plea entered pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2), which permits the defendant to reserve the right to appeal an adverse determination of \u201ca specified pretrial motion.\u201d Helton\u2019s plea agreement reserved his right to move to dismiss the \u00a7 924(c) charge and to appeal any denial of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">Helton\u2019s primary argument before the district court and on appeal is that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) charge must be dismissed because \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s requirement that a gun be used or carried \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime is vague and overbroad. The district court relied on our opinion in <em>United States v. Mackey, </em>265 F.3d 457 (6th Cir.2001) in examining Helton\u2019s claims. In <em>Mackey, </em>we addressed the definition of \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 under the statute. In light of the term\u2019s natural meaning and the legislative history, we found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-9\">[i]n order for the possession to be in furtherance of a drug crime, the firearm must be strategically located so that it is quickly and easily available for use.... Other factors that may be relevant to a determination of whether the weapon was possessed in furtherance of the crime include whether the gun was loaded, the type of weapon, the legality of its possession, the type of drug activity conducted, and the time and circumstances under which the firearm was found.... The list of factors is not exclusive, but it helps to distinguish possession in furtherance of a crime from innocent possession of a wall-mounted antique or an unloaded hunting rifle locked in a cupboard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b921-12\"><em>Mackey, </em>265 F.3d at 462. As our <em>Mackey </em>analysis makes apparent, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s use of \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 is neither unconstitutionally vague nor over-broad. Accordingly, Helton\u2019s constitutional claims must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-13\">Alternatively, Helton argues that \u00a7 924(c) is subject to the rule of lenity. Helton is mistaken. \u201cThe rule of lenity applies only if, after seizing everything from which aid can be derived, ... we can make no more than a guess as to what Congress intended.\u201d <em>Muscarello v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 125, 138, 118 S.Ct. 1911, 141 L.Ed.2d 111 (1998) (internal quotations omitted). As <em>Mackey </em>establishes, we do not need to guess at what Congress meant by \u201cin furtherance of,\u201d and therefore Helton\u2019s claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-14\">Helton next claims that Count Six must be dismissed because the evidence does not support a \u00a7 924(c) violation. In the trial court, Helton argued only that the version of the statute under which he was indicted was vague and overbroad, violated the Second Amendment, and was subject to the rule of lenity. He made no challenge to the facts on which the \u00a7 924(c) charge was predicated, and indeed, his plea of guilty-albeit a conditional guilty plea-foreclosed his right to deny the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>on which the charge is predicated, inasmuch as a conditional guilty plea reserves only the right to appeal adverse determinations of \u201cspecified pretrial motion[s].\u201d <em>See U.S. v. Bahhur, </em>200 F.3d 917, 923 (6th Cir.2000) (\u201cThe term \u2018specified pre-trial motion\u2019 incorporates all questions that are collateral to a determination of guilt or innocence.\u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Pickett, </em>941 F.2d 411, 416 (6th Cir.1991) (referring to the Notes of the Advisory Committee on Rules for the 1983 Amendments to Rule 11(a), reprinted in 18 U.S.C. Rules 1-11 at 359)).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">Before us, however, Helton not only challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the \u00a7 924(c) count, he flatly misstates the charge contained in that count. According to Helton, Count Six charges him with using the gun in furtherance of the attempted narcotics sale at the restaurant where he was arrested, and because the gun was not anywhere near the restaurant and was not used in any way in connection with that attempted sale, there is no evidence to support the charge. But Count Six charges Helton with knowingly possessing the handgun-the same gun that was found in the safe in his residence-in furtherance of the offenses charged in Counts Three, Four and Five of the indictment-possession of various controlled substances with the intent to distribute them. It is not necessary for Helton to have been convicted of the drug trafficking offense on which a \u00a7 924(c) charge is predicated. <em>United States v. Ospina, </em>18 F.3d 1332, 1336 (6th Cir.1994) (\u201cTo establish the required predicate, the fact of the offense rather than a conviction is all that is necessary.\u201d) Helton\u2019s conditional guilty plea did not preserve any right to challenge the facts on which the charge is predicated. Even if he could challenge those facts, we have no difficulty in holding that the evidence in this case amply supports the \u00a7 924(c) charge. This claim is wholly meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Finally, Helton urges us to adopt the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Emerson, </em>and to hold that \u00a7 924(c) unduly infringes on Second Amendment rights. <em>Emerson, </em>of course, is not binding on this court, and, in any event, we note that it contemplates that Second Amendment rights may be subject to \u201climited, narrowly tailored specific exceptions or restrictions for particular cases that are reasonable and not inconsistent with the right of Americans generally to individually keep and bear their private arms as historically understood in this country.\u201d <em>Emerson, </em>270 F.3d at 261. Because we agree with the district court that \u00a7 924(c) constitutes just such a reasonable limitation, Helton\u2019s Second Amendment claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
