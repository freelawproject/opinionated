He argues that the district court erred in denying him standing to assert his Fourth Amendment rights in the home of his co-defendant, Todd Broussard; that the district court erred in finding that Broussard voluntarily consented to the search of his home; and that the district court erred in finding that the search warrant issued on Broussard\u2019s home was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-19\">We assume <em>arguendo, </em>without deciding, that Carr\u00f3n had a legitimate expectation of privacy in Broussard\u2019s home and, therefore, that he has standing to challenge the constitutionality of the search. <em>See United, States v. Wilson, </em>36 F.3d 1298, 1302 (5th Cir.1994). We hold, however, that the district court\u2019s factual findings that Broussard consented to the search of his residence and, under the totality of the circumstances, that his consent was voluntarily given were not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Randall, </em>887 F.2d 1262, 1265 (5th Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Zucco, </em>71 F.3d 188, 191 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-24\">Because we find that Broussard consented to the search of his residence, we do not address the issue of whether the search warrant was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b773-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
