We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review this claim pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). Tesfaye next disputes the IJ\u2019s finding that she failed to qualify for withholding of removal. We have reviewed the record and the IJ\u2019s decision, which was designated by the Board as the final agency determination, and find that she indeed failed to meet her burden of proof to establish her eligibility for this relief. <em>See Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-21\">We accordingly dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-22\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, AND DENIED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
