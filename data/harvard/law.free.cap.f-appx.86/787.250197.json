Ortiz argues that his indictment was defective because it failed to specify the subsection of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 he violated and failed to allege that he was previously convicted of an aggravated felony. Ortiz also argues that the district court accepted his guilty plea without a sufficient factual basis and erroneously enhanced his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Ortiz has not shown that his claims meet the requirements of \u00a7 2255\u2019s \u201csavings clause.\u201d He has not shown that any of his claims are based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that he may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in his trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Therefore, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Ortiz\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b817-35\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
