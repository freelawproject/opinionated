California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967) \u2014 an appointed appellate counsel who \u201cfinds [a] case to be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious examination of\u2019 the case must so advise this court and request permission to withdraw. 386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. The request must be accompanied by \u201ca brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A copy of counsel\u2019s brief was furnished to Appellant, who was given time to raise any non-frivolous arguments in a <em>pro se </em>brief. <em>Id. </em>at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396; 3rd Cir. R. 109.2(a). Appellant has not filed such a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-23\">The <em>Anders </em>brief has referred us to portions of the record that arguably present non-frivolous issues and has identified the following sole issue: the court may have erred in denying Olmedo\u2019s motion for a downward departure based on his diminished capacity for the claim that his criminal history overstates the seriousness of his prior criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-24\">The policy statement for diminished capacity set forth in the Sentencing Guidelines provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-25\">[T]he court may not depart below the applicable guideline range if 1) the significantly reduced mental capacity was caused by the voluntary use of drugs or other intoxicants; 2) the facts and circumstances of the defendant\u2019s offense indicate a need to protect the public because the offense involved actual violence or serious threat of violence; or 3) the defendant\u2019s criminal history indicates a need to incarcerate the defendant to protect the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13. The district court considered the departure motion and determined that even though Olmedo may have suffered from diminished capacity, he did not meet any of the three conditions necessary for application of downward departure under \u00a7 5K2.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">We are satisfied that the district court knew that it had the authority to impose a downward departure and exercised its discretion not to do so. Accordingly, this court does not have jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Torres, </em>209 F.3d 308, 309 n. 1 (3d Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 864, 121 S.Ct. 156, 148 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">We are satisfied that no non frivolous argument could be presented in the case at bar. Because counsel has complied with all of the procedures specified in <em>Anders, </em>we will grant his motion for withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">For the reasons set forth, we will dismiss Olmedo\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
