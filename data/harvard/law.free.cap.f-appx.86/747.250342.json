Daher argues that the district court clearly erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence seized at his home because the police did not knock and announce their presence before forcibly entering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3109 and the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress made after a pretrial hearing, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings, including its credibility choices, for clear error, and we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous \u2018when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with a firm and definite conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When findings rest on the credibility of witnesses, \u201ceven greater deference to the trial court\u2019s findings\u201d is warranted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If the district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record, we may not reverse it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Daher argues that the district court\u2019s credibility determination that the police knocked and announced before entering his home was clearly erroneous. He claims that one of the officers, Officer Pudafin, admitted on cross-examination that there was no knock and announcement. The single question and answer on which Daher relies, however, were at best ambiguous.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Officer Pudafin and two other officers affirmatively and clearly testified that they knocked and yelled and then waited 15 to 20 seconds before entering Daher\u2019s home. The district court concluded based on the testimony and evidence that the officers knocked and announced before entering. The court\u2019s account of the evidence was plausible, and we will not second-guess the court\u2019s credibility determinations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">In his brief, Daher also requested that we hold this appeal in abeyance until the Supreme Court decides <em>United States v. Banks.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Supreme Court recently issued its decision, concluding that police officers did not act unreasonably in waiting only 15 to 20 seconds after a single knock and announcement before forcibly entering a defendant\u2019s home.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Daher has not argued on appeal, and did not argue before the district court, that the police waited an unreasonably brief period of time before entering his home, and <em>Banks </em>is therefore inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-12\">Because we find that the district court did not clearly err in refusing to suppress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>the evidence seized, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b777-30\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
