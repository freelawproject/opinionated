He pled guilty to Count 1 (conspiracy to distribute more than 100 grams of heroin) and Count 3 (possession of more than 100 grams of heroin with intent to distribute in a school zone). He was sentenced to 60 months imprisonment, a fine of $500, a special assessment of $200, and 8 years of supervised release. On appeal, he does not deny his guilt, does not raise any issue concerning the manner in which the evidence was obtained, and does not object to the manner in which he was sentenced. His appeal is limited to a challenge to the failure of the Government to move for a downward departure under \u00a7 5K1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines based on information that he provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-24\">Counsel has provided a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that in counsel\u2019s opinion there are no issues of arguable merit which can be advanced on behalf of Rodriguez. We agree and will affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence. Under <em>Anders, </em>the defendant is free to file a <em>pro se </em>brief. Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>though he was notified of that opportunity, Rodriguez has not filed a <em>pro se </em>brief on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Under <em>Anders, </em>an appointed appellate counsel who \u201cfinds [a] case to be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious examination of it,\u201d must so advise the court of appeals and request permission to withdraw. <em>Id. </em>at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. Counsel must file a brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal. <em>As </em>explained subsequently by the Supreme Court in <em>Smith v. Robbins, </em>528 U.S. 259, 120 S.Ct. 746, 145 L.Ed.2d 756 (2000), the brief must identify any \u201cissue arguably supporting the appeal even though the appeal was wholly frivolous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 285, 120 S.Ct. 746. This court has made clear that counsel must explain why the issues are frivolous and show that counsel \u201cthoroughly scoured the record in search of appeal-able issues.\u201d <em>United States v. Marvin, </em>211 F.3d 778, 780 (3d Cir.2000); see <em>United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 300 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Under the circumstances of this case, counsel for Rodriguez could not reasonably have challenged his guilt. Rodriguez participated in a transaction of selling, to a Government confidential source, a total of 149.3 grams of heroin. Because Rodriguez pled guilty, he has waived, <em>inter alia, </em>his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, the right to a trial by jury, and the right to confront his accusers. Counsel discusses the one possible ground that Rodriguez may arguably claim, the Government\u2019s failure to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion which would have reduced Rodriguez\u2019s 60-month mandatory sentence under the applicable statute. Counsel, however, recognized that such an approach would be unsuccessful because the written plea agreement between Rodriguez and the United States did not contain any provision concerning cooperation or any Government obligation concerning information Rodriguez provided. Rodriguez did provide some information to the Government, but the Assistant U.S. Attorney ad-vised the court that Rodriguez had not offered information which was of \u201csubstantial\u201d benefit. The Government has the authority, but not the duty, to file a motion requesting the sentencing court to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum to reflect a defendant\u2019s \u201csubstantial assistance.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e). As the Supreme Court has held, a court can review the Government\u2019s discretionary decision not to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion if that decision was based on an unconstitutional motive. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). There is no suggestion in the record that there was any such unconstitutional motive for the Government\u2019s decision not to file a motion under \u00a7 5K1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Accordingly, counsel was correct in determining that there were no nonfrivolous issues to raise on appeal. We are satisfied that counsel has complied with the responsibilities placed upon him under <em>Anders. </em>We will therefore affirm the conviction and sentence, and we will grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
