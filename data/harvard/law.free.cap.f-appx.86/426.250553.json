It is</p>\n<p id=\"b456-19\">ORDERED that the judgment from which these appeals have been taken be affirmed. The district court correctly terminated all injunctive relief related to the District of Columbia Central Detention Facility pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3626(b)(2), because the appellants, detainees in the facility, failed to demonstrate a \u201ccurrent and ongoing\u201d constitutional violation as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3626(b)(3). As the district court observed, the conditions about which the appellants now complain do not approach the objective threshold for finding a constitutional violation under the Eighth Amendment, <em>see Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (\u201cconditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm\u201d); <em>Rhodes v. Chapman, </em>452 U.S. 337, 347, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981) (conditions that \u201cdeprive inmates of the minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities\u201d); <em>Women Prisoners of the D.C. Dep\u2019t of Corr. v. District of Columbia, </em>93 F.3d 910, 928 (D.C.Cir.1996) (\u201cconditions that are so \u2018soul-chilling\u2019 \u201d and \u201cgrossly wanting\u201d (quoting <em>Rhodes, </em>452 U.S. at 354, 101 S.Ct. 2392 (Brennan, J., concurring))); <em>Inmates of Occoquan v. Barry, </em>844 F.2d 828, 836-839 (D.C.Cir.1988) (\u201cconditions of unspeakable inhumanity\u201d); nor have they shown that prison officials are \u201creckless[ly]\u201d or \u201cdeliberately] indifferent\u201d to the welfare of inmates. <em>Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 838-842, 114 S.Ct. 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-21\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
