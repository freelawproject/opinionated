We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review credibility findings for substantial evidence. <em>Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1149-50 (9th Cir.1999). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">The IJ observed that Kaur, who testified in Punjabi through a translator, often answered questions before they were translated from English into Punjabi and noted that Kaur\u2019s demeanor in responding on cross-examination indicated that she was reciting something she had memorized. We give \u201cspecial deference\u201d to a credibility determination based on demeanor and find no reason to discount the IJ\u2019s reliance on Kaur\u2019s demeanor. <em>See id. </em>at 1151. In addition, the IJ noted that Kaur testified inconsistently about whether she attended rallies or moved to her parents\u2019 home before or after her husband disappeared. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001) (inconsistencies going to the heart of an asylum claim support adverse credibility finding).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In sum, a reasonable finder of fact would not be compelled to conclude that Kaur\u2019s claim is credible. <em>See Singh-Kaur, </em>183 F.3d at 1153.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Kaur contends that the IJ was biased. A review of the transcript does not demonstrate that the IJ was biased; nor does Kaur show that she suffered any prejudice as a result of the alleged bias. <em>See Hassan v. INS, </em>927 F.2d 465, 469 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Finally, the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance without opinion does not violate due process. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 850-51 (9th Cir.2003). To the extent Kaur raises the issue that her case was not appropriate for streamlining, the issue is not supported by argument. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir.1996) (issues raised in a brief that are not supported by argument are deemed abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b341-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
