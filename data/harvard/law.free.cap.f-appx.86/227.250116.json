After a trial in which Rutkowski\u2019s three coconspirators testified against him, a jury found Rutkowski guilty on both counts. Pursuant to \u00a7 851 and \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), the district court sentenced Rutkowski to life in prison without the possibility of parole because of two prior felony drug convictions. Rutkowski argues on appeal that (1) there was insufficient evidence to sustain a conviction against him, and the district court erred in denying his motion for acquittal; (2) the district court improperly instructed the jury regarding the permissible use of Rule 404(b) evidence; (3) the district court failed to comply with 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b) prior to sentencing him;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (4) that his sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment; and (5) that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during sentencing. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">First, Rutkowski argues that the government\u2019s evidence was inconsistent and lacked credibility, that it was therefore insufficient to sustain a conviction for conspiracy and possession, and that the district court improperly denied his motion for acquittal on this basis. One of Rutkowski\u2019s coconspirators testified that Rutkowski hired him to transport the methamphetamine from Los Angeles to Hawaii, and that Rutkowski procured the drugs in Los Angeles, transferred them to his co-conspirators for transport, and inspected them on at least two occasions. Moreover, two of his coconspirators were caught with more than five pounds of methamphetamine in the Honolulu airport upon their return from Los Angeles. We conclude that a rational trier of fact, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, could have found all of the elements of conspiracy and possession beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See U.S. v. Romero, </em>282 F.3d 683, 686 (9th Cir.2002). For the same reason, we hold that the district court properly denied Rutkowski\u2019s motion for acquittal. <em>See U.S. v. Carranza, </em>289 F.3d 634, 641 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">Second, Rutkowski argues that the district court improperly instructed the jury regarding the permissible use of Rule 404(b) evidence when it explained, mid-deliberation, that evidence of a prior conviction can be used for the purpose of showing knowledge or intent, but not as evidence that the defendant committed the specific crime charged in the case. The mid-deliberation instruction was consistent with Rule 404(b), as well as this Court\u2019s model jury instruction. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 404(b); Model Crim. Jury Instru. \u00a7 4.3 (9th Cir.2000). Accordingly, we conclude that the instructions as a whole were not misleading or inadequate to guide the jury\u2019s deliberation. <em>See U.S. v. Dixon, </em>201 F.3d 1223, 1230 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b259-13\">Third, Rutkowski argues that the district court failed to comply with 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b) during sentencing. We agree that the court did not follow \u00a7 851(b) when it failed to ask him if he affirmed or denied his previous convictions, and, most important, when it did not \u201cinform him that any challenge to a prior conviction which is not made before sentence is imposed may not thereafter be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>raised to attack the sentence.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b). However, Rutkowski conceded at oral argument that the court\u2019s error did not affect his substantial rights. Under this circumstance, we hold that the district court\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 851(b) was harmless error. <em>See U.S. v. Severino, </em>316 F.3d 939, 947 (9th Cir.2003) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Fourth, Rutkowski argues that his sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole violates the Eighth Amendment. Bound by <em>U.S. v. Van Winrow, </em>951 F.2d 1069 (9th Cir.1991) (applying <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836(1991) to a similar challenge), we hold that Rutkowski\u2019s sentence does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment within the meaning of the Eight Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Finally, Rutkowski argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel as a result of his attorney\u2019s failure to object to the enhancement provisions of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Here, the record is sufficiently developed to permit us to review and determine this issue on direct appeal. <em>See U.S. v. Ross, </em>206 F.3d 896, 900 (9th Cir.2000). We conclude that Rutkowski has failed to establish that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient; we also conclude that, even if it had been deficient, counsel\u2019s performance was not prejudicial. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b258-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-7\">. Rutkowski also originally argued that one of his underlying convictions was not final within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), but no longer presses this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
