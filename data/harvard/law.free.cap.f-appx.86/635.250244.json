After the district court sentenced him to thirty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>months imprisonment, Chipperf\u00edeld appealed. His attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but addressing the propriety of Chipperfield\u2019s sentence. Chipperf\u00edeld was informed of his right to file a pro se brief but has not done so. Finding no reversible error, we affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Chipperfield\u2019s guilty plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered after a thorough hearing pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 11. The district court properly advised Chipperf\u00edeld as to his rights, the offense charged, and the maximum sentence for the offense. The court also determined that there was an independent factual basis for the plea and that the plea was not coerced or influenced by any promises. <em>See North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 31, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970); <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 119-20 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">We find that the district court correctly computed Chipperfield\u2019s offense level and properly refused to decrease his offense level under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Xl.l(b)(2) (2000), because Chipperf\u00edeld and his co-conspirators had completed all acts they believed necessary for successful completion of the offense. We further find that the district court correctly determined that Chipper-field did not qualify for a departure based on \u201caberrant behavior.\u201d <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 5K2.20(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Chipperf\u00edeld moved for a downward departure based on the impossibility of the scheme. USSG \u00a7 2F1.1, comment. (n.ll). The district court denied the motion, finding that the scheme was not impossible and the gravity of the offense was not overstated. Where, as here, the sentencing court was aware of its authority to depart and declined to do so, we lack authority to review its decision. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>188 F.3d 230, 238-39 (4th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 30-31 (4th Cir.1990). Accordingly, we dismiss this portion of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Chipperfield\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
