Diaz argues on appeal that the evidence is insufficient to show that he had knowledge that the marijuana was in a hidden compartment in the trailer he was towing and that the district court erred in instructing the jury on deliberate ignorance.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">There was testimony that Diaz suspected that the trailer might contain drugs, that he never requested an X-ray, that Diaz had looked inside the trailer before approaching the border and that the alterations were obvious to the inspecting officer, that Dias was hesitant in answering the X-ray inspector\u2019s questions, and that the trailer contained marijuana worth at least $1,000,000. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and accepting the jury\u2019s credibility determinations, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support Diaz\u2019s convictions. <em>See United States v. Chavez, </em>119 F.3d 342, 347 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Loe, </em>262 F.3d 427, 432 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The evidence at trial raised the inferences necessary to support the district court\u2019s decision to instruct the jury on deliberate ignorance. <em>See United States v. Lara-Velasquez, </em>919 F.2d 946, 951 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b731-30\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
