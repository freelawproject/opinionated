The district court applied an eight-level enhancement to Rodriguez\u2019s offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) because he has a prior theft conviction for which he was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment, suspended for two years\u2019 probation, 74 days in jail, and a $1,000 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Rodriguez argues that this prior conviction is not an aggravated felony under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) because the sentence imposed was not at least one year in prison. Rodriguez relies on Note l(A)(iv), which provides that \u201c[i]f all or any part of a sentence of imprisonment was probated, suspended, deferred, or stayed, \u2018sentence imposed\u2019 refers only to the portion that was not probated, suspended, deferred, or stayed.\u201d Rodriguez contends that, because all of his sentence was probated or suspended except for 74 days, his offense of conviction is not an aggravated felony. Rodriguez concedes that his conviction is an aggravated felony under <em>United States v. Banda-Zamora, </em>178 F.3d 728, 730 (5th Cir.1999), but argues that <em>Banda-Zamora </em>is not controlling because it was decided before Note l(A)(iv) was added to the commentary. He also contends that Note l(A)(iv) created an ambiguity, as of result of which the question must be resolved in his favor under the \u201crule of lenity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-13\">We are not persuaded. Note l(A)(iv) defines the term \u201csentence imposed\u201d as used in \u00a7 2L1.2(b), but that term appears only in \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) <em>&amp; </em>(B) and is used in distinguishing between various felony drug trafficking offenses. The guideline section at issue here is \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), which does not use the term \u201csentence imposed.\u201d Note l(A)(iv) is not applicable in this case. Instead, the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d adopted by the guidelines from 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a), as interpreted in <em>Banda-Zamora, </em>applies, and the calculation considers the period of incarceration without regard to any suspension of the sentence, in whole or in part. <em>See Banda-Zamora, </em>178 F.3d at 730; \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(l)(C), comment, (n.2). The fact that Rodriguez\u2019s sentence for theft was suspended except for 74 days does not change the fact that it meets the definition of an aggravated felony in \u00a7 1101(a)(43).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-14\">Rodriguez also argues, for the first time on appeal, that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional because it treats a prior conviction for a felony or aggravated felony as a sentencing factor and not as an element of the offense. He acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but wishes to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>see also United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000), and we must follow the precedent set in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Ddbeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b43-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
