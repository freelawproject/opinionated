Pri- or to his deportation, Barrigas had been convicted of a felony drug trafficking offense for which he was sentenced to 180 days of custody, suspended for three years of probation. Because this prior sentence was suspended, Barrigas contends that the district court plainly erred by increasing his offense level for the instant offense by 12 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B). <em>See also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(A)(iv)) (defining \u201csentence imposed\u201d). Given the lack of controlling authority in this circuit on this issue, any error on the part of the district court was not \u201cclear or obvious\u201d and could not have been plain error. <em>See United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162-64 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc), <em>abrogated in part, Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-25\">Barrigas also contends that the sentence-enhancing provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Barrigas acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>he asserts that the decision has been cast into doubt by <em>Apprendi. </em>He seeks to preserve his argument for further review. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b800-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
