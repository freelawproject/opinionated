The BIA\u2019s summary affirmance procedures do not violate due process and nor do they deprive this court of a basis for judicial review, as the IJ\u2019s decision is the final agency determination for judicial review. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832-33 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Bellaga argues on appeal that he was a victim of past persecution and that the IJ erred in determining that he was ineligible for asylum. He also asserts that the IJ failed to adjudicate his application for withholding of deportation. Bellaga did not prove a well-founded fear of prosecution, as he did not show that a reasonable person in the same circumstances would fear prosecution if deported. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 304 (5th Cir.1997). Moreover, this court will not review persecution claims that Bellaga first raises in his brief, as he has not exhausted his administrative remedies as to those claims. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). Although Bellaga based his application in part upon his fear of retaliation by the government for his evasion of the draft and also requested protection under the Convention Against Torture, he does not raise these issues in his brief and they are deemed abandoned. <em>See Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">Accordingly, Bellaga\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">Bellaga requests that this court restrain the United States from deporting him and stay its mandate to allow the BIA to consider his \u201cmarriage case.\u201d The motion is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">PETITION AND MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b753-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
