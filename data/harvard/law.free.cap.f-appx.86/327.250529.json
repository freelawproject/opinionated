We have jurisdiction pursuant 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Agbon failed to demonstrate an objectively well-founded fear of persecution supported by credible, direct and specific evidence in the record. <em>See Arriaga-Barrientos v. INS, </em>937 F.2d 411, 413 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">Agbon, by failing to qualify for asylum, necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard required to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Alvarez-Scmtos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">To the extent Agbon contends the IJ violated her right to due process by conducting her merits hearing with a Tagalog translator, despite her request for a Resian translator, Agbon failed to show that this affected her ability to present her case, or that it influenced the outcome. <em>See Cuadras v. INS, </em>910 F.2d 567, 573 (9th Cir.1990) (explaining that the right to a full and fair hearing is denied only if an alleged error results in prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">Agbon\u2019s contention that the BIA was required to state reasons for its affirmance of the immigration judge\u2019s decision is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 851 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that it does not violate due process for the BIA to affirm an immigration judge\u2019s decision without issuing an opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b358-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
