Christian appeals his conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b303-13\">The district court properly excluded time from the running of the Speedy Trial Act limitation period,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> both with respect to pending motions and the \u201cends of justice\u201d provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(F) and (8)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-21\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b303-22\">The district court did not abuse its discretion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in denying Appellant a fourth new lawyer. The court\u2019s inquiry was adequate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, there was no showing that the degree of conflict between Appellant and his lawyer was so great that it resulted in a total lack of communication preventing an adequate defense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-23\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b303-24\">We decline to consider Appellant\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Claims of ineffective assistance \u201care generally inappropriate on direct appeal\u201d due to the lack of a sufficient evidentiary record.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The record here is not sufficiently developed to permit review. Additionally, Appellant\u2019s counsel was not so inadequate as to obviously deny him his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-25\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b303-26\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to accept Appellant\u2019s guilty plea. Appellant refused to engage in a plea colloquy. Therefore, the district court could not determine whether there was a factual basis for the plea.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Sufficient evidence existed to support the conviction. Several witnesses identified the Appellant as the individual who pulled a firearm out of his pocket and pointed it at a man in the tavern. In addition, Appellant\u2019s ex-wife identified the weapon as belonging to Appellant. No error, much less plain error,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> has been shown to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">We decline to consider Appellant\u2019s argument that his statements to a transporting agent were involuntary and should have been suppressed. His failure to raise the argument before the trial court constitutes a waiver of the issue. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b)(3) \u201crequires that motions to suppress evidence be raised prior to trial,\u201d and \u201cfailure to bring a timely suppression motion constitutes a waiver of the issue.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b303-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-15\">. <em>See, e.g., United States v.
