Lang argues that the district court should not have increased his offense level by four levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) because it already had increased his offense level by two levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4). Lang concedes that in <em>United States v. Luna, </em>165 F.3d 316 (5th Cir.1999), this court rejected the argument that he advances, but he notes that other circuits have held otherwise. He thus seeks to preserve the argument for Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-17\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines <em>de novo. Luna, </em>165 F.3d at 322. However, \u201cit is the firm rule of this circuit that one panel may not overrule the decisions of another.\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>933 F.2d 307, 313 (5th Cir.1991). In <em>Luna, </em>165 F.3d at 323, this court held that the firearms Guidelines permit separate enhancements for the firearms being stolen, under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4), and for the same firearms being possessed during the commission of the underlying felony offense of burglary, under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). Because Lang\u2019s argument is directly foreclosed by the precedent of this court, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b817-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
