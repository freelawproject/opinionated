R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">This is a <em>pro se </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 appeal. Appellant Aguilar-Ortiz pleaded guilty on September 25, 2001, to illegal reentry after deportation for an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). On January 10, 2002, the court sentenced him to a term of 57 months\u2019 imprisonment, three years supervised release, and a $100 special assessment. We dismissed Appellant\u2019s direct appeal by Order filed July 2, 2002. Appellant then filed a \u00a7 2255 motion seeking an order vacating or setting aside his sentence. He argued for the first time that his initial deportation, which followed his conviction for an aggravated felony, violated his due process rights. Thus, he argued, the present conviction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 is defective. <em>See INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (certain aliens could not be lawfully deported unless properly advised of their right to apply for waiver of deportation). The district court denied the \u00a7 2255 motion holding that \u201cthere was not a due process violation that would sustain [Appellant\u2019s] collateral attack on his deportation.\u201d Rec., Doc. 38, at 3. We granted a certificate of appealability by Order filed November 17, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-15\">On appeal, Appellant reasserts his argument that his due process rights were violated when he was deported pursuant to his conviction for an aggravated felony. He also argues that the Government failed to file a written information on his prior conviction as required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. We review the legal conclusions underlying the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion <em>de novo </em>and the factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Mora, </em>293 F.3d 1213, 1216 (10th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-16\"><em>St. Cyr </em>was decided by the Supreme Court on June 25, 2001. <em>See generally </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347. Appellant pleaded guilty as charged on September 25, 2001, was sentenced on January 10, 2002, and his conviction was affirmed on direct appeal on July 2, 2002. At no time did Appellant raise a due process argument related to the deportation underlying his 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 conviction. Section 2255 \u201cis not available to test the legality of matters which should have been raised on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Allen, </em>16 F.3d 377, 378 (10th Cir.1994). Therefore, Appellant \u201cis barred from raising the issue in a \u00a7 2255 motion, unless he can show cause for his procedural default and actual prejudice resulting from the alleged errors, or can show that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will occur if his claim is not addressed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>378; <em>United, States v. Talk, </em>158 F.3d 1064, 1067 (10th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 167-68, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Appellant\u2019s petition does not reveal the cause or reason he failed to raise his <em>St. Cyr </em>argument prior to his conviction or on direct appeal. Thus, Appellant has not established cause sufficient to excuse his procedural default. Similarly, Appellant\u2019s petition does not assert that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will occur unless we address his claim. Consequently, because <em>St. Cyr </em>was decided at the time of Appellant\u2019s direct appeal and, in fact, at the time of his conviction, Appellant\u2019s argument is waived, and we need not address the merits of his claim. Additionally, because Appellant had the opportunity to raise the issue on direct appeal, we need not decide whether <em>St. Cyr </em>applies retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Appellant\u2019s second argument, that the Government failed to file a written information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, must fail for two reasons. First, Appellant raised this argument for the first time in this appeal and has thus waived the issue. Second, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 applies only to drug cases. Appellant\u2019s conviction for reentry after deportation in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b) is unrelated to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b421-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
