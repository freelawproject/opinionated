See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a); 10th Cir. R. 34.1.9. The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-25\">This appeal stems from a continuing dispute regarding a trademark on toothpicks. <em>Pro se </em>Appellant Webb filed a complaint against Appellee Blevins alleging trademark infringement, false advertising, and other related claims in connection with the name \u201cAngled ProPieks.\u201d Appellee filed a third-party complaint seeking indemnity or contribution from Armonds Manufacturing Company, not a party to this appeal. Appellee then filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On February 18, 2003, the district court entered an order granting in part and denying in part Appellee\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>dismissing Appellant\u2019s claims which alleged violation of the Oklahoma Unfair Sales Act and the Oklahoma Antitrust Act. The remainder of the claims were tried before a jury. The jury returned a verdict for Appellee and against Appellant on all counts. The district court subsequently entered judgment in favor of Appellee and against Appellant. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">We initially note that Appellant\u2019s brief is nothing more than his Trial Brief with a new cover page, conclusion, and exhibits. The brief does not have a statement of issues or an argument section to support any issues. Additionally, the exhibits and new \u201cevidence\u201d included at the end of the brief were not part of the record in the district court. As such, we are unable to identify any proper issues raised for appellate review. We have carefully reviewed the briefs, the district court\u2019s disposition, and the record on appeal. We will not \u201cmanufacture a party\u2019s argument on appeal when it has failed in its burden to draw our attention to the error below.\u201d <em>Scott v. Hern, </em>216 F.3d 897, 910 n. 7 (10th Cir.2000) (citations and internal quotations omitted). To the extent that we can decipher Appellant\u2019s arguments on appeal, there is no support in the record for any of his contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">AFFIRMED. Appellant\u2019s Motion to Supplement the Record is DENIED. Appellant\u2019s Motion to Deliver All Work Product and Evidence is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-18\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
