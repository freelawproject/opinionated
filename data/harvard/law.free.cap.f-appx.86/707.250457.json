Amir\u2019s argument to this court turns principally upon two claims: that the IJ incorrectly determined that Amir\u2019s testimony was not credible and that he was previously subjected to persecution on account of his political affiliation. However, the record does not compel a finding that Amir\u2019s testimony was credible. <em>See Lopez De Jesus v. INS, </em>312 F.3d 155, 161 (5th Cir.2002). Further, despite Amir\u2019s claim that his captors had mixed motives for torturing him, the record does not compel a finding that his political beliefs were a cause of the torture. <em>See Girma v. INS, </em>283 F.3d 664, 667-68 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-23\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b737-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
