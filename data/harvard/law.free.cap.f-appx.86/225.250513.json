He contends on appeal that the district court erred by finding that he possessed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>gun \u2014 a finding that increased his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) and precluded a reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(6). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">We agree with the district court that Campos-Banos possessed a gun for purposes of applying \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). The court found that a gun was displayed during the drug negotiations and was in the car during the drug transfer. The court found that Campos-Banos placed his hand on the gun during the negotiations \u2014 a finding supported by the undisputed evidence of Campos-Banos\u2019s fingerprints on the gun. These findings are not clearly erroneous and support the conclusion that Campos-Banos had actual possession of a firearm. We reject Campos-Banos\u2019s contention that the gun was not \u201cconnected with the offense\u201d because it was allegedly not used in a threatening manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Campos-Banos argues that it is improper to enhance his drug sentence under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) because he was also punished under \u00a7 922 for possessing the same gun. He relies on cases prohibiting \u201cdouble counting\u201d when a defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). <em>See United States v. Aquino, </em>242 F.3d 859, 864-65 (9th Cir.2001). That reliance is misplaced. The Sentencing Guidelines expressly preclude double counting for \u00a7 924(c) convictions. <em>See id. </em>(citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, comment, (n.2)). There is no such provision, however, for \u00a7 922(g) convictions. <em>See United States v. Archdale, </em>229 F.3d 861, 869 (9th Cir.2000) (noting that the Sentencing Commission \u201cplainly understands the concept of double counting and expressly forbids it where it is not intended\u201d) (internal quotation omitted). Moreover, there is no impermissible double counting in Campos-Banos\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Romero, </em>293 F.3d 1120, 1123 (9th Cir.2002) (explaining impermissible double counting); <em>United States v. Reese, </em>2 F.3d 870, 894-95 (9th Cir.1993) (same). Campos-Banos\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 922(g) is for conduct separate and distinct from the drug offense. Further, unlike a conviction under \u00a7 924(c), which carries a mandatory, <em>consecutive </em>sentence, Campos-Banos\u2019s \u00a7 922(g) conviction resulted in a concurrent sentence that did not add to his incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">Finally, Campos-Banos challenges the district court\u2019s denial of a reduction under \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(6). His reliance on <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>222 F.3d 545 (9th Cir.2000), is misplaced. There, we vacated and remanded the defendant\u2019s sentence because the district court imposed an incorrect burden of proof in rejecting the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(6) reduction. That is not the case here. Rather, the district court properly denied the reduction because it correctly found that Campos-Banos possessed a gun during the commission of his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b256-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
