On their application, the CMHCs requested that the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) classify them as \u201cprovider-based\u201d participants for reimbursement purposes. The CMS mistakenly classified the CMHCs as \u201cfree standing\u201d participants. The error was later corrected, but the CMS refused to apply the correction retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-23\">The CMHCs appealed to the Department of Health and Human Services Departmental Appeals Board (\u201cDAB\u201d). The DAB dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction on the grounds that the dispute did not involve an appealable \u201cinitial determination\u201d pursuant to 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 498.3. The DAB Appellate Division and the District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana affirmed. The CMHCs timely appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-24\">The CMHCs first contend that the CMS\u2019s mistaken classification of the CMHCs as \u201cfree standing\u201d Medicare participants was an appealable \u201cinitial determination.\u201d The classification of the CMHCs as \u201cfree standing\u201d only affected the CMHCs\u2019 eligibility for Medicare reimbursements. At the time of the CMHCs\u2019 claim, the Medicare regulations did not enumerate reimbursement classification disputes as appealable \u201cinitial determinations.\u201d The classification of the CMHCs as \u201cfree standing\u201d Medicare participants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>was thus not an appealable \u201cinitial determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\">The CMHCs further assert that their procedural due process rights were violated because the DAB dismissed the case without considering an outcome-determinative issue. The CMHCs argue that the DAB should have considered whether the CMHCs\u2019 application had been unilaterally altered by the CMS. Because this issue was wholly irrelevant to the DAB\u2019s jurisdictional analysis, the DAB did not fail to consider an outcome-determinative issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">The CMHCs finally argue that the DAB\u2019s denial of jurisdiction was arbitrary and capricious since the DAB had previously exerted jurisdiction over two reimbursement classification disputes. <em>See Memorial Hosp. at Easton v. CMS, </em>DAB CR 634, 1999 WL 1292903 (H.H.S. Dec. 16, 1999); <em>Johns Hopkins Health Sys. v. CMS, </em>DAB CR 598, 1999 WL 596463 (H.H.S. June 7, 1999). In those two cases, the DAB emphasized that parties on both sides had requested DAB review. In the matter <em>sub judice, </em>however, the CMS did not seek DAB review. The DAB\u2019s denial of jurisdiction over the CMHCs\u2019 dispute was not arbitrary and capricious because it did not contravene its earlier rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b807-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
