The presentence report recommended a sixteen-level enhancement because Nunez had previously been convicted of a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). The District Court accepted this recommendation and sentenced Nunez to forty-six months of incarceration followed by three years of supervised release. He appeals, asserting that this was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-14\">Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) requires a sentencing court to increase a defendant\u2019s offense level by 16 where that defendant has been previously deported after \u201ca conviction for a felony that is ... a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence exceeded 13 months.\u201d A \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d is defined in the Guidelines commentary as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-15\">an offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AK0\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment., n. l(B)(iii). The Guidelines commentary further provides that conspiracies and attempts to commit such offenses are included in \u201cdrug trafficking offenses.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment., n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-16\">Nunez concedes that he was deported following his conviction in a New York state court of violating N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.39, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqV\">Criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree: A person is guilty of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree where he knowingly and unlawfully sells: 1. A narcotic. N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.39 (1999).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-17\">New York\u2019s controlled substance statute defines \u201csell\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-18\"><em>Controlled substances: definitions: </em>(1) \u201cSell\u201d means to sell, exchange, give or dispose of to another, or to offer or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>agree to do the same. N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.00 (1999).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The New York indictment charged Nunez with having \u201cknowingly and unlawfully sold to a police officer known to the Grand Jury, a narcotic drug, to wit, cocaine\u201d on May 14, 1997, in the County of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">When Nunez pled guilty to this charge, the judge questioned him to establish the factual basis for his plea. The following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">THE COURT: Is it true that in New York County on June 5, 1997, you knowingly unlawfully sold to another individual a substance containing a narcotic drug weighing one half ounce or more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">Is that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-9\">DEFENDANT NUNEZ: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-10\">THE COURT: What was the drug?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-11\">DEFENDANT NUNEZ: Cocaine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-12\">THE COURT: Where did this sale occur?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-13\">DEFENDANT NUNEZ: Amsterdam Avenue</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-14\">THE COURT: What street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-15\">DEFENDANT NUNEZ: 141st Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-16\">THE COURT: Was that about six in the evening?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-17\">DEFENDANT NUNEZ: I don\u2019t remember exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-18\">THE COURT: But, it was later in the day? It wasn\u2019t in the morning, was it? Was it more later in the day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-19\">DEFENDANT NUNEZ: In the afternoon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-20\">Appellee\u2019s App. at 17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-21\">Nunez insists that one can violate N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.39 \u201cwithout proof of either possession or distribution.\u201d Accordingly, he concludes that his \u201cconviction does not fit the guideline definition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-22\">We are satisfied that Nunez\u2019s New York conviction was for a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d and that a sixteen-level enhancement was required. We may assume <em>arguendo </em>that there may be peripheral cases within the scope of \u00a7 220.39 that involve neither possession nor distribution. This does not aid Nunez, however. The offense Nunez committed, as described by him at the time of his plea, is at the heart of a statute prohibiting the trafficking in controlled substances. Even when a court applies a categorical approach to determining the character of a prior conviction, as Nunez urges us to do here, there is an established exception to the rule that the statutory elements and not the underlying facts control. \u201cWhen the \u2018statutory definition of the prior offense\u2019 is broad enough to permit conviction based on conduct that falls outside the scope of [the enhancement provision], it becomes necessary to look beyond the statute of conviction. Only in such cases may the sentencing court look to the facts of the particular case in order to determine whether the trier of fact necessarily found elements that would qualify the offense\u201d under the enhancement provision. <em>United States v. Watkins, </em>54 F.3d 163 (3d Cir.1995). Here, the fact finder\u2014 the New York judge \u2014 clearly found all of the elements of a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-24\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
