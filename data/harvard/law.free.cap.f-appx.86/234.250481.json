However, Lopez was statutorily ineligible for voluntary departure since he served four years in prison for a first degree burglary conviction, which precluded him from satisfying the \u201cgood moral character\u201d requirement for voluntary departure. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f)(7) (\u201cNo person shall be regarded as, or found to be, a person of good moral character who ... has been confined, as a result of a conviction, to a penal institution for an aggregate period of one hundred and eighty days or more.... \u201d); <em>De La Cruz v. INS, </em>951 F.2d 226, 228 (9th Cir.1991) (holding that an illegal alien convicted of first degree burglary who served two years in prison does not possess good moral character and accordingly is statutorily ineligible for voluntary departure). Therefore, it is clear that Lopez suffered no prejudice from any alleged error on the part of the INS. <em>See United States v. Esparza-Ponce, </em>193 F.3d 1133, 1136 (9th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 842, 121 S.Ct. 107, 148 L.Ed.2d 64 (2000) (holding that in order to meet the burden of proving prejudice, a defendant \u201cmust demonstrate that he had plausible grounds for relief from deportation\u201d). Although the district court based its opinion on erroneous grounds, <em>see United States v. Leon-Paz, </em>340 F.3d 1003, 1007 (9th Cir.2003), its denial of Lopez\u2019s motion to dismiss his indictment was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The district court did not err in enhancing Lopez\u2019s sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) based on his prior aggravated felony conviction, even though the prior conviction was not charged in his indictment. See <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zapeda, 234 F.3d </em>411 (9th Cir.2000), <em>cert denied, </em>532 U.S. 966, 121 S.Ct. 1503, 149 L.Ed.2d 388 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b264-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
