Larry Bass appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the plan administrator respecting the discontinuation of his long-term disability benefits. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-17\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b879-18\">Bass injured his back while on the job at the TRW manufacturing facility in Rogers-ville, Tennessee. After suffering his injury. Bass applied for long-term disability benefits from the TRW Employee Welfare Benefits Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d), an ERISA plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d) funded and administered by his employer, TRW, Inc. The long-term disability provision of the Plan provided a two-part definition of \u201cdisability.\u201d Under the first definition, \u201cdisability was defined as \u201ca medically determined disability due to injury or illness\u201d which, \u201c[djuring the first 12 months from the initial date of disability, prevents you from working at your own occupation or any reasonably related occupation.\u201d The second definition defined \u201cdisability\u201d as an injury or illness which, \u201c[bjeginning with the 13th month from the initial date of disability, prevents you from working at any occupation for which you are or could become reasonably fitted by education, training or experience.\u201d Finding Bass disabled under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>first definition, the claims administrator\u2014 at that time Aetna Life Insurance Company (\u201cAetna\u201d) \u2014 -awarded benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">The Trust changed claims administrators from Aetna to UNUM Life Insurance Corporation of America (\u201cUNUM\u201d) in 1998. As part of the changeover, UNUM reviewed the status of on-going disability payments, including Bass\u2019s. Bass thereafter underwent a series of tests, including a Functional Capacity Evaluation and an Independent Medical Examination. In 1999, based on the results of these tests, UNUM discontinued benefits. It noted that the test reports and other evidence indicated that Bass could work the following jobs: assembler, dispatcher, maintenance service, and bench worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Bass appealed the discontinuation of benefits, but the Trust Administrative Committee affirmed. Bass filed suit for benefits. Reviewing under an \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d standard, the district court found it \u201cpossible to offer a reasoned explanation, based on the evidence, for TRW\u2019s conclusion that [Bass] could perform the jobs of Assembler. Dispatcher, and Bench Worker\u201d and granted summary judgment to the Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">This court \u201creview[s] the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in an action involving an ERISA claim de novo.\u201d <em>Williams v. Int\u2019l Paper Co., </em>227 F.3d 706, 710 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">The first issue to be addressed is whether the district court applied the correct standard of review. It reviewed the plan administrator\u2019s decision to discontinue benefits using an \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard. Though the court gave no reason for applying this standard, presumably it relied on the following language from the TRW Employee Benefits Book in effect after UNUM became claims administrator (in 1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-11\">With respect to plans not provided through an insurance contract, except for long-term disability claims beginning on or after January 1, 1998 and for claims administered by Prudential Healthcare, TRW Inc., as plan administrator, has the exclusive discretionary authority to construe and to interpret the plan provisions, to decide questions of fact pertaining to eligibility for benefits and to determine the amount of such benefit. TRW\u2019s decisions on such matters are final and conclusive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-12\">Even Bass concedes that, if applicable, this language would require that the district court apply an \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard in reviewing the plan administrator\u2019s discontinuation of Bass\u2019s benefits. <em>See Williams v. Int\u2019l Paper Co., </em>227 F.3d 706, 711 (6th Cir.2000) (\u201c[W]here an ERISA plan expressly affords discretion to trustees to make benefit determinations, a court reviewing the plan administrator\u2019s actions should apply the arbitrary and capricious standard of review.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-13\">According to Bass, however, the discretionary language in the Employee Benefits Book is inapplicable, and thus review should be de novo. Bass advances two arguments in support of this contention. First, he argues that the language cannot be considered because the Employee Benefits Book was not included in the administrative record, and under well-settled case law the court cannot look beyond the administrative record in reviewing the decision of a plan administrator. Second, he argues that, even if the Employee Benefits Book can be considered, the governing document is a 1990 version of the benefits plan (which, in contrast to the post-1998 Employee Benefits Book, did not contain language giving the plan administrator discretionary authority to construe and inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>pret the plan). Both arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">As to the first, Bass is unquestioningly correct in his assertion that a district court when reviewing a plan administrator\u2019s denial of benefits cannot look past the administrative record. <em>See Perry v. Simplicity Eng\u2019g, Inc., </em>900 F.2d 963, 967 (6th Cir.1990) (stating that both de novo and \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d review \u201cdo[] not mandate or permit the consideration of evidence not presented to the administrator\u201d). The case law makes clear, however, that the rule was intended to prevent the courts from looking past the <em>evidence of disability </em>\u2014 medical reports, correspondence, test results, and the like \u2014 considered by the plan administrator; it does not suggest that the rule covers the benefits plan itself, which is in the nature of a contract. <em>See Cassidy v. Akzo Nobel Salt, Inc., </em>308 F.3d 613, 615 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Bass\u2019s second argument also fails. It relies on an Administration/ERISA Rights handbook in effect in 1990 that does not contain language granting the plan administrator discretionary authority. Bass argues that, even if the Employee Benefits Book can be considered, the controlling language is found in the 1990 version entitled \u201cMedical, Dental, Vision, Spending Account and Long-Term Disability Claims,\u201d which appears under the general heading \u201cAppeals Process.\u201d In essence. Bass argues that this section (which <em>does not </em>contain language granting the plan administrator discretionary authority) controls \u2014 not the post-1998 Employee Benefits Book (which <em>does </em>contain such language) \u2014 because the discretionary language in the Employee Benefits Book does not make specific reference to long-term disability claims. Clearly, however, the section on which Bass relies does not speak to interpretation or construction of the benefits plan, but to the mechanical process of filing a claim. Moreover, the post-1998 Employee Benefits Book <em>does </em>reference long-term disability claims, albeit several paragraphs down the page. In the final analysis, while Bass tries to construct a \u201cgenuine issue of fact\u201d by pointing to inconsistencies in the two documents and by arguing that the earlier document controls, it is plain that the post-1998 Employee Benefits Book <em>replaced </em>the 1990 handbook. The only real difference between the two is that the Employee Benefits Book \u2014 in effect when Bass was discontinued benefits \u2014 contained the \u201cmagic words\u201d mandating that a reviewing court apply an \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard of review to the plan administrator\u2019s benefits decision, while the old handbook did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">Having determined that the district court applied the correct standard of review, the next question is whether the court erred in applying that standard. A fiduciary\u2019s determinations \u201care not arbitrary and capricious if they are rational in light of the plan\u2019s provisions.\u201d <em>Perry v. United Food and Commercial Workers Dist. Unions 405 and 442, </em>64 F.3d 238, 242 (6th Cir.1995) (citations and quotations omitted). \u201cWhen it is possible to offer a reasoned explanation, based on the evidence, for a particular outcome, that outcome is not arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Davis v. Ky. Fin. Cos. Ret. Plan. </em>887 F.2d 689, 693 (6th Cir.1989). In the instant case, given the results of Bass\u2019s tests, it is difficult to say that the plan administrator\u2019s determination that Bass no longer met the definition of \u201cdisabled\u201d under the benefits plan was arbitrary or capricious. Bass\u2019s most compelling argument on this point is that he continues to receive social security disability benefits, and the definition of \u201cdisability\u2019 for purposes of social security and that for purposes of the Trust are substantially similar. Even were they identical, however, the determination of the social security administrator would not be binding on the Trust. <em>See, e.g., Calvert </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number><em>v. Firstar Fin., Inc., </em>266 F.Supp.2d 578, 585 (W.D.Ky.2003) (quoting <em>Coker v. Metropolitan Life. Ins. Co., </em>281 F.3d 793, 798 (8th Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
