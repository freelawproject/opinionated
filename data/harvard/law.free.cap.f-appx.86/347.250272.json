R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b378-5\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Francisco Javier Orozco-Borboa appeals from his concurrent sentences of 135 months incarceration, on each of two counts, following his guilty plea to conspiring to possess more than five kilograms of cocaine with intent to distribute, and possessing cocaine with intent to aid and abet in its distribution. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Orozco objects to the district judge\u2019s failure to grant him a mitigating role downward adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 or an aberrant-behavior downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.20. We affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 allows for a decrease of between four and two levels when a defendant \u201cwas a minimal participant in any criminal activity,\u201d or \u201cwas a minor participant in any criminal activity.\u201d Orozco contends that he is entitled to a mitigating role downward departure because his participation in an extensive drug tunnel conspiracy was limited to renting a \u201cstash\u201d house.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">The district judge explained that she declined to grant a minor or minimal role reduction because of the \u201cextremely large quantity of cocaine\u201d (200 kilograms) that the organization entrusted to Orozco, because Orozco accepted the role of actually finding and renting the stash house and received $1,500 from another person to rent the house, and because Orozco\u2019s role was greater than that of Alen, who Orozco invited to reside in the stash house. We conclude that the district court properly denied the minor or minimal role reduction. <em>See United States v. Ladum, </em>141 F.3d 1328, 1348 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.20 allows for a sentence below the applicable guideline range \u201cin an extraordinary case if the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct constituted aberrant behavior.\u201d We review de novo a district court\u2019s conclusion that it lacks authority to depart downward, but we lack jurisdiction to review a discretionary refusal to depart downward. <em>United States v. Rojas-Millan, </em>234 F.3d 464 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">Orozco argues that the district judge in referring to the large quantity of drugs involved and to Orozco\u2019s admitted use of marijuana did not exercise her discretion, but really determined that Orozco was not qualified for a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">As Orozco was convicted of a serious drug trafficking offense, it is not clear that he is eligible for an aberrant behavior downward departure. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.20(c)(3). Even assuming that Orozco was eligible, we note that the district court repeatedly stated that, based on the totality of the circumstances, it was declining to exercise its discretion to grant a departure for aberrant behavior, and accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s discretionary denial of the downward departure. <em>See Rojas-Millan, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b378-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
