The district court dismissed Golfs action with prejudice on February 15, 2001 and entered final judgment that same date. Goff filed her notice of appeal more than two years later on June 25, 2003. Because Goffs notice of appeal from the February 15, 2001 judgment was untimely this court has no jurisdiction to review that order. Goff then filed a motion for leave to reinstate her complaint on February 14, 2003. The district court treated that motion as a motion for relief under Rule 60(b) F.R.C.P. and denied the motion on June 19, 2003. Goff filed a timely appeal from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-22\">After reviewing the record and the briefs of the parties we are satisfied that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Goffs Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b750-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
