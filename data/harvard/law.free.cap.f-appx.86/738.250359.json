The Government\u2019s motion to strike Johnston\u2019s brief is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">Johnston was entitled to an extension of time in which to file an appeal because his lawyer\u2019s failure to file a timely appeal upon Johnston\u2019s request to do so constituted \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d under Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). <em>See United States v. Clark, </em>191 F.3d 845, 846 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 477, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000). Thus, Johnston\u2019s notice of appeal, filed on January 10, 2003, is timely based in excusable neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">Johnston\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 1046, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002). Johnston has either waived the remaining issues he raises on appeal by virtue of his valid guilty plea <em>(see United States v. Cothran, </em>302 F.3d 279, 285-86 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Glinsey, </em>209 F.3d 386, 392 (5th Cir.2000)), or has abandoned them by failing to brief them adequately. <em>See United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 936 n. 2 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">Counsel is WARNED that filing frivolous appeals invites the imposition of sanctions. <em>See United States v. Gaitan, </em>171 F.3d 222, 224 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b769-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
