Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Woodberry claims that the district court erred in denying his various motions to withdraw his guilty plea. Our review of the plea colloquy discloses that it was conducted in full compliance with Fed. R.Crim.P. 11. Moreover, Woodberry makes no claim of actual innocence and raises no additional factors that call into question the validity of his plea. Accordingly we deny relief on this claim. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Woodberry also claims that the district court erred in denying his motion for recusal and that it became an \u201cadvocate for the plea agreement.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s informal br. at 18). Nothing in our review of the record of the district court discloses a reasonable factual basis for doubting the judge\u2019s impartiality. Consequently, we deny relief on this claim. <em>See In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 827 (4th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">We affirm the judgment of the district court. We also deny Woodberry\u2019s pending motions for discovery, to correct transcripts, to supplement the record on appeal with the name of a confidential informant, for a copy of the Government\u2019s information, to hold the case in abeyance pending resolution of outstanding motions, to file a second supplement seeking an audiotape copy of his sentencing proceeding, and to compel a Government response to pending motions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
