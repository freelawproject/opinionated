The district court denied relief. The facts are familiar to the parties, so we recount them only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) we may grant habeas relief for a claim adjudicated in a state court if \u2014 and only if \u2014 that adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d When we initially considered Gray\u2019s appeal we concluded, under our then-applicable precedent, that the appellate court\u2019s failure to apply the pertinent Supreme Court precedent with respect to his fourth claim rendered the state decision \u201ccontrary to\u201d that precedent. We therefore reversed the district court\u2019s decision on that ground. The Court has since clarified, however, that a state court\u2019s \u201cfail[ure] to apply\u201d Supreme Court precedent does not necessarily satisfy the \u201ccontrary to\u201d prong of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), <em>Early v. Packer, </em>537 U.S. 3, 123 S.Ct. 362, 366, 154 L.Ed.2d 263 (2002), and remanded this case for further consideration in light of that ruling, <em>Klauser v. Gray, </em>537 U.S. 1041, 123 S.Ct. 658, 154 L.Ed.2d 512 (2002). Upon reconsideration this court now unanimously affirms the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Because our standard of review is pertinent only with respect to Gray\u2019s fourth and final claim, we combine our discussion of the appropriate AEDPA standard with our analysis of the merits of that claim. As to Gray\u2019s first three claims, we would deny relief even under de novo review.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">1. Photo Line-Up</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">Assuming \u2014 without deciding \u2014 that the five-person photo array was somewhat suggestive, we are convinced that under the circumstances Mackay\u2019s eyewitness identification was sufficiently reliable to have been presented to the jury. <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 114, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977); <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 199-200, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972). Maekay had a good opportunity to view the bicycle rider he later identified as Gray. As an on-duty security guard his attention level was high. His pre-line-up description was both fairly accurate and fairly certain (although Mackay did remember the man he identified as clean shaven, whereas Gray sported a beard). And finally, the period of time between Mackay\u2019s encounter with the mystery bicycle rider and the photo line-up was a brief three days. These factors suggest that there was no substantial likelihood of misidentification. <em>See Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. at 114-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-14\">2. Juror Polling</p>\n<p id=\"b310-15\">At Gray\u2019s request the trial court polled the jury members about their exposure to potentially adverse mid-trial publicity. In his brief to this court, Gray argued, as he had on direct appeal and in the federal district court on habeas, that the trial judge inadvertently bypassed one juror and that this failure denied him his right to an impartial jury. The state appeals court and the district court accepted the factual representation but held that there was no error of constitutional dimensions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>As Gray\u2019s appellate counsel acknowledged during oral argument, however, a careful reading of the transcript shows that the trial judge <em>did </em>poll each of the twelve jurors and two alternates. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">3. Betty Gray\u2019s Hearsay Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The trial court\u2019s inquiry into the trustworthiness preceding the introduction of Betty Gray\u2019s hearsay statements, while truncated in some respects, was sufficient under <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 815, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990), to preclude a violation of the Confrontation Clause. The trial court found trustworthiness on the basis of some of the factors that the Supreme Court has approved as particularized guarantees of trustworthiness, including spontaneity, consistent repetition, state of mind, and lack of motive to fabricate (although each statement admitted did not have all these characteristics). <em>Id. </em>at 818-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">4. Roundy\u2019s Hearsay Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">The trial court\u2019s failure to admit Roundy\u2019s hearsay statements presents a closer question, which does turn on our standard of review. Gray introduced hearsay statements parallel, both in kind and in terms of the indicia of reliability that accompanied them, to the hearsay statements offered by the government. Whereas the trial court considered and admitted the government\u2019s evidence under Idaho\u2019s residual hearsay exception, Idaho R. Evid. 803(24), the court failed explicitly to explain why Gray\u2019s statements did not qualify under that same rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">The Idaho appellate court did not recite the Supreme Court cases pertinent to Gray\u2019s Sixth Amendment and due process claim. It did, however, apply elements of the constitutional standard when it ruled that the evidence was insufficiently rehable to require a reversal of the trial court ruling. Thus, as in <em>Early v. Packer, </em>537 U.S. 3, 8, 123 S.Ct. 362, 154 L.Ed.2d 263 (2002) , the state court analyzed the claim using state-law principles analogous to the constitutional standards. We therefore cannot say that the rule applied by the Idaho state court was \u201ccontrary to\u201d Supreme Court precedent. <em>See Early, </em>537 U.S. at 8. Rather, we defer to the state court ruling unless that ruling is objectively unreasonable. An objectively unreasonable result is something more than an erroneous, or even clearly erroneous, result. <em>See Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 1175, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003) .</p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">In <em>United States v. Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. 303, 308, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 140 L.Ed.2d 413 (1998), the Supreme Court summarized its precedents as having \u201cfound the exclusion of evidence to be unconstitutionally arbitrary or disproportionate only where it has infringed upon a weighty interest of the accused.\u201d <em>See also Valenzuela-Bernal, </em>458 U.S. 858, 868-69, 102 S.Ct. 3440, 73 L.Ed.2d 1193 (1982) (in the area which \u201cmight loosely be called access to evidence,\u201d there is no constitutional violation unless the omitted evidence is \u201cmaterial\u201d in the sense that it might have affected the outcome); <em>Greene v. Lambert, </em>288 F.3d 1081, 1092-93 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that exclusion of evidence violates the right to present a defense where the evidence is of weighty importance to the defendant).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>The state trial court did not give a Ml accounting of its reasons for determining the Roundy statements immaterial and the state appellate court did not reach the issue, given its view of the case. We therefore perform an independent review of the record but defer to the result reached by the state court. <em>See Delgado v. Lewis, </em>223 F.3d 976, 982 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Greene v. Lambert, </em>288 F.3d 1081, 1084 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Our review of the record indicates that the materiality conclusion was not unreasonable, given (1) the defense counsel\u2019s acknowledgment that Dyer had an alibi that had been confirmed by the police; (2) the defense counsel\u2019s stated intention of using the Roundy statements not to suggest that Dyer was the killer but merely to highlight the inadequacy of the police investigation; and (3) the lack of any corroborating evidence tying Dyer to the murders. These considerations support the state trial court\u2019s determination that the statements were of such marginal probative value that they did not meet the materiality requirement of Idaho\u2019s residual hearsay exception. <em>See </em>Idaho R. Evid. 803(24). These same considerations establish that Gray is unable to meet ScheffePs requirement that the interest served by the admission of the evidence be a \u201cweighty\u201d one. 523 U.S. at 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">We therefore conclude that under AEDPA\u2019s deferential standard of review Gray\u2019s petition must be denied because the determination that the Roundy statements were not sufficiently material to overcome the hearsay rule was not objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Our conclusion is reinforced by our decision in <em>Perry v. Rushen, </em>713 F.2d 1447 (9th Cir.1983), which held that the application of a California rule creating a heightened requirement for the admissibility of evidence of third-party guilt did not violate the constitution. <em>See </em>713 F.2d at 1453-54. In reaching its decision, <em>Perry </em>read the Supreme Court cases as holding that \u201ca defendant must show that his interest clearly outweighs the state\u2019s before we will interfere with\u201d the state\u2019s application of the rules of evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 1453. Balancing Idaho\u2019s interest here in excluding marginally material hearsay statements against the importance to Gray\u2019s defense of exposing the inadequacy of the police investigation, and applying AEDPA deference, we cannot say that the state court\u2019s determination, albeit implicit, that Gray did not meet this standard was objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">The strength of Idaho\u2019s interest in excluding this type of evidence is not undermined by the state trial court\u2019s decision to admit the Betty Gray statements. Those statements, unlike the Roundy statements, were clearly material because they were corroborated by some evidence tending to connect Gray to the particular crime in question. <em>See </em>Idaho R. Evid. 803(24) (requiring the proffered statements to be evidence of a material fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">Nor is the strength of the state\u2019s interest lessened by the court\u2019s decision to admit other third-party evidence offered by Gray, because that evidence, unlike the evidence regarding Dyer, was not hearsay and was therefore subject to a less stringent relevancy requirement. <em>Compare </em>Idaho R. Evid. 401 (relevant evidence generally admissible) <em>with </em>Idaho R. Evid. 803(24) (requiring materiality). Roundy\u2019s statements regarding Dyer implicated not only the state\u2019s interest in excluding potentially confusing and immaterial evidence, but also its interest in excluding immaterial hearsay evidence, and the state trial court\u2019s determination that such evidence was not sufficiently material to overcome the ordinary prohibition against hearsay was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">The reasonableness of the state trial court\u2019s determination that the Roundy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>statements were insufficiently material is also bolstered by the imposition by many other jurisdictions of significant restrictions on the introduction of uncorroborated circumstantial evidence tending to implicate a third party. <em>See, e.g., Perry, </em>713 F.2d at 1449 (describing California\u2019s rule); <em>Allen v. State, </em>275 Ga. 64, 68, 561 S.E.2d 397 (Ga.2002) (excluding evidence of third party guilt under heightened relevancy standard); <em>Helmig v. State, 42 </em>S.W.3d 658, 671 (Mo.Ct.App.2001) (same); <em>Smithart v. State, </em>988 P.2d 583, 586-87 (Alaska 1999) (describing Alaska\u2019s heightened admissibility requirement for third party evidence); <em>State v. Soto-Fong, </em>187 Ariz. 186, 928 P.2d 610, 623 (1996) (en banc) (evidence of threats by third parties against victim inadmissible unless corroborated by evidence tying the third party to the crime charged). These authorities suggest that those jurisdictions view such evidence as something less than critical.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Idaho courts do not apply a specialized rule in these circumstances, but deem third party evidence inadmissible \u201c \u2018if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Kerchusky, </em>138 Idaho 671, 67 P.3d 1283, 1287 (2003) (quoting Idaho R. Evid 403). Where, as here, such evidence is not corroborated by evidence linking the third party to the crime, however, it is considered to be of only \u201cnegligible\u201d probative value. <em>Id. </em>at 1287 (holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding \u201cnegligbl[y] probative\u201d third party evidence under Idaho R. Evid. 403). Idaho\u2019s Rule 403 thus embodies a concern, reflected in the cases from other states cited above and articulated by the Idaho Supreme Court in <em>State v. Larsen, </em>91 Idaho 42, 415 P.2d 685 (1966), that evidence of third party guilt should not be admitted unless there is some evidence directly connecting the third party to the crime in question. <em>See Kerchusky, </em>67 P.3d at 1286-87. Given the lack of any evidence here connecting Dyer to the murders, the state trial court\u2019s determination that Roundy\u2019s statements regarding Dyer were immaterial was not objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">In view of the practice of many states and, more importantly, the particular circumstances of this case, we conclude that the Idaho courts\u2019 determination of Gray\u2019s challenge to the exclusion of the Roundy hearsay statements did not \u201cinvolve an unreasonable application ... of clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b310-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-9\">. <em>Scheffer </em>was not decided until <em>after </em>the Idaho appellate court denied Gray\u2019s claim. But given that the Supreme Court itself, in <em>Scheffer, </em>signaled that its prior precedent might include an independent \"weighly interest\u201d requirement, appending that requirement in 1997 was obviously a reasonable interpretation of then-existing Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b313-6\">.
