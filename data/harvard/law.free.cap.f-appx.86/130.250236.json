The victims reported that the Blazer proceeded into the Marina Cove Apartments parking lot. In response, Officer Byars immediately drove to that location. He observed a golden Chevrolet Blazer, occupied by a black female driver (later identified as Shamelle Clifton) (\u201cClifton\u201d) and a black male passenger (later identified as the defendant Thompson), exit the apartment complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The constable followed the Blazer to the Winchester Square Townhomes. After Clifton parked her vehicle, Thompson summoned a young male to approach it. As the defendant handed an object through the passenger side window to that youth, Officer Byars ordered both of its occupants to exit the Blazer. The passenger initially resisted that order. As the peace officer moved closer to the vehicle, he observed a modified long arm stowed between the passenger seat and door. The patrolman also perceived the defendant\u2019s evident nervousness, and that he was \u201ceyeing\u201d the firearm. Ultimately, Thompson peacefully exited the Blazer and submitted to arrest. Officer Byars then seized the weapon, which was a loaded sawed-off Remington 870 twelve-gauge shotgun. Although Thompson initially denied ownership or knowledge of that weapon, he ultimately admitted his ownership thereof to the arresting officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">On October 1, 2001, Thompson proceeded to a jury trial on a two-count indictment by which the government charged that he had illegally possessed the shotgun (1) following a felony conviction in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), and (2) in an altered state absent its proper registration as required by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5841 <em>&amp; </em>5861(d). On the following day, October 2, 2001, the jurors returned guilty verdicts on both counts. On March 26, 2002, the sentencing court imposed two concurrent terms of 120 months in penal custody, to be followed by three years of supervised release. On April 2, 2002, Thompson noticed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">On review, the defendant has postulated that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his pre-trial motion to exclude any testimony by Officer Byars concerning the statements made to him by the two eyewitnesses who had accused Thompson of aiming his shotgun at them. Those two men were not scheduled to testify. In support of his motion, the defendant argued that the subject out-of-court statements constituted inadmissible hearsay; and further were unduly prejudicial as unnecessarily exposing the jury to purported \u201cevidence\u201d that he had committed an uncharged serious felony, namely aggravated assault, in the absence of any opportunity to cross-examine the accusers. The district judge denied the suppression motion, ruling that the subject statements either were not hearsay or were admissible as \u201cexcited utterances,\u201d and that any potential prejudicial effect of the assailed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>testimony could, and would, be neutralized by an appropriate limiting jury instruction read during trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">A trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings are usually examined for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Mack, </em>258 F.3d 548, 553 (6th Cir.2001). An abuse of discretion occurs \u201cwhen the reviewing court is firmly convinced that a mistake has been made. A district court abuses its discretion when it relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact, or when it improperly applies the law or uses [an] erroneous legal standard.\u201d <em>Romstadt v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>59 F.3d 608, 615 (6th Cir.1995). (Quotation marks and citations omitted; correction in brackets). On review of a trial adjudicator\u2019s decision to admit proffered evidence irrespective of an opposing party\u2019s objection, the Sixth Circuit \u201clook[s] at the evidence in the light most favorable to the proponent, maximizing its probative value and minimizing its prejudicial effect.\u201d <em>United States v. Zipkin, </em>729 F.2d 384, 389 (6th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">Applying those standards to the matter <em>sub judice, </em>the instant trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying Thompson\u2019s motion to exclude the contested portion of Officer Byars\u2019 testimony. The district judge\u2019s cautionary charge sufficiently directed the jurors that they were to consider that testimony only as evidence of the officer\u2019s purpose for initiating his investigation of the gold Chevy Blazer and its occupants, rather than as proof that any person had in fact leveled a firearm in anyone\u2019s face. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Levy, </em>904 F.2d 1026, 1029 (6th Cir.1990) (positing that officers\u2019 testimony to explain why they undertook an investigation after receiving a tip is not hearsay under Fed. R.Evid. 801(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Furthermore, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that one or more jurors nevertheless construed the faulted testimony as direct proof that Thompson had in fact trained his illegal firearm at the two out-of-court declarants, that inference would be permissible under the \u201cexcited utterance\u201d hearsay exception. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 803(2); <em>Haggins v. Warden, Fort Pillow State Farm, </em>715 F.2d 1050, 1057 (6th Cir.1983) (\u201cThree elements are necessary for the admission of an excited utterance. First, there must be an event startling enough to cause nervous excitement. Second, the statement must be made before there is time to contrive or misrepresent. And, third, the statement must be made while the person is under the stress of the excitement caused by the event.\u201d). Accordingly, because Officer Byars\u2019 undisputed testimony evinced that the speakers were in the requisite state of mind, their out-of-court statements were valid proof of the truth of the matters asserted, irrespective of their failure to take the witness oath and their insulation from cross-examination by the defendant. <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Alternatively, the defendant has argued that, <em>even if </em>Officer Byars\u2019 testimony at issue did <em>not </em>run afoul of the hearsay or confrontation rules, it nonetheless should have been excluded because its potential prejudicial impact averredly outweighed its probative value. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403 (\u201cAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by consideration of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d). The trial court\u2019s admission of evidence notwithstanding a Rule 403 objection is assessed for abuse of discretion; the reviewing court should indulge a \u201cmaximal view of the probative effect of the evidence and a minimal view of its unfairly prejudicial effect.\u201d <em>United States v. Gibbs, 182 F.3d </em>408, 429 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">On the subject record, no material possibility exists that Officer Byars\u2019 testimony about the eyewitness statements unduly prejudiced the defendant. Thompson had not been charged with using the firearm to threaten anyone, and therefore the jurors made no finding that he had done so. Rather, the jurors found only that he had illegally possessed the modified shotgun. Thompson had <em>admitted </em>to Officer Byars that he owned that weapon, and the circumstantial evidence strongly corroborated that concession. Accordingly, the record contained sufficient direct and circumstantial proof to evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that Thompson had possessed the subject weapon, without the need for recourse to any extrajudicial statement(s) about Thompson\u2019s contemporaneous deployment of that firearm. Indeed, <em>even if </em>Officer Byars\u2019 assailed testimony had been <em>erroneously </em>admitted as violative of hearsay or Confrontation Clause proscriptions, that hypothetical error would have been harmless and hence non-reversible, because no material possibility exists that the jurors\u2019 verdict would have been different in its absence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number><em>Ford v. Curtis, </em>277 F.3d 806, 808 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 846, 123 S.Ct. 185, 154 L.Ed.2d 73 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">This reviewing court has carefully examined the trial record, the briefs and all arguments of counsel, and the controlling law. It had identified no reversible error. Accordingly, the conviction and sentence of the defendant Anderson M. Thompson are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b162-5\">. At trial, when Office Byars testified that two black males had approached his squad cruiser to inform him \"that a guy had put a shotgun in their faces and said he was going to kill them,\u201d the presiding jurist interjected his cautionary jury charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">THE COURT: Now wait just a minute. Ladies and gentlemen, I need to give you a limiting instruction. You have just heard this officer testify, and he probably has some further testimony as to what these two people said. Now, of course, that would be \u2014 ordinarily, that would be hearsay. But you may not consider it for the truth of the matter that is contained in the statement; that is, that two black males walked up and stuck a gun in his face. You don't consider it for the truth of what is contained in the statement, but you can consider it in terms of why this officer took further actions based upon that information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">So you are allowed to consider it for that purpose, but not for the truth of the matter contained in the statement itself. That\u2019s a sort of a legal distinction, but one you have to make.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Because Thompson failed to object at trial to any aspect of that <em>in limine </em>jury charge, scrutiny thereof is for \"plain error.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 52. \"Plain error is defined as an egregious error, one that directly leads to a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Krimsky, </em>230 F.3d 855, 858 (6th Cir.2000). \"Under that test, before an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial, there must be (1) 'error,' (2) that is 'plain,' and (3) that \u2018affects substantial rights.\u2019 If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631-32, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002). (Citations and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">On review, Thompson has contended, for the first time, that the subject limiting instruction was potentially confusing and prejudicial, because its language was not as clear as it might have been. However, the overall message of the subject charge was accurate and sufficient for its intended purpose. Moreover, the defendant has conceded that, if any confusion was caused by the language of the <em>in limine </em>jury charge, it was dispelled during the prosecution\u2019s closing argument, in that the United States \"did inform the jury of the limitations of those [out-of-court] statements.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief, page 15. Accordingly, no reversible \"plain error\u201d resided in the trial court\u2019s cautionary jury charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b163-6\">. Thompson has faulted the trial judge for neglecting, on the record, to conduct the customary three-step examination predicate to the admission of \"other acts\u201d evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). <em>See Trepel v. Roadway Express, Inc., </em>194 F.3d 708, 716 (6th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Merriweather, </em>78 F.3d 1070, 1074 (6th Cir.1996) (citations omitted). However, as developed herein, the government did not offer any part of Officer Byars\u2019 testimony to prove that the defendant had committed the \"other bad act\u201d of menacing the lives of the out-of-court-speakers with his shotgun; hence Rule 404(b) was not implicat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>ed. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Landers, </em>39 F.3d 643, 648 (6th Cir.1994) (remarking that \"the court below allowed this material [the defendant\u2019s stated admissions of other crimes] to be displayed to the jury <em>not </em>as Rule 404(b) evidence, but instead as statements relevant to the overall understanding of the otherwise admissible incriminating conversation[.]\u201d) (Emphasis in original; brackets added). At any rate, even if Rule 404(b) applied to this case, and even if the trial court had failed to follow its procedural mandates, that error would have been substantively harmless, because the relevant admitted evidence did not influence the jury verdict adversely against the defendant, for the reasons developed herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
