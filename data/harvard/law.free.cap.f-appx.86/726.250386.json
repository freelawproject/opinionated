Reyes argues that the BIA erred by determining that, by relying solely on his own \u201cvague and inconsistent\u201d testimony, he failed to meet his burden of proof to warrant withholding of removal under the INA. Reyes fails to provide any support for his challenge to the BIA\u2019s credibility determination. <em>See Lopez De Jesus v. INS, </em>312 F.3d 155, 161 (5th Cir.2002). Moreover, he has failed to show that the BIA\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-22\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b756-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
