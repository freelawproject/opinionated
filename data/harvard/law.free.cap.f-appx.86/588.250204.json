For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Nyonda first challenges the immigration judge\u2019s finding that his asylum application was untimely and that he failed to demonstrate a change in circumstances or extraordinary circumstances excusing the late filing. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B) (2000); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(4), (5) (2003). We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review this claim pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) \"(2000). <em>See Castellano-Chacon v. INS, </em>341 F.3d 533, 544 (6th Cir.2003); <em>Tarrawally v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 180, 185-86 (3rd Cir.2003); <em>Tsevegmid v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 1231, 1235 (10th Cir.2003); <em>Fahim v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1217-18 (11th Cir.2002); <em>Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 815 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Ismailov v. Reno, </em>263 F.3d 851, 854-55 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Additionally, while we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a) to consider Nyonda\u2019s claims for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture, we find that he has waived his right to raise these claims before this court by failing to raise them before the Board. <em>See Farrokhi v. INS, </em>900 F.2d 697, 700 (4th Cir.1990) (\u201c[A]n alien who has failed to raise claims during an appeal to the [Board] has waived his right to raise those claims before a federal court on appeal of the [Board]\u2019s decision.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Accordingly, we deny Nyonda\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
