We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-25\">Santos-Serna contends that the district court erred by denying his request for a mitigating role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 by relying on an uncorroborated hearsay statement from an accomplice. Because the district court specifically stated it relied on evidence other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>than the hearsay statement, it did not abuse its discretion. <em>Cf. United States v. Corral, </em>172 F.3d 714, 716-17 (9th Cir.1999) (vacating and remanding where district court did not state whether it was relying on an uncorroborated hearsay statement contained in a presentence report).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Santos-Serna next contends that the district court erred by failing to find that he played a mitigating role in the offense. Because the only evidence introduced by Santos-Serna in support of the reduction was his own self-serving statement, the district court did not clearly err. <em>See United States v. Ladum, </em>141 F.3d 1328, 1348 (9th Cir.1998); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n. 3(C) (\u201cAs with any other factual issue, the court, in weighing the totality of the circumstances, is not required to find, based solely on the defendant\u2019s bare assertion, that such a role adjustment is warranted.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Santos-Serna also contends that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s statement in many cases that all U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 mitigating role adjustments are to be used \u201cinfrequently\u201d tainted the district court\u2019s sentencing decision and requires remand. Because there is no evidence that the district court based its denial of the intermediate and minor role adjustments on the allegedly erroneous basis that they are to be used \u201cinfrequently,\u201d we cannot reconsider overruling on this ground. Moreover, we cannot reconsider or overrule the decision of a prior panel absent intervening Supreme Court authority. <em>See United States v. Gay, </em>967 F.2d 322, 327 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b269-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
