In his petition, Cousins argued that the sentencing court unconstitutionally varied the indictment, which charged Cousins with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c) and 2113(a) and (d). He also averred that his sentence should be modified pursuant to Amendment 599 to the Sentencing Guidelines because the weapons enhancement he received under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2) and the sentence he received for the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) counts constituted duplicative punishment for the same offense conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-24\">Cousins contends that his petition satisfied the criteria established in <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>Cir.2001), and that he was entitled to proceed under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Cousins has not met his burden of showing that he meets the requirements for filing a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. He has failed to point to a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that he may have been imprisoned for conduct that was not prohibited by law. Nor has he shown that his claims were foreclosed by circuit law at the time of his conviction, appeal, or prior 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See id. </em>at 903-04. The true nature of Cousins\u2019 claims is not actual innocence; he is challenging the propriety of his sentences. Relief on such claims cannot be sought by way of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 211 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b805-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
