On appeal, he contends that the district court erred by ruling on the motion for summary judgment prior to discovery, failing to consider his claims of disparate impact, and granting summary judgment on his retaliation claim. We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, the joint appendix, and the district court\u2019s opinions and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Medlock v. Rumsfeld, </em>No. CA-02-1093DKC (D. Md. Dec. 31, 2002; Apr. 4, 2003). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
