Jacobs, Office of the United States Attorney, Milwaukee, WI, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1003-10\">Corey Sykes, pro se, Leavenworth, KS, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1003-11\">Before COFFEY, KANNE, and WILLIAMS, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b1003-12\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-13\">Corey Sykes pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute heroin, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), and was sentenced to 300 months\u2019 imprisonment. At sentencing the court heard and granted the government\u2019s motion for a downward departure based upon Sykes\u2019s substantial assistance. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. Ten months later the government filed a motion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b) requesting the court to grant an additional departure based on Sykes\u2019s substantial assistance in matters that followed sentencing. Again the district court granted the requested departure and resentenced Sykes to 250 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-14\">Even though Sykes received a departure, he filed a notice of appeal. His appointed counsel now seeks to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), being unable to identify a nonfrivolous basis for appeal. As an initial matter, we note that Sykes does not have a constitutional right to counsel in this Rule 35 matter, <em>see United States v. Kimberlin, </em>898 F.2d 1262, 1265 (7th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Palomo, </em>80 F.3d 138, 142 (5th Cir.1996), and so a motion to withdraw comporting with the requirements of <em>Anders </em>is unnecessary, <em>see Pennsylvania v. Finley, </em>481 U.S. 551, 555, 107 S.Ct. 1990, 95 L.Ed.2d 539 (1987). Nevertheless, we invited Sykes to respond to counsel\u2019s motion and identify any issues he wishes us to consider, <em>see </em>Cir. R. 51, and he has done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-15\">Counsel contemplates just <em>one </em>conceivable appellate argument: that the district court, in granting the Rule 35(b) motion, should have shaved even more time from Sykes\u2019s sentence on the ground that his assistance put him at risk of death in prison and damaged his relationships with members of his family, including his mother, ex-girl\u00f1iend, and children. But this contention is necessarily frivolous because we have no jurisdiction to review the degree of departure awarded under Rule 35(b). <em>United States v. McDowell, </em>117 F.3d 974, 976-78 (7th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-16\">In Sykes\u2019s Rule 51(b) response, in addition to echoing counsel\u2019s proposed argument, he suggests that trial counsel was ineffective at his initial sentencing because he failed to present motions challenging the presentence report. Sykes\u2019s proposed argument would be frivolous because the scope of this appeal is limited to the district court\u2019s ruling on the government\u2019s Rule 35 motion, and that motion was itself limited in scope to the question of Sykes\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>entitlement to a further sentence reduction because of post-sentencing assistance to the government. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CrimJP. 35(b); <em>cf. United States v. Nonahal, </em>338 F.3d 668, 671 &amp; n. 1 (7th Cir.2003) (explaining that errors committed at initial sentencing cannot be raised on appeal from denial of motion to modify conditions of supervised release).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
