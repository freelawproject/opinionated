In 2000, Pesok, a self-described Jewish Caucasian, was demoted from his position as Maintenance Supervisor for the New York campus of Hebrew Union and replaced by a \u201cnonwhite, non-Jewish\u201d employee. Shortly thereafter, Pesok suffered an injury and took several weeks of leave. He failed to report back or contact the college for more than three days after he was supposed to return to work, and, pursuant to a provision in the Employee Handbook, Hebrew Union deemed him to have abandoned his job. Pesok, brought this suit, alleging that Hebrew Union had discriminated on the basis of race and religion in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>and had violated the Family Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-15\">In December 2002, the district court granted summary judgment to Hebrew Union. We have considered all of the appellant\u2019s claims. Finding them merit-less, we AFFIRM for substantially the reasons stated by the court below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-13\">. Pesok's complaints about the performance of his attorney provide no basis for reversal in this civil matter. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Coven, </em>662 F.2d 162, 176 (2d Cir.1981) (there is no constitutionally guaranteed right to the assistance of counsel in a civil case).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
