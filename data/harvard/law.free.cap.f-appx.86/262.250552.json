The order summarily affirmed an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision denying Garcia-Garcia\u2019s applications for cancellation of removal and voluntary departure. The IJ found Garcia-Garcia statutorily ineligible for either form of relief because he admitted violating the essential elements of a crime of moral turpitude, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(a)(7)(B) (obtaining any benefit through false representation of a social security number). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 <em>1101(f), </em>1229b(b)(l)(B), 1229c(b)(l)(B). Garcia-Garcia does not challenge these rulings on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">Rather, Garcia-Garcia alleges that the admissions did not comport with the relevant procedures as laid out in <em>Matter of G-M-, </em>7 I. &amp; N. Dec. 40, 70, 1955 WL 8691 (1956). Namely, Garcia-Garcia claims that he did not comprehend 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(a)(7)(B) as it was read and paraphrased to him, thus violating the requirement that \u201c[a]n adequate definition of the crime, including all essential elements, must first be given to the alien .... [and] must be explained in understandable terms.\u201d <em>Matter of G-M- </em>7 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-14\">The IJ made a specific factual finding that Garcia-Garcia \u201cdid understand the elements\u201d of the crime, which we must uphold \u201cunless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). Strong, evidence supports this finding. After the statute was explained to Garcia-Garcia, the government asked if he understood it, to which he replied, \u2018Yes, I understand.\u201d Garcia-Garcia argues that his next comment suggested the contrary: \u201cBut when-but when I used that number, I didn\u2019t know it was this.\u201d Yet the IJ reasonably concluded this indicated that Garcia-Garcia was ignorant of the statute at the time he violated it, rather than that he failed to comprehend the explanation of the statute. A later instance when Garcia-Garcia asked the government to repeat a relatively straightforward question does not directly bear on Garcia-Garcia\u2019s understanding of the statute. It more likely represents a temporary translation difficulty often present in such proceedings, and is thus insufficient to disturb the IJ\u2019s factual finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-15\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b293-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
