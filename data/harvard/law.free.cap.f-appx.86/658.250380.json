In criminal cases, a defendant must file his notice of appeal within ten days after the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). With or without a motion, the district court may grant an extension of time to file of up to thirty days upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">The district court entered its judgment on June 14, 2002. Thompson filed his notice of appeal on March 18, 2003, seeking a finding of excusable neglect. Because Thompson\u2019s notice was filed well beyond the periods specified in Rule 4(b), this court is without jurisdiction to consider his claims. <em>See United States v. Raynor, </em>939 F.2d 191, 196 (4th Cir.1991). Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-13\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
