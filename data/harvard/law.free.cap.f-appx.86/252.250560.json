We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). Where, as here, the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, we review the decision of the IJ. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845 (9th Cir.2003). We review for substantial evidence, <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 1015, 1019-20 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">Zou\u2019s claims for relief are based on her mother being forcibly sterilized and fined for violating China\u2019s \u201cone child\u201d policy. Because Zou presented no evidence that she herself was persecuted or would be persecuted, beyond her stated intention to violate the \u201cone child\u201d policy, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Cf. Wang, </em>341 F.3d at 1021 (concluding that petitioner had a well founded fear of persecution where she had been forced to have abortions and use contraceptives).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b283-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
