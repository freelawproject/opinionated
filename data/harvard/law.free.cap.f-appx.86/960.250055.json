Mayo, who is represented by counsel, appeals a district court judgment affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of his application for social security disability insurance benefits. The parties have waived oral argument and the panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-19\">Mayo filed an application for social security disability insurance benefits, alleging that he was disabled due to obesity and an impaired back. After a hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) denied Mayo\u2019s application for benefits, concluding that Mayo could perform his past relevant work. The Appeals Council declined to review the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-20\">Mayo then sought judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. The case was referred to a magistrate judge who recommended that the complaint be dismissed. Mayo\u2019s attorney did not file specific objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report. Rather, he filed a one sentence document which stated: \u201cNow comes the Plaintiff, Kenneth J. Mayo, Appellant, and objects to the Court Judgment of Report and Recommendation of the Magistrate.\u201d Noting that no specific objections were filed, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and dismissed the case. On appeal, Mayo argues the merits of his social security claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-21\">Mayo has waived appellate review of his arguments. The ease was referred to a magistrate judge who recommended that the Commissioner\u2019s decision be affirmed. Mayo was notified that his failure to file specific objections to the magistrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>judge\u2019s report would constitute a waiver of his claims on appeal. Mayo failed to file specific objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report. Thus. Mayo has waived appellate review of his arguments. <em>See Miller v. Currie, </em>50 F.3d 373, 380 (6th Cir.1995); <em>Howard v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>932 F.2d 505, 508-09 (6th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
