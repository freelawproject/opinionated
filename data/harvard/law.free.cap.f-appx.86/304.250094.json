United States, </em>886 F.2d 1187, 1188 (9th Cir.1989) (holding that pendency of an appeal does not toll the one-year period).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-22\">Vygovskiy\u2019s contention, made for the first time in his reply brief, that his motion was brought pursuant to \u201call subdivisions\u201d of Rule 60(b), and is therefore subject to the \u201creasonable time\u201d limit rather than the one-year time limit, is contradicted by the motion itself, which states that it is brought pursuant to subsections (1) and (3) and sets forth grounds for relief covered by subsections (1), (2) and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b334-33\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
