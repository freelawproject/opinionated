This court affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See United, States v. Elliott, </em>No. 97-4756, 1998 WL 462801 (4th Cir. Aug. 5, 1998) (unpublished). Seeking a second direct criminal appeal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 (2000), Elliott filed a notice of appeal on September 11, 2003. We lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of the appeal, however, because it is untimely. Criminal defendants have ten days from the entry of the judgment or order at issue to file a notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b). The appeal periods established by Rule 4 are mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978). Because Elliott filed his notice of appeal over five years outside the appeal period, we lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-23\">To the extent that Elliott seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s April 6, 2000, denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Elliott\u2019s notice of appeal is also untimely as to that order. Parties are accorded sixty days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. RApp. 4(a)(6). Furthermore, this court has previously reviewed that order on appeal, denied a certificate of appealability, and dismissed the appeal. <em>See United States v. Elliott, </em>No. 00-6660, 2000 WL 1124559 (4th Cir. Aug. 9, 2000) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-24\">We dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
