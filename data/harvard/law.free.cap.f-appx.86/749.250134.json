Stayton, the appointed appellate attorney for defendant-appellant Gerardo Tapia-Carrillo (\u201cTapia\u201d), has moved for leave to withdraw and has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396,18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Tapia has filed a response brief to counsel\u2019s motion but he fails to identify any nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Although counsel\u2019s brief fails to address several variances from Fed. R.Crim. P. 11 during rearraignment, our independent review of the record reflects that those variances were not plain error and that there are no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, Stayton\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, Stayton is excused from further responsibilities herein, and this appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b779-34\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
