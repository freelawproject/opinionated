On appeal, Canipe asserts the district court erred in denying her a downward adjustment to her offense level for acceptance of responsibility. A district court\u2019s determination of whether a defendant is entitled to an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility is factual, and is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Ruhe, </em>191 F.3d 376, 388 (4th Cir.1999). Canipe\u2019s claim is meritless. Canipe\u2019s false statements to investigating authorities preclude a finding that the district court erred by failing to grant Canipe an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3El.l(a)-(b) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Canipe\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not significantly aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
