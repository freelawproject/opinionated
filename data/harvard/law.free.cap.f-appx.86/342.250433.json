They contend that the stop of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>their vehicle was illegal and that the district court erred in enhancing their sentences based on (1) intentional or reckless creation of a substantial risk of death or serious bodily harm,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) actual bodily injury to one of the aliens and (3) vulnerability of the victims. We affirm the judgments and the sentences. Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we discuss the facts only as they are necessary to explain our disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Deputies Schilb and Renteria of the Pima County Sheriffs Department made a legal traffic stop. They correctly understood that driving an unregistered vehicle is a violation of Arizona law. <em>See </em>Ariz. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 28-2153 (2003). They were also correct in believing that vehicle registrations could expire mid-month. <em>See, e.g., </em>Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 28-2159 (2003); Ariz. Admin. Code \u00a7 R17-4-304(D)(l) (2003). Even if the deputies were mistaken in believing that Miguel\u2019s vehicle registration had expired, it would have been a mistake of fact based on a computer error. <em>See United States v. Dorais, </em>241 F.3d 1124, 1131 (9th Cir.2001). Furthermore, the deputies\u2019 belief in this mistaken fact was reasonable and in good faith because it was possible for vehicle registrations to expire on the 15th. <em>See United States v. Twilley, </em>222 F.3d 1092, 1096 n. 1 (9th Cir.2000). Consequently, the deputies had reasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle based on their factually erroneous but reasonable belief. <em>See United States v. King, </em>244 F.3d 736, 739 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The district court did not err in enhancing Miguel\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s sentences. First, the enhancement under Section 2Ll.l(b)(5) was proper because \u201cthe offense involved intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5). Even though the aliens were not enclosed in an airtight area and could have extricated themselves from the trunk of the car because the back seat was down, <em>see United States v. Dixon, </em>201 F.3d 1223, 1233 (9th Cir.2000), Miguel\u2019s vehicle was carrying more passengers than its rated capacity, and the children were lying down on top of the back seat without any restraints, thus creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury. <em>See United States v. Angwin, </em>271 F.3d 786, 809 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">Second, the district court\u2019s finding that one of the aliens, a five-year-old boy, \u201csustained bodily injury\u201d was not clearly erroneous. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(6). The boy\u2019s unconscious state when he was discovered by authorities is the type of injury \u201cfor which medical attention ordinarily would be sought.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, app. note 1(b). Even if the boy\u2019s injury was caused in part from walking through the desert before Johnson and Miguel put him in the car, they are accountable as co-conspirators for the boy\u2019s injuries sustained in the course of their conspiracy to transport illegal aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">Third, Miguel and Johnson knew or should have known that the young children were \u201cunusually vulnerable due to age.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l), app. note 2. Young children may be more vulnerable to illegal transportation because they do not appreciate the danger involved or are too frightened to assert themselves. These particular children were vulnerable. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>instance, they obediently climbed in the trunk when Johnson put the back seat down, and despite the temperature in the trunk, they did not ask for any water even though Miguel had a bottle of water in the front of the car. Furthermore, the defendants did not need to target young children for the enhancement to apply; Section 3Al.l(b)(l) only requires that they should have known that the young children were vulnerable. <em>See United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>50 F.3d 751, 755 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-8\">.
