United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b939-21\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b939-22\">David Keith Johnston, a pro se federal prisoner, appeals a district court judgment dismissing his complaint filed pursuant to the doctrine announced in <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-23\">Seeking monetary relief, Johnson asserted that his double jeopardy rights, due process rights, and Eighth Amendment rights were violated when he was subject<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>ed to prison disciplinary proceedings after he had been criminally prosecuted for escaping from prison. As a result of disciplinary proceedings, Johnston received an assortment of sanctions, including the loss of 27 days of good-time credit. The district court sua sponte dismissed the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, reasoning that Johnston\u2019s double jeopardy rights had not been violated and that his due process and Eighth Amendment claims were too vague and conclusory to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">In his timely appeal, Johnston reasserts his double jeopardy and due process claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">As an initial matter, we decline to consider Johnston\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim because he does not reassert the claim on appeal. Issues raised in the district court but not on appeal are considered abandoned and are not reviewable. <em>Kocsis v. Multi-Care Mgmt., </em>97 F.3d 876, 881 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">Upon de novo review, we conclude that the district court\u2019s judgment must be affirmed for reasons other than those stated by the district court. <em>See Loftis v. United Parcel Serv., </em>342 F.3d 509, 514 (6th Cir.2003); <em>Brown v. Bargery, </em>207 F.3d 863, 867 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">Johnston\u2019s claims are not cognizable because he challenges the procedure used to deny him good-time credits. In <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), the Supreme Court ruled that a prisoner cannot bring a civil rights action directly challenging his confinement, until and unless the reason for his continued confinement has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal, or has otherwise been called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Id. </em>at 486-87. A claim challenging confinement must be dismissed regardless of whether the plaintiff seeks injunctive or monetary relief. <em>Id. </em>at 489-90 (claim for damages is not cognizable); <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 488-90, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973) (claim for injunctive relief is only cognizable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254). In <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997), the Supreme Court extended <em>Heck </em>to bar 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 actions that do not directly challenge confinement, but instead challenge procedures which necessarily imply unlawful confinement. <em>Id. </em>at 646. Specifically, the Court held that <em>Heck </em>barred due process claims that would necessarily imply the invalidity of the loss of good-time credits, until the prison disciplinary conviction was reversed. <em>Id. </em>This ' court has extended <em>Heck </em>to <em>Bivens </em>actions. <em>Lanier v. Bryant, </em>332 F.3d 999, 1005 (6th Cir.2003). Thus, Johnston cannot challenge a disciplinary proceeding resulting in a loss of good-time credits in a <em>Bivens </em>action because his disciplinary conviction has not been reversed. <em>See Edwards, </em>520 U.S. at 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
