Us-Hernandez argues that he was persecuted based on the political opinion imputed to him by the guerillas who attacked him after he did not pay them the money they demanded. He notes that his mother and brother were subsequently threatened and abused by guerillas after he left the country and even after they relocated within Guatemala. He contends that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution based on his family\u2019s experiences, including a shooting attack on his brother that occurred shortly after the 1996 Peace Accords were signed. Us-Hernandez\u2019s mother and brother relocated after the shooting, and Us-Hernandez testified that he was not aware of any problems occurring after this move.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-23\">After reviewing the record and the briefs, we conclude that the IJ\u2019s decision as adopted by the BIA is supported by substantial evidence and that the record evidence does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 482-83, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Campos-Guardado v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 285, 289-90 (5th Cir.1987); <em>see also Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 445 (5th Cir.2001). The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b741-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
