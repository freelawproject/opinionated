She pled guilty to knowingly and intentionally conspiring and agreeing to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of cocaine base, namely, crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(l)(A)(iii) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; she was sentenced to the lower end of the guideline range, 87 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3281, and we have jurisdiction to review the sentencing orders of the District Court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 3742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">We must sustain the District Court\u2019s factual findings regarding the offense level reduction unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>280 F.3d 318, 351 (3d Cir.2002). We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s \u201cinterpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Figueroa, </em>105 F.3d 874, 875-76 (3d Cir.1997). But where the District Court \u201cwas aware of its authority to depart from the Guidelines, and chose not to,\u201d we are without jurisdiction to review the merits of the sentencing decision. <em>United States v. Georgiadis, </em>933 F.2d 1219, 1222 (3d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">With respect to the refusal to reduce Cruz\u2019s offense level reduction, the \u201cminor role\u201d adjustment provided for under section 3B1.2(b) is reserved for a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, app. n. 5. This determination is essentially fact-based, concentrating on the defendant\u2019s relationship to other participants, the importance of the defendant\u2019s actions to the success of the venture, and the defendant\u2019s awareness of the nature and scope of the criminal enterprise. <em>United States v. Isaza-Zapata, </em>148 F.3d 236, 239 (3d Cir.1998) (quoting <em>United States v. Headley, </em>923 F.2d 1079, 1084 (3d Cir.1991)). Here, the District Court carefully analyzed the appropriate factors and discussed them in reaching its conclusion, noting that there was \u201cno question but that the defendant was aware of the drug distribution process, the proceeds involved, and she was a willing participant of this scheme.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Cruz had recruited and directed the actions of her co-defendant, Perez, and had negotiated the transaction with the undercover officer before her arrest, and had also been observed previously supplying known drug dealers. We conclude that the District Court\u2019s determination that Cruz was not a \u201cminor participant\u201d was supported by the record and was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">With respect to the downward departure sought by Cruz on the basis of her ill health, her addiction, and the inhumane conditions of her confinement, the District Court concluded that although these factors might provide a basis for departing under certain extreme circumstances, a departure was not warranted in Cruz\u2019s situation. The record shows that the District Court applied the proper sections of the Guidelines, and there is no indication that the District Court \u201cbelieved erroneously it lacked authority to depart, or that it failed to consider [Cruz\u2019s] request for a downward departure.\u201d <em>Georgiadis, </em>933 F.2d at 1223 (citation omitted). Thus, under our case law as it currently stands, we are compelled to conclude that we lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of Cruz\u2019s departure request. <em>See United States v. Denardi, </em>892 F.2d 269, 272 (3d Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">Accordingly, we will affirm the Judgment and Conviction Order of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
