R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b332-16\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-17\">Patrick Ricks Rainey appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing for failure to state a claim his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging false arrest, excessive force, and state law claims related to his arrest by San Bernardino police on July 29, 2001. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we review de novo. <em>Barnett v. Centoni, </em>31 F.3d 813, 816 (9th Cir.1994) (per curiam). We affirm in part and vacate in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-21\">The district court properly concluded that Rainey\u2019s false arrest claim was barred by his conviction for disorderly conduct, Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 415. <em>See Cabrera v. Huntington Park, </em>159 F.3d 374, 380 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-22\">However, we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of Ramey\u2019s excessive force claim because the record shows that Rainey was not convicted of resisting arrest under California Penal Code \u00a7 148; rather, the charge was dismissed pursuant to a plea bargain. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). We are not persuaded by defendants\u2019 contention that Rainey\u2019s conviction under Penal Code \u00a7 415 nonetheless bars his excessive force claim. <em>See Cabrera, </em>159 F.3d at 380-81 (recognizing that plaintiffs excessive force claim, if successful, would not necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction for disorderly conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-23\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Rainey\u2019s false arrest claim, we vacate the dismissal of Rainey\u2019s excessive force claim, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-24\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b332-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
