ROSS</p>\n<p id=\"AA1\">Officers from the Dane County Narcotics and Gang Task Force (DCNGTF), while investigating drug activity in Madison, Wisconsin, made a traffic stop of a car being driven by Robert Ross on March 7, 2002. With Ross\u2019s consent, the officers searched and hit a jackpot \u2014 $84,940 in United States currency stuffed in a duffle bag that also contained some marijuana and a \u201cSucrets\u201d tin (apparently a drug packaging container) similar to another Sucrets tin found at a residence on Huxley Street on March 26, 2002, during a search that revealed 170 grams of marijuana. Ross was staying at the Huxley residence with its long-term occupants, Randall Wegner and Lennore Black. When asked, Ross denied any knowledge of, or ownership in, the cash found in the duffel bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-12\">Twelve days after the seizure of the cash, on March 19, 2002, the DCNGTF asked the federal DEA to \u201cadopt the seizure\u201d of the money and commence proceedings to forfeit it under federal law. The DEA formally accepted the offer on April 2, 2002, and commenced forfeiture proceedings by publication of a notice of administrative forfeiture on May 21, 2002.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The notice was also sent to Ross and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-13\">On May 20, 2002, one day before the DEA published its notice, Ross filed a \u201cMotion for Return of Seized Personal Property\u201d pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 968.20, in the circuit court, Dane County, Wisconsin, naming only the State of Wisconsin as a party. The state moved to dismiss Ross\u2019s motion on the ground that the <em>res </em>was transferred to the DEA, thus depriving the circuit court of jurisdiction. On August 22, 2002, the state circuit court denied the motion to dismiss, concluding that the Dane County circuit court had <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction by virtue of Ross\u2019s motion for the return of the cash. So, at this point in time, the stage was set for a potential tug-of-war over the <em>res. </em>But that potential evaporated when the State of Wisconsin and the federal government jointly asked the circuit court to reconsider its decision, and on April 11, 2003, the court did so: it held that the circuit court did not have jurisdiction over the <em>res. </em>And while this was going on, Ross, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>protect himself if the state court relinquished its claim to the <em>res, </em>filed a claim in the DEA\u2019s administrative action on June 17, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">To preserve its ability to forfeit the currency,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the United States filed a complaint for forfeiture in the federal district court on September 6, 2002. Ross was served with a copy of the forfeiture complaint on December 3, 2002. On January 7, 2003, Ross filed an answer, claiming ownership to the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">The United States filed a summary judgment motion together with supporting affidavits, and Ross filed a motion to dismiss the forfeiture action for lack of jurisdiction, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b). On April 25, 2003, Ross also filed a motion in the Wisconsin circuit court, asking it to again reconsider its most recent order on jurisdiction. The circuit court summarily rejected Ross\u2019s reconsideration motion on May 6, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">The district court denied Ross\u2019s motion to dismiss, and the parties agreed to the entry of an order of forfeiture, subject to Ross\u2019s right to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to dismiss for lack of <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction. The final order of forfeiture was entered on July 29, 2003. Ross, who has never been charged with any crimes related to drug activity, now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">Ross\u2019s argument before us is that jurisdiction over the <em>res </em>belongs in the circuit court for Dane County, not the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin. While the doctrine of collateral estoppel might very well doom this argument \u2014 the Dane County court has ruled that it is without jurisdiction over the <em>res </em>\u2014 we need not base our decision on that theory as the district court, in a splendid decision by Chief Judge Barbara Crabb, correctly analyzed both Wisconsin and federal law in deciding that federal subject jurisdiction here is present. We have nothing to add to Judge Crabb\u2019s analysis, and so we adopt it as our own. Her opinion is attached to this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-11\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-12\">OPINION AND ORDER</p>\n<author id=\"b1010-13\">CRABB, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1010-14\">This is a civil action <em>in rem </em>brought by the government to obtain forfeiture of $84,940 seized from claimant Robert M. Ross\u2019s automobile following a vehicle stop by Madison police on March 7, 2002. Claimant has moved for dismissal of the case on the ground that this court does not have jurisdiction over the seized money. I conclude that this court does have jurisdiction by virtue of Wis. Stat. \u00a7 961.555(1), which makes it explicit that state-seized property may be the subject of a federal forfeiture action, and the state\u2019s decision to ask the United States Drug Enforcement Agency to \u201cadopt\u201d the forfeiture made by the Madison Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-15\">From the parties\u2019 submissions, I find the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-16\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-17\">Early last year the Dane County Narcotics and Gang Task Force learned that Randall Wegner, Lennore Black and Robert M. Ross might be selling marijuana from a residence at 2005 Huxley Street in Madison, Wisconsin. Wegner and Black were long-term residents of this home; Ross was living with them temporarily. On March 6, 2002, task force agents visited the apartment to conduct a \u201cknock and talk.\u201d Ross and Black were present but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>Wegner was not. The agents asked for consent to search the premises. Ross consented to a search of the common areas, but could not and did not consent to any search of Wegner\u2019s bedroom. Although the search uncovered about six ounces of marijuana, packaging materials and marijuana residue, the task force agents left without arresting anyone. The task force asked Madison Police Department patrol officers to keep an eye on the residence that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">At about 1:00 a.m. on March 7, 2002, a patrol officer observed Ross drive away from the residence in his car. The officer believed he saw Ross \u201croll through\u201d the intersection of Fordem Avenue and East Johnson Street without coming to a complete stop and pulled him over. The officer asked him for consent to search his car, which Ross provided. Police found a duffle bag containing $84,940 in cash. The police arrested Ross and took him to the station. During questioning, Ross denied any knowledge or ownership of the money in his duffel bag. No charges were pressed against Ross, but the task force kept the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">On March 19, 2002, a task force lieutenant asked the United States Drug Enforcement Administration to \u201cadopt\u201d the seizure so that the forfeiture could be sought under more lenient federal forfeiture laws. On March 20, 2002, Special Agent Jerome Becka of the DEA filled out the paperwork. On April 2, 2002, the DEA formally adopted the seizure. No state forfeiture action had been initiated by the state under Wisconsin\u2019s Uniform Controlled Substances Act, Wis. Stat. Ch. 961, and the state had not yet declined to proceed with a state forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">On May 20, 2002, Ross\u2019s lawyer filed a motion in Dane County Circuit Court for the return of seized personal property pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 968.20, which provides different procedures from those used in \u00a7 961.55.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">The next day, May 21, 2002, the DEA formally initiated its administrative forfeiture proceedings against the $84,940 by publishing notice of intent to forfeit in the Wall Street Journal and by sending a letter to Ross\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-10\">The state moved to dismiss Ross\u2019s motion for return of property on the ground that the money had been transferred to the DEA, depriving the circuit court of jurisdiction. Initially, the circuit court disagreed. In an order entered August 21, 2002, the court concluded that it had obtained <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction over the cash prior to the federal government by virtue of Ross\u2019s motion to return. The court determined that the federal court had no jurisdiction over the money and that any purported transfer from the task force to the DEA was null.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-11\">Undeterred, the federal government filed a complaint of forfeiture <em>in rem </em>in this court on September 3, 2002. The United States Attorney did not mention that an <em>in rem </em>action had been filed in state court and that the state court did not intend to relinquish its jurisdiction. This court issued the requested warrant and proceedings began in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-12\">Subsequently the district attorney and the United States Attorney filed a motion for reconsideration in state court. On April 11, 2003, the court granted the motion to reconsider and found that it never had had jurisdiction over the $84,940. The court vacated its earlier order and dismissed Ross\u2019s action for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-13\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-14\">Claimant argues that this court has no jurisdiction over the seized money because of the \u201cfirst-in-time\u201d rule and because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>state\u2019s attempt to transfer the money was illegal. Although there is some support for both propositions, closer examination reveals that they do not prevent this court from exercising jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">Civil forfeiture is an <em>in rem </em>proceeding governed by the longstanding rule that when state and federal courts each proceed against the same <em>res, </em>the court first assuming jurisdiction over the property may maintain and exercise that jurisdiction to the exclusion of the other. The purpose of this rule is to avoid \u201cunseemly and disastrous conflicts\u201d in the administration of our dual judicial system and to protect the judicial processes of the court first assuming jurisdiction. <em>United States v. $79,123.49 in United States Cash and Currency, </em>830 F.2d 94, 96 (7th Cir.1987); <em>see also United States v. $506,231 in United States Currency, </em>125 F.3d 442, 447 (7th Cir.1997). Once a state court has assumed jurisdiction over a <em>res, </em>a federal court cannot assert jurisdiction over the same <em>res </em>until it has been transferred pursuant to state statute or by a turnover order from the state court. <em>United States v. One 1987 Mercedes Benz Roadster, </em>2 F.3d 241, 243 (7th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. One 1979 Chevrolet C-20 Van, </em>924 F.2d 120, 122 (7th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">The state of Wisconsin has enacted several different forfeiture statutes that apply to different situations. Pursuant to Wisconsin\u2019s Uniform Controlled Substances Act, Wis. Stat. Ch. 961 (first enacted as Ch. 161 and renumbered in 1996), the state may obtain forfeiture of contraband related to drug trafficking, including money derived through the commission of any crime under Ch. 961. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 961.55(2). Section 961.55(3) provides that any property seized but not forfeited shall be returned to its rightful owner and that any person claiming a right to property seized pursuant to \u00a7 961.55 may apply for its return in the circuit court of the county in which the property was seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">Wis. Stat. \u00a7 961.555 sets forth the procedures governing forfeitures under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act. When enacted, this statute (then numbered \u00a7 161.555(1)) provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-c\">In an action brought to cause the forfeiture of any property seized under s. 161.55, the court may render a judgment in rem or against a party personally, or both. The circuit court for the county in which the property was seized shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any proceedings regarding the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">Wis. Stat. \u00a7 161.555(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">In 1993, in direct response to the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>One 1979 Chevrolet C-20 Van, </em>924 F.2d 120, the state amended this statute to eliminate the exclusive jurisdiction requirement. The first sentence of the statute remained unchanged. The second sentence now reads</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgF\">The court for the county in which the property was seized shall have jurisdiction over any proceedings regarding the property when the action is commenced in state court. Any property seized may be the subject of a federal forfeiture action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1012-10\">Wis. Stat. \u00a7 961.555(1). <em>See </em>1993 Wis. Act 321; 1993 Assembly Bill 793 (Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau, 1993 Assembly Bill 793) (because federal, state and local law enforcement agencies cooperate in drug investigations, statute is being amended to remove exclusive state court jurisdiction over seized property so that it may be forfeited in federal action).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-11\">A claimant may invoke \u00a7 961.55\u2019s return-of-property provisions only after an unsuccessful forfeiture action brought by the state under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act. In any situation in which the state has not initiated a forfeiture ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>tion under the Act, or in which the state did not seize property pursuant to \u00a7 961.55, such as in criminal forfeitures in nondrug cases, see \u00a7\u00a7 973.075 and 973.076, a person claiming the right to property seized by the authorities is limited to the procedures set out in Wis. Stat. \u00a7 968.20. <em>In Re the Return of Property in State v. Jones, </em>226 Wis.2d 565, 569, 594 N.W.2d 738, 740 (1999). Section 968.20(1) is a more general statute allowing any person claiming the right to possession of seized property to apply to the county court in which the property was seized; if the right to possession is proved to the court\u2019s satisfaction, then the court shall order property other than contraband to be returned if it is not needed as evidence or if all proceedings have been completed. <em>Id. </em>Section 968.20 presupposes the existence of a case and the retention of property by the authorities for use as evidence; \u00a7 961.55 does not require either of these things. <em>Id. </em>at 584, 594 N.W.2d at 747. If, however, the police seize property that could be forfeited under the Act but never initiate a forfeiture proceeding, a claimant must proceed under \u00a7 968.20. <em>Id. </em>at 585, 594 N.W.2d at 747-48. Pursuant to \u00a7 961.555(2)(a), a district attorney has 30 days from the date on which the property was seized within which to initiate a forfeiture proceeding under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Although these statutes and procedures seem easy enough to interpret and apply, proceedings in this case became snarled quickly because the parties and the court did not apply them rigorously. The county\u2019s drug task force seized the $84,940 from claimant\u2019s car on March 7, 2002. On March 19, 2002, the task force asked the DEA to adopt this seizure and seek forfeiture in federal court. This was within the 30-day time limit imposed by \u00a7 961.555(2)(a) and it comported with \u00a7 961.555(1), which explicitly allows the state to seek forfeiture in federal court. Two weeks later, on April 2, 2002, the DEA agreed to proceed. (The ability to transfer the <em>res </em>to federal jurisdiction in this fashion had not been part of the state statutory scheme when the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit had decided <em>United States v. One 1987 Mercedes Benz, </em>2 F.3d 241, <em>United States v. One 1979 Chevrolet C-20 Van, </em>924 F.2d 120 and <em>United States v. $79,123.49, </em>830 F.2d 94.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">If someone had immediately notified claimant or his attorney that the DEA had adopted the case, it is unlikely that he would have filed his state court action. In the absence of any such notice, claimant filed his motion for the return of property pursuant to \u00a7 968.20 after the 30-day time limit had passed for the state to file a forfeiture action under the Act. Unfortunately, claimant stated in his motion that \u2018Wis. Stat. 961.555(2)(a) controls forfeiture proceedings.\u201d <em>See </em>Dkt. #38 at 2. This was incorrect. <em>See Jones, </em>226 Wis.2d at 585, 594 N.W.2d at 747-48. Claimant erred again in invoking the Uniform Controlled Substances Act\u2019s 30-day statute of limitations as a ground for relief, <em>see id., </em>but that is irrelevant to the motion before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">The state moved to dismiss claimant\u2019s action, arguing that the DEA had obtained jurisdiction over the money. In an order dated August 21, 2002, the state circuit court disagreed, citing \u00a7 961.55(a) (which did not apply to claimant\u2019s action brought under \u00a7 968.20) and to the previous Seventh Circuit decisions cited above that were based on a statute that had since been amended to hold that the purported transfer to the DEA was invalid and that it was irrelevant that the state had never sought forfeiture in state courts. This order was in effect when the United States Attorney filed his forfeiture complaint in this court on September 3, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">When the state (and the federal government) moved for reconsideration, the circuit court vacated its previous order and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>dismissed claimant\u2019s state court action for lack of jurisdiction. The court agreed with the government that \u00a7 961.555(1) no longer required a turnover order; therefore, the county task force could and did effectively transfer the <em>res </em>to the federal government, presumably on April 2, 2002, the date the DEA adopted the seizure. As of that date, the money belonged to the DEA, not the state. This meant that Wis. Stat \u00a7 968.20 had no application and claimant could not invoke it to obtain return of the money. It also meant that the first-in-time rule could not apply because the state no longer had the <em>res </em>and had no right to begin a forfeiture proceeding under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act. As the circuit court recognized, the state court proceedings on claimant\u2019s motion for return of property were void <em>ab initio </em>for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See State v. Banks, </em>105 Wis.2d 32, 43-44, 313 N.W.2d 67, 72 (1981). Although claimant\u2019s state court action was filed 3% months before the federal forfeiture action and remained pending until just recently, it could not and did not establish state court possession of the <em>res </em>or jurisdiction over it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">In sum, the task force and the DEA complied with all applicable statutes and regulations to bring the <em>res </em>properly before this court. Claimant\u2019s attempt to seek return in state court made sense when filed, but because of facts that claimant did not know, he could not establish the primacy of the state court action. This court has had jurisdiction over the <em>res </em>since the commencement of this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">It is ORDERED that claimant Robert M. Ross\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1009-10\">. Oddly, the DEA published its notice in a newspaper-the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>\u2014 -that one ordinarily does not associate with proceedings of this sort. The AUSA who argued the case before us could not say why that paper was used.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1010-8\">. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983(a)(3)(A), an action for forfeiture must be commenced not later than 90 days after an administrative claim has been filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
