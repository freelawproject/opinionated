He was sentenced to 77 months imprisonment and three years of supervised release. The calculation of that sentence by the district court was based in part upon a 16-level enhancement imposed because of the nature of a prior felony conviction. He argues that the enhancement was erroneous because his prior convictions do not qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-23\">Gaeta-Duarte\u2019s conviction under CaLPenal Code \u00a7 288(a) was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under that guideline and thus the 16-level sentence enhancement was appropriate, as we recently held in <em>United States v. Medina-Maella, </em>351 F.3d 944 (9th Cir.2003). The sentence imposed by the district court was not erroneously calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b357-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
