Abner, proceeding pro se, appeals a district court order dismissing his civil actions pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). This ease has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-16\">On February 26, 2003, Abner filed four separate, identical complaints against SBC (Ameritech), Compaq, K-Mart, and United On-Line (Netzero). The unintelligible complaints alleged that Abner suffers from agoraphobia, which has been aggravated through his \u201cuse of the computer under the assumption that its [sic] a personal private PC.\u201d The complaints alleged that the defendants erased some of Abner\u2019s emails, which resulted in the loss of his \u201cfuture employment and a possible entertainment career.\u201d The complaints also contended, without any explanation, that \u201cinvasion of privacy, defamation, and employment discrimination along with aggravated [sic] personal injury is prevalent.\u201d Abner sought monetary relief in the amount of twenty million dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-18\">The district court granted Abner\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis and summarily dismissed his complaints as frivolous pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2). Abner now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-19\">We review de novo a district court order dismissing a complaint as frivolous under \u00a7 1915(e)(2). <em>Brown v. Bargery, </em>207 F.3d 863, 866 (6th Cir.2000). A complaint \u201cis frivolous where it lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u201d <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989); <em>see also Lawler v. Marshall, </em>898 F.2d 1196, 1198 (6th Cir.1990). A complaint lacks an arguable or rational basis in law \u201cif it is based on legal theories that are indisputably meritless.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>207 F.3d at 866. A complaint lacks an arguable or rational basis in fact if it describes \u201cfantastic or delusional scenarios.\u201d <em>Neitzke, </em>490 U.S. at 327-28,109 S.Ct. 1827.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-20\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Abner\u2019s complaints, as they lacked an arguable basis in law or fact. The complaints were completely incomprehensible and contained no legal theories upon which a valid federal claim may rest. In addition, the factual allegations made in Abner\u2019s complaints, to the extent that they could be deciphered, were delusional. Thus, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>under the most liberal construction, Abner\u2019s complaints were frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order is affirmed.
