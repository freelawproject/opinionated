Coles cannot appeal this order unless a circuit judge or justice issues a certificate of appealability, and a certificate of appealability will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>not issue absent a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A habeas appellant meets this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 326, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude Coles has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny Coles\u2019 motion for injunctive relief, deny a certificate of appealability, and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts, and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
