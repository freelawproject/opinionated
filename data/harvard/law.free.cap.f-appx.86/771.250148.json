Over the past several years, Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd have burdened this court and the district court with numerous motions and briefs apparently designed to obstruct the seizure of their real property for nonpayment of property taxes. This strategy finally forced the district court to dismiss all pending cases filed by the Lloyds in the bankruptcy and district courts of the Southern District of Texas and to impose pre-filing restrictions requiring the Lloyds to obtain the court\u2019s permission before filing any new letters or pleadings. A panel of this court affirmed that order, dismissed the Lloyds\u2019 appeal as frivolous, and imposed sanctions. The panel also ordered the clerk not to accept any further filings from the Lloyds until they had paid the sanctions. Although the Lloyds have failed to pay the sanctions, the clerk\u2019s office accepted the Lloyd\u2019s latest brief and motions because they had filed the notice of appeal in the present appeal prior to the imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-21\">This latest brief and the motions that accompany it are largely incomprehensible. To the extent the Lloyds have renewed their objections to the district court order striking their pleadings, we have already rejected those arguments as frivolous. To the extent the Lloyds raise new issues, we can discern no argument meritorious enough to warrant analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-22\">We once again DISMISS the Lloyd\u2019s appeals and all pending motions as frivolous and entirely without merit. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The clerk of this court will accept no further filings by the Lloyds until they have paid the outstanding sanc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>tions. Should the Lloyds feel inclined to persist in filing frivolous appeals, we once again warn them that this court has the authority to sanction appellants on its own motion. <em>See Conner v. Travis County, </em>209 F.3d 794, 801 (5th Cir.2000). We will not hesitate to exercise that authority if necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b801-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
