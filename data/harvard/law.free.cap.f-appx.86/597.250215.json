Our review of the record and the district court\u2019s opinion discloses no reversible error. Accordingly, although we grant Gray\u2019s motion to proceed in for-ma pauperis on appeal, we deny Gray\u2019s motion for a stay and affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Gray v. Cohen, </em>No. CA-99-255-3 (E.D. Va. June 12, 2003). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
