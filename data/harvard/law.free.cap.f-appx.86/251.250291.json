We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">We lack jurisdiction to review the determination that no \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d excused Ortega\u2019s untimely filing of his asylum application. <em>Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 815 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 over the remainder of Ortega\u2019s petition. We review for substantial evidence the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal, <em>Hakeem, </em>273 F.3d at 816, and relief under the Convention Against Torture, <em>Zheng v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 1186, 1193 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination because Ortega\u2019s inconsistent accounts about whether he was physically harmed in Mexico go to the heart of his withholding of removal claim. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Ortega\u2019s tarnished testimony, and scant corroborating evidence, and the country conditions evidence in the record, did not show that Ortega would \u201cmore likely than not\u201d be tortured upon his return to Mexico. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, Ortega\u2019s request for CAT relief was properly denied. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">PETITION DISMISSED in part AND DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b282-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
