We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a. <em>Ordonez v. INS, </em>345 F.3d 777, 779 (9th Cir.2003). We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, <em>id. </em>at 782, and whether a deportation proceeding violated due process de novo, <em>Larita-Martinez v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1092, 1095 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-15\">We are not persuaded by Susano\u2019s contentions that the BIA did not consider his additional evidence because the BIA\u2019s order stated that it considered Susano\u2019s argument in support of reopening. <em>See Laritar-Martinez, </em>220 F.3d at 1096 (concluding petitioner did not overcome presumption that BIA reviewed evidence; BIA reviewed \u201ccontentions on appeal,\u201d which included arguments regarding supplemental evidence). Moreover, Susano has not shown substantial prejudice as he has not demonstrated how the evidence would have affected the outcome of the proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b344-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
