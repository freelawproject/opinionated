We dismiss the appeal of those claims. To the extent plaintiff attempted to state a claim of malicious prosecution under \u00a7 1983 upon these facts and the order of the district court allowed the claim of malicious prosecution to proceed, we must reverse. As we recently explained in an opinion filed after the district court\u2019s order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-22\">\u201cMalicious prosecution\u201d standing alone is no violation of the United States Constitution, and ... to proceed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 such a claim must rest upon a denial of rights secured under federal and not state law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-23\">Plaintiffs claims of false arrest and detention in violation of the Fourth Amendment are the sole federal claims. The district court has jurisdiction over the state law claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367. The district court may choose to require plaintiff to amend his pleadings separating his state and federal claims. We express no opinion regarding the merits of the claims before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-24\">AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b798-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b798-26\">. The dismissal of claims on other grounds is not before us, and we express no opinion in that regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b798-27\">. <em>Castellano </em>v. <em>Fragozo, </em>352 F.3d 939, 942 (5th Cir.2003) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
