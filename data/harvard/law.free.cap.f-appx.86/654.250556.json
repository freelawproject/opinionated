The order affirmed, without opinion, the immigration judge\u2019s order denying Yimam\u2019s applications for asylum and withholding of removal. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">Yimam challenges the immigration judge\u2019s finding that she failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution. The decision to grant or deny asylum relief is conclusive \u201cunless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D) (2000). We conclude that the record supports the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that Yimam failed to establish her eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2003); <em>Gonahasa v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 538, 541 (4th Cir.1999). As the decision in this case is not manifestly contrary to law, we cannot grant the relief that Yimam seeks. Accordingly, we deny Yimam\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
