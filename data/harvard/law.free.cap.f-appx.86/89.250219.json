New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The defendant Covington, who has one prior felony drug conviction, was sentenced before <em>Apprendi </em>was decided, and the case was pending on appeal when <em>Apprendi </em>was decided. On March 21, 2001, we remanded this criminal appeal for re-sentencing under <em>Apprendi </em>After the remand the District Court sentenced the defendant to 97 months, apparently relying on 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D). As counsel for defendant states at page 7 of his brief, the \u201conly issue presented in this appeal is the effect of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>on appellant\u2019s sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-19\">Here the defendant Covington was only charged in Count 1 of the indictment in this case. That count says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-20\">Beginning on or about January, 1996, and continuing up to and including December, 1997, in Campbell and Kenton Counties, in the Eastern District of Kentucky and elsewhere,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>RICK HAY JIMMY KLOPFER DAVID KORDENBROCK BRIAN SPAULDING ERIC COVINGTON BEVERLY ALLEN KING</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">defendants herein, did knowingly and intentionally conspire with Anthony Rademaker, John Kevan Hay, David Durso, Bonnie Hay, and Jerry Baggs, and each other and others known to the grand jury <em>to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute a measurable quantity of marijuana, </em>a Schedule I controlled substance, as defined by Title 21, United States Code, Section 812, in violation of Title 21, United States Code, Section 841(a)(1), all in violation of Title 21, United States Code, Section 846.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"At\">Thus, the Count contains no allegation concerning a quantity of marijuana other than \u201ca measurable amount\u201d and although it charges \u201cdistribution,\u201d it does not charge that the distribution was for \u201cremuneration\u201d or for \u201cno remuneration.\u201d The <em>Apprendi </em>problem here arises because there is an ascending set of sentences for marijuana distribution in \u00a7 841 with maximum penalties as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">1. Section 841(b)(4) says:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(D) of this subsection, any person who violates subsection (a) of this section by <em>distributing a small amount of marijuana for no remuneration </em>shall be treated as provided in \u00a7 844 of this title .... (emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Section 844 which sets out penalties for \u201cpossession\u201d provides for a sentence of a defendant with a prior drug felony of \u201cnot less than 15 days but not more than two years.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\">2. Section 841(b)(1)(D) says:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-10\">In the case of less than 50 kilograms of marijuana ... such person shall, except as provided in paragraphs 4 and 5 of this subsection, be sentenced to not more than five years.... If any person commits such a violation after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final, such person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not more than ten years....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">3. Section 841(b)(1)(B) provides that for \u201c100 or more\u201d kilos of marijuana the sentence shall be not less than 10 years for a person with a prior felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">4. Section 841(b)(1)(A) provides that for \u201c1,000 or more\u201d kilos the sentence shall be not less than 20 years for a person with a prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-14\">The defendant, with one prior felony conviction, argues that since \u201cremuneration\u201d is not charged and only a \u201cmeasurable amount\u201d is charged, he should be sentenced only under \u00a7 841(b)(4) which provides in his case for a maximum penalty of two years, instead of the 97 months the District Court imposed under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D). He argues that a \u201csmall amount\u201d is necessarily included in a \u201cmeasurable amount,\u201d the words of the indictment, and that \u201cdistributing ... without remuneration\u201d is necessarily included within \u201cdistribute and possess,\u201d the words used in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-15\">Given the language of <em>Apprendi, </em>this argument is certainly plausible. But it has previously been specifically rejected by this Court in <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>317 F.3d 597 (6th Cir.2003), a case we are required to follow. <em>See United States v. Dunlap, </em>209 F.3d 472, 481 (6th Cir.2000). In a later unpublished opinion the Court explained <em>Campbell </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-16\">[T]he allegations contained in Laakkonen\u2019s indictment, especially the averments that she possessed marijuana with intent to distribute in concert with several accomplices, are inherently inconsistent with the \u201cmisdemeanor\u201d scenario patently envisioned by Congress underlying \u00a7 841(b)(4), to wit, the gratuitous \u201csocial\u201d distribution of a joint or two to a fellow drug abuser. Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>the district judge correctly ruled that the 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D) \u201cdefault\u201d statutory maximum range of sixty months controlled Laakkonen\u2019s sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><em>United States v. Laakkonen, </em>59 Fed.Appx. 90, 2003 WL 343291, 2003 U.S.App. LEXIS 2752, at *13-14 (6th Cir. Feb. 12, 2003) (Krupanky, Siler, Cole).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Thus we must conclude based on these cases that the District Court properly found (b)(1)(D) as the correct \u201cdefault\u201d statutory provision and sentenced defendant accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">As to defendant\u2019s downward departure argument, we conclude that the district judge was aware of his authority in this respect and that the claim is not appealable. <em>See United States v. McGahee, </em>257 F.3d 520, 531-32 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The judgment of the District Court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
