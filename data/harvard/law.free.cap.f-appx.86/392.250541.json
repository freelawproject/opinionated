R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1. The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-20\">\n<em>I. BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b423-21\">Leobardo Cruz-Mendez pleaded guilty to illegal re-entry of a previously removed alien, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. Though Mr. Cruz-Mendez had a base offense level of eight, the district court applied a sixteen-level enhancement because Mr. Cruz-Mendez was deported after conviction of an aggravated felony. The court also granted Mr. Cruz-Mendez a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, leaving him with a total offense level of twenty-one. On January 14, 2003, the district court sentenced Mr. Cruz-Mendez to sixty-four months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by thirty-six months\u2019 supervised release. This sentence falls within the middle of the fifty-seven to seventy-one month range provided by the Sentencing Guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>lines based on Mr. Cruz-Mendez\u2019s offense level of twenty-one and his criminal history category of IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Mr. Cruz-Mendez now appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in (1) calculating his sentencing guideline range, (2) imposing a sentence in the middle of the guideline range, and (3) ordering his sentence to run consecutively to a previously imposed sentence for violation of supervised release. Mr. Cruz-Mendez also argues that his counsel was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Mr. Cruz-Mendez\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has moved for leave to withdraw as counsel. The certificate of service indicates that Mr. Cruz-Mendez has been served with the brief and motion; no response has been received from him, and the government has declined to file a response brief. We grant leave to withdraw and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">\n<em>II. DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\"><em>Anders </em>holds that \u201cif counsel finds his case to be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious-examination of it, he should so advise the court and request permission to withdraw.\u201d 386 U.S. at 744. Counsel\u2019s request to withdraw must \u201cbe accompanied by a brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal,\u201d and a copy of this brief must be served on the client. <em>Id. </em>Upon receiving an <em>Anders </em>brief, this court \u201cproceeds, after a full examination of all the proceedings, to decide whether the case is wholly frivolous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have fully examined the proceedings as required by <em>Anders </em>and conclude that this appeal is wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">In calculating Mr. Cruz-Mendez\u2019s sentencing guideline range, the district court properly applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, which establishes a base offense level of eight for aliens who illegally reenter the United States, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a), and provides for a sixteen-level enhancement if the defendant has previously been convicted of \u201ca drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). Mr. Cruz-Mendez\u2019s 1995 conviction for possession of a controlled. substance with intent to distribute, for which he was sentenced to twenty-fours months\u2019 imprisonment, qualified him for the sixteen-level enhancement. The district court also correctly calculated Mr. Cruz-Mendez\u2019s criminal history category. The court determined that Mr. Cruz-Mendez had four criminal history points based on two prior drug convictions and then added two points because Mr. Cruz-Mendez committed the offense while under supervised release, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d), and one additional point because the offense was committed less than two years after he was released from custody. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">The court\u2019s imposition of a sentence in the middle of the guideline range was also proper. Though the United States did recommend as a part of the plea agreement that Mr. Cruz-Mendez be sentenced at the low end of the guideline range, that recommendation did not limit the court\u2019s discretion to sentence Mr. Cruz-Mendez within the guideline range. The sixty-four month sentence imposed was well within that range. Mr. Cruz-Mendez argues that the court should have explained its reasons for sentencing him in the middle rather than the low end of the guideline range; however, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) only requires a court to state its reasons for imposing a particular sentence when the sentence is outside the range or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>the range exceeds twenty-four months. That is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">At the time that he committed the instant offense, Mr. Cruz-Mendez was serving a term of supervised release for his 1995 drug conviction. As a result of his illegal reentry, Mr. Cruz-Mendez\u2019s supervised release was revoked, and he was sentenced to nine months\u2019 imprisonment. Mr. Cruz-Mendez argues that the district court should have ordered his sentence for illegal reentry to run concurrently with his sentence for violation of supervised release, since both sentences were based on the same underlying conduct. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b) (2002) (calling for concurrent sentencing when an \u201cundischarged term of imprisonment resulted from offense(s) that have been fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cU.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b)\u2019s central aim is to ensure no defendant is punished twice for the same crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Moyer, </em>282 F.3d 1311, 1316 (10th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">In <em>Moyer, </em>we declined to apply U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b) where a defendant\u2019s conduct resulted in revocation of a term of probation and an additional sentence, because the original term of probation stemmed from a separate offense. <em>Id. </em>at 1317; <em>see also United States v. Tisdale, </em>248 F.3d 964, 976-77 (10th Cir.2001) (finding that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c) provides the district court with the discretion to sentence a defendant consecutively or concurrently where the conduct giving rise to the instant offense resulted in revocation of probation). Moreover, at the time of Mr. Cruz-Mendez\u2019s sentencing, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3, Application Note 6 (2002) specifically provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-10\">[i]f the defendant was on federal or state probation, parole, or supervised release at the time of the instant offense, and has had such probation, parole, or supervised release revoked, the sentence for the instant offense should be imposed to run consecutively to the term imposed for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised release.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-11\"><em>See also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f) (policy statement) (\u201cAny term of imprisonment imposed upon the revocation of probation or supervised release shall be ordered to be served consecutively to any sentence that the defendant is serving, whether or not the sentence of imprisonment being served resulted from the same conduct that is the basis of the revocation of probation or supervised release.\u201d). Consequently, the district court was well within its discretion to order Mr. Cruz-Mendez\u2019s sentence for illegal reentry to run consecutively to his sentence for violation of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>As to Mr. Cruz-Mendez\u2019s ineffective assistance claim, we have held that, generally, \u201c[ijneffective assistance of counsel claims should be brought in collateral proceedings, not on direct appeal. Such claims brought on direct appeal are presumptively dismissible, and virtually all will be dismissed.\u201d <em>United States v. Galloway, 56 </em>F.3d 1239, 1240 (10th Cir.1995); <em>see also Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 1694, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003) (\u201cIn light of the way our system has developed, in most cases a motion brought under \u00a7 2255 is preferable to direct appeal for deciding claims of ineffective-assistance.\u201d). We therefore decline to consider Mr. Cruz-Mendez\u2019s ineffective assistance claim in this direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">After careful review of the proceedings, we agree with counsel that no non-frivolous grounds for appeal appear on this record. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the conviction and GRANT Mr. Cruz-Mendez\u2019s counsel\u2019s request to withdraw. We DISMISS Mr. Cruz-Mendez\u2019s claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b423-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-7\">. Section 5G1.3(b) was amended effective November 1, 2003.
