Stewart, </em>340 F.3d 933, 939 (9th Cir.2003). In doing so, however, we must observe the deferential standard for review of state court determinations under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). Under the AEDPA, the state court\u2019s determination is entitled to deference if it was not \u201ccontrary to, or ... an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-18\">A state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law only \u201cif the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in [Supreme Court] cases\u201d or \u201cif the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Supreme] Court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from [Supreme Court] precedent.\u201d <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 1173, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the California Court of Appeal in <em>People v. Brown, </em>75 Cal.App.4th 916, 89 Cal.Rptr.2d 589 (1999), relied on <em>Castaneda v. Partida, </em>430 U.S. 482, 97 S.Ct. 1272, 51 L.Ed.2d 498 (1977), to conclude that the state adequately rebutted the prima facie case of discrimination to defeat Brown\u2019s equal protection claim. <em>Brown, </em>89 Cal. Rptr.2d at 594-98. Because the facts of Brown\u2019s case are \u201cmaterially indistinguishable\u201d from the facts in that case, the state court\u2019s reliance on <em>Castaneda </em>was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of <em>Castaneda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">On Brown\u2019s due process claim, the state appellate court held that, even assuming that the duties of a grand jury foreperson under California law differ from those of the federal counterpart, Brown had failed to show that he suffered actual prejudice from the manner in which the foreperson was selected. <em>Brown, </em>89 Cal.Rptr.2d at 599-600. This decision also was not an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of or contrary to clearly established federal law, as set forth in <em>Hobby v. United States, </em>468 U.S. 339, 345, 104 S.Ct. 3093, 82 L.Ed.2d 260 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court denying Brown\u2019s petition for habeas corpus is</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b287-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b287-19\">.
