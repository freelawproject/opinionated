We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Pedro-Mateo v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.2000), and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-24\">Petitioner testified that he fears returning to Guatemala because he witnessed guerrillas kill his father, a member of the civil defense, during an armed conflict. The evidence presented does not establish that the potential persecutors imputed or would impute any political opinion to him. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (noting petitioner must establish a well-founded fear of persecution because of a political opinion). Accordingly, the record does not compel the conclusion that petitioner was persecuted or reasonably fears persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1487, 1490 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-25\">As petitioner has failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he has necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 960-61 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-26\">Petitioner\u2019s contention that the BIA\u2019s opinion insufficiently articulated its reasons for denying relief is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 848-49 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-27\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b351-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
