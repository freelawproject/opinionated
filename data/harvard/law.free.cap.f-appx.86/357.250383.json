Because we find that the BIA did not err in its decision, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Petitioner is a native of Mexico who first entered the United States without inspection on or about June 1, 1989. On March 22, 2000, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) issued a Notice to Appear charging petitioner with being subject to removal from the United States under the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). Petitioner subsequently applied for cancellation of removal, and a hearing was held on his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">At the hearing, petitioner conceded that he had been detained by Immigration authorities in the United States no fewer than three times, in 1992, 1994, and 1999. Each of these times, petitioner testified, he had signed for \u201cvoluntary departure,\u201d which permitted the authorities to return him to Mexico in lieu of placing him in deportation or removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) held that petitioner was ineligible for cancellation of removal because he had not proven ten years of continuous physical presence in the United States. Although the IJ based his decision on a finding that petitioner had spent more than 90 days outside of the United States in 1994, the BIA dismissed petitioner\u2019s appeal on the alternate ground that petitioner\u2019s voluntary departures in 1992, 1994, and 1999 interrupted his continuous physical presence in the United States, irrespective of the length of those departures. We review <em>de novo </em>legal determinations of the BIA, including its interpretation of the INA. <em>Ratnam v. INS, </em>154 F.3d 990, 994 (9th Cir.1998). Because Congress has made an implicit delegation of authority to the Attorney General to interpret and apply the INA, however, we accord deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the statute when Congress\u2019s intent is unclear. <em>INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, </em>526 U.S. 415, 425, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">To be eligible for cancellation of removal, a removable alien must prove, <em>inter alia, </em>ten years of continuous physical presence. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(A). If any of petitioner\u2019s returns to Mexico by the INS are deemed to have interrupted his continuous physical presence, he is ineligible for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">In <em>Vasquez-Lopez v. Ashcroft, </em>343 F.3d 961 (9th Cir.2003), <em>amending </em>315 F.3d 1201 (9th Cir.2003), we upheld a determination by the BIA and the Attorney General that voluntary departure under threat of deportation constitutes a break in continuous physical presence for purposes of cancellation of removal. <em>Id. </em>at 973-74. Petitioner argues on appeal that the BIA did not find that the INS returned him to Mexico \u201cunder threat of deportation,\u201d that the record contains no evidence that he was ever \u201cunder threat of deportation,\u201d and implicitly that, without such evidence, the returns cannot be found to have interrupted his continuous physical presence. Petitioner\u2019s contentions are meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">As the government correctly points out, all returns of aliens to Mexico by the INS are \u201cunder threat of deportation\u201d because the INA only permits voluntary departure \u201cin lieu of being subject to [removal] proceedings.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229e(a)(l). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Whether petitioner had actual knowledge that he would be subject to removal proceedings if he did not agree to voluntarily return to Mexico is entirely irrelevant to the legitimacy of the Attorney General\u2019s actions. Each time he was detained by the INS, petitioner knew that he was in the United States illegally, and knowingly signed voluntary departure papers to expedite his return to Mexico. Our use of the phrase \u201cunder threat of deportation\u201d in <em>Vasquez-Lopez </em>illustrates that an alien\u2019s voluntary departure is not so much \u201cvoluntary\u201d as it is contractually coerced, because the agreement to depart stems from the alien\u2019s desire to avoid removal proceedings. <em>See Vasquez-Lopez, 343 F.3d </em>at 970-71. The phrase does not impose any substantive requirement on the Attorney General where an alien admits his illegal presence and agrees to be returned to his country of origin. To impose such a requirement would be inconsistent with the grant of discretion given to the Attorney General to permit administrative voluntary departures. <em>See id. </em>at 974. For these reasons, the BIA did not err in holding that petitioner was ineligible for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
