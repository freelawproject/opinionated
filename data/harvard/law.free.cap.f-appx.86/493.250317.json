The plan provides LTD benefits for covered employees who meet all contractual requirements for such benefits, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Total Disability exists when Prudential determines that all of these conditions are met:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-4\">(1) Due to sickness or accidental injury, both of these are true:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">(a) You are not able to perform, for wage or profit, the material and substantial duties your occupation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">(b) After the Initial Duration of a period of Total Disability, you are not able to perform for wage or profit the material and substantial duties of any job for which you are reasonably fitted by your education, training, or experience. The Initial Duration is shown in the Schedule of Benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">(2) You are not working at any job for wage or profit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">(3) You are under the regular care of a Doctor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">In February 1996, Shapiro left work as a major account representative for Lanier. He applied and received short term disability benefits. His doctors anticipated that he would be able to return to work in March. Shapiro did not return.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">In June 1996, Shapiro submitted a claim for LTD benefits under the plan. Shapiro\u2019s claim was approved, effective May 24, 1996. According to his medical records, Shapiro was suffering from a degenerative disc disease and a cervical herniated disc, making it difficult for him to carry his fifty-pound sales bag and twenty-pound laptop computer on sales calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">On December 5, 1997, Prudential wrote Shapiro to notify him that part 1(b) of his plan\u2019s total disability definition would become effective May 24, 1998, pursuant to the policy\u2019s terms. To determine whether total disability continued as defined by part 1(b) of the plan, Prudential was going to conduct a thorough review of Shapiro\u2019s claim to ensure that he was still eligible for LTD benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">As a result of its review, two administrative appeals by Shapiro, a surveillance video, and a final administrative appeal, Prudential denied Shapiro\u2019s claim on the basis that Shapiro was capable of performing sedentary work. Shapiro then brought suit in District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">Both Shapiro and Prudential filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The District Court determined that Prudential\u2019s decision was not arbitrary and capricious and granted summary judgment for Prudential. Shapiro appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-14\">We have jurisdiction of this appeal pursuant to 28 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over a District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Pi Lambda Phi Fraternity v. University of Pittsburgh, </em>229 F.3d 435, 441 (3d Cir.2000). Thus, we apply the same standard of review to Prudential\u2019s decision to deny benefits as the District Court should have applied. Sma<em>thers v. Multi-Tool/Multi-Plastics Employee Health and Welfare Plan, </em>298 F.3d 191, 194 (3d Cir.2002); <em>Farrell v. Planters Lifesavers Co., </em>206 F.3d 271, 278 (3d Cir.2000). Summary judgment is appropriate when the record discloses no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See F.C.R.P. </em>56(c); <em>Celotex v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-15\">We find that Prudential\u2019s initial termination of Shapiro\u2019s LTD benefits, and its subsequent decisions to uphold this termination, were based on Prudential\u2019s determination, supported by independent medical evaluations and objective observation, that Shapiro was able to perform sedentary work and was able to perform for wage or profit the material and substantial duties of any job for which he was reasonably fitted by his education, training, or experience. Because Prudential both funds and administers the benefits at issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>here, its decision <em>to </em>terminate benefits is reviewed under a \u2018heightened arbitrary and capricious standard.\u2019 <em>Pinto v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>214 F.3d 377, 378 (3d Cir.2000). In view of the above, we cannot say that Prudential\u2019s decision was without reason, unsupported by substantial evidence, or erroneous as a matter of law. Thus, Prudential\u2019s decision was neither arbitrary nor capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
