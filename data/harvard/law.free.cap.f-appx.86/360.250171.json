On appeal, Kumar contends that the district court erred in denying his habeas petition because he was eligible for waiver from removal under \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c), of the Immigration and Naturalization Act. The district court held that Kumar was ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief because he was an aggravated felon. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Angulo-Dominguez v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 1147, 1149 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-21\">Kumar further contends that the district court erred when it applied \u00a7 440(d) of the Antiterrorism and Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) and \u00a7 321 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) retroactively to determine that he was an aggravated felon. These contentions are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-22\">Kumar pled <em>nolo contendere </em>to forcible rape and false imprisonment on May, 14, 1996, which was after the enactment of AEDPA \u00a7 440(d) on April 24, 1996. The application of \u00a7 440(d) to post-enactment guilty or <em>nolo contendere </em>pleas is not retroactive. <em>United States v. Velasco-Medina, </em>305 F.3d 839, 850 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-23\">In addition, IIRIRA \u00a7 321 is not impermissibly retroactive even when applied to pre-enactment guilty or <em>nolo contendere </em>pleas because Congress expressly intended to make the statute retroactive. <em>Aragon-Ayon v. INS, </em>206 F.3d 847, 852-53 (9th Cir.2000). Accordingly, Kumar met the definition of an aggravated felon when he was determined to be ineligible for removal because he was sentenced to more than one year in prison for crimes of violence. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(43)(F); <em>United States v. Echavarria-Escobar, </em>270 F.3d 1265, 1270-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>1271 (9th Cir.2001). Kumar is, thus, ineligible for relief under \u00a7 212(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b390-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
