Scullin, Jr., <em>Chief Judge), </em>dated January 10, 2003, dismissing on a motion for summary judgment appellants\u2019 claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging that the tax foreclosure proceedings of Clinton County, New York, William Bin-gel, in his official capacity as Clinton County Administrator, and Janet L. Duprey, in her official capacity as Clinton County Treasurer (together \u201cappellees\u201d or the \u201cCounty\u201d) violated appellants\u2019 Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process and equal protection by (a) foreclosing on appellants\u2019 property without providing requisite notice; and (b) failing to advise Fortunatas that he could make a motion to vacate the default judgment against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-14\">On appeal appellants argue (1) that the County did not provide them with sufficient notice of the tax sale of their property; (2) that N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 2101 governs due process regarding notice of the commencement of a legal action and unambiguously provides that the letters in a summons shall be of no less than twelve-point type and that all papers served or filed in a legal action shall be of no less than ten-point type; (3) that due process was not satisfied because appellants\u2019 names did not appear on the face of their respective combined notice and petition; and (4) that the notice did not state that their respective property would be seized and sold. Appellants also argue that the County misled Fortunatas to believe that his only remedy would be to repurchase his property at the tax sale. To meet due process requirements, appellants maintain that the County had an affirmative duty to advise Fortunatas that he could make a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>vacate the default judgment against him when he appeared at the County Treasurer\u2019s Office within the 30 day time period to vacate default judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>affirming if the record as a whole reveals no genuine issues of material fact. <em>See Mount Vernon Fire Ins. Co. v. Belize NY, Inc., </em>277 F.3d 232, 236 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">As to Fortunatus\u2019s contention that the County misled him, it is undisputed that the County sent notice of the foreclosure proceedings via certified mail on October 12, 2000, that Fortunatas received and read the notice, that the notice indicated in bold lettering that the last date of redemption was January 19, 2001, and that Fortunatas made no further inquiry until he appeared at the County Treasurer\u2019s Office in mid-July 2001. Under the circumstances, we conclude that the County adequately apprised Fortunatas of his rights and, accordingly, did not violate due process. <em>See Weigner v. City of New York, </em>852 F.2d 646, 652 (2d Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">We have reviewed appellants\u2019 remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Furthermore, we find no error in the actions of the district court and affirm for substantially the reasons given in its thorough opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
