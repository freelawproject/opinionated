Nakauchi claims he had withdrawn from the conspiracy to posses with the intent to distribute the drugs because he had already been arrested and given a confession to authorities prior to the government\u2019s seizure of the 22,000 tablets of MDMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Huerta, </em>182 F.3d 361, 364 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">A defendant is presumed to continue in a conspiracy unless he makes a substantial affirmative showing of withdrawal, abandonment, or defeat of the conspiratorial purpose. <em>United States v. Torres, </em>114 F.3d 520, 525 (5th Cir.1997). The district court did not clearly err in finding that Nakauchi\u2019s confession to authorities was insufficient to show his withdrawal from the conspiracy. The record indicates that Nakauchi provided only limited information, not a full confession. <em>See United States v. Jimenez, </em>622 F.2d 753, 757-58 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-27\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
