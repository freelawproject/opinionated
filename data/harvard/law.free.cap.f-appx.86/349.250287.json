The BIA\u2019s credibility findings must be upheld unless \u201cthe evidence presented would <em>compel </em>a reasonable finder of fact to reach a contrary result.\u201d <em>Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1149-50 (9th Cir.1999) (emphasis in the original) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Under the substantial evidence standard, the IJ \u201cmust have a legitimate articulable basis to question the petitioner\u2019s credibility, and must offer a specific, cogent reason for any stated disbelief.\u201d <em>Hartooni v. INS, </em>21 F.3d 336, 342 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-24\">In this case the BIA and IJ offered a cogent reason for disbelieving Yang: her testimony was inconsistent with that of her aunt. In responding to repeated questions about Yang\u2019s departure for the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>States and the political problems of Yang\u2019s mother, Yang\u2019s aunt never said anything about Yang\u2019s mother\u2019s house having been bombed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Yang\u2019s counsel first asked Yang\u2019s aunt why Yang\u2019s mother sent Yang to the United States. Yang\u2019s aunt replied that \u201cthe mother said that there has been some problems at home and asked that we take care of her.\u201d Yang, however, specifically testified that she was sent to the United States because her mother\u2019s house was bombed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">When asked if she knew what \u201cproblem\u201d Yang\u2019s mother was referring to, Yang\u2019s aunt said, \u201c[Yang\u2019s mother] said that you must take good care of [Yang], she didn\u2019t say anything else.\u201d Yang\u2019s aunt did not mention a bombing.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">When asked what she knew about the relationship between Yang\u2019s mother and Yang Gui Fu, Yang\u2019s aunt said that \u201c[w]hen I heard her voice, her tone of voice, it sounds like there are some conflicts.\u201d Yang, however, testified that Yang Gui Fu had orchestrated the bombing of her mother\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The IJ then asked Yang\u2019s aunt: \u201cDid your sister say anything else at all about the situation there in the village that was remarkable or stuck in your memory?\u201d The aunt answered that Yang\u2019s mother \u201c[s]aid that she will send my niece over to me to take care of, that there are some problems at home.\u201d Again, Yang\u2019s aunt said nothing about a bombing.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Yang\u2019s aunt also testified that she had been to Yang\u2019s mother\u2019s house after the alleged bombing and that she spoke regularly with Yang\u2019s mother. This testimony led the IJ to state in his oral decision \u201cthat if these two ladies who are sisters, who were talking, then certainly the witness would have been apprised that there had been a bomb blast at the family home.\u201d It was reasonable for the IJ and BIA to infer that, had the house actually been bombed, Yang\u2019s aunt would have mentioned it in responding to the questions about why Yang came to America and what kind of relationship Yang\u2019s mother had with the alleged bomber. The BIA therefore found that Yang\u2019s aunt\u2019s testimony contained a \u201cmaterial omission\u201d and conflicted with Yang\u2019s own testimony. The record does not compel a contrary finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Yang also argues that her aunt was not credible. However, the record does not disclose that Yang\u2019s aunt was suffering from \u201cmental turbulence\u201d or was not able to express herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">The petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
