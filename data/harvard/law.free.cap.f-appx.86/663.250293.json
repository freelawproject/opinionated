For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-25\">Etoundi asserts that his testimony was credible and corroborated and contends that he established his eligibility for asylum. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. </em>478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Etoundi fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that Etoundi seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-26\">Additionally, we uphold the IJ\u2019s denial of Etoundi\u2019s application for withholding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>removal. The standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than that for granting asylum. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate \u201ca clear probability of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Because Etoundi fails to show he is eligible for asylum, he cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
