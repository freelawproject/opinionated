Lewis\u2019 counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging the sentence. Although informed of his right to do so, Lewis has not filed a pro se supplemental brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">We review an order imposing a sentence after revocation of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995). Lewis first challenges the court\u2019s determination that he possessed cocaine base with intent to distribute, thereby violating a condition of his supervised release.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The district court need only find a violation of a condition of supervised release by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2000); <em>United States v. Copley, </em>978 F.2d 829, 831 (4th Cir.1992). We review for clear error factual determinations informing the conclusion that a violation occurred. <em>United States v. Carothers, </em>337 F.3d 1017, 1019 (8th Cir.2003). We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Lewis\u2019 supervised release based on the uncontradicted testimony of witnesses at the revocation hearing regarding Lewis\u2019 possession of cocaine base with the intent to distribute it.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-13\">Lewis also asserts that his twenty-three-month sentence is excessive and that the district court should have sentenced him in accordance with the policy statements set forth in <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.4 (2002). Chapter Seven of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual sets forth policy statements offering recommended sentencing ranges for revocation of probation and supervised release. Chapter Seven is advisory and nonbinding. <em>Davis, </em>53 F.3d at 642. However, the Court should consider the policy statements before imposing sentence. <em>Id. </em>If the Court has considered the relevant factors and the applicable policy statements, the Court has the discretion to impose a sentence outside the ranges set forth in the Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>Because the district court was presented with and explicitly considered the suggested sentencing range of USSG \u00a7 7B1.4, and Lewis\u2019 sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583 (2000), we find no error in Lewis\u2019 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-14\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Lewis\u2019 sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b662-10\"> Lewis does not contest the court\u2019s determination that he violated other conditions of his supervised release, as alleged in the probation officer's \"Petition for Warrant or Summons for Offender Under Supervision,\u201d filed on April 1, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
