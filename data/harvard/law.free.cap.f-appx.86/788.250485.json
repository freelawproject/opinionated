He argues that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is unconstitutional in view of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000), but states that he is raising it to preserve it for possible Supreme Court review. The argument that <em>Apprendi </em>rendered 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 facially unconstitutional was rejected in <em>Slaughter. </em>We are bound by this precedent absent an intervening Supreme Court decision or a subsequent <em>en banc </em>decision. <em>See United States v. Short, </em>181 F.3d 620, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>624 (5th Cir.1999). Therefore, this issue is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Salas argues that the supervised release condition which prohibits him from possessing dangerous weapons conflicts with the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement of the sentence and must be deleted. The Sentencing Guidelines recommend that all defendants who have been convicted of a felony be prohibited from possessing any dangerous weapon during the term of supervised release. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.3(d)(l). \u201cIf the district court orally imposes a sentence without stating the conditions applicable to this period of supervision, the judgment\u2019s inclusion of conditions that are mandatory, standard, or recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines does not create a conflict with the oral pronouncement.\u201d <em>United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 938 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b818-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
