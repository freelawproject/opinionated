Maldonado-Canales argues for the first time on appeal that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) is unconstitutional because it permitted the sentencing judge to find, under a preponderance of the evidence standard, a fact which increased the statutory maximum sentence to which he otherwise would have been exposed. He thus contends that his sentence is invalid and argues that it should not exceed the two-year maximum term of imprisonment prescribed in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that the enhanced penalties in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are sentencing provisions, not elements of separate offenses. The Court further held that the sentencing provisions do not violate the Due Process Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 239-47. Maldonado-Canales acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>but asserts that the decision has been cast into doubt by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He seeks to preserve his argument for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, Maldonado-Canales\u2019s first argument is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">Maldonado-Canales also contends that the district court erred by concluding that his prior convictions for delivery of cocaine were not related for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2). The district court correctly held that his prior crimes were not part of a \u201csingle common scheme or plan.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n.3); <em>see also United States v. Ford, </em>996 F.2d 83, 86 (5th Cir.1993). Furthermore, although Maldonado-Canales asserts that his prior crimes were related for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) because they were functionally consolidated, he has failed to make a sufficient showing to overcome the deference afforded to the district court\u2019s ruling on that matter. <em>See Buford v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 59, 64, 121 S.Ct. 1276, 149 L.Ed.2d 197 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">For his final argument, Maldonado-Canales asserts that the special written condition of supervised release that Maldonado-Canales not possess a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d must be stricken from the judgment of conviction because that condition was not orally pronounced at sentencing. His argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 937-38 (5th Cir.2003), which was issued after Maldonado-Canales submitted the instant appeal brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b763-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
