The court sentenced Stewart to life imprisonment as to the conspiracy count and 30-year prison terms as to the possession and distribution counts, with the terms to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Stewart contends that the trial evidence was insufficient to support any of his' convictions. The standard for reviewing a claim of insufficient evidence is whether \u201ca rational trier of fact could have found that the evidence establishes the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Villarreal, </em>324 F.3d 319, 322 (5th Cir.2003) (citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). Review of the sufficiency of the evidence does not include review of the weight of the evidence or of the credibility of the witnesses. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>995 F.2d 556, 561 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Stewart contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his conspiracy conviction because the Government relied on a \u201crogue\u2019s gallery\u201d of witnesses who were facing drug-trafficking charges or who had already been imprisoned for drug-trafficking convictions. The testimony of various Government witnesses was sufficient to support the conspiracy conviction because the testimony established the existence of an agreement between two or more persons to violate narcotics laws, Stewart\u2019s knowledge of such agreement, and his voluntary participation in it. <em>See United States v. Peters, </em>283 F.3d 300, 307 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>536 U.S. 934, 122 S.Ct. 2612, 153 L.Ed.2d 797 (2002); <em>United States v. Westbrook, </em>119 F.3d 1176, 1190 (5th Cir.1997) (\u201cuncorroborated testimony of a co-conspirator\u201d is sufficient as long is \u201cnot factually insubstantial or incredible\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">Stewart contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute on September 21, 2001, because no drugs were found on his person or in his vehicle. The evidence was sufficient to establish to support this conviction because it showed that Stewart and his girlfriend Latoya (or \u201cToyah\u201d) Golden were stopped on the street in a drug-trafficking area of Midland, Texas, that cocaine base was found on Golden\u2019s person during this detention, and that Stewart and Golden regularly sold cocaine base together in the area. <em>See United States v. Fierro, </em>38 F.3d 761, 768 (5th Cir.1994) (defining aiding and abetting).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">Stewart argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his distribution conviction, relating to a drug transaction on October 10, 2001. The evidence overwhelmingly established that Midland police officers sent a confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d) to perform a controlled purchase of cocaine base from Stewart and that the Cl bought from Stewart 16 \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine rocks weighing 2.84 grams. <em>See United States v. Sotelo, </em>97 F.3d 782, 789 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-11\">Finally, Stewart argues that the district court abused its discretion in admitting into evidence an audiotape and transcript thereof from the October 10, 2001, controlled purchase. The \u201cpoor quality and partial unintelligibility\u201d of the tape did not render the tape inadmissible, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>334 F.3d 406, 412 (5th Cir.2003) (citation omitted), and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>court gave the jury cautionary instructions regarding the poor quality of the tape. <em>See United States v. Stone, </em>960 F.2d 426, 436 (5th Cir.1992). The court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the tape. <em>See United States v. White, </em>219 F.3d 442, 448 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Stewart\u2019s convictions are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b733-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
