Lynch contends that the sentence imposed by the district court is clearly unreasonable. Finding no abuse of discretion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">Lynch challenges the length of the sentence, which exceeded the three-to-nine month range suggested by the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.4(a) (2002). The sentencing ranges in Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines are not binding on the sentencing court. <em>United States v. Davis, 53 </em>F.3d 638, 640-41 (4th Cir.1995). Rather, upon finding a violation, the district court may revoke supervised release and resentence the defendant to any sentence within the statutory maximum for the original offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(a) (2000); <em>United States v. Schaefer, </em>120 F.3d 505, 507 (4th Cir.1997). Because the district court imposed a sentence within the statutory maximum for Lynch\u2019s original offenses, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 922(c)(1) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2003); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (2000), we find no abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 7B1.4, comment, (n.4) (stating that sentence above suggested range may be warranted \u201c[w]here the original sentence was the result of a downward departure.\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm Lynch\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
