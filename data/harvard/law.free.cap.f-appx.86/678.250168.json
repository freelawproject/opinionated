The record supports the Board\u2019s conclusion. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2003) (the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum). We will reverse the Board only if the evidence \u201c \u2018was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rusu v. </em>INS, 296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). We have reviewed the administrative record, the IJ\u2019s decision, and the decision of the Board, and find that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s ruling that Hafeez failed to establish his refugee status.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">We deny Hafeez\u2019s petition for review. We deny the Attorney General\u2019s motion to designate the administrative record as a supplemental joint appendix and Hafeez\u2019s motion to file an amended opening brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b709-8\"> As Hafeez has failed to challenge on appeal the denial of withholding and relief under the Convention Against Torture, these claims are waived. See Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(6); <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999); <em>11126 Baltimore Blvd., Inc. v. Prince George\u2019s County, Md., </em>58 F.3d 988, 993 n. 7 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
