He asserts that the district court erred in sentencing him as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 because he had received misdemeanor sentences for his two state jail felony convictions pursuant to a Texas Penal Code provision. Because Brown\u2019s guilty plea to a state jail felony exposed him to the possibility of a sentence of more than one year in prison, these convictions count as felonies under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 despite the fact that Brown received a misdemeanor sentence under Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 12.44(a). <em>See United States v. Rivera-Perez, </em>322 F.3d 350, 352 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 2625, 156 L.Ed.2d 641 (2003). The judgment of the district court is thus AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b809-41\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
