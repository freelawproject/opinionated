We affirm' the district court\u2019s decision and decline to certify the issues raised on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b38-11\">I. <em>Statement of facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-12\">On January 10, 1999, a fire destroyed the home of Bulley and his wife Gaida Bulley (\u201cGaida\u201d). Gaida and her minor daughter Kiara Hubbs (\u201cKiara\u201d) died in the fire. Kelvin Hubbs (\u201cKelvin\u201d) and Antwan survived the fire. Kelvin is the son of Gaida and the brother of Kiara. Antwan is the son of Bulley and Gaida, and the half-brother of Kiara and Kelvin.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-17\">Bulley was advised, after an inspection of the fire scene by Roger Owens (\u201cOwens\u201d), an expert witness retained by Bulley, that the cause of the fire was an electrical malfunction of a space heater manufactured by Arvin Industries, Inc. (\u201cArvin\u201d). On February 1, 1999, Bulley filed suit against Arvin. Around June,</p>\n<p id=\"b38-18\">1999, during discovery, representatives of Arvin inspected the space heater and provided Owens with information that it had been manufactured not by Arvin, but by Toastmaster, Inc, (\u201cToastmaster\u201d). Subsequent to Arvin\u2019s filing a motion for summary judgment dismissal on October 12, 2000, Bulley filed a motion for voluntary dismissal, which the district court denied. On February 5, 2001, Arvin and Bulley agreed to a voluntary dismissal with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-20\">Almost a year later, on February 1, 2002 Bulley filed suit against Toastmaster, naming it as the manufacturer of the allegedly defective heater. On October, 8, 2002, Toastmaster filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that Bulley\u2019s claims were barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-21\">The district court held that Bulley\u2019s claims were barred by the statute of limitations because neither of the Mississippi savings statutes, Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 15 \u2014 1\u2014 69 (\u201c \u00a7 15-1-69\u201d) nor Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 15-1-59 (\u201c \u00a7 15-1-59\u201d), was applicable, and therefore granted Toastmaster summary judgment dismissing Bulley\u2019s claims. Bulley now appeals this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>II. <em>Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">This Court has jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>In re Topco, Inc., </em>894 F.2d 727, 734 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">III. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Am. States Ins. Co. v. Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia, </em>335 F.3d 493 (5th Cir.2003). Summary judgment is appropriate only if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Tango Transp. v. Healthcare Fin. Servs. LLC, </em>322 F.3d 888, 890 (5th Cir.2003). A genuine issue of material fact exists if the record, taken as a whole, could lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party. <em>Id. </em>Questions of law are reviewed <em>de novo. Id. </em>The plain language of Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fads to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. <em>Celotex v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">TV. <em>Law and Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">The district court initially noted that the parties agreed that Bulley\u2019s action was governed by the three-year statute of limitations pursuant to Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 15-1-49. Because Bulley did not file the suit against Toastmaster until February 1, 2002, more than three years after the January 10, 1999 fire, the district court stated that his claim was outside the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-13\">\n<em>Miss.Code. Ann. \u00a7 15-1-69</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b39-14\">The issue of whether a plaintiff, who timely sues the wrong party initially, subsequently voluntarily dismisses with prejudice that party, and then refiles his suit against the proper party after the statute of limitations has expired, can utilize \u00a7 15-1-69 to toll the running of the statute of limitations is a matter of first impression for this Court. The district court rejected Bulley\u2019s assertion that the one-year savings period under Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 15-1-69 (\" \u00a7 15-1-69\u201d) applied here to toll the running of the three-year statute of limitations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court relied on established Mississippi Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit law in finding that the circumstances of Bulley\u2019s voluntary dismissal against Arvin and subsequent suit against Toastmaster did not fall within the scope of \u00a7 15-1-69 because his initial action had not (1) been abated, avoided, or defeated by the death of any party to the action; (2) been abated, avoided, or defeated for any \u201cmatter of form,\u201d such as for lack of jurisdiction; and (3) resulted in a verdict for him, nor a reversal thereof. <em>See, Ryan v. Wardlaw, </em>382 So.2d 1078 (Miss.1980) and <em>Lowry v. International </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number><em>Broth. of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders and Helpers of America, </em>220 F.2d 546 (5th Cir.1955) (\u00a7 15-1-69 generally provides a one-year savings period for refiling actions which have been abated, avoided, or defeated for reasons of form, such as lack of jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Finding no error in the district court\u2019s analysis of this issue we affirm its resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">\n<em>Good Faith/Misnomer of Party</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Bulley also argues that he proceeded initially against Arvin in good faith based upon the advice and recommendation of his expert witness, Owen, that his subsequent dismissal of Arvin was as a result of a misnomer of party, and therefore \u00a7 15-1-69 worked to give him one-year from the voluntary dismissal of February 5, 2001 to refile his suit against Toastmaster.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">The district court found that Burley\u2019s failure to bring his initial suit against the correct party here was neither the result of good faith nor a misnomer of party.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">The district court relied on the Mississippi Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>W.T. Raleigh Co. v. Barnes, </em>143 Miss. 597, 109 So. 8 (1926), in determining that Bulley failed to show good faith in not bringing suit against Toastmaster until after the statute of limitations had run. Bulley, the district court noted, simply sued the wrong defendant initially, and the record was devoid of evidence indicating any connection between Arvin and Toastmaster. Additionally, the district court noted that Bulley knew as early as June, 1999, that Arvin had not manufactured the heater in question and that Bulley had admitted that he knew that Toastmaster had manufactured the heater sometime prior to entering into the voluntary dismissal with Arvin. Finally, the district court concluded, Bulley had until January 10, 2002 to file suit against Toastmaster and failed to do so, therefore requiring that his suit against it be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">A good faith intent for invoking the savings statute \u201cinvolves a finding of fact by the trial court, which must be accepted if supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Wertz v. Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc., </em>790 So.2d 841, 845 (Miss.App.2000) <em>citing Herring Gas Co. v. Whiddon, </em>616 So.2d 892, 893 (Miss.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">The district court fully considered Bulley\u2019s claim of good faith, and its finding of a lack of such was based on substantial evidence. Having reviewed the record we agree with the district court\u2019s resolution of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-12\">Furthermore, this Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Honeycutt v. Long, </em>861 F.2d 1346, 1349, 1351 (5th Cir.1988), and <em>Montalvo v. Tower Life Building, </em>426 F.2d 1135, 1146-47, 1151 (5th Cir.1970) have established that a misnomer of party situation exists only where the named defendant and the correct defendant are connected in some way, such as sharing the same general counsel or office space. Bulley has not argued, nor can he show, that Arvin and Toastmaster are connected in anyway. We therefore also agree with the district court that Bulley\u2019s initial suit against the wrong party, Arvin, was not a misnomer of party entitling him to an extended period of time beyond the statute of limitations to file suit against Toastmaster.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-13\">\n<em>Miss.Code. Ann. \u00a7 15-1-59</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b40-14\">The district court rejected Bulley\u2019s assertion that the one-year savings period under Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 15-1-59 applied to toll the statute of limitations for his minor son Antwan\u2019s wrongful death suits because it found that Bulley was available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>to protect Antwan\u2019s rights,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> thus precluding the applicability of this savings statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The district court, relying on <em>Curry v. Turner, </em>832 So.2d 508 (Miss.2002) and <em>Arender v. Smith County Hosp., </em>431 So.2d 491, 493-94 (Miss.1983), concluded that as long as there is a responsible party who is acting or could act on behalf of a minor child, a person <em>in esse, </em>the statute of limitations will run from the time the cause of action accrues, and \u00a7 15-1-59 will not apply. The district court held that because Mississippi\u2019s wrongful death statute, Miss Code Ann. \u00a7 11-7-13,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> clearly provided that Bulley could bring a suit on Antwan\u2019s behalf, a person <em>in esse </em>exists thus precluding the application of \u00a7 15-1-59 to save Antwan\u2019s suits for the wrongful deaths of both Gaida and Kiara.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">We conclude that the district court did not err in resolving this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">\n<em>Issue Certification/Mississippi Rule of Appellate Procedure 16</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">Bulley finally argues that if this Court finds that Mississippi law is unsettled, vague or ambiguous on the issues presented in this case, then he requests that this Court seek certification on the issues to the Mississippi Supreme Court pursuant to M.R.A.P. 46. (citing <em>Walters v. Inexco Oil Company, </em>670 F.2d 476, 477 n. 2 (5th Cir.1982); <em>Government Employees Insurance Company v. Brown, </em>675 F.2d 645 (5th Cir.1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-14\">However, certification is appropriate only when Mississippi precedents as to the issues to be resolved are insufficiently clear, and the certification procedure may be the only means of allowing the Mississippi Supreme Court to authoritatively establish the rule of law. <em>Brown, </em>675 F.2d at 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-15\">The district court\u2019s resolution of the issues in this case was based on clearly established Mississippi Supreme Court precedent, and therefore no vagueness or ambiguity exists in the settled principles of law that were applied by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-16\">Therefore, because Mississippi law is neither unsettled, vague or ambiguous, we DENY Bulley\u2019s request for certification of these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-17\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b41-18\">Because the district court did not err in finding that neither \u00a7 15-1-69 nor \u00a7 15-1-59 applied in this case, and that Bulley failed to show that his delay in bringing suit against the correct party, Toastmaster, was in good faith, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Toastmaster dismissing Bulley\u2019s claims. Furthermore, because the Missis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>sippi law as to these issues is well settled and unambiguous, Bulley\u2019s request for certification is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b38-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
