He was sentenced to ten years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">On appeal, Bryant argues that there was insufficient evidence that the firearm he possessed had traveled in interstate commerce. In reviewing a sufficiency challenge, \u201c[t]he verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). \u201cSubstantial evidence,\u201d in the context of a criminal action, is that evidence a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Newsome, </em>322 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2003). A defendant challenging the sufficiency of evidence to support his conviction \u201cbears a heavy burden.\u201d <em>United States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">We conclude that, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to establish the firearm traveled in interstate commerce. We therefore affirm Bryant\u2019s conviction and sentence. Bryant\u2019s motion to file a supplemental brief is denied. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
