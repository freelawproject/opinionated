Chand contends that he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to a jury trial or a trial by a district court, that the magistrate judge abused his discretion by denying Chand\u2019s motion for a continuance to secure the presence of a witness, that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, and that the eighteen-month delay between the completion of briefing on appeal and the issuance of the district court\u2019s opinion violated his right to a speedy appeal. With respect to the first three issues, we have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, the joint appendix, the supplemental joint appendix, and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See United States v. Chand, </em>No. CR-01-487-DKC (D.Md. Aug. 11, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Chand\u2019s final issue is that the district court\u2019s delay in adjudicating his appeal amounted to a violation of his right to a speedy appeal. An \u201cundue delay in processing an appeal may rise to the level of a due process violation.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>732 F.2d 379, 381 (4th Cir.1984). To determine whether such a delay results in the denial of a speedy appeal, the court considers the length of the delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his speedy appeal right, and any prejudice to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 381-82 (citing <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972)). Addressing these factors, we find that, while an eighteen-month delay may rise to the level of an \u201cundue delay\u201d and while Chand did assert his speedy appeal right by requesting a ruling on the appeal, Chand suffered no prejudice as a result of the delay. As this court held in <em>Johnson, </em>there is no prejudice and affirmative relief is not appropriate when \u201cthe appeal has been heard and found lacking in merit.\u201d 732 F.2d at 382-83. Here, the district court found no merit to Chand\u2019s issues on appeal and affirmed his conviction. Thus, we find that Chand suffered no prejudice and is entitled to no relief on his claim that his speedy appeal right was violated by the district court\u2019s delayed disposition of his appeal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Chand\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
