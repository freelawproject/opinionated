DeSouza pled guilty to one count of identity theft due to his part in a scheme to purchase vehicles using false identities. In this scheme, DeSouza was aided by Kyshon Hardemon, who would often use false names to purchase vehicles for DeSouza. After being stopped for driving with a false license and an altered temporary tag, DeSouza failed to appear at a hearing. Roughly a year later, he was caught in Florida and charged in federal court in Tennessee with seven counts of identity theft. At that time DeSouza pled guilty to one count, and the other counts were dropped. He now appeals, claiming the district court erred by: (1) enhancing his sentence two levels based on \u00a7 3C1.1 of the 1998 United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) because he obstructed justice by failing to appear at the hearing for his motor vehicle violations, and (2) enhancing his sentence an additional two levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) for his role in leading and supervising Hardemon in criminal activity. Because the district court correctly calculated his sentence under the U.S.S.G., we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b147-13\">A federal grand jury indicted DeSouza on October 24, 2000 on seven counts relating to identity theft. A plea agreement was reached under which DeSouza would plead guilty <em>to </em>count two of the indictment. Count two of the indictment alleged that DeSouza used the identity of another person to steal a vehicle worth more than $1000. In return for DeSouza pleading guilty to count two, the other six counts were dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">As the Presentence Report set forth, DeSouza used false identification, and persuaded others to identify themselves falsely, in order to purchase automobiles. For example, on June 18, 1999, DeSouza allegedly used his name and a credit card from a \u201cJamie Sackett,\u201d whom he identified as his cousin, to rent a Ford Expedition that was never returned. Sackett, when contacted, stated that she did not know De-Souza and that someone had opened several credit cards in her name. Roughly seven months later he allegedly used the identity of \u201cDaniel Grano\u201d to buy a 1993 Mercedes, but the real Grano was unaware of the Mercedes purchase and also had someone open credit cards in his name.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-15\">DeSouza and Kyshon Hardemon apparently used roughly the same modus operandi on several other occasions. In February 2000, Hardemon pretended to be \u201cMelissa Hill\u201d to purchase a 2000 Impala. That same month, DeSouza visited a local Lexus dealer and stated that he was looking for a car for his sister. The next day, DeSouza returned with Hardemon to the dealer and used the name of \u201cMelissa Hill\u201d to buy a used 1998 Lexus. They left with the car, and later returned to purchase a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>1999 Lexus, but that loan was declined by Toyota Motor Credit Corporation. After about two weeks, Hardemon returned the 1998 Lexus to the dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">That same day, DeSouza and Hardemon apparently went to a Chevy dealer and told the sales people that Hardemon was DeSouza\u2019s sister, \u201cMeredith Sydnor,\u201d and that she wanted to purchase a 2000 Corvette. Sydnor was approved for an almost $50,000 loan, and DeSouza and Hardemon left with the car. The real Meredith Sydnor lived in a different city, and her credit information was fraudulently used. Later the same day, DeSouza and Hardemon went to a Lincoln Mercury dealer where they bought a used Lincoln Navigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">About two weeks later, on April 6, 2000, authorities found and followed DeSouza, who was driving a Navigator and then a Corvette. DeSouza was arrested on an outstanding warrant relating to the Ford Expedition. The officers seized the Navigator. At the time, DeSouza had four vehicles: a Lincoln Navigator, a Corvette, an Impala, and a Ford Expedition. He was arrested at that time, but the charges were dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Hardemon, when interviewed by investigators that day, stated that DeSouza told her his cousin, Meredith Sydnor from New York, was going to help him finance a car. She claimed that DeSouza had asked her to sign Sydnor\u2019s name because Sydnor could not come to Tennessee, and that she talked to a woman on the phone claiming to be Sydnor.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">On September 12, 2000, DeSouza and a unknown female allegedly bought a 1997 Nissan Altima in the name of Bruce Smith. On October 6, 2000, the police stopped DeSouza because he was driving a 1997 Nissan Altima with an altered temporary tag. He was also carrying a driver\u2019s license with a false name.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">DeSouza was scheduled for a court appearance on October 9, 2000, for a misdemeanor theft charge and for motor vehicle violations relating to the license alteration, but he failed to appear. He was apprehended in Florida on December 21, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">I. Obstruction of Justice: U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1</p>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">The district court correctly enhanced DeSouza\u2019s sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. As stated in <em>United States v. Jackson-Randolph, </em>282 F.3d 369 (6th Cir. 2002), \u201cthe clear error standard is ... appropriate for reviewing sentencing decisions under \u00a7 3C1.1 where the sole issue before the district court is a fact-bound application of the guideline provisions.\u201d <em>Jackson-Randolph, </em>282 F.3d at 390. However, where a Guidelines-interpretation issue is purely legal, the <em>de novo </em>review standard still applies. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Canestraro, </em>282 F.3d 427, 431 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-13\">Section 3C1.1 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-14\">[i]f (A) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct related to (i) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (ii) a closely related offense, increase the offense level by 2 levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-15\">Application note 4(e) further provides that the adjustment applies to \u201cwillfully failing to appear, as ordered, for a judicial proceeding.\u201d However, Application note 5(d) states that this section does not apply to defendants who \u201cavoid[] or flee[] from arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>This court has held that, with regard to \u00a7 8C1.1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">[W]e agree with our sister circuits that have held that obstructive conduct occurring during the state investigation or prosecution and preceding federal involvement triggers the enhancement even if the federal charge is not identical to the state charge, so long as the underlying behavior is connected to both offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-6\"><em>United States v. Roberts, </em>243 F.3d 235, 238 (6th Cir.2001). Further, the court noted that \u201c[t]he determinative factor was that both sets of charges [the state and federal charges], and the obstruction activity, were related to the same -underlying activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Count two of the indictment, to which he pled guilty, involved the theft of the Navigator. At the sentencing hearing, DeSouza was sentenced to imprisonment for 30 months followed by three years of supervised release. At the sentencing hearing, the court enhanced his offense level by two under \u00a7 3C1.1 of the U.S.S.G for obstruction of justice because he failed to appear at the October 9, 2000, proceeding. The court enhanced his offense level another two levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) because he played an aggravating role in the offense by supervising Hardemon. He was given a downward adjustment because of his acceptance of responsibility. De-Souza filed a timely notice of appeal, and argues that the two offense level enhancements were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">There is no real factual dispute in this case. Therefore, the only issue in applying \u00a7 3C1.1 to this case is whether DeSouza\u2019s failure to appear for the October 9, 2000, hearing relating to charges from his traffic stop and his conviction for identity theft are related to the same underlying activity. DeSouza argues that the altered temporary tag was not \u201crelevant conduct\u201d to the offense of conviction in this case\u2014 identity theft. Indeed, the defense argues that DeSouza probably fled to avoid the inevitable consequences of his actions, but that the flight itself is not an obstruction of justice because there is an insufficient nexus between the conduct involved in identity theft and the state misdemeanor charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">The Government contends that DeSouza\u2019s failure to appear in state court was part of the concealment of the federal identity theft crime for which he was convicted. At sentencing, the Government admitted that this obstruction enhancement was a \u201clittle bit peripheral\u201d compared to most obstruction cases, but that the state charges related to the stolen Altima, which was stolen by means of using a false identity. The Government argued in front of the district court that when the police stopped DeSouza, they only were aware that he (1) had an altered temporary tag, (2) possessed a false drivers license, and (3) was driving a vehicle listed as stolen. At this point, the officer was unaware of the details of the theft and scheduled the court hearing. By the time of the scheduled hearing, the Government had discovered that the car had been bought using that false drivers license, and this was \u201cpart and parcel\u201d of the entire identity theft offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">The district court held that since the hearing in which DeSouza failed to appear involved charges relating to the stolen car \u2014 misdemeanor theft charges and the violation of motor vehicle registration laws \u2014 that hearing was relevant and directly related to count 6 (the Altima) and the scheme in which he was involved. The court concluded that the failure of DeSouza to appear was \u201cpart and parcel of concealing the theft\u201d of cars and the identity theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">Section 3C1.1 provides for a two level sentencing enhancement if the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>willfully obstructs or impedes an investigation and the obstructive conduct was related to the offense of conviction or a closely related offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. The misdemeanor charges related to the stolen Altima he was driving at that time, and at the time of the missed hearing, the Government was aware of the manner that the Altima was stolen. DeSouza\u2019s failure to appear impeded the investigation of the stolen Altima, which led to the discovery of the other stolen cars, including the Navigator upon which his conviction was based. Thus, the district court was correct in its determination that the two level sentencing enhancement was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">II. Organizer, Leader, Supervisor, or Manager of a Criminal Activity: \u00a7 3Bl.l(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The district court was also correct in its judgment that DeSouza\u2019s sentence should be enhanced by two levels under \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) because he led and/or supervised another person, Hardemon, in a criminal activity. This court has had some difficulty articulating the appropriate scope of review for enhancements under \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). <em>See United States v. Solorio, </em>337 F.3d 580, 600 (6th Cir.2003). As in <em>Solorio, </em>we need not resolve the issue because the district court should be affirmed even under the least deferential standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Section 3Bl.l(e) states that \u201c[i]f the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity other than described in (a) or (b), increase by two levels.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). Application note 2 states that \u201c[t]o qualify for an adjustment under this section, a defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants.\u201d Application note 1 describes a participant as \u201ca person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been convicted.\u201d A person, such as an undercover police officer, who is not criminally responsible, is not a participant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 Application note 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">DeSouza argues that Hardemon was not culpable because she was duped, and, therefore, DeSouza could not have led or supervised her in a criminal activity. The defense principally relies on <em>United States. v. Lewis, </em>68 F.3d 987 (6th Cir.1995). In <em>Lewis, </em>a defendant ran a credit card scam and was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(2). <em>Lewis, </em>68 F.3d at 988. The defendant would use credit cards in to buy gift certificates in a Mississippi casino, and, to avoid detection, she would ask young ladies to redeem them in return for tokens. <em>Id. </em>The district court enhanced her sentence two levels under \u00a7 3B1.1 because of her leadership role. <em>Id. </em>This court reversed, stating that the young women were aware that something suspicious was going on but that suspicion was not enough to render them culpable under \u00a7 1029(a)(2), which requires a knowing use with intent to defraud. <em>Id. </em>at 989. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-10\">Without this knowledge, the women could not have violated \u00a7 1029(a)(2) either as principals or as aiders and abettors. <em>See United States v. Frazier, </em>880 F.2d 878, 886 (6th Cir.1989) (listing the elements of aiding and abetting as (1) an act that contributes to the commission of the crime and (2) an intention to aid in the commission of the crime). Because the district court did not find that the women possessed the knowledge and intent required by the statute, they could not be criminally responsible for the commission of the offenses under \u00a7 1029(a)(2) and could not be \u201cpartid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>pants\u201d for the purpose of \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) of the Sentencing Guidelines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 989-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The district court granted the Government\u2019s request for a two level enhancement even while acknowledging that \u201cthere was an elaborate scheme to ... dupe Ms. Hardeman [sic] into believing that she was authorized to sign the documents and purchase a vehicle in Mr. De-Souza\u2019s cousin\u2019s name.\u201d J.A. at 34. Although the district court did not expressly state that Hardemon was culpable, it had enough evidence in the false identities and addresses she used to help purchase four cars to conclude that she was culpable. At two car dealerships, Hardemon helped buy two cars under the name Melissa Hill, and later at two other car dealerships, she helped buy two different cars as Meredith Sydnor. She also used false addresses in these purchases. In one instance, she even returned the car to the dealer. Even if she believed that she was helping De-Souza buy a car by standing in for his \u201ccousin,\u201d that did not mean she was not criminally culpable. There is little doubt that Hardemon was more knowledgeable about the criminal nature of her conduct than the casino women in <em>Lewis. </em>Thus, the district court properly, albeit implicitly, found that Hardemon was a criminally responsible participant in the scheme, even if she was in some sense duped.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-7\">. Sections (a) and (b) involve criminal activities with five or more \"participants.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b151-9\">KAREN NELSON MOORE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ava\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">I concur in all but Part II of the majority\u2019s opinion. In light of the district court\u2019s statement acknowledging the \u201celaborate scheme ... to dupe Ms. Hardem[o]n\u201d and because the district court did not expressly state that Hardemon was culpable, I would remand to the district court to permit it to make the factual findings necessary for a determination of whether DeSouza\u2019s sentence should be enhanced two levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) as a leader or supervisor of a criminally responsible person.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
