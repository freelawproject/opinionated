Davis appeals his sentence, chai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>lenging the district court\u2019s decision to enhance his sentence on the grounds that (1) the offense involved between three and seven fire-arms, <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A) (2002); (2) Davis possessed a stolen firearm with an obliterated serial number, USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4); (3) Davis possessed a firearm in connection with another felony offense, USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Davis had two felony drug convictions when he was arrested in a house where surveillance had indicated that drug activity was taking place. Three other people were present. On a table in front of one of them was 10.3 grams of crack cut into $20 pieces. A .390 semiautomatic pistol was on a television stand. Davis was seated on a couch with a 9mm pistol next to his leg. Davis\u2019 brother Matthew was on another couch with a Ruger .357 Magnum next to his leg. The Ruger was stolen and its serial number had been obliterated.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Davis objected to the probation officer\u2019s recommendation for a two-level enhancement for an offense involving three-to-seven fire-arms pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A), a two-level enhancement for a firearm that was stolen or had an obliterated serial number, USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4), and a four-level enhancement because Davis possessed a firearm in connection with another felony offense, i.e., drug trafficking, USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). He argued that he should be held responsible only for the 9mm pistol he personally possessed because he did not have actual or constructive possession of any other firearm. The district court determined that Davis had been involved in a joint criminal activity with the others present and had constructively possessed his co-conspirators\u2019 firearms. On appeal, Davis con-tests the district court\u2019s rulings with respect to the disputed enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">We first review the district court\u2019s determination that Davis possessed or constructively possessed all three firearms. The district</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Love, </em>134 F.3d 595, 606 (4th Cir.1998). Although Davis asserted in his objections to the presentence report that he had possession only of the gun lying next to his leg on the couch, the district court found that he had constructive possession of all three firearms in the room where he was arrested. Constructive possession exists when \u201cthe defendant exercised, or had the power to exercise, dominion and con-trol over the item.\u201d <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>124 F.3d 607, 610 (4th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 878 (4th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Davis argues that the government failed to show that he exercised or had the power to exercise dominion and control over the two guns that were not in his personal possession. He points out that he did not own or reside at the house where the guns were. However, the firearms in the room where Davis was arrested were readily accessible to him: one was in his brother\u2019s possession and the other was lying unattended on the television stand. Davis also contends that there was no evidence that he was involved in a concerted criminal activity with the others present, and asserts that he was simply a guest. However, Davis\u2019 prior record of drug and firearm offenses supported the district court\u2019s conclusion that the circumstances indicated that Davis was present for drug activity. Moreover, Davis presented no evidence that his brother or the other people in the room would have denied him access to either of the firearms. Therefore, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Davis possessed a total of three firearms and in making the two-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Davis argues here also that the enhancement for a stolen firearm or one with an obliterated serial number was incorrect because the evidence did not show that he had actual or constructive possession of the .357 Magnum revolver that was under his brother Matthew\u2019s leg. For the reasons explained earlier, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Davis had constructive possession of the firearm and in making the enhancement for possession of a stolen firearm or one with an obliterated serial number pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Finally, Davis challenges the four-level enhancement that applies if the defendant used or possessed the firearm \u201cin connection with another felony offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). The government has</p>\n<p id=\"APUH\">the burden of proving the necessary facts by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Garnett, </em>243 F.3d 824, 828 (4th Cir.2001). In this Circuit, \u201cin connection with\u201d is treated as analogous to \u201cin relation to,\u201d as used in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2000). <em>United States v. Blount, </em>337 F.3d 404, 411 (4th Cir.2003). That is, the firearm must facilitate or have the tendency to facilitate another offense. <em>Id. </em>(citation omit-ted). \u201c[T]he firearm must have some purpose or effect with respect to the ... crime; its presence or involvement cannot be the result of accident or coincidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Smith v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 223, 238, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993)). But it is sufficient if the gun is \u201cpresent for protection or to embolden the actor.\u201d <em>United States v. Lipford, </em>203 F.3d 259, 266 (4th Cir.2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Here, Davis had prior drug convictions and was present with several others known to be involved in drug dealing in a house where drug trafficking had been taking place. Crack packaged for sale and firearms were present. On these facts, the district court did not clearly err in concluding that Davis possessed the gun to facilitate the ongoing drug offense. Therefore, the court\u2019s decision that the enhancement applied was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
