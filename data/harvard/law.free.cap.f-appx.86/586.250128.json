Coleman appeals the district court order denying his motion for release on bond pending resolution of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. A person seeking interim release during pursuit of \u00a7 2255 relief faces a formidable barrier created by the fact of conviction and the government\u2019s interest in executing its judgment. Coleman has failed to establish exceptional circumstances warranting relief. We further find Coleman did not present \u201ca clear case on the law, ... [or] a clear, and readily evident, case on the facts.\u201d <em>Glynn v. Donnelly, </em>470 F.2d 95, 98 (1st Cir.1972) (citation omitted); <em>see also Martin v. Solem, </em>801 F.2d 324, 329 (8th Cir.1986). We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order denying his request for release on bond. We deny as moot Coleman\u2019s motion to expedite the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
