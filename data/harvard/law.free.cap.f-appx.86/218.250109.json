For reversal, Boneshirt argues the district court abused its discretion in departing upward from the imprisonment range under the Sentencing Guidelines, and relied on factors already taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-26\">Boneshirt has an earlier conviction for sexual abuse of a minor. His relationship with the minor produced a child, the victim in this case. When Boneshirt was released from custody on the earlier conviction, he and the victim\u2019s mother resumed a relationship. Their child, a girl, was then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>three years old. She was later removed from her parents\u2019 care, and an investigation revealed Boneshirt had committed acts which included sexually penetrating his three-year-old daughter, making her scream again and again, and repeatedly ejaculating on her. At sentencing, to Boneshirt\u2019s base offense level of 27 for criminal sexual abuse \u2014 the most analogous offense guideline for incest, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X5.1 \u2014 four levels were added because the victim was under twelve years old, and another two levels were added because the victim was in Boneshirt\u2019s care, custody, and control. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.1(a) &amp; (b). After additional adjustments, a total offense level of 30 and a category III criminal history resulted in a sentencing range of 121 to 151 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The district court then determined an upward departure was warranted and increased Boneshirt\u2019s criminal history category by two categories, resulting in a sentencing range of 151 to 188 months. In departing, the district court relied on U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5K2.0 (aggravating circumstances of kind or degree not taken into consideration by Sentencing Commission in formulating Guidelines), 5K2.8 (extreme conduct by defendant that was unusually heinous, cruel, brutal, or degrading to victim), and 4A1.3 (criminal history category that does not adequately reflect seriousness of defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct or likelihood defendant will commit other crimes). Reviewing the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts de novo, <em>United States v. Hutman, </em>339 F.3d 773, 775 (8th Cir.2003), we conclude the district court properly departed given the facts of this case. <em>See United States v. Hampton, </em>260 F.3d 832, 835-36 (8th Cir.2001) (upholding six-level upward departure as within sentencing court\u2019s discretion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.3 or \u00a7 5K2.8 based in part on four-year-old victim\u2019s psychological injury), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1058, 122 S.Ct. 1919, 152 L.Ed.2d 828 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">LAY, Circuit Judge, concurs only in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b248-16\"> The Honorable Charles B.
