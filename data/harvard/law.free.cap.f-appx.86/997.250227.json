Less than a month after being released from prison for the second time, Smith failed a drug test. The judge initially revoked his supervised release but later decided instead to place him on electronic monitoring. Smith promptly failed another drug test, deviated from his approved schedule, and failed to maintain his telephone service as required. He stipulated to these violations, and the district judge revoked his supervised release and sentenced him to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment, an upward deviation from the range of 6 to 12 months recommended by the probation officer. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G \u00a7 7B1.4. Smith appeals the most recent revocation of his supervised release, but his appointed counsel moves to withdraw because he cannot discern a nonfrivolous basis for the appeal. Smith has declined our invitation under Circuit Rule 51(b) to respond to the motion, and counsel\u2019s brief is facially adequate, so we limit our review to the issues counsel identifies. <em>See United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">Counsel first considers whether Smith could challenge the revocation of his supervised release. But to do so would be frivolous because Smith admitted committing two Grade C violations of his release conditions-failing two drug tests and not complying with the terms of his electronic monitoring-which permitted the court to revoke his supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">Counsel also questions whether Smith could challenge the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence that exceeds that recommended by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4. This too would be frivolous. The sentencing ranges provided by \u00a7 7B1.4 are not binding on a district court, although the judge, must consider them in imposing a sentence. <em>See United States v. Trotter, </em>270 F.3d 1150, 1151 (7th Cir.2001). But given Smith\u2019s history of violations, the court\u2019s decision to impose a higher sentence was not \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1); <em>United States v. Harvey, </em>232 F.3d 585, 587 (7th Cir.2000). Furthermore, Smith wrote a letter to the judge in which he openly admitted to using marijuana. We have held that drug use may be used to imply possession of the drug. <em>See Trotter, </em>270 F.3d at 1153. If the court had simply characterized Smith\u2019s admitted marijuana use as \u201cpossession\u201d rather than as the submission of \u201curinalysis samples which tested positive for marijuana,\u201d it would have found him guilty of a Grade B violation, <em>see id.; </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a). This would have required the court to revoke Smith\u2019s supervised release and imprison him, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g)(1), and his sentencing range would have been 12 to 18 months, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G \u00a7 7B1.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and this appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
