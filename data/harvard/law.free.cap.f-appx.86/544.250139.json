We have jurisdiction over this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). The Government concedes that the District Court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>action was error and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-17\">The facts of this case are well known to the parties and are not in dispute. On March 17, 2003, the District Court entered an order sentencing Bettis to twelve months imprisonment for violating the terms of his supervised release. On March 20, 2003, Bettis appealed this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-19\">On May 12, 2003, the District Court, <em>sua sponte, </em>issued a second order imposing a period of twenty-four months of supervised release on Bettis after the conclusion of his twelve-month sentence. This order was intended to \u201cclarify\u201d the March 17th order. (App. at 6a.) Bettis appealed this second order, and we consolidated it with his prior appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-20\">The Government correctly concedes that the District Court\u2019s May 12th order cannot be considered the correction of a clear error made within seven days after sentencing, as is allowed under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a). The Government also correctly concedes that the District Court\u2019s imposition of this additional term of supervised release is not the correction of a clerical error under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 36. Accordingly, as the Government also concedes, the District Court lacked jurisdiction to add additional penalties to Bettis\u2019 original sentence more than two months after that sentence was imposed. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Fraley, </em>988 F.2d 4, 7 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-21\">We will vacate the District Court\u2019s May 12, 2003 order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
