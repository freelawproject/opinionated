The trial court sentenced Hinkle to life imprisonment. The district court granted a COA on the issue whether counsel provided ineffective assistance when he told Hinkle\u2019s witnesses that their testimony was not needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-27\">Federal habeas relief may not be granted on questions adjudicated on the merits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>by a state court unless the state court\u2019s decision (1) was contrary to or was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court; or (2) was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">To establish ineffective assistance, Hinkle must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance caused him prejudice. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). \u201c[Cjomplaints of uncalled witnesses are not favored, because the presentation of testimonial evidence is a matter of trial strategy,\u201d and counsel is entitled to a presumption that his performance was adequate. <em>Wilkerson v. Cain, </em>233 F.3d 886, 892-93 (5th Cir.2000). To demonstrate the required <em>Strickland </em>prejudice on his claim of ineffective assistance based on uncalled witnesses, Hinkle \u201cmust show not only that [the] testimony would have been favorable, but also that the witness would have testified at trial.\u201d <em>Evans v. Cockrell, </em>285 F.3d 370, 377 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The district court concluded that Hinkle did not show that the uncalled witnesses\u2019 testimony would have been favorable and that counsel\u2019s decision to omit the testimony was not a matter of sound trial strategy. <em>See Evans, </em>285 F.3d at 377; <em>Wilkerson, </em>233 F.3d at 892-93. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Hinkle has not made the showing required under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b717-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
