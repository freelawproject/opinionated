After the close of the Government\u2019s case in chief, the district court denied Peele\u2019s motion for acquittal for lack of sufficient evidence on all counts save one \u00a7 287 count. On appeal, Peele asserts the evidence was insufficient to support any of her convictions and that certain remarks by the prosecutor in closing argument unduly prejudiced her defense. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-21\">In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence and the denial of a motion for acquittal, a guilty verdict \u201cmust be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the government, to support the finding of guilt.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc). We find the evidence, when viewed in its entirety and in the light most favorable to the Government, supports Peele\u2019s convictions. Likewise, we find the prosecutor\u2019s comments in closing did not prejudice Peele\u2019s defense or violate her right to due process under the Fifth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Scheetz, </em>293 F.3d 175, 186 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 963, 123 S.Ct. 397, 154 L.Ed.2d 320 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-22\">Accordingly, we affirm Peele\u2019s convictions and sentence.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b682-18\"> Peek's criminal judgment order contains several clerical errors. Most notably, Count One is described as a conspiracy to distribute 50 grams or more of a mixture containing methamphetamine, rather than a conspiracy to defraud the United States by obtaining payments of false claims for tax refunds. Also the term of imprisonment for Count One is omitted, and the term of supervised release for Count Four is omitted. Peek has not asserted these errors on appeal and they do not affect our disposition of the issues she has asserted. The district court may correct such clerical errors in the criminal judgment order at any time under Fed.R.Crim.P. 36.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
