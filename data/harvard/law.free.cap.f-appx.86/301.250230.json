We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-24\">Pinto-Santellano contends that the district court clearly erred by denying him a sentencing adjustment for acceptance of responsibility because he went to trial. We review for clear error, <em>United States v. Bazuaye, </em>240 F.3d 861, 863 (9th Cir.2001), and see none.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-25\">Pinto-Santellano\u2019s stated reason for going to trial was to call attention to his medical condition rather than to contest his factual guilt <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 application note 2. The evidence of his medical problem was excluded prior to trial, yet Pinto-Santellano nonetheless proceeded to trial. He contested his factual guilt. We discern no clear error in the district court\u2019s finding that Pinto-Santellano failed to meet his burden of clearly demonstrating acceptance of responsibility. <em>See United States v. Velasco-Medina, </em>305 F.3d 839, 854 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b331-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
