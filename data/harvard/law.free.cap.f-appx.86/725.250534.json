He argues on appeal that the district court erred by increasing his sentence by three offense levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). However, as noted by the Government, Mei\u2019s instant argument is barred by the appeal-waiver provision contained in his written plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-24\">Although the Government asserted the appeal waiver in its brief, defense counsel did not file a reply brief. He has therefore failed to address the threshold issue before this court. However, as the record shows that Mei\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal was knowing and voluntary, that waiver should be enforced as valid. See <em>United States v. Melancon, </em>972 F.2d 566, 567-68 (5th Cir.1992). Accordingly, Mei\u2019s instant appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b755-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
