We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Lopez-Uribe contends that the district court improperly denied him a \u201csafety valve\u201d sentence reduction pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines section 5C1.2, even though he made a full disclosure to the government concerning his offense. Specifically, Lopez-Uribe asserts that he met his initial burden and that the district court did not then properly shift the burden to the government to show the information he supplied was untrue or incomplete. The record supports a determination that Lopez-Uribe failed to assert relevant facts that were more likely true than not, <em>see United States v. Montano, </em>250 F.3d 709, 713 (9th Cir.2001), and we conclude the district court did not clearly err in finding that Lopez-Uribe did not meet his burden. <em>See United States v. Ajugwo, </em>82 F.3d 925, 929 (9th Cir.1996) (a \u201cbare assertion that [a defendant] provided all relevant information to the government ... is hardly a preponderance of the evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">Lopez-Uribe also contends, for the first time on appeal, that he should receive a third reduction point for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines section 3E1.1(b)(1). Reviewing for plain error, <em>see United States v. Vences, </em>169 F.3d 611, 613 (9th Cir.1999), we conclude that because Lopez-Uribe\u2019s statements lacked the requisite completeness to warrant the section 3E1.1(b)(1) adjustment, the district court properly denied the additional point. <em>See United States v. Chee, </em>110 F.3d 1489, 1494 (9th Cir.1997) (upholding district court\u2019s denial of adjustment where defendant did not provide complete information regarding his involvement in the offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b326-21\">This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
