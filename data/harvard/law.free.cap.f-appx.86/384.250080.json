We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Ramirez was driving a van registered in Colorado through Utah when the van was stopped by Utah Highway Patrol Sergeant Ryan Bauer. Bauer stopped the van after noticing the van front side windows had an excessive tint, in violation of Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 41-6-149. Section 41 \u2014 6 \u2014 149(l)(b) provides that, with certain exceptions not relevant here, \u201ca person may not operate a motor vehicle with ... a front side window that allows less than 43% light transmittance.\u201d The statute does not provide an exception for vehicles registered in other states. It is undisputed that the van window tinting did not violate Colorado\u2019s less restrictive law. Colo.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 42-4-227(l)(a) (prohibiting window treatments that allow \u201cless than twenty-seven percent light transmittance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">At the suppression hearing, Bauer testified that he observed several things during the stop that made him suspect drugs might be hidden in the van and which led him to ask Ramirez for permission to search the van. Ramirez consented to a search of the van and Bauer discovered two packages containing methamphetamine. Ramirez moved to suppress the methamphetamine, arguing the stop was not based on any reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal wrongdoing. The district court denied the motion, concluding that Bauer had a reasonable suspicion that Ramirez was operating the van in violation of Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 41-6-149.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">When reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, this court accepts the district court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>See United States v. Basham, </em>268 F.3d 1199, 1203 (10th Cir.2001). This court reviews de novo the legal question of whether a search violated the defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">A traffic stop is a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment and therefore must not be unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Botero-Ospina, </em>71 F.3d 783, 786 (10th Cir.1995) (en banc). A traffic stop is reasonable at its inception if the officer had either probable cause or a reasonable articulable suspicion that the motorist violated an applicable traffic or equipment regulation. <em>See id. </em>at 787. Ramirez argues the Full Faith and Credit Clause precludes application of Section 41-6-149 to vehicles registered in other states that are passing through Utah and, thus, there was no reasonable suspicion that Ramirez had violated an applicable equipment regulation. Ramirez\u2019 argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">The Full Faith and Credit Clause provides that \u201cFull Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State.\u201d U.S. Const. art. IV, \u00a7 1. The Supreme Court has emphasized there is a difference between \u201cthe credit owed to laws (legislative measures and common law) and to judgments.\u201d <em>Baker v. General Motors Corp., </em>522 U.S. 222, 232, 118 S.Ct. 657, 139 L.Ed.2d 580 (1998) (cited with approval in <em>Franchise Tax Bd. of California v. Hyatt, </em>538 U.S. 488, 123 S.Ct. 1683, 1687, 155 L.Ed.2d 702 (2003)). The Full Faith and Credit Clause \u201cis exacting\u201d with respect to \u201c[a] final judgment ... rendered by a court with adjudicatory authority over the subject matter and persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>governed by the judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233. On the other hand, the Full Faith and Credit Clause does not compel \u201ca state to substitute the statutes of other states for its own statutes dealing with a subject matter concerning which it is competent to legislate.\u201d <em>Sim Oil Co. v. Wortman, </em>486 U.S. 717, 722, 108 S.Ct. 2117, 100 L.Ed.2d 743 (1988) (internal quotation omitted). Here, the State of Utah is competent to pass legislation dealing with the window tinting of vehicles operated within Utah. Utah is not required by the Full Faith and Credit Clause to apply the window tinting statute of Colorado in lieu of its own statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">In addition to the Full Faith and Credit Clause, Ramirez relies on <em>State v. Friesen, </em>988 P.2d 7 (Utah App.1999), and <em>State v. Baird, </em>763 P.2d 1214 (Utah App.1988). Neither case is on point. In each case, an officer based the stop of a vehicle registered in another state upon the officer\u2019s supposition of the requirements of the law of the state where the vehicle was registered. In <em>Friesen, </em>the defendant\u2019s Wyoming registered van was stopped in Utah based on an officer\u2019s incorrect speculation that the van might be in violation of Wyoming\u2019s license plate display law. During the stop, the defendant consented to a search and marijuana was found. The appellate court, like the trial court, concluded the officer did not have a reasonable suspicion to justify the initial stop. In <em>Baird, </em>the defendant\u2019s vehicle was stopped when an officer thought there was something \u201cfunny\u201d about the vehicle\u2019s Arizona license plate sticker. During the stop, the trooper smelled marijuana and, without the defendant\u2019s consent, searched the car and discovered marijuana. The appellate court concluded the officer did not have a reasonable suspicion of a violation to justify the initial stop. In the case before us, unlike <em>Friesen </em>or <em>Baird, </em>the officer knew what Utah law prohibited and his observations supported a reasonable suspicion that the law regarding window tinting was being violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Finally, Ramirez notes that Bauer testified he generally only gave warning citations to non-Utah residents operating vehicles in violation of Section 41-6-149. According to Ramirez, this indicates that Bauer had an ulterior motive for stopping him. It is well established that it is irrelevant that an officer \u201cmay have had other subjective motives\u201d for stopping a vehicle as long as the officer reasonably suspected that a traffic law was being violated. <em>See Botero-Ospina, </em>71 F.3d at 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b414-28\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b416-5\">. Even if the Utah statute were repugnant to the Constitution, the \"good faith exception\u201d to the exclusionary rule would apply. Under the \u201cgood faith exception,\" the exclusionary rule does not apply to evidence obtained by police officers who act in reasonable reliance on validly enacted statutes. <em>See Illinois v. Krull, </em>480 U.S. 340, 107 S.Ct. 1160, 94 L.Ed.2d 364 (1987); <em>United States v. Vanness, </em>342 F.3d 1093 (10th Cir.2003) (holding officer\u2019s reliance on local noise ordinance was reasonable and therefore exclusionary rule did not apply to evidence obtained as a result of defendant\u2019s consent following stop of defendant\u2019s car pursuant to noise ordinance\u2014 even if ordinance was unconstitutional).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
