The district court dismissed the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and the district court likewise denied the plaintiffs\u2019 postjudgment motion for new trial. The plaintiffs now appeal the district court\u2019s denial of their post-judgment motion. They also move this court to supplement the record on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-19\">We first note that there is an issue concerning which plaintiffs filed a valid notice of appeal. However, we pretermit this jurisdictional question because this appeal lacks merit. <em>See United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Weathersby, </em>958 F.2d 65, 66 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-20\">The plaintiffs challenge the district court\u2019s denial of their postjudgment motion. They do not dispute the district court\u2019s characterization of this motion as a Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(a) motion for new trial, nor do they challenge the district court\u2019s reasons for denying the motion. Rather, they argue only that they were at an unfair disadvantage in the district court because they lacked counsel. This argument is unavailing. The denial of a motion for new trial is not appealable. <em>See Osterberger v. Relocation Realty Serv. Corp., </em>921 F.2d 72, 73 (5th Cir.1991); <em>Youmans v. Simon, </em>791 F.2d 341, 349 (5th Cir.1986). Moreover, the plaintiffs\u2019 argument concerning their lack of counsel shows no error in the underlying judgment dismissing their suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Osterberger, </em>921 F.2d at 73. To the extent that the plaintiffs attempt to raise several new issues for the first time in their reply brief, we decline to consider these issues. <em>See United States v. Prince, </em>868 F.2d 1379, 1386 (5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>1989). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED, and the motion to supplement is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b736-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
