Defendant raises four issues on appeal: (1) whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant\u2019s RICO conviction; (2) whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant\u2019s attempted witness tampering conviction; (3) whether the government\u2019s summation deprived defendant of a fair trial; and (4) whether a letter by defendant\u2019s pretrial counsel was properly admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">\u201cAn appellant who challenges the sufficiency of the evidence bears a heavy burden.\u201d <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>176 F.3d 52, 89 (2d Cir.1999). This Court must view the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the government ...,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 89 (citations omitted), and all issues of credibility must be resolved in favor of the prosecution. <em>See United States v. Desena, </em>287 F.3d 170, 177 (2d Cir.2002). The conviction must be affirmed if <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the ciime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). Consequently, \u201c[t]he ultimate question is not whether [this Court] believe[s] the evidence adduced at trial established defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether any rational trier of fact could so find.\u201d <em>United States v. Payton, </em>159 F.3d 49, 56 (2d Cir.1998) (emphasis omitted). Under these standards both sufficiency challenges fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-13\">The RICO statute makes it unlawful \u201cfor any person employed by or associated with any enterprise ... to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c); <em>see also United States v. Indelicate, </em>865 F.2d 1370, 1372 (2d Cir.1989) <em>(en banc). </em>The statute defines the term \u201centerprise\u201d to include \u201cany ... group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(4). The Supreme Court has explained that a RICO enterprise is \u201ca group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct\u201d the existence of which is proven \u201cby evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit.\u201d <em>United States v. Turkette, </em>452 U.S. 576, 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-14\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertions, the trial record contains proof of the existence of the charged enterprise (\u201cthe Enterprise\u201d). Cooperating witnesses testified they committed crimes as part of an ongoing criminal group and were members of the Enterprise. Plea allocutions of group members acknowledged the Enterprise\u2019s existence. Individuals testified to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>the structure and hierarchy of the Enterprise, and other evidence established the ongoing nature of the criminal activities committed by Enterprise members.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Similarly, there was ample evidence of a pattern of racketeering activity. \u201c[T]o prove a pattern of racketeering activity ... a prosecutor must show that the racketeering predicates are related, and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.\u201d <em>H.J. Inc. v. Northwest Bell Tel. Co., </em>492 U.S. 229, 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989) (emphasis omitted). To establish relatedness, the government must show the racketeering acts relate both to one another (\u201chorizontal relatedness\u201d) and to the enterprise (\u201cvertical relatedness\u201d). <em>See Diaz, </em>176 F.3d at 93. Defendant claims the jury lacked a reasonable basis to determine the charged predicate acts were vertically related to the Enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Vertical relatedness can be proven by showing either that (1) the offense related to the activities of the enterprise, or (2) defendant was able to commit the offense solely because of his position in the enterprise. <em>See United States v. Minicone, </em>960 F.2d 1099, 1106 (2d Cir.1992). Here, testimony from associates of the Enterprise established that criminal acts were undertaken to gain the confidence and respect of other members. That testimony is sufficient to establish vertical relatedness. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Polanco, </em>145 F.3d 536, 541 (2d Cir.1998) (gun sales intended to \u201ccultivate a relationship\u201d and persuade others to join enterprise were vertically related to affairs of drug enterprise). Defendant\u2019s claim that his actions were motivated by personal profit, and not the desire to gain respect of other members, is unavailing. The indictment charged that one of the purposes of the Enterprise was to enrich its own members. This allegation was supported by testimony at trial. Thus, crimes undertaken for the financial enrichment of Enterprise members are in furtherance of the affairs of the Enterprise. <em>See Minicone, </em>960 F.2d at 1107 (crime committed \u201cfor the purpose of enriching the enterprise\u2019s members and consolidating its power\u201d was vertically related to the enterprise).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The evidence was also sufficient to sustain the witness tampering conviction. The statute makes it a crime to intimidate, threaten or \u201ccorruptly persuade\u201d a potential witness, or to attempt to do so, with intent to influence his testimony in an official proceeding. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b). The section was written broadly to encompass non-coercive efforts to tamper with a witness. <em>See United States v. Masterpol, </em>940 F.2d 760, 763 (2d Cir.1991). Consequently, the government need only \u201cprove that the defendant\u2019s attempts to persuade were motivated by an improper purpose.\u201d <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>76 F.3d 442, 452 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Defendant does not dispute the facts elicited at trial. Defendant believed Christopher was cooperating against him. Concerned Christopher would testify against him at trial, defendant directed intermediaries \u2014 including a Gambino family associate \u2014 to reach out to Christopher and deliver a message. The jury could reasonably conclude the intent, and resulting effect, of that message was to demonstrate both that defendant believed Christopher was \u201ca rat\u201d and that defendant knew where to find Christopher.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">Defendant claims that even if he did intend to discourage Christopher from cooperating with the government, he did not violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b) because he did not use any form of \u201ccorrupt persuasion.\u201d That contention is based upon a Third Circuit case in which a divided panel ruled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>that the term \u201ccorruptly persuades\u201d does not include a non-coercive attempt to persuade a co-conspirator who could legitimately invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to disclose inculpatory information. <em>See United States v. Farrell, </em>126 F.3d 484, 488 (3d Cir.1997). <em>Farrell\u2019s </em>definition of \u201ccorruptly\u201d is clearly inconsistent with this Court\u2019s view of that term in <em>Thompson. </em>76 F.3d at 452. Thus, contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, <em>Farrell </em>is irreconcilable with the law of this Circuit by which we are bound. <em>See also United States v. Shotts, </em>145 F.3d 1289, 1300-01 (11th Cir.1998) (preferring the Second Circuit\u2019s position in <em>Thompson </em>than the Third Circuit\u2019s position in <em>Farrell.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Defendant also claims the government\u2019s rebuttal summation deprived him of a fair trial. Where as here, defense counsel makes arguments that are themselves improper, the government is granted greater latitude in its rebuttal. <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>22 F.3d 430, 438 (2d Cir.1994). Rather than rehash the unprofessional antics of counsel, suffice it to say that in light of the attacks on rthe integrity of its case and the Assistant United States Attorney, the government was entitled to respond with \u201crebutting language suitable to the occasion.\u201d <em>United States v. Bagaric, </em>706 F.2d 42, 60 (2d Cir.1983) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Finally, defendant challenges the district court\u2019s decision to admit into evidence a letter by defendant\u2019s pretrial counsel. Because this question is one deserving of a more detailed analysis, we address this issue in an opinion issued simultaneously with this summary order.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED, in all respects, other than to the extent that it addresses the admissibility of the pretrial counsel\u2019s letter.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
