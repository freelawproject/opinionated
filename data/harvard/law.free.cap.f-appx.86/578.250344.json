Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review on the reasoning of the Board. <em>See In re: Amanuel, </em>No. A75-376-845 (B.I.A. May 7, 2003). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-24\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b608-19\"> We conclude we lack jurisdiction to review the Board's denial of Amanuel\u2019s motion to reopen because she did not petition for review of that order within thirty days. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
