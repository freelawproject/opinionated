R. Civ. P. 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law and Fed. R. Civ. P. 59 motion for new trial following the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of the City of Seguin, Texas, in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights suit. Among other things, Tomblin argues that the City\u2019s pervasive practice of obtaining social security numbers (SSN) during routine traffic stops established the existence of a well-established policy and custom, thereby entitling Tomblin to judgment as a matter of law on his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim. For purposes of his motion for new trial, Tomblin contends that the jury instructions were flawed because they were submitted on the issue of municipal liability only without the benefit of the district court\u2019s threshold determination whether a constitutional violation had occurred. Tomblin also argues that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the weight of the evidence, and that the district court erred in failing to recite findings of fact or conclusions of law with respect to Tomblin\u2019s state-law claim, as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">We have reviewed the record and the briefs submitted by the parties and hold that reasonable persons could have reached different conclusions regarding the existence of an official City policy or custom mandating the disclosure of a person\u2019s SSN. Accordingly, the jury\u2019s determination of this issue will not be disturbed. <em>See Granberry v. O\u2019Barr, </em>866 F.2d 112, 113 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">Tomblin\u2019s challenge to the jury instructions, raised for the first time on appeal, does not survive plain error review. <em>See Hartsell v. Dr. Pepper Bottling Co. of Tex., </em>207 F.3d 269, 272 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Tex. Beef Group v. Winfrey, </em>201 F.3d 680, 689 (5th Cir.2000). Similarly, we reject as lacking merit Tomblin\u2019s arguments challenging the evidence supporting the jury\u2019s verdict, and the district court\u2019s alleged failure to recite findings of fact and conclusions of law. <em>See Sherman v. United States Dep\u2019t of the Army, </em>244 F.3d 357, 365 (5th Cir.2001); Fed R. Civ. P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b747-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
