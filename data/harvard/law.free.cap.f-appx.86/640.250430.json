Smith\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising as a potentially meritorious issue whether Smith was correctly sentenced as an armed career criminal, but asserting that in his view there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Smith has been informed of his right to file a pro <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>se supplemental brief. He has not filed a brief, but has moved to dismiss his appointed attorney and lists in his motion several issues he believes have merit. Smith\u2019s attorney has moved to withdraw. We deny Smith\u2019s motion to dismiss his attorney and the attorney\u2019s motion to withdraw. We affirm the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">A defendant who violates \u00a7 922(g) is subject to a sentence within a mandatory range of fifteen years to life if, before his violation of \u00a7 922(g), he received \u201cthree previous convictions ... for a violent felony or serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another.\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e)(1). A \u201cviolent felony\u201d is defined in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) as \u201cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that ... has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.... \u201d Smith had prior convictions for a felony common law robbery committed on October 8, 1993, two counts of felony second degree kidnapping and felony robbery with a dangerous weapon committed on July 17, 1994, and a felony second degree murder committed on August 28, 1994. The 1994 offenses were consolidated for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">At his sentencing hearing, Smith\u2019s attorney conceded that his client was eligible for sentencing under \u00a7 924(e). Because of Smith\u2019s status as an armed career criminal, and because at the time of his arrest Smith possessed marijuana packaged for sale, his offense level and criminal history category were adjusted upward pursuant to USSG \u00a7 4B 1.4(b)(3)(A). The resulting guideline range was 188-235 months. Smith informed the court that he had not committed the July 17, 1994, kidnappings and armed robberies, but had pled guilty to those offenses as part of a plea bargain in the felony murder. He acknowledged that, because these convictions had not been vacated, reversed, or set aside, the court was required to sentence him under \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">In the <em>Anders </em>brief, appellate counsel challenges the armed career criminal sentence. We find no error in the sentence. Offenses consolidated for sentencing may be predicate offenses for a \u00a7 924(e) sentence if they were committed on different occasions, as they were here. <em>United States v. Letterlough, </em>63 F.3d 332, 335 (4th Cir.1995) (offenses must have arisen from separate and distinct criminal episodes); <em>United States v. Samuels, </em>970 F.2d 1312, 1315 (4th Cir.1992) (neither \u00a7 924(e) nor the guidelines require that predicate offenses be tried or sentenced separately). In his motion for new counsel, Smith claims error in that he was not served with an information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000). However, such an information is required only when the defendant receives a sentence for a federal drug offense that is statutorily increased based on prior drug convictions; it was not necessary in Smith\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>this court has reviewed the record for reversible error and found none. We therefore affirm the conviction and sentence. We deny Smith\u2019s motion to dismiss his attorney and counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
