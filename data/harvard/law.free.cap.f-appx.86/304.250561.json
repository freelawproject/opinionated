We need not reach this contention because petitioner\u2019s early-1990s administrative voluntary removal, which petitioner does not contest occurred, precludes him from establishing the ten years of continuous physical presence required for eligibility for cancellation of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l); <em>Vasquez-Lopez v. Ashcroft, </em>343 F.3d 961, 969-74 (9th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (upholding the BIA\u2019s conclusion that administrative voluntary departure, effectuated in lieu of removal proceedings, continues after 1996 amendments to constitute a break in continuous physical presence).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-16\">Petitioner\u2019s contention that the BIA was required to state reasons for its affirmance of the immigration judge\u2019s decision is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 851 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that it does not violate due process for the BIA to affirm an immigration judge\u2019s decision without issuing an opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-17\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b335-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
