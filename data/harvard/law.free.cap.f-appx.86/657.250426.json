Jenkins, in his plea agreement, waived his right to appeal or collaterally attack any sentence within the statutory maximum. He was sentenced to 78 months incarceration, 5 years of supervised release, and a $100 special assessment. Jenkins\u2019 counsel has filed an appeal under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting the sentencing court erred in assessing Jenkins\u2019 criminal history. Jenkins was informed of his right to file a supplemental brief but did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">We review the validity of a defendant\u2019s waiver of appellate rights de novo. <em>United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992). Jenkins\u2019 waiver is valid and his appeal is therefore meritless. <em>United States v. Wiggins, </em>905 F.2d 51, 53 (4th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165,168 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-11\">Accordingly, we affirm Jenkins\u2019 convictions and sentence. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and find no other meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
