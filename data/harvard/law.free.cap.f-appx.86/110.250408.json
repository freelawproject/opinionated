Bailey subsequently petitioned for a federal writ of habeas corpus, alleging that the state court violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth (and Fourteenth) Amendment by admitting an out-of-court statement made by his co-defendant without allowing him to cross-examine the individual. Because we agree with the district court that the state courts did not violate clearly-established federal law in permitting the admission of this evidence-most notably, because the state court did give petitioner an opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>cross-examine his co-defendant-we affirm the court\u2019s denial of habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">This case arises from the murder of Randy Bland. At 3:10 a.m. on July 13, 1993, police discovered Bland lying shot to death beside his car. Later that morning. Bailey voluntarily went to the police station and gave a statement to police regarding Bland\u2019s murder. He told police that he had \u201cno involvement\u201d in the murder, but that he knew where the weapon used to kill Bland was located. During the conversation. Bailey implicated Wayne Brown in the murder, telling police that Brown had given him the weapon after the shooting, and that he had subsequently hidden the weapon in the backyard of a home near the crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Shortly thereafter, police arrested Brown for the murder. After waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Brown gave a statement to Officer Reginald Harvel about the incident in which he admitted to shooting Bland, but also implicated Bailey in the murder. According to Brown, he and Bailey \u201cdecided to get [Bland]\u201d after an altercation, and then set out to kill him. Bailey gave Brown the gun that he used in the murder, and was hiding nearby when Brown shot Bland.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Brown and Bailey were tried together in a single proceeding for their offenses, but each one was tried in front of a different jury. Ruling on a motion in limine before trial, the state-court judge determined that Brown\u2019s statement to Officer Harvel would be admissible as substantive evidence against Bailey under an exception to Michigan\u2019s hearsay rule-Rule 804(b)(3) of the Michigan Rules of Evidence. In doing so, the court determined that the statement was against penal interest and was made by an \u201cunavailable\u201d declarant because Brown thus far had invoked his Fifth Amendment rights. The court also determined that the statement bore sufficient indicia of reliability to be admitted without cross-examination of the declarant. In accordance with this ruling. Officer Harvel read Brown\u2019s statement in its entirety in front of Brown\u2019s and Bailey\u2019s juries during the State\u2019s case in chief against the two defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">After the State rested, Bailey declined to introduce any evidence. At this point, Bailey\u2019s lawyer asked the judge to keep Bailey\u2019s jury out of the courtroom during Brown\u2019s defense. Bailey\u2019s lawyer, however, soon equivocated, and a lengthy discussion ensued with the trial judge about whether Bailey\u2019s jury should hear Brown\u2019s defense. During this colloquy, the trial judge asked Bailey\u2019s attorney if he \u201c[didn\u2019t] wish to cross examine [Brown]\u201d should Brown decide to testify in his own defense. Bailey\u2019s attorney responded that he had rested his case, and the judge pointed out that \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t examine [Brown].\u201d Ultimately, Bailey\u2019s attorney elected to have the jury stay out of the courtroom while Brown proceeded with his case, and accordingly Bailey\u2019s jury did not return until closing arguments and the court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">At it turned out, Brown waived his Fifth Amendment privilege and took the stand in his own defense. Bailey\u2019s attorney, however, did not request a return of the Bailey jury and he thus did not cross-examine Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">The jury convicted Bailey of second degree murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, and the court sentenced him to a prison term of fifteen to forty years for the murder and an additional two years for the firearm violation. After unsuccessfully appealing this judgment and after unsuccessfully pursuing state court post-conviction reme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>dies, Bailey filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal district court, challenging his conviction on Confrontation Clause grounds. He claimed that the state court committed constitutional error by admitting Brown\u2019s out-of-court statement to Officer Harvel as substantive evidence without affording him an opportunity to cross-examine Brown and without sufficient indicia of reliability. The district court rejected the claim, concluding that the state court satisfied all constitutional requirements in this area by offering Bailey\u2019s lawyer the opportunity to cross-examine Brown. Bailey appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">When presented with an appeal from the denial of a habeas petition, we give de novo review to the district court\u2019s legal conclusions, applying the same standards of review to the state court proceeding as the district court applied. <em>See Smith v. Hofbauer, </em>312 F.3d 809, 813 (6th Cir.2002). The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA). Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), establishes the applicable standard of review. Under AEDPA, federal courts may grant a writ of habeas corpus only if the petitioner\u2019s state court conviction \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), or was \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2254(d)(2). The requirements of \u00a7 2254(d)(1) are satisfied when a state court reaches a conclusion of law opposite to that reached by the Supreme Court, or if in facing a set of \u201cmaterially indistinguishable\u201d facts, the state court arrives at a result different from that of the Supreme Court. <em>See Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 405, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">In this case. Bailey complains that the admission of his co-defendant\u2019s confession (which implicated Bailey in the murder) violated clearly-established Supreme Court precedent interpreting the Confrontation Clause. For reasons that follow, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">In state prosecutions, as in federal prosecutions, the Confrontation Clause gives the defendant the right \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. VI; <em>see also Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 403, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965) (applying the Sixth Amendment to the States). As the words of the provision suggest, the constitutional right to confront adverse witnesses generally prevents a court from admitting an out-of-court statement against a criminal defendant. <em>See California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 155-58, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970). <em>See also Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. 530, 546, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 90 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986) (affirming \u201ctime-honored teaching\u201d that a \u201ccodefendant\u2019s confession inculpating the accused is inherently unreliable\u201d and cannot be admitted consistent with the Confrontation Clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">This general prohibition, however, has two exceptions. First, a state court does not violate the Confrontation Clause where the defendant is given a right to cross-examine the individual who made the out-of-court statement. <em>See Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 315-16, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974); <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. at 158 (\u201c[T]he Confrontation Clause is not violated by admitting a declarant\u2019s out-of-court statements, as long as the declarant is testifying as a witness and subject to full and effective cross-examination.\u201d). Second, if the declarant is not available for crossexamination, the statement may be admitted if it (1) falls within a \u201cfirmly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>rooted hearsay exception\u201d or (2) contains \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d such that cross-examination would not materially increase the reliability of the statement. <em>Lilly v. Virginia, </em>527 U.S. 116, 124-25, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117 (1999) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The right of cross-examination secured by the Confrontation Clause does not demand that cross-examination actually take place or that it be allowed without limits. Rather, the defendant must be afforded an <em>\u201copportunity </em>for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u201d <em>Delaware v. Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. 15, 20, 106 S.Ct. 292, 88 L.Ed.2d 15 (1985); <em>see also Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986) (holding that prohibition of <em>\u201call </em>inquiry\u201d into witness bias violated the Confrontation Clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">That \u201copportunity\u201d was provided here. While the exchange between the trial judge and Bailey\u2019s lawyer was at points confusing, the trial judge clearly said it was Bailey\u2019s decision whether his jury would hear any of Brown\u2019s case in chief. And the judge made it clear that with Bailey\u2019s jury in the courtroom. Bailey\u2019s attorney would be able to cross-examine Brown if he took the stand. Nor was Bailey (or his attorney) presented with an abstract question. In the course of this colloquy, Brown\u2019s lawyer indicated that Brown would in fact take the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Bailey in the end was faced with a straightforward choice. On the one hand, he could allow his jury to remain in the courtroom while his lawyer cross-examined Brown on his confession but face the risk that Brown might say something even more damaging to his case. On the other hand, Bailey could keep his jury out of the courtroom and eliminate the risk of exposing the jury to potentially damaging testimony but forgo the opportunity to cross-examine Brown about his confession. Bailey opted to take the latter route, which turned out to be prescient: Brown did exactly what Bailey presumably feared by recanting his earlier confession and testifying that it was Bailey, not Brown, who pulled the trigger on Bland.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">This sort of strategic choice does not violate the Confrontation Clause. When a state court gives the defendant an opportunity to cross-examine a witness and the defendant opts not to accept that opportunity as a matter of trial strategy, it does not offend the Confrontation Clause. <em>See Trigones v. Bissonnette, </em>296 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir.2002) (defense lawyer\u2019s decision to forgo bias line of cross-examination does not violate the Confrontation Clause); <em>Jackson v. Brigano, </em>No. 94-3409, 1995 WL 302258, at *1 (6th Cir. May 17, 1995) (\u201c[Counsel\u2019s] inability to cross-examine was at least partially a result of a tactical decision by defense counsel, and therefore does not amount to a violation of the Confrontation Clause.\u201d): <em>United States v. Wright, </em>904 F.2d 403, 406 (8th Cir.1990) (finding no Confrontation Clause violation where defendant\u2019s \u201cdecision not to cross-examine ... witnesses ... was a tactical decision by his attorney\u201d and \u201cnot a prohibition handed down by the court\u201d): <em>United States v. Tarantino, </em>846 F.2d 1384, 1407 (D.C.Cir.1988) (finding no Confrontation Clause violation where defendant tactically chose to forgo cross-examination on a particular subject when doing so would open the door to damaging testimony). Because the trial court gave Bailey an opportunity to cross-examine Brown on his confession, we cannot say that the Michigan court\u2019s decision to admit the confession as substantive evidence was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly-established Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Bailey makes several arguments to the contrary, all unavailing. First, he contends that the state court erred by considering the admissibility of Brown\u2019s statement wholesale, rather than in smaller parcels, which in his view is inconsistent with <em>Williamson v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 594, 114 S.Ct. 2431, 129 L.Ed.2d 476 (1994) (precluding admission under the statement-against-interest rule of a narrative statement or confession without analysis of whether each individual \u201cdeclaration or remark\u201d is actually inculpatory). Yet <em>Williamson </em>involves the exception to the hearsay rule found in <em>Federal </em>Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3) for statements against the declarant\u2019s interest. By contrast, the Michigan court in Bailey\u2019s case applied its own evidentiary rule (Michigan Rule 804(b)(3))-which parallels, but need not be interpreted identically to, the federal provision-in determining whether Brown\u2019s confession should be admitted. <em>See People v. Bailey, </em>No. 190227, 1997 WL 33347855, at *2-3 (Mich.Ct.App. June 17,1997). As this case proves and as several later cases confirm, the Michigan courts have not followed <em>Williamson\u2019s </em>interpretation of the federal statement-against-interest rule. <em>See, e.g., People v. Beasley, </em>239 Mich.App. 548, 609 N.W.2d 581, 585 (2000). Because <em>Williamson </em>was neither directly nor indirectly (through avoidance principles) informed by the Federal Constitution, state courts need not follow the federal courts\u2019 parcel-by-parcel approach to interpreting their own versions of the statement-against-interest exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See, e.g., People v. Newton, </em>966 P.2d 563, 577 (Colo. 1998) (rejecting <em>Williamson </em>in favor of state-law precedents); <em>State v. Hills, </em>264 Kan. 437, 957 P.2d 496, 503 (1998) (same); <em>State v. Sonthikoummane, </em>145 N.H. 316, 769 A.2d 330, 334 (2000) (same); <em>Chandler v. Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 270, 455 S.E.2d 219, 225 (1995) (same); <em>State v. Julian, </em>129 Ohio App.3d 828, 719 N.E.2d 96, 100 (1998) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Nor does <em>Vincent v. Seabold, </em>226 F.3d 681, 689 (6th Cir.2000) advance Bailey\u2019s position. In <em>Vincent, </em>it is true, the Court determined that the admission of a statement under Kentucky\u2019s statement-against-interest rule violated the Confrontation Clause, and was \u201ccontrary to\u201d Supreme Court precedent fWilliamson), prompting the Court to grant habeas relief under \u00a7 2254(d)(1). But <em>Williamson </em>was invoked not by way of imposing the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of Federal Rule 804(b)(3) on the Kentucky court, but rather as guidance in answering the constitutional question of whether the statement admitted bore sufficient \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d to be admitted <em>without cross-examination </em>under <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 65-66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980). <em>See Vincent, </em>226 F.3d at 688 (determining that second prong of <em>Roberts </em>test [sufficient indicia of reliability] must be satisfied, because statement did not fall within firmly rooted exception to hearsay rule). The <em>Roberts </em>standard does not apply where, as in this case, the confessing defendant may be cross-examined about his statement. <em>See Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 66 (requiring adequate \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d where hearsay declarant is <em>not </em>present for cross-examination at trial); <em>Cruz v. New York, </em>481 U.S. 186, 190, 107 S.Ct. 1714, 95 L.Ed.2d 162 (stating that the pretrial confession of one co-defendant \u201cis not admissible against the others <em>unless </em>the confessing defendant waives his Fifth Amendment rights so as to permit cross-examination\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">For like reasons, the argument that Brown\u2019s confession did not have particularized indicia of reliability, <em>see Lee, supra, </em>and did not fall within a \u201cfirmly rooted hearsay exception,\u201d <em>see Lilly, supra, </em>is unavailing. As suggested above, where the defendant has the opportunity to cross-examine the hearsay declarant, the truth-producing nature of eross-examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>tion itself satisfies all reliability concerns and precludes the need to invoke a firmly rooted hearsay exception. <em>See Green, </em>399 U.S. at 158-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Bailey, lastly, argues that respondent waived the argument that he had an opportunity to cross-examine Brown by raising it for the first time in objecting to the Magistrate\u2019s Report and Recommendation. Yet this argument does not square with the substance of the magistrate\u2019s decision. In reality, the magistrate fully addressed the question of whether Bailey was given an opportunity to cross-examine Brown. It was wholly appropriate for the State to argue in its objections to the magistrate\u2019s report that Bailey was in fact afforded an opportunity of cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
