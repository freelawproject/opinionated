Because we lack jurisdiction to hear their claim, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), special transitional rules governing judicial review of BIA decisions apply to cases brought before the effective date or IIRIRA, April 1, 1997. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c). Because the INS brought deportation proceedings on December 23, 1996 and a final order was issued by the BIA on August 8, 2002, these transitional rules apply. <em>Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 778 (9th Cir.2001). Under the transitional rules, we lack jurisdiction to hear appeals of discretionary determinations under former INA \u00a7 244. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(E). Whether petitioners meet the statutory definition of extreme hardship is an inherently discretionary determination. <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1152 (9th Cir.1997). We thus lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination that petitioners did not show that theirs was a case of extreme hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Petitioners also argue that the Attorney General should have exercised his discretion to terminate this case under IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(3). Because petitioners did not raise this argument before the IJ or the BIA, we also lack jurisdiction to hear this claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(c) (1994) (Repealed. Pub. L. 104-208, Div. C, Title III, \u00a7 306(b), Sept. 30, 1996, 110 Stat. 3009-612); <em>see also Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1183 &amp; n. 6 (applying \u00a7 1105a(c) in a case following the transitional rules of judicial review).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b278-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
