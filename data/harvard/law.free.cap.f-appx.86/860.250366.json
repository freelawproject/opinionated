Taulbee prospered as a residential builder. However, he began to confront financial difficulties by early 1998. Nevertheless, the defendant persisted thereafter in his well-established extravagant spending patterns which had fueled the \u201cjet-set\u201d lifestyle to which he had become accustomed, which included frequent purchases of luxury automobiles, jewelry, and lavish vacations for himself and his friends, as well as the regular indulgence of his high-stakes gambling habit. To feed his cash addiction after his legitimate business earnings had evaporated. Taulbee concocted a scam in April 1998 whereby he would fraudulently obtain federally-insured construction loans from financial institutions by tendering falsified real estate purchase contracts to them. Typically, the loans were secured by the subject realty and the home to be constructed thereon; occasionally Taulbee pledged additional property as security for a bank debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-13\">Taulbee\u2019s initial false contract reflected that certain bona fide property buyers, the Cobanes, had made only a small down payment for the erection of a residence, and therefore the defendant required a substantial bank loan for the balance of the construction costs; whereas in fact the buyers had paid the full purchase price in cash. Thereafter, Taulbee created additional fake contracts between himself as seller, an accomplice (usually Daniel Lunsford) as buyer, and another accomplice (Cary True) as real estate broker, of houses purportedly under construction at addresses which in fact were vacant parcels where Taulbee was not building anything. In reliance upon those deceptive documents, various banks advanced more than $1.8 million in supposed construction funds to the defendant. After the confidence scheme was discovered, the victimized lending institutions collectively recovered most of their monies through foreclosures of their various security interests in Taulbee\u2019s realty; however, an aggregate sum of $717,791.66 in loan advances remained unrecovered by the institutional lenders after the exhaustion of Taulbee\u2019s encumbered assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-14\">On December 7, 2000, a federal grand jury indicted Taulbee, Lunsford, and True on one count of defrauding an agency of the United States, namely the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), contrary to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371; eight counts of federal bank fraud and conspiracy in viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>tion of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1014 and <em>2; </em>and two counts of attempted bribery of a bank officer in offense to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In April 2001, following a four-day jury trial. Taulbee was convicted of the government fraud count, plus all eight bank fraud and conspiracy charges, but was acquitted of both bribery counts. On August 20, 2001, the sentencing court imposed a cumulative imprisonment term of 78 months, to be followed by three years of supervised release, plus restitution totaling $717,791.66 and a special assessment of $900.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">On review, Taulbee has initially argued that the trial judge betrayed bias against him during a sidebar conference conducted during the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief while the jury was in recess outside of the courtroom. During that discourse, which concerned the erstwhile testimony of co-defendant Cary True, the presiding judge, among other things, remarked to counsel that \u201cthey [the defendants] were smart\u201d in reference to the conspirators <em>modus operandi, </em>and further inquired about whether any evidence would indicate that True had shared in Taulbee\u2019s ill-gotten lucre. Taulbee has postulated that those judicial articulations revealed that the trial judge had pre-judged his guilt prior to the close of the evidence, which purportedly denied him due process of law and the legal presumption of innocence prior to the submission of all material evidence; and that he had been actually prejudiced by that asserted pre-judgment in that the trial court ultimately denied his Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 motions for judgment of acquittal initiated both following the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief and after the close of all proofs, presumably by reason of the court\u2019s charged prejudgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">The defendant has conceded that his trial lawyer failed to move contemporaneously for a mistrial or to otherwise object to the faulted bench commentary: therefore his procedurally defaulted challenge is examined for \u201cplain error.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b). \u201cPlain error is defined as an egregious error, one that directly leads to a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Krimsky, </em>230 F.3d 855, 858 (6th Cir.2000). \u201cUnder that test, before an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial, there must be (1) \u2018error,\u2019 (2) that is \u2018plain,\u2019 and (3) that \u2018affects substantial rights.\u2019 If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631-32, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002). (Citations and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">A careful examination of the district judge\u2019s implicated comments, in the full context of the sidebar conference as well as the overall trial, discloses that the lower court had committed no prejudicial error. The subject judicial inquiries to the attorneys were designed to clarify the prosecution\u2019s theory of the case. The trial judge has a duty to \u201cconduct the trial in an orderly fashion, to ensure that the issues are not obscured and to act at all times with a view toward eliciting the truth.\u201d <em>United States v. Tilton, </em>714 F.2d 642, 643 (6th Cir.1983) (per curiam). The district court had accorded counsel for both the government and the defense equal opportunities to contribute to the sidebar conference and to respond to queries and remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>Moreover, nothing expressed by the presiding judge displayed any extra-judicial personal bias against Taulbee, as opposed to impressions founded upon information collected within the confines of the litigation. <em>See Reed v. Rhodes, </em>179 F.3d 453, 468 (6th Cir.1999). \u201c[OJpinions formed by the judge on the basis of facts introduced or events occurring in the course of the current proceedings, or of prior proceedings, do not constitute a basis for a bias or partiality motion unless they display a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible.\u201d <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994). On the overall instant record, no reasonable, objective observer could conclude that the trial judge had displayed any detrimental partiality against Taulbee. <em>United States v. Hough, </em>276 F.3d 884, 899 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1089, 122 S.Ct. 1986, 152 L.Ed.2d 1042 <em>&amp; </em>537 U.S. 898, 123 S.Ct. 199, 154 L.Ed.2d 169 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">To the contrary, the district judge\u2019s crediting of the prosecution\u2019s evidence against Taulbee prior to the admission of any defense evidence <em>for purposes of the sidebar conference </em>was not prejudicial error, because at that stage of the litigation, the salient issue before the court was whether the United States had presented sufficient evidence which, if believed by the jury, could sustain a guilty verdict against the defendant. Hence, the trial court\u2019s denials of Taulbee\u2019s Rule 29 motions, anchored in the presumptive accrediting of the government\u2019s evidence irrespective of any defense proof, was not prejudicial error, but instead conformed to well-established legal standards. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Villarce, </em>323 F.3d 435, 438 (6th Cir.2003) (\u201cWhere a motion for a judgment of acquittal has been denied, our task is to determine whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, and after giving the government the benefit of all inferences that could reasonably be drawn from the testimony, any rational trier of fact could find the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d). (Citations, internal quotation marks, and italics omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Indeed, the defendant\u2019s failure to argue on appeal that the record evidence was legally insufficient to sustain his convictions comprises, in essence, a concession that the trial court\u2019s denials of his motions for judgment of acquittal were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">At bottom, Taulbee\u2019s guilt on nine of eleven counts of the indictment was unanimously found beyond a reasonable doubt by twelve neutral and impartial jurors who had not been exposed to the assailed judicial comments. \u201cMuch of the concern about an otherwise inappropriate judicial act or remark is neutralized by the absence of the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Morrow, </em>977 F.2d 222, 225 (6th Cir.1992) (en banc). Accordingly, a judge\u2019s improper remark which might otherwise constitute prejudicial misconduct supporting a mistrial is rendered harmless if made during a sidebar conference outside of the jury\u2019s presence. <em>United States v. Glover, </em>21 F.3d 133, 136 (6th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Seago, </em>930 F.2d 482, 491 (6th Cir.1991). <em>Cf. Sandstrom v. Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 61 L.Ed.2d 39 (1979) (explaining that the presumption of innocence requires the <em>trier of fact </em>to avoid prejudgments adverse to the defendant): <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967) (propounding that a criminal defendant has a due process right to an unbiased fact-finder).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">Therefore, no reversible error inhered in the trial adjudicator\u2019s sidebar statements in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">Next, Taulbee has contended, also for the first time, that the trial court had prejudiced him by allowing evidence of his extravagant lifestyle and lavish spending habits to go to the jury. Although proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>ly preserved evidentiary rulings are ordinarily scrutinized for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Mack, </em>258 F.3d 548, 553 (6th Cir.2001), Taulbee\u2019s forfeiture below of his evidentiary objection at issue subjects it to \u201cplain error\u201d review. <em>Bowman v. Corrections Corporation of America, </em>350 F.3d 537, 548 (6th Cir.2003). By either measure, the district court did not err by admitting that proof, because it was directly probative of Taulbee\u2019s criminal motive and objective which had animated his charged conspiratorial scheme to dupe federally-insured financial institutions out of large amounts of cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">The defendant has maintained that much of the admitted \u201clifestyle\u201d evidence concerned events which pre-dated his initial fraudulent bank transaction, and thus was averredly irrelevant and potentially inflammatory, because (the defendant argues) the fiscal resources for those costly purchases presumably had been generated by legitimate means. However, the government did <em>not </em>proffer evidence of those pre-fraud extravagances as proof that Taulbee was spending large amounts of unaccounted-for and hence facially illegitimate cash. Rather, that evidence was offered to prove Taulbee\u2019s pre-existing and well-established <em>pattern of excessive expenditures </em>to buttress the inference that, <em>after </em>his business collapsed in the late 1990s, he was driven to pursue alternate, and unfortunately illegal, means of securing a continued steady inflow of disposable cash. Accordingly, both Taulbee\u2019s prefraud and post-fraud spending practices were directly relevant to the prosecution\u2019s case, and that relevance was not outweighed by any risk of undue prejudice. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">At any rate, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the evidence in controversy would have been excludable if a proper objection had been mounted, the admission of that evidence did not offend case-controlling \u201cplain error\u201d strictures, because no substantial right of the defendant was adversely impacted by that evidence to any material degree. The overall record proof of Taulbee\u2019s guilt of his crimes of conviction was conclusive. Hence, no material possibility exists that the jurors\u2019 verdict would have been more favorable to the defendant if the faulted evidence had been excluded. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a); <em>Ford v. Curtis, </em>277 F.3d 806, 808 (6th Cir.). <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 846, 123 S.Ct. 185, 154 L.Ed.2d 73 (2002); <em>United States v. Fountain, </em>2 F.3d 656, 668 (6th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">Finally, although he was represented by appellate counsel, Taulbee has advanced <em>pro se </em>a novel contention on review, to wit, that the presiding judge had prejudiced him by erroneously instructing the jury on a legal element of federal bank fraud by reproducing an averred misstatement of the law recited in the indictment. The defendant has contended that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014, the statute governing \u201cloan and credit application fraud,\u201d requires proof of <em>\u201cany </em>false statement or report\u201d which was knowingly given by the defendant \u201cfor the purpose of influencing in any way [a lending institution] upon any application, advance, discount, purchase, purchase agreement, repurchase agreement, commitment, or loan;\u201d whereas the instant indictment had charged, and the subject court-issued jury charges had instructed that the jurors must find, that the defendant had given a <em>\u201cmaterially </em>false statement\u201d under the statutory conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">Ordinarily, the legal correctness of a jury charge is subject to plenary review. <em>United States v. Newcomb, </em>6 F.3d 1129, 1132 (6th Cir.1993). However, because the defendant failed to preserve his challenge to the jury instructions in the trial court, they are assessed on review for plain error. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>108 F.3d 668, 670 (6th Cir.1997) (en banc). No revers<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>ible error exists in jury instructions unless \u201cviewed as a whole [they] were confusing, misleading or prejudicial.\u201d <em>Innes v. Howell Corp., </em>76 F.3d 702, 714 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Taulbee\u2019s <em>pro se </em>assault was entirely misconceived. Although the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Wells, </em>519 U.S. 482, 490, 117 S.Ct. 921, 137 L.Ed.2d 107 (1997), rejected <em>the defendants\u2019 </em>argument that \u201cmateriality\u201d <em>should </em>be incorporated as an implicit term of \u00a7 1014,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Court did <em>not </em>resolve that it would be legal error for a \u00a7 1014 indictment to charge the defendant with having made a \u201cmaterially\u201d false statement, and/or for jury instructions to charge the fact-finders that they must find a \u201cmaterially\u201d false statement as a \u00a7 1014 element predicate to conviction. Stated differently, simply because <em>a defendant is </em>not entitled <em>to </em>a \u00a7 1014 indictment allegation or jury charge which includes a \u201cmateriality\u201d qualifier, it certainly does <em>not </em>follow that he is <em>prejudiced </em>if his \u00a7 1014 indictment and/or jury charge <em>does </em>include the word \u201cmaterial\u201d or the concept of \u201cmateriality.\u201d Indeed, the addition of \u201cmaterial\u201d to the subject indictment and jury charge <em>benefitted </em>Taulbee by narrowing the scope of possible proofs, from <em>any </em>\u201cfalse statement\u201d to only those which were <em>\u201cmaterially </em>false.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, any identified \u201cerror\u201d in the indictment and/or jury instructions was beneficial, rather than prejudicial, to the defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">This reviewing court has carefully examined the trial record, the briefs and all arguments of counsel and the defendant, and the controlling law. It has identified no reversible error. Accordingly, the instant judgment of conviction and sentence against defendant Gary Steven Taulbee is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b892-5\">. Taulbee had been charged with offering Steven Smith, an officer of the First Lancaster Federal Savings Bank, cash sums totaling $1,800.00 and $5,000.00, respectively, as inducements for the approval of two requested fraudulent construction loans.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b895-6\">. <em>See also United States v. Nash, </em>175 F.3d 429, 434 (6th Cir.1999) (observing that the absence of the word \u2018'material\u201d from \u00a7 1041 has meaning: therefore a \"material\" misrepresentation is not required).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b895-7\">. Taulbee's allegation that the \"materiality\u201d qualifier in the indictment either caused him to be charged with, and convicted of, a nonexistent statutory offense, or to be convicted of an offense which had not been properly pleaded in the indictment, was also ill-formulated. As developed herein, the grand jury's indictment had properly alleged that Taulbee had made \"false statements\u201d to financial lenders under the requisite statutory conditions, and the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that Taulbee had acted as charged. The fact that the indictment and jury instructions had qualified the \"false statement\u201d element with a \"materiality\u201d aspect did not detract from the ultimate reality that requisite \"false statements\u201d were charged in the indictment and found by the jurors. The addition of factual allegations in an indictment charge or jury instruction which are more specific than the minimally required bare legal elements does not invalidate the indictment charge or juiy instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b895-13\">. On October 10, 2003, Taulbee tendered a <em>pro se </em>application for leave to file a second <em>pro se </em>brief, by which he sought to argue that his trial lawyer had rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to frame the \"materiality\u201d objections to the indictment and jury charges discussed above. On November 10, 2003, this court denied that motion; thus the defendant\u2019s \"ineffective assistance\u201d argument is not presently before this court. In all events, because, as evolved herein, the \"materiality\u201d contention was ill-conceived as a matter of law, defense counsel's failure to advance it could not have constituted ineffective assistance. <em>See, e.g., Kimmelman v. Morrison, </em>477 U.S. 365, 375, 106 S.Ct. 2574, 91 L.Ed.2d 305 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
