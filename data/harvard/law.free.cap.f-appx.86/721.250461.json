Moody appeals the district court\u2019s order transferring the case to the Northern District of Texas and denying his motion for leave to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-25\">This court examines the basis of its jurisdiction on its own motion if necessary. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number><em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). A transfer order is not a final order that may be appealed. <em>See Stelly v. Employers National Ins. Co., </em>431 F.2d 1251, 1253 (5th Cir.1970). Additionally, the denial of Moody\u2019s motion for leave to amend also is not a final, appealable order. <em>See Smith v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>569 F.2d 325, 326 (5th Cir.1978); <em>McClune v. Shamah, </em>593 F.2d 482, 486 (3rd Cir.1979). This appeal is therefore DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Moody has also filed a document entitled \u201cmotion supplement re-submitted,\u201d which we construe as a motion for leave to file supplemental brief. This pleading is incomprehensible, and Moody offers no clear explanation of why it was filed or its intended purpose. Moody\u2019s motion is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b751-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
