In 1991, a jury convicted Smith of five counts for his participation in a drug trafficking scheme. Smith\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal. In 1994, Smith\u2019s first 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion was denied. In 2001, this court dismissed Smith\u2019s second 2255 motion as successive.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">On May 23, 2003, Smith filed the instant action, requesting that his sentence be modified based upon Amendment 645 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines. However, Amendment 645 is not listed in <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 1B1.10 (2002), which allows for retroactive reductions of a sentence based upon amendments to the Guidelines. Accordingly, under the plain language of the guideline, the district court properly determined that a sentence reduction was not authorized. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 1B1.10, p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Additionally, Smith\u2019s claim that the district court had the discretion to give retroactive effect to Amendment 645 as a clarifying amendment is also without merit. In this Circuit, clarifying amendments apply retroactively when the amendment takes place before sentencing, or while direct appeal is pending. <em>See United States v. Capers, </em>61 F.3d 1100, 1109 (4th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Drath, </em>89 F.3d 216, 217 (5th Cir.1996). Because neither of these conditions exist in this case, the district court correctly determined that it lacked the authority to grant Smith a sentence reduction. <em>Capers, </em>61 F.3d at 1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
