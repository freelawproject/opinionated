(\u201cAIG\u201d). Krop sustained a partial disability on January 1, 2000, and filed a claim for disability benefits under the policy. After AIG denied Krop\u2019s claim, Krop sued AIG for breach of the policy and wrongful denial of benefits under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132, asserting that the policy was an \u201cemployee welfare benefit plan\u201d under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(1) and that he was a \u201cparticipant\u201d in that plan under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-21\">As is pertinent here, the policy defined an insured to be \u201cdisabled\u201d if, while unable to perform all the material duties of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>regular occupation or another occupation, the insured was performing at least one of such duties and was earning less than 80% of his pre-disability earnings. Krop qualified under this provision because, after his partial disability, he was able to perform some, but not all, of the material duties of his occupation, and his income was below the 80% threshold. In June 2001, however, Krop\u2019s income exceeded the 80% threshold. After the completion of discovery, Krop and AIG reached a partial settlement covering the period before June 2001, leaving unresolved the single stipulated issue of Krop\u2019s entitlement to benefits after June 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c), the parties consented to trial before a magistrate judge (\u201cthe district court\u201d), who asserted jurisdiction over the case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(e). The parties\u2019 dispute centered on the meaning of \u201ccease\u201d as used in the provisions of the policy listed under the heading \u201cTERMINATION OF BENEFITS.\u201d Those provisions stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">Disability benefits will cease on the earliest of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">1. the date the insured is no longer disabled;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">2. the date the insured dies;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">3. the end of the maximum benefit period; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-9\">4. <em>the date the insured\u2019s current earnings exceed 80% of his indexed predisability earnings.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">J.A. 28 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">Krop contended that in the context of this policy, \u201ccease\u201d was ambiguous and, construing the policy against its drafter, AIG, should be read to mean \u201ctemporarily suspend.\u201d According to Krop, that construction entitled him to receive benefits for any month, including those after June 2001, in which his income again fell below 80% of his pre-disability income. In contrast, AIG asserted that, as used in the policy, \u201ccease\u201d could only mean \u201cto permanently terminate,\u201d and thus contended that Krop\u2019s entitlement to benefits ended permanently after Krop\u2019s income exceeded the 80% threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">The district court observed that the policy was a plan governed by ERISA in which the administrator (AIG) lacked interpretive discretion. Accordingly, the district court reviewed the denial of benefits <em>de novo, </em>applying ordinary rules of contract interpretation and noting the requirement that ambiguous terms be construed in accordance with the reasonable expectations of the insured, and against the drafter. <em>See Tester v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>228 F.3d 372, 375 (4th Cir.2000). In a thorough opinion, the district court concluded that, as used in the policy, \u201ccease\u201d was unambiguous, and accorded the term its plain and ordinary meaning of \u201cto end permanently.\u201d Consequently, the court directed the entry of judgment in AIG\u2019s favor. <em>Krop v. AIG Life Ins. Co., </em>No. CA-01-418-2 (E.D.Va. Mar. 6, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-14\">The district court provided several reasons for its decision. Despite the conflicting definitions of \u201ccease\u201d offered by the parties, the district court concluded that the context in which \u201ccease\u201d was used in the <em>policy </em>\u2014 i.e., as part of the \u201cTermination of Benefits\u201d section- \u2014 \u201cstrengthened] AIG\u2019s contention that the term [wa]s unambiguous and indicate[d] a permanent cessation of benefits,\u201d in light of the plain and ordinary meaning of \u201cterminate.\u201d The district court also examined the three other conditions that would result in the termination of benefits under the policy, and concluded that \u201c[t]he finality and nonrecurring nature of such events len[t] context to [the meaning of \u2018cease\u2019] and supported] the conclusion\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>\u201ccease\u201d should similarly be read to indicate a permanent ending. Additionally, the court cited to several decisions holding \u201ccease\u201d to be unambiguous when employed in similar contexts, some of which had specifically rejected the argument that the term should be read as \u201cto suspend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Finally, the district court pointed to the \u201cRecurrent Disability\u201d provisions of the policy, which provided that a subsequent disability of an insured would be treated as the continuation of a prior, related disability for which the insured received benefits under the policy if the insured returned to his regular occupation on a full-time basis for less than six months and performed all the material duties of his occupation. The district court concluded that interpreting \u201ccease\u201d to mean that benefits are merely suspended would render this section of the policy superfluous. For these reasons, the district court held that Krop\u2019s benefits ended permanently after June 2001, the month in which his income exceeded 80% of his pre-disability earnings, and thus that he was not entitled to disability benefits for any month thereafter in which his income failed to exceed that threshold. J.A. 130-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Upon review of the parties\u2019 briefs and consideration of their oral arguments, we find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court on the reasoning of that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
