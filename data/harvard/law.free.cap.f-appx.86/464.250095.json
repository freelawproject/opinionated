The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants, and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the behavior of which Manessis complains was significant enough to constitute an adverse employment action, there is no evidence that the alleged mistreatment was based on the plaintiffs ethnicity or national origin. And, assuming Manessis could show that these incidents stemmed from his hearing and learning impairments, he has made no showing that these impairments amounted to a \u201cdisability\u201d that gives him protection under the ADA. <em>See Reeves v. Johnson Controls World Servs., Inc., </em>140 F.3d 144, 154 (2d Cir.1998). Nor has the plaintiff alleged facts sufficient to support his hostile work environment or retaliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">Having considered all of the appellant\u2019s arguments and found them to be meritless, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b495-23\">. The plaintiffs motion to attach additional exhibits to his reply brief is hereby GRANTED.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
