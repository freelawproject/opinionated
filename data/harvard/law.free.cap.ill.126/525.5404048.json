Fraudulent conveyance\u2014character of claims within the statute. The fourth section of the Statute of Frauds, which makes void any gifts, grants, etc., made with intent to hinder, delay or defraud any \"\u201ccreditor or other person,\u201d applies to transfers of a husband made to delay, hinder and defraud his wife in the assertion of her right to a separate maintenance.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b525-14\" pgmap=\"525\">2. In anticipation of legal steps being taken by his wife for a separate maintenance, the husband made an assignment of certain securities to his son, amounting to about $100,000, upon the expressed consideration of $10,000, and the agreement of the son to pay him, for and during his natural life, the sum of $5000 per annum, to be paid semi-annually from the date of the writing, the father to be the sole judge of his necessities, and the son being required to make such payments when demanded: Held, that the assignment, upon its face, was plainly fraudulent, in that it attempted to secure the use of the property to the father to the exclusion of all others having claims upon him.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b525-15\" pgmap=\"525\">3. Same\u2014right of grantor to a reconveyance. In addition to the assignment of the greater part of the securities owned by the husband, for the purpose of delaying, hindering and defrauding his \"wife in respect of the anticipated suit for separate maintenance, he also caused his lands to be conveyed to the son for the same purpose. The son gave the grantor his written agreement to give him back the securities and lands when demanded. The wife obtained a decree for separate maintenance, when the grantor executed to his son \"another agreement, antedated, whereby he released the son from the payment of the $5000 per annum, on condition the son should furnish him with bed and board in his family during life, and kind treatment. Afterward the grantor filed his bill against .the son, for the reconveyance of the property: Held, that the conveyance was fraudulent, and that the grantor could not maintain the bill.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b525-16\" pgmap=\"525\">4. Same\u2014who may avail of the fraudulent character of a convey once\u2014 us to the grantee, or a trustee. It is competent to go behind the language of a writing, and show that the real purpose of its execution is to delay and defraud creditors, in violation of the Statute of Frauds,\u2014 and this in behalf of the party ostensibly bound by the instrument, and to defeat a suit for its enforcement.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b526-4\" pgmap=\"526\">5. ' Although a transfer of property by a father to his son contains nothing on its face to show an intention to defraud others, it is competent for the grantee, on bill by the grantor for a reconveyance, to show that the transfer and conveyance were in fact made to prevent the grantor\u2019s wife from obtaining separate maintenance and support from his property, and that the papers declaring the trust were executed secretly, and knowledge thereof withheld from the public, to enable the grantor to re-assert his ownership of the property after having accomplished the purpose of the transfer.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b526-5\" pgmap=\"526\">6. A trustee, however, into whose hands money is paid on account of a third person, can not set up the illegality of the trust under which the money was so paid, though the cestui que trust could not have enforced his right against the payer directly, as in that case he could only have obtained the money through the illegal agreement.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b526-6\" pgmap=\"526\">7. Sake\u2014secret trust\u2014how created. The question of the secrecy or publicity of the trust in the transfer of property with intent to defraud creditors, is not affected by the circumstance whether it was created by an oral declaration, only, or by a writing. That affects simply the question of proof. A trust created by a merely verbal expression of it, may yet be public, and a trust, though expressed in writing, may be secret, if the fraudulent grantee, without the knowledge of any one other than the fraudulent grantor, executes a writing declaring the trust, and gives it to the latter, who keeps it secretly in his own possession.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b526-7\" pgmap=\"526\">8. Sake\u2014subsequent agreement to create a trust\u2014of its validity. In the case of a fraudulent conveyance or assignment, it is competent for the parties thereto to subsequently make a new and independent agreement for a sufficient valuable consideration, whereby the grantee or assignee shall be obligated to hold the property in trust for the grantor or assignor; but such agreement must be open and notorious, and made in good faith to establish a trust in the property, otherwise it will be but attempting to create anew a secret trust already condemned by the statute. \u00bb</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b526-8\" pgmap=\"526\">9. Contract\u2014consideration\u2014resulting from, an illegal agreement. Where an act, though the result of an unlawful contract, is itself lawful, it may form the consideration for a lawful agreement, as, for instance, the actual transfer of stock, the agreement to do which was illegal.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b526-9\" pgmap=\"526\">10. PRrvniEeED communications\u2014to an attorney. The statements of a fraudulent grantor, made to the attorney of the grantee, in respect to the purpose of the former in making the conveyances and assignments of his property, are not privileged, as against such grantor, but may be proved by the grantee in a suit by the grantor against the grantee for a reconveyance.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b526-10\" pgmap=\"526(23) 527(46)\">11. Practice in the Supreme Court\u2014as to parties not appealing. Where only one of several parties appeals from the decree of the trial court to the Appellate Court, where the case is heard, and afterwards brought to this corn*, it was TteM, that this court could not pass upon the rights of the parties not appealing, and could only consider the case as it was before the Appellate Court.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-5\" pgmap=\"527\">Appeal from the Appellate Court for the First District;\u2014\u2022 heard in that court on appeal from the Superior Court of Cook county; the Hon.

He then resided in Broome county, New York, and owned real estate in that county, and notes, bonds and mortgages, of the value of $100,000, or more. John B. Tyler was the son of William A. T3'ler, by his first wife, and at that time resided at Conneaut, Ohio. This second marriage was infelicitous, and a separation followed within a few months. William A. Tyler then gave notice, by publication, that he would pay no debts thereafter contracted by his wife, and she, some time thereafter, commenced proceedings in the proper court, in Broome county, New York, for a decree for separate maintenance. Before the commencement of these proceedings, and in anticipation thereof, on or about the 27th of August, 1885, \u25a0 William A. Tyler went to Conneaut, Ohio, and then assigned and delivered to his said son, John B. Tyler, the principal part of his notes, bonds, mortgages, etc. This assignment was evidenced by writing, signed by both parties, containing a detailed description of the notes, bonds, mortgages, etc., assigned, and it concluded as follows: \u201cAnd it is further agreed upon the part of said John B. Tyler, that he will pay to the said William A. Tyler, for and during the term of the natural life of him, the said William A. Tyler, the sum of five thousand (5000) dollars per annum, to be paid semi-annually, in sums of two thousand and five hundred- (2500), from and after this date. Said payment, however, is to be made by the said John B. Tyler only upon the consideration that the sum is necessary for the support of him, the said William A. Tyler; and said William A. Tyler shall have full right to demand said sum, or any part thereof, and he shall be the judge of his necessities in this respect, and he, said John B., when the same is demanded, shall not refuse to pay upon the ground that such sum is not necessary for support.\u201d The consideration expressed, in addition to this undertaking of John B., is $10,000.</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-5\" pgmap=\"528\">In the afternoon of the same day, the following additional writing was executed and delivered by John B., at the request of William A.:</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-6\" pgmap=\"528\">\u201cConneaut, 0., Aug. 27, 1885.</summary><summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-7\" pgmap=\"528\">\u201cI, John B.

Patten, 18 Me. 229.</p> <opinion data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b536-5\" pgmap=\"536\">Mr. Justice Scholfield</author> <p id=\"Afp\" pgmap=\"536\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b536-6\" pgmap=\"536\">The Appellate Court, in its opinion filed on reversing the decree of the Superior Court, concurred in the conclusion reached by the Superior Court, that the conveyances and assignments in controversy were conceived and executed by the present appellee, of his own motion, for the purpose of preventing his wife from obtaining maintenance and support from his property. We have carefully examined the evidence preserved in the record, and we have no doubt of the correctness \u25a0 of that conclusion. In our opinion, the allegations of the bill ' are unsupported by the evidence, and it might be sufficient to dismiss the bill for that reason, without considering any other. See White v. Morrison, 11 Ill. 361; McKay v. Bissett, 5 Gilm. 499; Jackson v. Miner, 101 Ill. 550; Baldwin v. Campfield, 4 Halst. Ch. 891. We shall, however, not rest our decision ' on that ground alone.</p> <p id=\"b536-7\" pgmap=\"536(87) 537(92)\">The fourth section of our statute of \u201cFrauds and Perjuries\u201d makes void every gift, grant, conveyance, assignment or trans- \u2022 fer of or charge upon any estate, real or personal, * * * made with the intent to disturb, delay, hinder or defraud creditors or other persons,\u201d etc. (Rev. Stat. 1874, chap. 59.) If ' the wife be not, technically, a \u201ccreditor,\u201d she surely comes within the language \u201cother persons,\u201d and she is, obviously, as much injured by such a conveyance as any creditor can be. The same or equivalent language has been held to apply to the \"wife, in the following eases: Bails v. Bails, 1 Cold. (Tenn.) 287; Reynolds v. Vance, 1 Heisk. (Tenn.) 344; Killinger v. Reidenbauer, 6 S. &amp; R. 531; Boslaugh v. Boslaugh, 68 Pa. St. 499; Brewer v. Connell, 11 Humph. 500; Jenny v. Jenny, 24 Vt. 324; Gilmore v. Hutchinson, 120 Mass. 271; Jiggits v. Jiggits, 40 Miss. 714; Green v. Adams, 59 Vt. 602; Johnson v. Johnson, 12 Ky. Court of App. 485. See, also, Bump on Fraudulent Conveyances, 515.</p> <p id=\"b537-5\" pgmap=\"537\">El Draper v. Draper, 68 Ill. 17, we held that a conveyance, after bill filed for divorce and alimony, with intent to deprive the wife of alimony, was fraudulent, and should he set aside; and this, by necessary inference, recognizes that the wife is within the contemplation of the statute.</p> <p id=\"b537-6\" pgmap=\"537\">The instrument executed on the morning of the 27th day of August, 1885, is, upon its face, plainly fraudulent, in that it attempts to secure the use of the property to appellee to the exclusion of all others,\u2014whether creditors or others having claims upon him. Power v. Alston, 93 Ill. 587; Annis v. Bonar, 86 id. 128; Truitt v. Griffin, 61 id. 26; Mitchell v. Sawyer et al. 115 id. 650; Moore v. Wood, 93 id. 451. And the same is, in effect, the character of the instrument hearing date September 30, 1885.</p> <p id=\"b537-7\" pgmap=\"537(115) 538(226)\">But assuming that the several assignments and conveyances contain nothing, upon their faces, to condemn them, and that in the papers subsequently executed there is a trust declared in behalf of appeEee, which, upon its face, discloses nothing to render it illegal, the question arises, is it competent for the defendant to show that the several assignments and conveyances were, in fact, made to prevent the wife of appellee from obtaining maintenance and support from his property, and that the papers declaring the trust were executed secretly, and knowledge thereof withheld from the public, to enable appellee to re-assert his ownership of the property after having accomplished the purpose of the assignments and conveyances. It seems to be thought by counsel for appellee that Fast et al. v. McPherson, 98 Ill. 496, requires an answer in the negative. It is clear that such a view results from a misapprehension of the point actually in controversy in that ease. It was there charged that Dexter had held the property in secret trust, in fraud of the creditors of Mrs. McPherson. But he had executed his trust by conveying the property,'by the direction of .the agent of Mrs. McPherson, to Fast, and Fast made a formal public declaration, in writing, that he held in trust. The principle applied is well sustained by authority. \u201cThus, where an act, though the result of an unlawful contract, is itself lawful, it may form the consideration for a lawful agreement, as, for instance, the actual transfer of stock, the agreement to do which was illegal. Similarly, a trustee into whose hands money is paid on account of a third person, can not set up the illegality of the trust under which the money was so paid, though the cestui que trust could not have enforced his right against the payer directly, as in that case he could only have got the money through the illegal agreement.\u201d Fry on Specific Performance, (2d Am. ed.) p. 215, see. 313. See, also, ibid, ante, sec. 312.</p> <p id=\"b538-5\" pgmap=\"538\">This court, in Miller v. Marckle, 21 Ill. 152, committed itself to the doctrine that it is competent to go behind the language of a writing, and show that the real purpose of, its execution is to hinder, delay and defraud creditors, in violation of the Statute of Frauds and Perjuries,\u2014and this in behalf of the party ostensibly bound by the instrument, and to defeat a suit for its enforcement. The doctrine is re-asserted in Ryan v. Ryan et al. 97 Ill. 38, and indirectly recognized in Dunaway v. Robertson et al. 95 Ill. 419.</p> <p id=\"b538-6\" pgmap=\"538(56) 539(30)\">In Nellis v. Clark, 20 Wend. 24, and in Smith v. Hubbs, 1 Fairf. (Me.) 71, cited with approval and relied upon in Miller v. Marckle and Dunaway v. Robertson et al., the point was raised, and insisted on in argument, that the defense that the instrument was executed in violation of the Statute of Frauds and Perjuries, can only be allowed where the facts showing it must necessarily make a part of the plaintiff\u2019s or complainant\u2019s proof; but it was disallowed, and expressly ruled otherwise.</p> <p id=\"b539-5\" pgmap=\"539\">We concede that the ruling in some States is different from that in this court in the cases to which we have referred; but our cases are not without authority or reason, and the question must be regarded to be settled, here, as they declare. In addition to the cases cited in Miller v. Marckle, the following may be referred to as sustaining like views: Walton v. Tursten, 49 Miss. 569; Chapin v. Rease, 10 Conn. 69; Murphy v. Hubert, 16 Pa. St. 50; Schenck v. Hart, 32 N. J. Eq. 774; Goudy v. Gebhart, 1 Ohio St. 262; McQuade v. Rosencranz, 36 id. 442; Inhabitants of Canton v. Inhabitants of Dorchester, 8 Cush. 525.</p> <p id=\"b539-6\" pgmap=\"539(246) 540(115)\">It is argued that the fact that a declaration of trust is in writing, prevents its being secret. If, as we have before herein intimated, the purpose of this trust, as disclosed by the instruments relied upon as proving it, is, upon its face, to reserve the use of the property to appellee while placing it beyond the reach of others having a legal right, apart from such transfer, to resort to it, this is not important. But we do not think the question of the secrecy or the publicity of the trust is affected by the circumstance of whether it was created by word of mouth, only, or by writing. That affects simply the question of proof. If the trust affect lands, it must be in writing. (Bev. Stat. 1874, chap. 59, sec. 9.) But, manifestly, a trust may be public, and yet be created by word of mouth, only. Coke says, in Twyne\u2019s case: \u201cAnd therefore, reader, when any gift shall be to you in satisfaction of a debt, by one who is indebted to others also: 1. Let it be made in a public manner, and before the neighbors, and not in private, \u201d etc. Had he understood that a writing would be conclusive of this question, he would undoubtedly have added, after the words \u201cin private,\u201d \u201cor let a memorandum thereof be made in writing,\u201d etc. And it is quite as manifest that a trust, though expressed in writing, may be secret, \u2014 as, if the fraudulent grantee or assignee, without the knowledge of, any one other than the fraudulent grantor or assignor, execute a writing declaring the trust, and hand it to the fraudulent grantor or assignor, and he thereafter keep it secretly in his own possession. The writing may be as effectually hid from the world at large, as is the memory of the fact not reduced to writing. The writings here relied upon were not placed upon record. They were retained in the pocket-book of appellee, and they were completely secreted from all but him and appellant,\u2014 and so the trust they declare is a secret trust.</p> <p id=\"b540-5\" pgmap=\"540\">We are not unmindful, in this connection, that it is competent, in the ease of a fraudulent conveyance or assignment, for the parties thereto to subsequently make a new and independent agreement, for a sufficient valuable consideration, whereby the grantee or assignee shall be obligated to hold the property in .trust for the grantor or assignor, as held in Parker v. Tiffany, 52 Ill. 286, and Songer v. Partridge, 107 id. 529. (See, also, Roberts on Fraud. Con. p. 495, sec. 10.) But it is manifest such agreement must be open and notorious, and made in good faith, to establish a trust in the property, for otherwise it would be but attempting to create anew a secret trust, already condemned by the statute.</p> <p id=\"b540-6\" pgmap=\"540(129) 541(49)\">What is here relied upon as a new agreement creating a trust between these parties, is an agreement of which the public knew nothing, which the appellee kept concealed in his pocket-book, and which he was under no obligation to observe unless he chose to do so, and which he himself wholly ignored and disregarded in the instrument he executed in January or February following, and dated September 30, 1885. If the first trust was secret, this one was clearly so. Not only was knowledge of it kept from the public, but it does not appear that any right was attempted to be asserted by virtue of it. In truth, we have the impression, from a careful reading of the evidence, that the execution of these several papers was but an effort to guard against dangers suggested by new fears that appellee\u2019s wife might reach his property, as excited from time to time. Appellee seems to have been a passive instrument all the time, and, when acting at all, acting only and strictly in obedience to appellant.</p> <p id=\"b541-5\" pgmap=\"541\">An objection is urged that the Superior Court erred in permitting Cox, an attorney at law, to testify to what appellee said to him in respect to his purpose in making the assignments, conveyances, etc., to appellant. The objection is not tenable. Ho matter of confidence, as between appellee and Cox, was testified to. Cox was the attorney of appellant, not of appellee; and, at most, the case is not different from Lynn v. Lyerle, 113 Ill. 128, where it was held, that if two parties go together to an attorney, and make statements to him in the presence of each other, they are not confidential communications and therefore privileged.</p> <p id=\"b541-6\" pgmap=\"541\">The contention that the court erred in not requiring the parties to interplead on the petition of Hutchinson &amp; Luff, is not tenable. Hutchinson &amp; Luff,\u2014the parties injured, if any, by that ruling,\u2014are not before us. They neither appealed nor sued out a writ of error. We can only consider the case as it was before the Appellate Court.</p> <p id=\"b541-7\" pgmap=\"541\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed, and the decree of the Superior Court is affirmed. Appellant will recover his posts in the Appellate Court as well as in this court, to be taxed on the certificate of the clerk of the Appellate Court.</p> <p id=\"b541-8\" pgmap=\"541\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
