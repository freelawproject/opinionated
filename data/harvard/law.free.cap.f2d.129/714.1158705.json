It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-23\">\u201c1. A process of the character described consisting in <em>placing a model of the ultimate article to be cast between mold casing sections having registering depressions forming a space surrounding said model, </em>blocking out all of said space with a plastic material, except that portion of the space which is adjacent a portion of the model for which a mold section is to be made, <em>and then pouring a casting material into said portion of said space to form a mold section for. said portion of the model, </em>then while leaving the model and mold section already cast in place, removing an adjacent portion of the blocking out material to expose a different portion of the model and pouring the casting material into the space formed by removing the blocking out material to form a separate mold section for said last portion of the model contiguous to the first mold section.\u201d (Italics ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-24\">The interference is between appellant\u2019s application No. 284,985, filed July 17, 1939, and appellees\u2019 patent No. 2,078,562, issued April 27, 1937, on an application, No. 115,-964, filed December 15, 1936. Appellant\u2019s involved application is a division of an earlier application, No. 139,629, filed April 28, 1937, which matured into patent No. 2,-201,131, May 14, 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-25\">The counts originated in appellees\u2019 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-26\">Appellant is the junior party and, as his application No. 139,629, of which his involved application is a division, was filed subsequent (one day) to the issuance of appellees\u2019 patent, the burden was upon appellant to establish priority of invention beyond a reasonable doubt, not by a preponderance of the evidence as held by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-27\">Appellees submitted no evidence, and are, therefore, restricted to their filing date \u2014 December 15, 1936- \u2014 for conception and constructive reduction to practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-28\">Appellant submitted evidence for the purpose of overcoming appellees\u2019 filing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-29\">The primary issue, as presented here, relates to the italicized portions of the quoted count, which cover the first and third steps of the process defined therein. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>The board held that appellant had failed to establish conception of the invention prior to appellees\u2019 filing date, and, accordingly, awarded priority of invention to appellees. In so holding, the board discussed appellant\u2019s physical exhibits Nos. 2, 8, 10, 21, 37, 38, and 39, his documentary exhibit No. 35, and the evidence relating to such exhibits, it apparently having been contended by counsel for appellant .that each of such physical exhibits had been successfully operated prior to appellees\u2019 filing date and that by such operation appellant had successfully reduced the involved invention to practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Appellant\u2019s exhibit No. 2 comprises a flat metal plate and two flat metal mold sections, each of the mold sections having an oblong opening or cut-out portion extending completely therethrough.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Relative to that exhibit, the board held that the testimony of appellant\u2019s witnesses John Horvath (production manager and foreman of the casting department of one Sigmund Cohn, apparently a manufacturer of jewelry in New York City) and David J. Kaplan (\u201cproduction man in the factory\u201d of Morris Kaplan &amp; Sons of New York City, manufacturers of jewelry), and the stipulated testimony of Sidney Cohn (apparently associated with Sigmund Cohn) established that exhibit No. 2 had been successfully operated in this country by appellant at least as early as February, 1936, and stated that in the process of operating that device, rubber mold sections were produced and used to \u201ccast wax patterns which were then embedded in investment material to form investment molds for casting the final product.\u201d The board described the process as detailed in the testimony of the witness Kaplan as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-7\">\u201c * * * It appears that one of the apertured metal frames of apparatus like exhibit 2 was placed on the flat metal plate and plaster of paris was poured into the hole in the frame and leveled off. A model of the article ultimately to be produced was partially embedded in the plaster of paris and a sprue former was also partially embedded adjacent thereto to form a channel leading to one edge of the frame. After the plaster of paris had set and hardened the second frame was fastened on top of the first and a sheet of rubber was laid within the second frame and over the entire area of the plaster of paris. Heat and pressure were applied to melt the rubber and cause it to flow into all the irregularities of the model and generally conform to the exposed surfaces of the model, the sprue firmer, and the plaster of paris. The rubber was cooled and thoroughly solidified by immersing the assembly in water. The assembly was then inverted, and the flat plate and the first frame were removed. After removing all of the plaster of paris, the first frame was replaced and a second sheet of rubber was placed over the half exposed model and sprue former within the hole in the first frame. Heat and pressure were applied as before to form a second separable rubber mold section. The two rubber mold sections were then taken from the frames, separated to remove the model and the sprue former, and used to cast a wax duplicate of the original model. The wax casting was then used to form an investment mold for casting the finished article.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">The board then called attention to the fact that the first step in the process defined by each of the involved counts consists in \u201cplacing a model of the ultimate article to be cast <em>between </em>mold casing sections having <em>registering depressions </em>forming a space surrounding said model\u201d (italics quoted from the board\u2019s decision), and held that as the mold casings or frames in appellant\u2019s exhibit No. 2 had registering openings or cut-out portions extending completely therethrough, it could not be said that the casing sections of that exhibit had <em>registering depressions between </em>which a model of the ultimate article to be cast could be placed, and that, therefore, the operation of exhibit No. 2, in the manner set forth in the quoted excerpt from the board\u2019s decision, did not conform to the first step in the process set forth in each of the involved counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">In so holding, the board stated that the mold casing sections disclosed in appellees\u2019 patent were materially different from the mold casing sections or frames of appellant\u2019s exhibit No. 2, and that appellees\u2019 casings, as disclosed in their patent, were very similar to appellant\u2019s exhibit No. 8, in which two metal mold casings are provided with \u201chollowed out portions\u201d and in which \u201cthe model is practically completely enveloped by the two casing sections, the depressions [hollowed out portions] of which respectively form bounding walls of solid metal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">It would seem to be clear that the first step in the involved process requires the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>placing of a model between mold casing sections which have registering depressions, which registering depressions form a space surrounding the model. Obviously, the registering openings or cut-out portions extending completely through the mold sections in appellant\u2019s exhibit No. 2 cannot be said to be hollowed out portions or \u201cregistering depressions,\u201d within the plain meaning of the language contained in the involved counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Counsel for appellant here contends that the board was in error in holding that appellant\u2019s exhibit No. 2 is materially different from the mold casing sections disclosed in appellees\u2019 patent, and argues that the mold casing sections of exhibit No. 2 \u00e1re, in fact, similar to the mold casing sections disclosed in appellees\u2019 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">We have given careful consideration to the drawings of appellees\u2019 patent, but are unable to concur in the views of counsel for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Appellees clearly state ' in . their patent that the mold casing sections have \u201ccavities or depressions or cut-out portions in each of the faces.\u201d Furthermore, if 'counsel for appellant is correct in his argument, appellees could not make the claims constituting the counts in issue. We are of opinion, therefore, that the process carried out by means of appellant\u2019s exhibit No. 2, as explained by appellant\u2019s witness Kaplan, does not conform to the first step in the process defined in the involved counts. We are~also of. opinion th\u00e1t the first step in the process defined by \u2022 the counts in issue could not be carried out by the operation of appellant\u2019s exhibit No. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Although a portion of the device is missing, appellant\u2019s exhibit No. 21 is apparently similar to his exhibit No. 2. Accordingly, as pointed out by the board in its decision, there is nothing of record to indicate that the first step in the process defined in the involved counts was, or could have been, carried out by that device \u2014 exhibit No. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">\u2018The board held, and its holding is clearly in accordance with the evidence of record, that, although appellant\u2019s exhibits Nos. 8, 37, 38, and 39 were substantially similar to the mold casing sections disclosed in' appellees\u2019 patent, there was no evidence \u00f3f record -that those' exhibits were operated, or that the method of their operation was explained by' appellant to any one, prior to appellees\u2019 filing date, and no claim is made here by counsel for appellant that the board erred in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">In its decision, the board referred to appellant\u2019s exhibit No. 10, which, for reasons hereinafter stated, need not be described here, and stated that it appeared from the testimony of the witness Horvath that 'appellant brought the device (exhibit No. 10) to the United States sometime during the year 1936 and demonstrated it to the witness, but that as the witness did not state of what the demonstration consisted, it could not be held that the involved process had been carried out by the operation of that device prior to appellees\u2019 filing date. Although the board discussed exhibit No. 10 in considerable detail, we find it unnecessary to do so, as it is clear from the record that appellant has not established either a conception or reduction to practice of the involved invention by the operation of that' device.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-11\">Appellant\u2019s exhibit No. 35 consists of a copy of a patent application, prepared for appellant in the early part of 1936, and executed by him on March 23 of that year. However, that application was not filed in the Patent Office, and there is no evidence corroborating the testimony of appellant regarding its preparation. The board held, therefore, that appellant\u2019s exhibit No. 35 did not establish conception of the invention, and we are in agreement with that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-12\">The board also held that appellant had failed to establish either conception or reduction to practice of the third step in the involved process, which is present in each of the involved counts, prior to appellees\u2019 filing date. In view of the fact that we are of opinion that appellant has failed to establish either conception or reduction to practice of the first step of the process defined in each of the involved counts prior to appellees\u2019 filing date, it is unnecessary that we consider whether appellant has established conception or reduction to practice of the third step in the involved process, nor is it necessary that we discuss other issues decided by the board and referred to in the brief of counsel for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-13\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the Board of Interference Examiners, awarding priority of invention to appellees, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Aef\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
