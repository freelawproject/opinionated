Along with every other circuit court that has decided this issue, we conclude that bartering drugs for firearms furthers trafficking in drugs. We affirm Miranda\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-8\">In 2009, Miranda offered to purchase firearms from Eric Hernandez. Unbeknownst to Miranda, Hernandez was a special agent on a task force to prevent trafficking in narcotics and weapons between Florida and Puerto Rico. In several telephone conversations, Miranda stated that he wanted firearms that were fully automatic, and he offered to pay with heroin in lieu of cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-9\">Miranda was anxious to acquire firearms. When Hernandez asked to purchase a sample of heroin, Miranda asked Hernandez to pay with firearms, but Hernandez insisted on paying with cash. During the meeting, the men resumed their discussion about firearms and Miranda said that he \u201cneed[ed] a lot of guns\u201d because he had a customer in Puerto Rico who was \u201cdesperate to receive the firearms.\u201d When Hernandez asked about a date for the sale, Miranda responded that he wanted the firearms \u201cright now,\u201d \u201che was ready\u201d for the transaction, and he sought assurance from Hernandez that the firearms he would transfer would not be \u201cfake.\u201d Miranda then retrieved from his pants several plastic bags of heroin and sold Hernandez one bag of seven grams of heroin for $700.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-10\">A few days later, Hernandez initiated a three way telephone call between himself, Miranda, and Richard Zayas, a special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. Miranda was angry at Hernandez for failing to respond to telephone calls about the firearms, which Miranda wanted \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d Hernandez and Zayas agreed to sell four handguns and three fully automatic machine guns in exchange for 57 grams of heroin. Miranda asked for more firearms and asked to conduct the transaction \u201cright now,\u201d but Hernandez and Zayas refused. Later that day, Miranda sent Hernandez a text message to \u201cbring all the firearms\u201d that he had available.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-11\">On the day of the transaction, Miranda met the two agents. Zayas demonstrated how to use the three machine guns, and Miranda examined thoroughly one of the machine guns and inserted an empty ammunition magazine into the gun. Zayas asked to see the heroin, but Miranda refused to produce the drugs until he had inspected the handguns. Zayas retrieved an insulated bag used to transport pizza that contained the four handguns. Zayas handed the guns to Miranda, and Miranda tested each gun. After Miranda determined that the guns were operational, he gave Zayas 50 grams of heroin and offered to give Zayas 10 more grams of heroin in a future transaction. Zayas placed the seven guns inside the insulated bag and carried them to Miranda\u2019s vehicle. After Miranda placed the bag in the passenger seat of his vehicle, federal agents arrested Miranda.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-12\">A grand jury charged Miranda in a superseding indictment with five crimes, including possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). Miranda moved to dismiss the possession charge on the ground that it failed to state a crime. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(B). The district court denied Miranda\u2019s motion and ruled that Miranda\u2019s receipt of firearms in exchange for drugs violated section 924(c)(1)(A), based on our definition of \u201cpossession in furtherance\u201d in <em>United States v. Timmons, </em>283 F.3d 1246, 1253 (11th Cir.2002), and the decisions of other circuit courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">At trial, Miranda moved for a judgment of acquittal on the possession charge after the government rested its case, but the district court denied the motion for the same reasons that it had denied Miranda\u2019s motion to dismiss. The jury found Miranda guilty of the firearms charge and the other four crimes charged in his indictment. The district court sentenced Miranda to 183 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>both the denial of Miranda\u2019s motion to dismiss his indictment as legally insufficient and his motion for a judgment of acquittal. <em>United States v. Schmitz, </em>634 F.3d 1247, 1259 (11th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Friske, </em>640 F.3d 1288, 1290 (11th Cir.2011). \u201cEvidence is sufficient to support a conviction where \u2018after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Timmons, </em>283 F.3d at 1250 (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-8\">Miranda argues that the district court erred by refusing to dismiss his charge of and later adjudging him guilty of possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). Miranda argues, based on the decisions of the Supreme Court in <em>Watson v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 74, 128 S.Ct. 579, 169 L.Ed.2d 472 (2007), and of this Court in <em>United States v. Montano, </em>398 F.3d 1276 (11th Cir.2005), that his \u201cpassive receipt\u201d of firearms did not further a drug trafficking offense. Miranda\u2019s argument is irreconcilable with the plain language of section 924(c), the decisions of the Supreme Court and our Court, and the decisions of every sister circuit that has decided the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-10\">The original version of section 924(c)(1) imposed a minimum sentence of five years of imprisonment if a defendant \u201cduring and in relation to any ... drug trafficking crime ... use[d] or carrie[d] a firearm.\u201d <em>See Smith v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 223, 227, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 2053, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993). In <em>Smith, </em>the Supreme Court affirmed our decision that bartering a firearm to obtain drugs involved \u201cuse\u201d of a firearm in violation of section 924(c). <em>Id. </em>Two years later, the Supreme Court held in <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 145-50, 116 S.Ct. 501, 506-09, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), that mere possession of a firearm in the vicinity of a drug transaction did not constitute \u201cuse\u201d under section 924(c) because the term required the defendant\u2019s \u201cactive employment\u201d of the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-11\">Three years after the Supreme Court decided <em>Bailey, </em>Congress amended section 924(c)(1). In \u201cdirect response\u201d to the statement in <em>Bailey </em>that section 924(c) could have included the word \u201cpossess\u201d if Congress had \u201cintended possession alone to trigger liability under \u00a7 924(e)(1),\u201d 516 U.S. at 143, 116 S.Ct. at 506, Congress amended the provision to penalize a defendant \u201cwho, in furtherance of [a drug trafficking crime], possesses a firearm,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>560 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2169, 2179, 176 L.Ed.2d 979 (2010). Congress sought to address the dangers inherent in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>having firearms in the proximity of drug transactions when their presence was intended \u201cto advance or promote the criminal activity.\u201d <em>Timmons, </em>283 F.3d at 1252 (quoting H.R. Rep. 105-344, at 12 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">This Court later ruled that the opposite transaction of <em>Smith </em>\u2014 that is, bartering drugs in exchange for guns \u2014 did not constitute \u201cuse\u201d of a firearm under section 924(c)(1)(A). <em>Montano, </em>398 F.3d at 1283-84. We held that Montano\u2019s negotiations to acquire firearms and his viewing of the guns before he transferred methamphetamine to a federal agent did not involve the type of \u201cactive employment\u201d required under <em>Bailey </em>to constitute \u201cuse\u201d of the firearms. <em>Id. </em>at 1280-84. We reasoned that because \u201c[t]he firearms were never in Montano\u2019s possession, either actually or constructively,\u201d and he never exercised any \u201cdominion or control over the firearms,\u201d he lacked the \u201cmeans\u201d by which to \u201cuse\u201d the guns as contemplated in section 924(c)(1)(A). <em>Id. </em>at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">In <em>Watson, </em>the Supreme Court likewise decided that \u201ca person does not \u2018use\u2019 a firearm under [section] 924(c)(1)(A) when he receives it in trade for drugs.\u201d 552 U.S. at 83, 128 S.Ct. at 586. The Court reasoned that \u201cthe first possessor is the one who \u2018uses\u2019 the gun in the trade.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81, 128 S.Ct. at 584. Because the buyer, a government agent, \u201cused\u201d a pistol to obtain Watson\u2019s drugs, Watson did not \u201cuse[ ] the pistol in the trade.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79, 128 S.Ct. at 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-7\">Miranda argues that, under the reasoning of <em>Watson </em>and <em>Montano, </em>he did not possess a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense, but we disagree. The decisions in <em>Watson </em>and <em>Montano, </em>which construed the term \u201cuse\u201d in section 924(c), do not pertain to Miranda\u2019s charge of \u201cpossession.\u201d The Court in <em>Bailey </em>recognized that \u201cuse\u201d and \u201cpossession\u201d differ, 516 U.S. at 143-50, 116 S.Ct. at 506-09, and Congress, in its amendment of section 924(c), employed the two terms in different phrases to proscribe different types of misconduct, <em>see O\u2019Brien, </em>560 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 2179. The Court in <em>Bailey </em>held that \u201c \u2018use\u2019 must connote more than mere possession of a firearm,\u201d 516 U.S. at 143, 116 S.Ct. at 506, and the Court in <em>Watson </em>criticized as \u201cpeculiar\u201d and \u201cunderwhelming\u201d the argument of the government that bartering drugs to obtain a gun could be punished both as prohibited \u201cuse\u201d and \u201cpossession\u201d of a firearm, 552 U.S. at 83, 128 S.Ct. at 585-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-10\">Miranda\u2019s argument also is inconsistent with our decision in <em>United States v. Timmons, </em>where we held that a defendant possesses a firearm in furtherance of a crime when \u201cthe firearm helped, furthered, promoted, or advanced the drug trafficking.\u201d 283 F.3d at 1252. We explained that our interpretation of section 924(c)(1)(A) was supported by the legislative history of the amended statute to punish the act of possessing a firearm in the proximity of trafficking in drugs when the firearm was intended to \u201c \u2018advance or promote the criminal activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting H.R. Rep. 105-344, at 12). So long as the prosecution offers proof \u201c \u2018of some nexus between the firearm and the drug selling operation,\u2019 \u201d the defendant is subject to enhancement of his sentence under section 924(c)(1)(A). <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Finley, </em>245 F.3d 199, 202 (2d Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-11\">Miranda possessed firearms in furtherance of his drug trafficking crimes. The firearms were integral to Miranda\u2019s drug trafficking. Miranda sought to purchase as many firearms as possible and, after inspecting the firearms to ensure that they were operational, gave Zayas 50 grams of heroin. Miranda\u2019s demand for firearms as consideration for the heroin undoubtedly \u201cfurthered, promoted, or advanced\u201d his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>drug trafficking crime. <em>Timmons, </em>283 F.3d at 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">Our decision is consistent with the decisions of every sister circuit that has considered the issue. Seven circuit courts\u2014 the First, Second, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits \u2014 have held that bartering drugs to acquire firearms constitutes \u201cpossession in furtherance of\u2019 a drug trafficking crime. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>627 F.3d 941, 955 (4th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Gurka, </em>605 F.3d 40, 41 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 360, 178 L.Ed.2d 233 (2010); <em>United States v. Gardner, </em>602 F.3d 97, 99 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3372, 176 L.Ed.2d 1264 (2010); <em>United States v. Doody, </em>600 F.3d 752, 755 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3529, 177 L.Ed.2d 1109 (2010); <em>United States v. Mahan, </em>586 F.3d 1185, 1188-89 (9th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 173, 178 L.Ed.2d 103 (2010); <em>United States v. Luke-Sanchez, </em>483 F.3d 703, 706 (10th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Frederick, </em>406 F.3d 754, 764 (6th Cir.2005) (relying on its decision in <em>United States v. Mackey, </em>265 F.3d 457, 460-63 (6th Cir.2001)). Another court, the Fifth Circuit, \u201cassume[d], without [having to] decid[e], that bartering drugs for guns constitute^] \u2018possession in furtherance\u2019 of a drug trafficking offense\u201d and held that the defendant did not have to receive the firearms contemporaneously with delivery of the drugs to commit the offense. <em>United States v. Sterling, </em>555 F.3d 452, 458 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2422, 173 L.Ed.2d 1325 (2009). The Fifth Circuit reasoned that the firearms, regardless of the timing of their delivery, \u201cfunctioned as the currency used to purchase illegal drugs\u201d to further the drug transaction. <em>Id. </em>(relying on <em>Luke-Sanchez, </em>483 F.3d at 706).</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-15\">Miranda\u2019s conduct established that, but for the firearms, his transfer of heroin to Zayas and Hernandez would not have occurred. Miranda requested firearms, exercised dominion, albeit briefly, over the firearms, and transferred an illegal drug for the firearms. The record supports Miranda\u2019s conviction under section 924(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-16\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-17\">We AFFIRM Miranda\u2019s conviction for possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
