McCullough pleaded guilty to theft of money from a bank and was sentenced to five years probation, later modified to three years probation. He violated a condition of his probation, causing it to be revoked, and McCullough was sentenced to nine months imprisonment, followed by two years supervised release. McCullough timely appealed this sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-25\">McCullough maintains on appeal that the district court erred by imposing a term of supervised release following the period of imprisonment. He contends that a sentence of supervised release is not available under subchapter A as referred to in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(a)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-26\">A sentence imposed after revocation of probation is reviewed <em>de novo </em>and will be upheld unless it is in violation of law or is plainly unreasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The government correctly notes that McCullough did not object timely to the imposition of a term of supervised release. In the absence of a contemporaneous objection, we may correct only errors that are clear or obvious under current law and which affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If these requirements are met, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>the court has the discretion to grant relief but will do so only when the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The sentencing court herein did not err. When a defendant violates a condition of probation, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(a)(2) directs the court to \u201crevoke the sentence of probation and impose any other sentence that was available under subchapter A at the time of the initial sentencing.\u201d It is abundantly clear that when initially sentenced the controlling statutes made McCullough subject to imprisonment and a term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Further, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(g)(1) provides that \u201c[wjhere probation is revoked and a term of imprisonment is imposed, the provisions of sections 5D1.1-1.3 shall apply to the imposition of a term of supervised release.\u201d Section 5Dl.l(a) in turn provides that the court \u201cshall order a term of supervised release to follow imprisonment when a sentence of imprisonment of more than one year is imposed, or when required by statute.\u201d McCullough was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of nine months; therefore section 5Dl.l(a) did not mandate the district court to impose a term of supervised release. Section 5Dl.l(b), however, provides that the court \u201cmay order a term of supervised release to follow imprisonment in any other case.\u201d Under this section the district court was empowered to impose a term of supervised release. We therefore hold that the court a <em>quo </em>did not err in imposing the challenged term of supervised release following the period of imprisonment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-16\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-17\">(a) If the defendant violates a condition of probation at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the term of probation, the court may ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-18\">(2) revoke the sentence of probation and impose any other sentence that was available under subchapter A [18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3551 et seq.] at the time of the initial sentencing.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b501-27\">. <em>United States v.
