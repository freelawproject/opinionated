The probation officer determined that James\u2019 guidelines sentence range was 151-to-188 months. The district court adopted the PSR and sentenced James to a term of 160 months. James argues that the district court failed to supply adequate reasons for choosing the 160-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-25\">By statute a sentencing court must consider the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; the need for punishment, deterrence, public protection and rehabilitation; the available sentences; the guidelines and policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission; the need for consistency in sentencing; and the need for restitution. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-26\">If a defendant\u2019s guidelines sentencing range exceeds twenty-four months, the district court must state in open court its reasons for the particular sentence that it has imposed. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1). The sentencing court is to link the pertinent facts to the relevant statutory factor[s] supporting the sentence imposed. <em>United States v. Duran, </em>37 F.3d 557, 560-61 (9th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Rosa, </em>11 F.3d 315, 344-35 (2nd Cir.1993), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 114 S.Ct. 1565, 1864, 128 L.Ed.2d 211, 485 (1994); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-30\">James did not object to the district court\u2019s allegedly inadequate reasons for imposing a 160-month sentence. Therefore, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162 (5th Cir.1994) (en <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>banc). The requirements enunciated in <em>Cal-verley </em>have' not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
