He appeals the district court\u2019s sixteen level enhancement of his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court applied the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(2) enhancement because Garcia-Rico was previously deported after a conviction for voluntary manslaughter. Garcia-Rico contends that voluntary manslaughter, at the time he committed it, did not constitute an aggravated felony un^er ^be statute. We affirm,</p>\n<p id=\"AH\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b109-16\">Garcia-Rico was convicted of voluntary manslaughter on January 18, 1990, and thereafter deported. He reentered this country illegally and was arrested in March 1994. He pled guilty to one count of illegal reentry after deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The PSR recommended a sixteen level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(2). Garcia-Rico objected to the PSR\u2019s recommendation on the grounds that voluntary manslaughter only became an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 on November 29, 1990.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He committed the voluntary manslaughter before that date. The district court nonetheless adopted the PSR\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-17\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b109-18\">Whether the Sentencing Guidelines apply to a prior conviction is a question of law. <em>United States v. Howard, </em>991 F.2d 195, 199 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 395, 126 L.Ed.2d 343 (1993). We review questions of law de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-21\">Congress defines the term \u201caggravated felony\u201d in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). Congress amended the definition in 1990 to include \u201cany crime of violence ... for which the term of imprisonment imposed (regardless of any suspension of such imprisonment) is at least 5 years.\u201d Immigration Act of 1990, Pub.L. No. 101-649, \u00a7 501(a), 104 Stat. 4978, 5048 (1990). The amended definition \u201cshall apply to offenses committed on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 501(b), 104 Stat. at 5048. Congress enacted the Immigration Act on November 29, 1990. Because Garcia-Rico committed voluntary manslaughter before that date, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>contends that the amended definition of aggravated felony does not apply either to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) or U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">In <em>United States v. Saenz-Forero, </em>27 F.3d 1016 (5th Cir.1994), we addressed whether 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) could apply to an aggravated felony committed before 1988 without violating the Ex Post Facto Clause.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant had been convicted of an aggravated felony in 1985, deported in 1986, and convicted of illegal reentry in 1992. Because the defendant violated \u00a7 1326 in 1992, we rejected his ex post facto argument. <em>Id. </em>at 1020-21; <em>see also United States v. Arzate-Nunez, </em>18 F.3d 730, 734 (9th Cir.1994) (noting that the relevant offense is the current \u00a7 1326 violation, not the predicate crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The Ninth Circuit addressed the precise question raised in this appeal in <em>United States v. Ullyses-Salazar, </em>28 F.3d 932 (9th Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 1367, 131 L.Ed.2d 223 (1995). The defendant had been convicted of armed robbery in 1983, deported, and convicted of illegal reentry in 1992. He contended that armed robbery became an aggravated felony only after Congress enacted the 1990 amendment to \u00a7 1101(a)(43). The court disagreed and applied the definition of aggravated felony that existed at the time the defendant was arrested for illegal reentry. <em>Id. </em>at 938 (citing <em>Arzate-Nunez, </em>18 F.3d at 735). Based on <em>Arzate-Nunez </em>and a reading of the statute, the court determined that the relevant offense was the defendant\u2019s violation of \u00a7 1326. <em>Id. </em>at 738-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">We agree with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s conclusion in <em>Ullyses-Salazar, </em>and we consider it consistent with our decision in <em>Saenz-Forero. </em>The amended definition of \u00a7 1101(a)(43) applies to offenses committed on or after November 29, 1990. The relevant offense is Garcia-Rico\u2019s illegal reentry into this country. Because he violated \u00a7 1326 in 1994, we apply the amended definition of aggravated felony to Garcia-Rico.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> His voluntary manslaughter conviction constitutes an aggravated felony. Thus, the district court properly applied the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(2) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-14\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b110-15\">For the foregoing reasons, Appellant\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b110-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-14\">. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is the Sentencing Guideline applicable to the offense of unlawful reentry. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(2) provides for a 16 level enhancement when \"the defendant previously was deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b109-15\">. An alien who is deported and later found illegally in the United States violates \u00a7 1326(a). If the alien is convicted of an aggravated felony before deportation, then \u00a7 1326(b)(2), which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years, also applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b109-23\">. Garcia-Rico does not dispute that his act of voluntary manslaughter would constitute an aggravated felony if committed after that date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b110-9\">. The commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 defines aggravated felony in accordance with the amended definition. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 commentary n. 7, <em>added by </em>Amendment 375 (effective Nov. 1, 1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b110-26\">. Congress added \u00a7 1326(b)(2) in 1988. Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub.L. No. 100-690, \u00a7 7345(a)(2), 102 Stat. 4181, 4471 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b110-27\">.
