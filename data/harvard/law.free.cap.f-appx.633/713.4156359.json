He first challenges his conviction on <em>Batson </em>grounds. Next he contends that the government improperly vouched for its witnesses in closing argument and that the district court improperly instructed the jury on the meaning of \u201cconstructive possession.\u201d Finally, he challenges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, contending that the district court\u2019s application of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors violated his First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The firearm Gibson was convicted of possessing was discovered in a home that he was unlawfully occupying in Lithonia, Georgia. A woman purchased that home from a bank in January 2013, with the closing date set for April 26, 2013. Gibson, along with several other people, unlawfully moved into the home during that time period. The purchaser and the bank\u2019s listing agent tried to get Gibson to leave. He refused. When the police visited it to investigate his' occupancy, he told them that he owned the home. He claimed ownership based on a number of documents that he posted on the front door and windows of the home.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The gist of those documents was that Gibson owned the home and that he Was a \u201csovereign citizen\u201d not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States or any state.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Gibson continued to occupy the home through the closing date. The purchaser and the bank then went to court in DeKalb County, Georgia to settle the ownership dispute. Gibson attended those proceedings. The court ordered him to leave the home immediately. At the end of those proceedings, law enforcement officers arrested Gibson for various state law-charges related to his \u25a0 occupation of the home. That same day the officers searched the home. They found fraudulent identification documents with Gibson\u2019s name on them and a Smith &amp; Wesson revolver under, the bedsheets in the master bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">\u25a0 The officers also interviewed Gibson twice on the day of his arrest. During those interviews, Gibson insisted that he owned the home, citing some of the documents that he had posted on the windows and door. He stated that he slept in the master bedroom most of the time and pointed to the location of that bedroom on a schematic drawing of the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-13\">The officers also asked him whether there were any firearms in the home. Gibson replied that another occupant had a shotgun. When asked about the handgun (which the officers did not describe in detail) that had been found during the search, Gibson described it as a five-shot, black-handled revolver and stated that he had moved it around the home. His description of the handgun matched the revolver the officers found in the master bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-14\">The government charged Gibson with one count of being a convicted felon who knowingly possessed a firearm (the handgun) in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). He agreed to stipulate at trial that he was a convicted felon at the time of the indictment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, he continued to assert his sovereign citizen status. On the first day of trial, he filed <em>pro se </em>an \u201caffidavit of competency,\u201d which alleged (among other things) that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>was a \u201ctribunal operated as a private corporation\u201d instead of a real court. At the end of trial Gibson stated that the district court lacked jurisdiction over him because he was a sovereign citizen. The jury-found Gibson guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm, and the district court sentenced him to 72 months imprisonment. This is his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Gibson first contends that the district court clearly erred when it rejected his <em>Batson </em>challenge to the government\u2019s strikes of five African American venire members. He focuses particularly on the strike of Prospective Juror 1, a 24-year-old African American. When asked by the district court to provide a race-neutral reason for that strike, the government stated that he was young, unemployed, previously worked at a grocery store, and did not own a home. Based on those characteristics, the government did not believe that he would be a \u201csuitable juror\u201d for the case because of the evidence relating to Gibson\u2019s fraudulent deeds to the.home where he had been residing. Gibson agreed that Prospective Juror 1 was a renter but argued that the government\u2019s explanation was mere pretext for discrimination. The district court accepted the government\u2019s explanation, stating that Prospective Juror l\u2019s \u201cyouth and lack of experience with real estate transactions of any kind\u201d was a \u201clegitimate, non-discriminatory reason\u201d for striking him.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The Supreme Court held in <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), that a \u201cprosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory strikes in even a single case to remove blacks from the jury on account of their race violates the Equal Protection Clause.\u201d <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>65 F.3d 918, 923 (11th Cir.1995). The framework for evaluating <em>Batson </em>challenges involves three steps. <em>Id. </em>at 923-24. The party challenging the strike must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 923. If the challenger succeeds in showing a prima facie case, the striking party must then articulate a race-neutral reason for the strike. <em>Id. </em>Once the striking party articulates a race-neutral reason, the district court \u201cmust evaluate the credibility of the stated justifications based on the evidence placed before it.\u201d <em>United States v. Houston, </em>456 F.3d 1328, 1335 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">The district court\u2019s determination concerning the actual motivation behind each challenged strike\u201d is \u201cpure factfinding\u201d that we review for clear error. <em>Id.; see also Greene v. Upton, </em>644 F.3d 1145, 1155 (11th Cir.2011) (\u201c[T]he determination on the ultimate question of discriminatory intent ... represents a finding of fact of the sort accorded great deference on appeal.\u201d) (quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">The district court did not clearly err in denying Gibson\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge. As to the first step, the issue of whether Gibson established a prima facie case of discrimination is moot. Although the establishment of a prima facie case is an \u201cabsolute precondition to the prosecution\u2019s burden to articulate race-neutral reasons\u201d for its strikes, <em>Houston, </em>456 F.3d at 1335-36, that issue becomes moot when the district court rules on \u201cthe ultimate issue of intentional discrimination\u201d without \u201cexplicitly determining]\u201d whether the defendant made out a prima facie case, at least where his challenge fails on steps two and three. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Gamory, </em>635 F.3d 480, 495 (11th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Edouard, </em>485 F.3d 1324, 1342-43 (11th Cir.2007). That is what happened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Regardless of step one, Gibson\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge fails on steps two and three. Step two only requires an explanation for the strikes that is legitimate, reasonably specific, and facially nondiseriminatory. <em>United States v. Folk, </em>754 F.3d 905, 914 (11th Cir.2014); <em>United States v. Alston, </em>895 F.2d 1362, 1366 (11th Cir.1990). The district court did not clearly err in finding that the government\u2019s asserted reasons for striking Prospective Juror 1 \u2014 that he was young, unemployed, previously worked at a grocery store, and did not own a home\u2014 are race neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">As for step three, the district court did not clearly err in finding the government\u2019s explanation for the strike credible and non-pretextual.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In evaluating whether the rationale for a strike is mere pretext, the key question is the <em>\u201cgenuineness </em>of the [government\u2019s] explanation, rather than its reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Walker, </em>490 F.3d 1282, 1294 (11th Cir.2007). We evaluate the credibility of that explanation based on all the relevant facts. <em>Parker v. Allen, </em>565 F.3d 1258, 1271 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">Gibson argues that the government\u2019s explanation for the strike was mere pretext for two reasons. First, he points to the government\u2019s failure to strike a similarly situated white venire member who was also young and did not own a home.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Second, he asserts that the government\u2019s inquiry about whether the venire members owned or rented their dwellings was not a meaningful voir dire on the issue of their ability to understand real estate transactions because even homeowners might not know much about real estate transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-11\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that the reasons for the government\u2019s strike were credible and non-pretextual. Even if a more meaningful voir dire were possible, it was not clear error for the district court to accept the government\u2019s race neutral reasoning that most homeowners are likely to know more about real estate transactions than someone who has never purchased a home. <em>See Stewart, </em>65 F.3d at 926 (\u201c[Where] there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d) (quotation marks and alterations omitted). Gibson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>focus on the government\u2019s decision not to strike the young, white venire member who did not own a home is misplaced because there were relevant differences between that venire member and the one who was struck. <em>See Parker, </em>565 F.3d at 1271 (\u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s failure, to strike similarly situated jurors is not pretextual ... where there are relevant differences between the struck jurors and the comparator juror[].\u201d) (quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">There were also five African Americans in the thirteen-member jury (twelve jurors and an alternate), out of twelve African Americans in the 32-person venire. <em>See United States v. Puentes, </em>50 F.3d 1567, 1578 (11th Cir.1995) (\u201cAlthough the presence of [African American] jurors does not dispose of an allegation of race-based peremptory challenges, it is a significant factor tending to prove the paucity of the claim.\u201d). For all of these reasons, the district court did not clearly err in finding that the government\u2019s reasons for the strike were credible and non-pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Gibson also contends that the government improperly vouched for its witnesses in closing argument. In his closing argument, defense counsel asserted that the officers who testified about Gibson\u2019s statements concerning his possession of the handgun essentially fabricated those statements after the interview. In rebuttal, the government provided various reasons why the officers\u2019 testimony was credible. In the course of doing so, the government stated: \u201cI submit to you, Ladies and Gentlemen, that these officers and these agents, their testimony is worthy of belief.\u201d The district court overruled Gibson\u2019s objection to that statement. According to Gibson, that decision was erroneous because the government improperly put its prestige behind the officers by assuring their credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">We review claims of improper vouching <em>de novo. United States v. Epps, </em>613 F.3d 1093, 1100 (11th Cir.2010). Improper vouching occurs where the government places its prestige \u201cbehind the witness, by making personal assurances of the witness\u2019 veracity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). The government\u2019s remarks must also \u201cprejudicially affect the substantial rights of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">Contrary to Gibson\u2019s argument, the government\u2019s statement did not improperly place prestige behind the officers. The transcript of the closing arguments establishes that the government was attempting to respond to Gibson\u2019s attacks on the officers\u2019 credibility. An argument that fairly responds to an argument is permissible. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>700 F.2d 627, 634 (11th Cir.1983) (\u201c[T]his Court has recognized an exception to [the prohibition on improper vouching], the so-called \u2018fair response\u2019 rule, that entitles a prosecutor to respond to arguments advanced by defense counsel in his or her statement to the jury.\u201d). The government did not base that response on evidence not before the jury, nor did it use its own reputation to defend the officers\u2019 credibility. <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>590 F.3d 1238, 1256-57 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201c[The] prohibition against vouching does not ... forbid prosecutors from arguing credibility; rather, it forbids arguing credibility based on the reputation of the government office or on evidence not before the jury.\u201d). The district court therefore did not err in overruling Gibson\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Gibson\u2019s final challenge to his conviction is that the district court erred in instructing the jury on constructive possession. The court instructed the jury that \u201c[cjon-structive possession of a thing occurs if a person doesn\u2019t have actual possession of it but has both the power and the intention to take control over it later.\u201d The court then instructed the jury that a \u201cperson who owns or exercises dominion and control over a residence in which contraband is knowingly concealed may be deemed to be in constructive possession of the contraband.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> According to Gibson, that instruction allowed the jury to find him guilty based solely on the fact that he possessed the property, even if one of the other occupants of the home had knowingly concealed the handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">We review jury instructions under a deferential standard of review. <em>Johnson v. Breeden, </em>280 F.3d 1308, 1314 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cAs long as they accurately reflect the law, the trial judge is given wide discretion as to the style and wording employed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). We reverse only where there is \u201csubstantial and ineradicable doubt as to whether the jury was properly guided in its deliberations.\u201d <em>United States v. Cochran, </em>683 F.3d 1314, 1319 (11th Cir.2012) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe analyze the objected-to portion of the instructions in light of the entire charge and we keep in mind that isolated statements which appear prejudicial when taken out of context may be innocuous when viewed in light of the entire trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">\u201cA person who owns or exercises dominion and control over a ... residence in which contraband is concealed may be deemed to be in constructive possession of the contraband.\u201d <em>United States v. Vera, 701 </em>F.2d 1349, 1357 (11th Cir.1983). However, a jury should not be \u201cinstructed that control of premises can serve as a sole basis of conviction.\u201d <em>Cochran, </em>683 F.3d at 1320. Instead, \u201cthe essence of constructive possession is the power to control the contraband itself,\u201d and \u201ccontrol of the premises simply permits an <em>inference </em>of that power.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">Gibson\u2019s argument that the instruction allowed the jury to convict him for constructive possession of the handgun based solely on his control of the premises fails. The instruction states that the person who controls the premises where the \u201ccontraband is knowingly concealed can be deemed to be in constructive possession of the contraband,\u201d and goes on to state that the government must prove that Gibson was the one who committed the crime of possessing the firearm. <em>See id. </em>at 1319-21 (upholding a constructive possession instruction with \u201ca number of problems\u201d because those problems were mitigated by \u201cthe totality of the instructions\u201d). The evidence at trial showed that Gibson slept most of the time in the master bedroom, law enforcement found the handgun in that bedroom, and Gibson\u2019s description of it matched the one that law enforcement found. He also admitted to moving the handgun around the house. Even if the instruction could have been clearer in terms of specifying that Gibson must control the handgun itself (and not merely the premises), that lack of clarity was \u201cinnocuous\u201d in light of the evidence that Gibson did exercise control over the handgun. <em>Id. </em>at 1319 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">Gibson also challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>tending that the district court\u2019s application of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors violated his First Amendment rights. Neither party objected to the district court\u2019s calculation of 41 to 51 months imprisonment as the guidelines range. However, the government requested an upward variance of 21 months (to 72 months total), arguing that the guidelines range did not adequately reflect Gibson\u2019s criminal history or the relevant conduct underlying his conviction (his unlawful occupation of the home). The district court agreed. In explaining why the upward variance was appropriate, it referred to Gibson\u2019s \u201cfiling of the documents the first day of trial that refused to admit that he was subject to the charges that were pending in this case.\u201d Gibson argues that reference makes his sentence substantively unreasonable. Essentially, he argues that the district court improperly followed \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s directive to consider the need to promote respect for the law when the court found that the documents he had filed evidenced disrespect for the law. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) (\u201cThe court, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider ... the need for the sentence ... to promote respect for the law____\u201d). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">The transcript from the sentence hearing establishes that the district court based the variance on the need to promote respect for the law as well as on Gibson\u2019s offense conduct and criminal history. Imposing an upward variance based on a defendant\u2019s disrespect for law is permissible. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>686 F.3d 1219, 1222-23 (11th Cir.2012) (upholding a \u201csubstantial\u201d upward variance based partly on the defendant\u2019s \u201cdisrespect for the law\u201d). The district court referred to the documents Gibson filed as exemplifying his disrespect for the law. Given that Gibson had filed documents asserting that he was not subject to the laws of the United States, the district court did not clearly err in making that finding. <em>See United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc), (explaining that when reviewing a sentence, \u201c[t]o the extent that the district court has found facts, we accept them unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d). And the court did not apply an improper factor when it followed the statutory directive to consider need to promote respect for the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b747-8\">. Those documents consisted of a \"disposses-sory warrant,\u201d an \"affidavit of awareness,\u201d a \"realtor and state agent notice,\u201d two quitclaim deeds, a \"notification of reservation of rights UCC 1-308/1-207,\u201d and an \u201caffidavit of truth.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b747-9\">. For example, the \u201caffidavit of truth\u201d provided that Gibson was \"not a \u2018person\u2019 when such term is defined in statutes of the United States or statutes of the several states when such definition includes artificial entities.\u201d It also stated that Gibson \"voluntarily [chose] to comply with the man-made laws which serve to bring harmony to society, but no such laws, nor their enforcers, have any authority over [him].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b747-16\">.Gibson had prior felony convictions for bur- ,. glary and first degree forgery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b749-7\">. After Gibson argued that he had established a prima facie case of discrimination and the government responded that he had not, the district court stated: \"Well, I don\u2019t know. Technically, [the government may be correct] ... but I\u2019m going to insist that you put on the record a racially neutral reason for exercising the strikes that you did.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b749-8\">. Gibson also argues that the district court improperly combined steps two and three. It did not. A district court improperly condenses steps two and three where it \"summarily overrul[es]\u201d the challenging party\u2019s objections \"and/or fail[s] to consider whether [the challenging party] ha[s] refuted\u201d the government\u2019s race-neutral explanations. <em>United States v. Edouard, </em>485 F.3d 1324, 1343 (11th Cir.2007). The <em>Batson </em>hearing transcript shows that the district court properly conducted the analysis. It first asked the government to provide race-neutral reasons for its strikes (step two), heard Gibson\u2019s response, and then independently assessed the credibility of the government\u2019s proffered reasons (step three). .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b749-13\">.Gibson notes in his brief to this Court that it was never actually established at voir dire whether Prospective Juror 1 had ever owned a home. That is correct. However, Gibson did not raise that point in the district court, and in his appellate brief he later states that Prospective Juror I had never owned a home. In any event, the government\u2019s failure to clarify whether he had ever owned a home does not prove that its explanation was pretextual. <em>See Parker, </em>565 F.3d at 1271 (\"Neither a prosecutor\u2019s mistaken belief about a juror nor failure to ask a voir dire question provides clear and convincing evidence of pretext.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b750-7\">. The juror who was not struck was pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree and was employed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b751-7\">. The district court defined \"knowingly\u201d as an act done \"voluntarily and intentionally and not because of a mistake or by accident.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
