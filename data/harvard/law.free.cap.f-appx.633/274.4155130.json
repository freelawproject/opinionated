He also alleged that the defendants are liable for defamation because, when prospective employers run background checks on Wyatt, they turn up outstanding warrants on charges for which he denies guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The district court screened the complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 and \u00a7 1915A and dismissed it as for frivolous and for failure to state a claim on the grounds that all of Wyatt\u2019s claims were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and that, as to the defamation claims, Wyatt had not identified any information in his background checks that was false. We review the district court\u2019s ruling de novo. <em>Green v. Atkinson, </em>623 F.3d 278, 280 (5th Cir.2010). Under <em>Heck, </em>a plaintiff in a \u00a7 1983 action may not recover damages for an \u201callegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid,\u201d unless he proves \u201cthat the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">According to Wyatt, the rule in <em>Heck </em>does not apply to his \u00a7 1983 action because he had not yet been convicted or sentenced at the time he filed suit. He is mistaken. Where a plaintiff files a \u00a7 1983 action when a criminal proceeding is pending against him, the district court may dismiss the \u00a7 1983 action if he is later convicted and his claims call into question the validity of that conviction. <em>Wallace v. Kato, </em>549 U.S. 384, 393-94, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Wyatt also suggests that <em>Heck </em>does not apply where the plaintiffs guilty plea is \u201cindependent, distinct, separate, and not contested\u201d in the civil rights action. Again, Wyatt misunderstands the rule laid out in <em>Heck. </em>The <em>Heck </em>bar applies in \u201ca \u00a7 1983 action that does not seek damages directly attributable to conviction or confinement but whose successful prosecution would necessarily imply that the plaintiffs criminal conviction was wrongful.\u201d 512 U.S. at 486 n. 6, 114 S.Ct. 2364. The district court determined that if Wyatt received a favorable judgment, it would, indeed, \u201cnecessarily implicate the validity of his conviction and sentence.\u201d Wyatt does not say how this finding is erroneous or explain how success on his \u00a7 1983 claims would not call into question the legitimacy of his conviction for theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Finally, Wyatt has not addressed the district court\u2019s finding that he failed to identify any information in his background checks that was false. Accordingly, he has abandoned the issue, and we decline to address it. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. Wyatt\u2019s motions for the appointment of . counsel and relief from an outstanding warrant are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
