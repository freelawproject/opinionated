By moving to proceed IFP, Estes is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into a litigant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-22\">The Supreme Court has prescribed a two-step inquiry for a district court that is considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). The court must first determine whether a prisoner is eligible for a reduction as set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a). <em>Id. </em>If he is eligible, then the district court must \u201cconsider any applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors and determine whether, in its discretion,\u201d any reduction is warranted under the particular facts of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 827, 130 S.Ct. 2683. We review the decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-23\">The district court found Estes eligible for the reduction under Amendment 782 but declined to exercise its discretion to reduce his sentence, determining that relief was \u2022 unwarranted based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Dillon, </em>560 U.S. at 826, 130 S.Ct. 2683. Estes argues that he was automatically entitled to the sentencing reduction upon a finding that he was eligible, particularly as the Government had no objection. He urges that the district court was biased, exceeded its authority, and acted illegally in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, conclusionally asserting that the reasons offered by the district court for its denial were false and irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-24\">The record reflects that the district court considered Estes\u2019s motion as a whole, gave specific reasons for its denial, and referenced the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>tors. Estes thus cannot show an abuse of discretion on the district court\u2019s part. <em>See Henderson, </em>636 F.3d at 717; <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009). Estes\u2019s conclusional assertion that he was automatically entitled to a sentencing reduction is patently incorrect. <em>See Dillon, </em>560 U.S. at 826, 130 S.Ct. 2683; <em>see also United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009). His allegation of bias, which is based on the fact that his motion was denied, is unpersuasive. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Estes has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED. Additionally, because this appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b283-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
