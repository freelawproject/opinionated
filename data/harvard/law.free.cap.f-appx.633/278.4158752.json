In this appeal, Madrigal contends that the district court reversibly erred by imposing a 16-level \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) based on his 2003 conviction for possession of a controlled substance for sale in violation of California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11351 and his 2007 conviction for use of a communication facility to facilitate a felony drug offense in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-22\">Madrigal did not object to the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) enhancement in the district court, and thus our review of his arguments are for plain error. <em>See United States v. Henao-Melo, </em>591 F.3d 798, 801 (5th Cir.2009). To be plain, an \u2018\u201cerror must be clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable debate.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>564 F.3d 370, 377-78 (5th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-23\">Madrigal challenges the district court\u2019s characterization of his \u00a7 843(b) conviction as a drug trafficking offense on the ground that, under <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014 , 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), \u00a7 843(b) is an indivisible statute to which the modified categorical approach of <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), does not apply. Because the statute may be violated in ways that do not constitute a generic \u201cdrug trafficking of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>fense,\u201d he argues, a prior conviction under \u00a7 843(b) may never qualify as a drug trafficking offense for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Madrigal\u2019s argument that his \u00a7 843(b) conviction is not a drug trafficking offense relies only on an extension of the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Descamps. </em>Because it asserts a novel legal theory, the district court did not commit a clear or obvious error in failing to recognize it. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 671 (5th Cir.2009) (concluding that any error was not plain where argument was novel and not supported by circuit precedent). Since by its terms \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) need only be supported by a single drug trafficking conviction, Madrigal\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s reliance on his \u00a7 11351 conviction as an additional basis for the sentence enhancement need not be considered. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b310-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
