(\u201cDan-Bunkering\u201d), a Danish corporation, and Aries Shipping Co., Ltd. (\u201cAries\u201d), a Hong Kong corporation. Aries owns the M/V Centrans Demeter, IMO number 9445174 (\u201cthe Vessel\u201d), which is a sea vessel flagged under Hong Kong law. In June 2014, Dan-Bunkering brought suit <em>in rem </em>to enforce a maritime lien against the Vessel, which was arrested in Mobile, Alabama. As the Vessel\u2019s owner, Aries appeals the district court\u2019s October 2014 denial of its motion to vacate the arrest and dismiss Dan-Bunkering\u2019s suit, or in the alternative to reduce the security to be paid for the Vessel\u2019s release. Dan-Bunk-ering appeals the district court\u2019s March 2015 conditional dismissal of this action under the doctrine of <em>forum non conve-niens </em>and its denial of Dan-Bunkering\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">After careful review, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of this action under <em>forum non conveniens </em>and the denial of Dan-Bunkering\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We need not address Aries\u2019s alternative theory for dismissing the suit, which is that the Commercial Instruments and Maritime Lien Act (\u201cCIMLA\u201d), 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 31301-31343, does not grant a maritime lien in this case. And since the Letter of Undertaking (LOU) Aries paid for the Vessel\u2019s release was returned in July 2015 and the Vessel is no longer under arrest in Mobile, we hold that Aries\u2019s additional claims are moot.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">Underlying this dispute is a 2011 bunker supply agreement (\u201cBunker Contract\u201d) Dan-Bunkering entered into with the Vessel\u2019s charterer, Zhenhua International Shipping Co., Ltd. (\u201cZhenhua\u201d), a Chinese company. Aries chartered the Vessel to Zhenhua in November 2011 for a single voyage between Hong Kong and a port in Southeast Asia. Shortly after the charter agreement was executed, Zhenhua entered into the Bunker Contract with Dan-Bunk-ering, to which Aries was not party. Pursuant to the Bunker Contract\u2019s terms, Dan-Bunkering helped fuel the Vessel in the port of Hong Kong in November 2011. However, Dan-Bunkering alleges that Zhenhua breached the Bunker Contract because it never paid in full for Dan-Bunkering\u2019s services.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-11\">On June 26, 2014, Dan-Bunkering brought suit <em>in rem </em>to enforce a maritime lien against the Vessel to satisfy the unpaid balance of the Bunker Contract. Dan-Bunkering argued that its Terms and Conditions were incorporated into the Bunker Contract with Zhenhua, which allowed it to seek a maritime lien under U.S. law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court authorized the U.S. Marshal to arrest the Vessel when it arrived in Mobile, Alabama on July 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>2014.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Aries provided Dan-Bunkering with a LOU as substitute res in order to secure the release of the Vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Aries then moved to vacate the arrest of the Vessel and dismiss the suit, or in the alternative to release or reduce the security. In response, Dan-Bunkering moved for summary judgment on its maritime lien claim. The district court denied Aries\u2019s motions, then granted a stay of the summary judgment motion so the parties could submit supplemental briefing<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the choice-of-law issues underlying the case. The district court ultimately dismissed the action under the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens </em>on the condition that Aries submit itself to the jurisdiction of Hong Kong, and denied Dan-Bunkering\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The district court granted a 60-day stay of its dismissal order, but this Court declined to extend the stay pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">Maritime liens often raise conflict-of-laws issues, and the district court correctly identified one here. While the United States recognizes a maritime lien for necessaries, the other nations connected to this dispute \u2014 Denmark, China, and Hong Kong \u2014 do not. For U.S. law to apply, the choice-of-law clause in Dan-Bunkering\u2019s Terms and Conditions must have been validly incorporated into the Bunker Contract with Zhenhua. To determine which country\u2019s laws controlled the formation of the Bunker Contract, the district court applied the \u201cmost significant relationship\u201d test<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws factors.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court noted that: (1) the contract was negotiated in Hong Kong and China; (2) the port of Hong Kong was the place of performance; (3) Aries is a Hong Kong company; and (4) the Vessel is flagged under the laws of Hong Kong. It therefore found that Hong Kong law controlled issues of contract formation. The district court also found that the United States did not have a significant interest in applying its laws to the dispute. Dan-Bunkering does not challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Hong Kong law applies to the issues of contract formation raised by this case. It instead challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of the suit under the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens </em>after making that choice-of-law determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">We review a dismissal based on <em>forum non conveniens </em>for abuse of discretion, 'giving the district court \u201csubstantial deference.\u201d <em>Leon v. Millon Air, Inc., </em>251 F.3d 1305, 1310 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation omitted). We review findings of fact for clear error. <em>Szumlicz v. Norwegian Am. Line, Inc., </em>698 F.2d 1192, 1196 (11th Cir.1983). A party moving to dismiss on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens </em>must demonstrate: \u201c(1) that an adequate alternative forum is available; and (2) that the private and public interest factors weigh in favor of dismissal.\u201d <em>Republic of Pan. v. BCCI Holdings (Lux.) S.A., </em>119 F.3d 935, 951 (11th Cir.1997). The need to resolve and apply foreign law points us toward dismissal. Sig<em>alas v. Lido Mar., Inc., </em>776 F.2d 1512, 1519 (11th Cir.1985). And \u201c[b]ecause the central purpose of any <em>forum non conveniens </em>inquiry is to ensure that the trial is convenient, a foreign plaintiffs choice deserves less deference.\u201d <em>Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, </em>454 U.S. 235, 256, 102 S.Ct. 252, 266, 70 L.Ed.2d 419 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">We review the denial of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard used by the district court. <em>LaChance v. Duffy\u2019s Draft House, Inc., </em>146 F.3d 832, 834-35 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Hill v. Cundiff, </em>797 F.3d 948, 967 (11th Cir.2015) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">To dismiss an action for <em>forum non conveniens, </em>the district court must first ensure that there is an available alternative forum for the suit. <em>Leon, </em>251 F.3d at 1311. \u201cThe alternative forum prong of the analysis generally will be satisfied when the defendant is amenable to process in the other jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Satz v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., </em>244 F.3d 1279, 1283 (11th Cir.2001) (per curiam) (quotation omitted). To avoid prejudice to the plaintiffs, the district court can attach conditions to a dismissal to which the defendants must submit. <em>Ford v. Brown, </em>319 F.3d 1302, 1307 (11th Cir.2003). A conditional dismissal does not destroy the finality of the judgment. <em>Leon, </em>251 F.3d at 1316.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">The alternative forum must also be adequate. It is only in \u201crare circumstances\u201d where \u201cthe remedy offered by the other forum is clearly unsatisfactory\u201d that we will consider an alternative forum inadequate. <em>Aldana v. Del Monte Fresh Produce N.A., </em>578 F.3d 1283, 1290 (11th Cir.2009) (quotations omitted). A remedy is inadequate when it amounts to \u201cno remedy at all.\u201d <em>Piper Aircraft, </em>454 U.S. at 254, 102 S.Ct. at 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">Because it was unclear if Hong Kong retained jurisdiction over this suit, the district court conditioned dismissal on Aries\u2019s agreement to waive any statute of limitations or jurisdictional defenses. Aries has filed notice of its consent to these conditions. \u201c[W]e approve[] of conditional dismissals, in which the district court dismisses the case only if the defendant waives jurisdiction and limitations defenses, and only if it turns out that another court ultimately exercises jurisdiction over the case.\u201d <em>Ford, </em>319 F.3d at 1310. The district court did not err in ordering a conditional dismissal, and may reassert jurisdiction should Hong Kong refuse to entertain the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>Dan-Bunkering argues that this conditional dismissal does not render Hong Kong an \u201cadequate forum\u201d because Dan-Bunkering cannot pursue its <em>in rem </em>claim there. However, unavailability of a particular claim is not the same as \u201cno remedy at all.\u201d <em>Piper Aircraft, </em>454 U.S. at 254, 102 S.Ct. at 265. As the district court noted, there are a number of potential avenues to relief for Dan-Bunkering. A Hong Kong court may enforce Dan-Bunk-ering\u2019s choice-of-law clause, thus rendering a maritime lien available. Or it may find that Aries is bound to the contract under its principles of agency law. Since Aries has already submitted to Hong Kong jurisdiction, we conclude that Hong Kong is an available and adequate alternative forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">We also conclude that the public and private factors favor dismissal. The private factors include the availability of evidence; access to witnesses; ability to view the premises where the conduct occurred; \u201cand all other practical problems that make trial of a case easy, expeditious and inexpensive.\u201d <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, </em>330 U.S. 501, 508, 67 S.Ct. 839, 843, 91 L.Ed. 1055 (1947). The public factors include: court congestion generated by controversies unrelated to the forum; the desirability of having localized controversies decided at home; and the difficulty of applying foreign law. <em>Id. </em>at 508-09, 67 S.Ct. at 843. In addition, \u201cin deciding whether a case should be dismissed because a foreign jurisdiction is more suitable, federal courts necessarily must analyze the interest that the foreign country has in the dispute.\u201d <em>Esfeld v. Costa Crociere, S.P.A., </em>289 F.3d 1300, 1312 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Here, the relevant documents, parties, and witnesses are in Hong Kong, China, and Denmark. And Dan-Bunkering provided the bunker servicing to the Vessel in the port of Hong Kong. The only significant connection the- Vessel has with the United States is that it was arrested while in Alabama. That connection alone is insufficient to outweigh this suit\u2019s more extensive foreign connections.- Hong Kong has an interest in ensuring that parties doing business in its ports receive equitable treatment. In contrast, the United States has little interest in this suit. None of the parties are U.S. citizens and none of the relevant events occurred in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">If the district court were to retain this suit, it would have been required to apply Hong Kong contract law. <em>Forum non conveniens </em>dismissals \u201chelp courts avoid conducting complex exercises in comparative law.\u201d <em>Piper Aircraft, </em>454 U.S. at 251, 102 S.Ct. at 263. Here, the district court would have been called on to decide a number of issues according to Hong Kong law, including whether: (1) a contract was formed between Dan-Bunkering and Zhenhua; (2) Dan-Bunkering\u2019s choice-of-law clause was enforceable and validly incorporated into the contract; and (3) the Bunker Contract was binding on the Vessel. Although the application of foreign law does not require dismissal, it may support it. <em>Sigalas, </em>776 F.2d at 1519. Once the district court found that Hong Kong law governed the issue of contract formation, it did not abuse its discretion by conditionally dismissing this action based on <em>forum non conveniens. </em>We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s conditional dismissal of this action and its denial of Dan-Bunkering\u2019s motion for summary judgment,</p>\n<p id=\"b791-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-11\">Aries appeals the district court\u2019s denial of its motion to vacate the arrest and to dismiss Dan-Bunkering\u2019s suit, or in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>alternative to reduce the security to be paid for the Vessel\u2019s release. \u25a0 Since the LOU has been returned and we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal on the grounds of <em>forum non conveniens, </em>we dismiss Aries\u2019s appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED AS MOOT IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b788-6\">. Even though the Vessel has departed and the LOU has been returned, this Court still retains jurisdiction over this appeal. The Supreme Court has held that an appeal in an <em>in rem </em>civil forfeiture action is not mooted and \"the Court of Appeals is not divested of jurisdiction, by the prevailing party\u2019s transfer of the res from the district.\u201d <em>Republic Nat'l Bank of Miami v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 80, 88-89, 113 S.Ct. 554, 559-60, 121 L.Ed.2d 474 (1992). The departure of the res moots the case only if further proceedings would be \"useless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87, 113 S.Ct. at 559. The Supreme Court noted that a civil forfeiture proceeding under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881 \"conform[s] as near as may be to proceedings in admiralty,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 84, 113 S.Ct. at 557, and so this rule also applies to this <em>in rem </em>admiralty action,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b788-13\">.
