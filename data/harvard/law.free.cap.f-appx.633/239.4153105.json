As he did below, Ibarra argues that the district court erred when imposing a three-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) for acting as a manager or supervisor over the offense. Ibarra asserts that he worked under the direction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>of his brother, Jose Ibarra, and was given specific tasks to do. We review the determination that a defendant is a manager or supervisor under \u00a7 3B1.1(b) for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>756 F.3d 422, 435 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">A defendant\u2019s base offense level may be increased by three levels if the defendant was a manager or supervisor, rather than a leader or organizer, \u201cand the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d \u00a7 3B1.1(b). When determining whether this enhancement applies, we consider \u201cthe defendant\u2019s participation in planning, recruitment of accomplices, and exercise of control and authority over others.\u201d <em>Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>756 F.3d at 435 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Reagan, </em>725 F.3d 471, 494 (5th Cir.2013) (finding no clear error in assessing the enhancement where the defendant \u201chad planned and coordinated the structure of the conspiracy\u2019s takings[,] ... had recruited [a participant] into the conspiracy, and had exercised control and authority over others on a number of occasions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Ibarra has not demonstrated that the district court clearly erred when imposing the three-level enhancement. There was evidence that Ibarra was involved in planning the offense, helped recruit accomplices, and exercised some control and authority over other participants. <em>See Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>756 F.3d at 435; <em>Reagan, </em>725 F.3d at 494. Ibarra was present and actively involved when the operation was being planned or negotiated, routinely maintained contact with other participants, supplied money, and was involved in the transport of several individuals to the warehouse where they were to load marijuana onto a truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b271-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
