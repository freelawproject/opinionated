The district court found that, while the requested reduction was authorized under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 and Amendment 782, a sentence reduction was not warranted upon consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We generally review the district court\u2019s denial of the motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-23\">Salazar argues that the district court relied upon an improper factor in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, i.e., the state charges that were pending at the time of his original sentencing. He asserts that arrests alone are not reliable information for sentencing purposes and that the record contained no specific information about the facts or circumstances underlying the pending charges. We note that although' Salazar filed a motion for reconsideration in the district court, he did not raise the contention he raises now: that the district court relied upon \u201cbare\u201d arrest records in making its determination. We need not decide whether that failure alters the standard of review to plain error, because we find his challenge fails even under abuse of discretion review.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-24\">We also need not decide whether the bar against considering \u201cbare\u201d arrest records applies in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, <em>see United States v. Johnson, </em>648 F.3d 273, 276-278 (5th Cir.2011), or whether the unadjudicated charges listed in the PSR from the original sentencing hearing as \u201cpending charges\u201d were, in fact, \u201cbare\u201d arrest records, <em>see United States v. Harris, </em>702 F.3d 226, 229-31 (5th Cir.2012). Considered in context, the record reflects that the pending charges did not form the basis of the district court\u2019s decision to deny the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The district court instead relied on permissible factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense, the seriousness of the offense, public safety concerns, Salazar\u2019s history and characteristics, and the need for deterrence. The district court also considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>appropriate aspects of Salazar\u2019s criminal history (e.g., his prior convictions and his commission of the instant offense while on probation) and found that a reduction would not serve the goals of deterrence and punishment or protect the public. The district court did not discuss in detail Salazar\u2019s pending charges and instead simply noted that there were charges against him at the time of his sentencing for this offense. There is no indication that the mention of the pending charges had any bearing on the district court\u2019s decision to deny relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Salazar further contends that the district court gave excessive weight to his criminal history and. failed to consider that denying his.motion created unwarranted sentencing disparities. The district court gave due consideration to the arguments Salazar presented in favor of his motion and concluded that a reduction was not warranted in light of the \u00a7 3553 factors and the particular circumstances of the case. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995). Salazar\u2019s request that we weigh the factors anew is unavailing. His unwarranted-disparity argument is without merit because it amounts to a request that the court make a sentencing reduction mandatory when requested under amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>595 F.3d 1322, 1323 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying relief. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672; <em>Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d at 1010. Thus, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b299-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
