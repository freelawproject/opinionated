We vacate the district judge\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b743-15\">Tomlin has been tried, convicted, and sentenced to death for the 1977 murders of Richard Bru\u00f1e and Cheryl Moore four times. His first three convictions were reversed. His fourth conviction was affirmed, but his sentence was reduced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole by the Alabama Supreme Court. During state post-conviction proceedings, Tomlin argued unsuccessfully his life sentence without parole violated ex post facto and due process principles under the United States and Alabama Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-16\">On March 9, 2010, Tomlin filed a pro se \u00a7 2254 petition in district court. He argued his sentence of life imprisonment without parole was \u201cillegal,\u201d because the Alabama capital-murder statute applicable in his ease required the presence of a statutorily enumerated aggravating factor for him to be eligible for a death sentence or life imprisonment without the possibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>of parole.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> R. at 55. The aggravating circumstance on which his sentence was based, double-intentional murder, was not enumerated in the relevant provision. Without further explanation, he asserted his sentence violated his rights \u201cunder the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments (due process [and] equal protection of the law) as guaranteed in the United States Constitution.\u201d R. at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">In a reply to the state\u2019s response to his \u00a7 2254 petition, Tomlin argued (1) the Alabama legislature did not add double murder as an aggravating factor until 1999, after he had committed his crimes; and (2) consequently, using that factor to convict and sentence him to life without parole under the capital-murder statute violated ex post facto principles. After filing his reply, Tomlin requested leave to file a supplemental pleading based on our then-recent decision in <em>Magwood v. Warden, Ala. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>664 F.3d 1340 (11th Cir.2011). His supplemental pleading contained assertions his conviction violated the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the United States and Alabama Constitutions. Referencing <em>Magwood, </em>Tomlin argued his sentence violated the fair warning principle inherent in the Due Process Clause, because it was based on judicial constructions of the Alabama capital-murder statute that occurred after his crimes and was applied retroactively in his case. The district judge did not rule on Tomlin\u2019s motion to supplement.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">A magistrate judge issued a Report and Recommendation (\u201cR <em>&amp; </em>R\u201d), recommending Tomlin\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition be denied. The magistrate judge, however, did -not address the ex post facto and due process, fair warning claims presented in Tomlin\u2019s motion to supplement his \u00a7 2254 reply brief. In addressing the claim his sentence was illegal, because the aggravating circumstances on which it was based were not statutorily enumerated at the time of his crimes in Tomlin\u2019s initial \u00a7 2254 petition, the magistrate judge relied on the judicial expansion of the Alabama capital-murder statute in <em>Kyzer,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and the Supreme Court\u2019s recognition of the <em>Kyzer </em>holding in <em>Magwood v. Patterson, </em>561 U.S. 320, 130 S.Ct. 2788, 177 L.Ed.2d 592 (2010). The district judge adopted the R <em>&amp; </em>R.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">A judge of this court issued a certif\u00edcate of appealability on the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0y\">Whether the Alabama court\u2019s decision\u2014 that Tomlin\u2019s sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause \u2014 was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the United States Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">On appeal and represented by counsel, Tomlin argues his sentence of life without parole violates the <em>\u201cex post facto </em>principle of fair notice\u201d inherent in the Due Process Clause. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 47. The state responds Tomlin\u2019s claim is unexhausted, procedurally barred, and meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b744-12\">We review de novo a district judge\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>Davis v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>341 F.3d 1310, 1313 (11th Cir.2003). District judges must resolve all claims alleging a constitutional violation a habeas petitioner presents. <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>(en banc). We have explained we \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims whenever the district court has not resolved all such claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The district judge violated <em>Clisby, </em>because (1) Tomlin presented his constitutional claims of Ex Post Facto Clause and fair warning principle violations in his motion to supplement his \u00a7 2254 petition and his \u00a7 2254 reply brief; (2) the judge did not rule .on Tomlin\u2019s motion to supplement; and (3) the judge consequently did not address the merits of these claims in denying Tomlin\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>See id. </em>at 936, 938. In addition, the district judge did not address whether these claims were exhausted or procedurally barred. Therefore, we vacate the denial of Tomlin\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition without prejudice and remand with instructions for the district judge to (1) determine whether the ex post facto issues raised in Tomlin\u2019s \u00a7 2254 reply brief were properly before the judge; (2) if so, decide those issues; (3) issue a decision on Tomlin\u2019s motion to supplement his \u00a7 2254 petition; and (4) if the judge grants that motion, decide the ex post facto and due process, fair warning claims raised in Tomlin\u2019s proposed supplement. <em>See id. </em>at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b744-6\">.
