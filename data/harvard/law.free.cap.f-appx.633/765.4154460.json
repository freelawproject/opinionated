After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-25\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b797-26\">In 2007, Defendant pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). After he entered his guilty plea, the probation officer prepared Defendant\u2019s Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). The PSR indicated that Defendant was a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>had two prior convictions for crimes of violence. Because the statutory maximum for the present offense was 25 years or more, Defendant\u2019s career offender status resulted in an offense level of 34. The PSR applied a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b), resulting in a total offense level of 31. Given Defendant\u2019s numerous criminal convictions and status as a career offender, the PSR assigned a criminal history category of VI. Based on a total offense level of 31 and a criminal history category of VI, the PSR calculated Defendant\u2019s guideline range as 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Defendant did not file any objections to the PSR. The district court ultimately imposed a 212-month sentence, and Defendant did not file a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">In March 2015, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>considered whether Defendant was eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court concluded that, as a career offender, Defendant was ineligible for a sentence reduction. Defendant now appeals from that decision, arguing that he is entitled to a reduction under Amendment 782 because he was erroneously sentenced as a career offender. Because one of his predicate offenses was not a crime of violence, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 122, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009), he contends that his applicable guideline range should have been calculated pursuant to the drug quantity guidelines, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, not the career offender guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions on the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a term of imprisonment when the original sentencing range has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). To be eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a defendant must identify an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines that is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(d). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(l). A defendant is not eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if a guideline amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-14\">Amendment 782, which is listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(d) and which became effective November 1, 2014, reduced by two levels the base offense level for most drug offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(d); U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 782 (2014). Amendment 782 did not make any changes to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the career offender guideline. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C., Amend. 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-16\">When a defendant is sentenced as a career offender, his base offense level is determined under \u00a7 4B1.1, not under the Drug Quantity Table set forth in \u00a7 2D1.1(c). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1; <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir.2008). In <em>Moore, </em>we faced the question of whether defendants who were sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1 were eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief in light of Amendment 706, which like Amendment 782, lowered the \u00a7 2D1.1(c) base offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>levels for certain quantities of crack cocaine. 541 F.3d at 1325. We held that the defendants did not qualify for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because Amendment 706 had no effect on their applicable guideline ranges, which had been calculated under \u00a7 4B1.1 <em>Id. </em>at 1327-28, 1330. Likewise, in <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317 (11th Cir.2012), we concluded that <em>Moore </em>remained binding precedent and that Amendment 750 did not lower the guideline range for career offenders. <em>Id. </em>at 1321.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Here, the district court did not err when it concluded that Defendant was not eligible for a sentence reduction. Defendant\u2019s total offense level and applicable guideline range were not based on the drug quantity offense levels in \u00a7 2D1.1, but instead were based on the career\" offender level in \u00a7 4B1.1. Because Defendant\u2019s guideline range was not based on the drug quantity guidelines, Amendment 782 did not lower the sentencing range upon which Defendant\u2019s sentence was based. <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321; <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Although Defendant argues that he would be entitled to a sentence reduction if he had not been improperly sentenced as a career offender, he cannot challenge his career offender designation in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000) (stating that -in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding \u201conly the amended guideline is changed. All other guideline application decisions made during the original sentencing remain intact\u201d). Accordingly, the district court committed no error in concluding that Defendant was ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b798-8\">. Without the career offender designation, the PSR indicated that Defendant's base offense level would have been 26, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1(c)(7), and that Defendant would have been subject to a 2-level enhancement for possession of a firearm, pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
