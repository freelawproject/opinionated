The PSI applied a 16 level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), because Mr. Olguin-Zarate had been convicted in 1999 of lewd or lascivious exhibition, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(7)(a), a crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines. According to the PSI, Mr. Olguin-Zarate stopped his car near two minors and asked them a question while fondling his exposed penis. He repeated the conduct approximately 30 minutes later and, about a month thereafter, he returned to the same location and drove slowly past one of the original victims, again exposing himself. The victim identified him to police, and he was arrested and convicted. The PSI also applied a three level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, bringing Mr. Olguin-Zarate\u2019s total offense level to 21. With a criminal history category of V, the PSI calculated a guidelines range of 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-13\">Mr. Olguin-Zarate objected to the 16 level enhancement, arguing that his 1999 conviction was not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. He conceded that this Court held in <em>United States v. Padilla-Reyes, </em>247 F.3d 1158, 1163-64 (11th Cir.2001), that a violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04 qualified for \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d and therefore categorically was a violent felony under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. But he argued that <em>Padillar-Reyes\u2019s </em>holding did not apply here because that case involved a conviction for an actual assault and his did not. The district court overruled the objection and adopted the PSI\u2019s calculations but varied downward and sentenced Mr. Olguin-Zarate to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-14\">This is Mr. Olguin-Zarate\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-16\">Mr. Olguin-Zarate raises four issues on appeal. Two, he concedes, squarely are foreclosed by circuit precedent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>we are bound to follow that precedent unless and until it is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court, we acknowledge that he has preserved the challenges but do not address them further. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>342 F.3d 1245, 1246 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008) (noting that, although a decision of the Supreme Court may overrule or abrogate prior panel precedent, such a decision \u201cmust be clearly on point\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). We address here Mr. Olguin-Zarate\u2019s two challenges that are not foreclosed by our precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">First, he argues that the district court erred in applying a 16 level enhancement based on his 1999 conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(7)(a), which criminalizes intentionally masturbating or \u201cexposing] the genitals in a lewd or lascivious manner\u201d in the presence of a victim who is less than sixteen years of age.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because he preserved his challenge by advancing it below, we review this claim <em>de novo. See United States v. Harris, </em>586 F.3d 1283, 1284 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The guidelines impose this enhancement if the defendant \u201cwas deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, after ... a conviction for a felony that is ,.. a crime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). The guidelines define \u201ccrime of violence\u201d to include, among other offenses, \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>comment. (n.1(b)(iii)). In <em>Padilla-Reyes, </em>we held that a conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04 as codified in 1987 constituted \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 even though the Florida statute encompassed acts involving no physical contact with the victim. 247 F.3d at 1162-64 &amp; n. 4.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This holding was not, as Mr. Olguin-Zarate contends, bound to the fact that a different subsection of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04 may have been implicated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, \u201c[w]e recognized [in <em>Padilla-</em>Reyes] that violations of \u00a7 800.04 might not involve any physical contact with the victim, but concluded that <em>all possible violations </em>involve the misuse or maltreatment of a child for sexual gratification, and, thus, constitute \u2018sexual abuse of a minor.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Cortes-Salazar, </em>682 F.3d 953, 955 (11th Cir.2012) (emphasis added) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">We also reject Mr. Olguin-Zarate\u2019s assertion that the holding of <em>Padillcp-Reyes </em>must be revisited in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013). In <em>Descamps, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>Supreme Court concluded that, when every possible offense under a statute does not match the generic definition of a qualifying violent felony offense, the sentencing court must determine whether the statute is divisible or not and, if not, must conclude that the offense does not qualify as a crime of violence. <em>Id. </em>at 2281-82. Here, because \u201call possible violations\u201d of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04 qualify as sexual abuse of a minor, the divisibility analysis of <em>Des-camps </em>is not implicated, and our holding in <em>Padilla-Reyes </em>remains intact. <em>Cortes-Salazar, </em>682 F.3d at 955. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s imposition of the 16 level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Second, Mr. Olguin-Zarate contends that using his prior conviction to increase both his criminal history category and his offense level violated the Double Jeopardy Clause and constituted impermissible double counting. He failed to make this argument to the district court, so we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mozie, 752 </em>F.3d 1271, 1290 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 422, 190 L.Ed.2d 305 (2014). We therefore may reverse on this ground only if we find (1) error (2) that is plain and (3) affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and then only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Ramirez-Flores, </em>743 F.3d 816, 821 (11th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 948, 190 L.Ed.2d 843 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">We find no error, plain or otherwise, in the district court\u2019s use of Mr. Olguin-Zarate\u2019s previous conviction to determine both his total offense level and his criminal history category. In the sentencing context, the Double Jeopardy Clause \u201cdoes no more than prevent the sentencing court from prescribing greater punishment than the legislature intended.\u201d <em>Garrett v. United States, </em>471 U.S. 773, 793, 105 S.Ct. 2407, 85 L.Ed.2d 764 (1985). Similarly, \u201cdouble counting\u201d a conviction in the manner the district court did here is permissible if the U.S. Sentencing Commission intended such a result. <em>United States v. Adeleke, </em>968 F.2d 1159, 1161 (11th Cir.1992). \u201cThe Commission clearly intended prior felonies to count against defendants both under the criminal history section and [U.S.S.G.] \u00a7 2L1.2.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, commentary to that guideline indicates that \u201c[a] conviction taken into account under subsection (b)(1) is not excluded from consideration of whether that conviction receives criminal history points.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 comment. (n(6)). \u201c[A]nd this result is permissible\u201d because \u201c[t]he criminal history section is designed to punish likely recidivists more severely, while the enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2 is designed to deter aliens who.have been convicted of a felony from re-entering the United States.\u201d <em>Adeleke, </em>968 F.2d at 1161. Because the district court\u2019s counting did not result in a greater punishment than the Sentencing Commission intended, the calculation did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause or constitute impermissible double counting.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-12\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm Mr. Olguin-Zarate\u2019s sentence. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b808-11\">. Mr. Olguin-Zarate contends that the definition of \"sexual abuse of a minor\u201d adopted by this Court in <em>Padilla-Reyes </em>is overbroad, but that case \u201cremains binding precedent.\u201d <em>United States v. Cortes-Salazar, </em>682 F.3d 953, 955-56 (11th Cir.2012). He also argues that the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights by using his prior conviction, Which was neither charged in the indictment nor proven to a jury, to increase the statutory maximum penalty he faced. But the Supreme Court has held that the fact of a prior conviction need not be charged in the indictment nor found by a jury. <em>See Almenda-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number><em>rez-Torres </em>v. <em>United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b809-8\">. The version of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(7)(a) in place at the time Mr. Olguin-Zarate was convicted is identical to the subsection now in effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b809-9\">. We noted in <em>United States v. Cortes-Salazar </em>that, although the amended version of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04 \"differ[s] slightly from the version discussed in <em>Padilla-Reyes, </em>the elements of [the] offense [are] identical to the elements of the offense in 1987.\u201d 682 F.3d at 955.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b809-10\">. We did not specify the subsection under which Mr. Padilla-Reyes was convicted, but Mr. Olguin-Zarate suggests that the conviction was for \"lewd assault,\u201d rather than exhibition, citing some language in <em>Padilla-Reyes </em>using the term \"assault.\u201d We are unconvinced by this reading of our precedent. The version of the statute under which Mr. Padilla-Reyes was convicted merely included the word \u201cassault\u201d in its introductory heading. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04 (1987) (\u201cLewd, lascivious, or indecent assault or act upon or in presence of child; sexual battery\u201d). As we emphasized in <em>Cortes-Salazar, </em>the 1987 statute is identical in meaning to the one under which Mr. Olguin-Zarate was convicted. <em>See supra </em>n.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
