Mango appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in assessing his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X3.1 pursuant to the cross-reference in \u00a7 2J1.2(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-23\">Specifically, Mango contends that this court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 2X3.1, comment. (n.1) in <em>United States v. Kimbrough, </em>536 F.3d 463, 467 (5th Cir.2008), and <em>United States v. Cihak, </em>137 F.3d 252, 264 (5th Cir.1998), relied on an interpretative rule known as the last antecedent rule and that <em>Kimbrough </em>and <em>Cihak </em>should be reconsidered in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s comments about the last antecedent rule in <em>Paroline v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 1710, 1721, 188 L.Ed.2d 714 (2014). According to Mango, interpreting \u00a7 2X3.1, comment. (n.1) based on the last antecedent rule also conflicts with the rules and policies governing relevant conduct under \u00a7 1B1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-26\">The district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Guidelines is ordinarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>reviewed de novo. <em>Kimbrough, </em>536 F.3d at 465. However, plain error review applies here because Mango\u2019s objections in the district court were insufficient to alert the district court of his instant argument regarding <em>Paroline </em>and the last antecedent rule. <em>See United States v. Guerrero-Robledo, </em>565 F.3d 940, 946 (5th Cir.2009). In any event, his argument fails even under de novo review because <em>Paroline\u2019s </em>comments about the last antecedent rule do not undermine this court\u2019s decisions in <em>Kimbrough </em>and <em>Cihak.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">This court explained its interpretation of \u00a7 2X3.1, comment. (n.1) in <em>Kimbrough, </em>536 F.3d at 466-68, and <em>Paroline </em>does not call that interpretation into doubt. Under the rule of orderliness, we follow a prior decision unless there is an intervening change in law; that intervening change must be \u201cunequivocal, not a mere hint\u201d of a likely Supreme Court ruling. <em>United States v. Fields, </em>777 F.3d 799, 807 (5th Cir.2015)(rejecting argument that Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of one statute would overrule Fifth Circuit precedent construing a different statute)(internal citations and quotation marks omitted). <em>Kimbrough </em>and <em>Cihak </em>control in this case. <em>See United States v. Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d 303, 313 <em>&amp; </em>n. 34 (5th Cir.2002)(\u201cmere ruminations\u201d in Court opinions do not permit overruling of prior precedent by a panel).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b289-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
