He argues that he should have been convicted and sentenced under \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and urges the court to vacate his conviction and sentence, reform the judgment to reflect a conviction under. \u00a7 1326(b)(1), and remand the case for resentencing. In the alternative, he asks the court to remand the case to the district court for reformation of the judgment to reflect a conviction under \u00a7 1326(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Maldonado-Villeda concedes that our review is limited to plain error given his failure to raise an objection before the district court. Under the plain-error standard, a defendant must show a clear or obvious error that affected his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). This court has discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Maldonado-Villeda\u2019s 2010 conviction for third-degree robbery in New York is not an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1326(b)(2) because he was sentenced to a prison term of less than one year. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F), (G). As such, Maldonado-Villeda should have been convicted and sentenced under \u00a7 1326(b)(1). Consequently, the district court committed a clear or obvious error when it entered a judgment incorrectly describing the offense of conviction as one for being an \u201calien unlawfully found in the United States after deportation, having previously been convicted of an aggravated felony.\u201d But as Maldonado-Villeda correctly acknowledges, he cannot show that the error affected his substantial rights given this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 369 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">As in <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>there is no record evidence in this case that the district court\u2019s incorrect understanding of the statutory maximum affected its. sentence selection. <em>See id. </em>And like the defendant in <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>Maldonado-Villeda\u2019s 41-month sentence is \u201cwithin a properly calculated Guidelines range and below the statutory maximum\u201d under \u00a7 1326(b)(2). <em>See id. </em>As such, remand for resentencing is not required. The judgment should be changed to correctly identify the offense of conviction, and the Government says we should remand for that limited purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-14\">Maldonado-Villeda\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED, but we REMAND this case to the district court for the limited purpose of correcting the written judgment to reflect the correct offense of conviction as under \u00a7 1326(b)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b276-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
