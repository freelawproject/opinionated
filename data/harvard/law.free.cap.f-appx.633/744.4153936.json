One of its drivers was seriously injured in May 2012 at IPSCO\u2019s Pennsylvania facility while securing a load of pipes on his truck. About a year later, the driver\u2019s legal guardian filed a lawsuit in Pennsylvania state court raising claims against IPSCO for negligence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> IPSCO joined Madd as a third-party defendant, claiming that Madd negligently trained and supervised its driver and was therefore liable (either solely or jointly and severally). Madd notified Progressive of the lawsuit, asserting that its commercial auto insurance policy required Progressive to defend it.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">Progressive filed a declaratory judgment action in the district court, contending that it had no' duty to defend or indemnify Madd under the policy. Progressive asserted that the policy\u2019s \u201cemployee exclusion\u201d \u2014 which provides that its coverage (including the duty to defend) does not apply to bodily injury to Madd\u2019s \u201cemployees\u201d \u2014 relieved it from defending or indemnifying Madd. Madd and IPSCO asserted that the employee exclusion was inapplicable because the driver was an independent contractor, not an employee (or, at the very least, that the question of his employment status should be resolved in the Pennsylvania state court lawsuit).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The policy does not define the term \u201cemployee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-14\">The district court found that Progressive did not have a duty to defend or indemnify Madd under the policy. It noted that Madd is an interstate motor carrier subject to federal motor carrier regulations and that the policy was drafted in accordance with those regulations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under those regulations, the term \u201cemployee\u201d includes \u201can independent contractor in the course of operating a commercial motor vehicle.\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 390.5 (2015). Applying that definition to the policy, the court found that even if the driver was an independent contractor, he was still an \u201cemployee\u201d under the employee exclusion. The court therefore granted summary judgment to Progressive. This is Madd and IPSCO\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>DeLong Equip. Co. v. Wash. Mills Abrasive Co., </em>887 F.2d 1499, 1505 (11th Cir.1989). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate only if the pleadings and evidence in the record demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to any issue and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>The parties agree that Georgia law applies to this case. Under Georgia law, \u201ccontracts of insurance are interpreted by ordinary rules of contract construction.\u201d <em>Lavoi Corp. v. Nat\u2019l Fire Ins. of Hartford, </em>293 Ga.App. 142, 666 S.E.2d 387, 391 (2008). \u201cIf the facts as alleged in the complaint even arguably bring the occurrence within the policy\u2019s coverage, the insurer has a duty to defend the action.\u201d <em>Hoover v. Maxum Indem. Co., 291 </em>Ga. 402, 730 S.E.2d 413, 418 (2012) (quotation marks omitted). IPSCO alleged in its complaint that the driver was an independent contractor. Whether that complaint requires Progressive to defend Madd in the Pennsylvania lawsuit depends on whether independent contractors qualify as \u201cemployees\u201d under the policy\u2019s employee exclusion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Although the policy itself does not define \u201cemployee,\u201d it is subject to federal motor carrier regulations that do define that term. <em>See </em>49 C.P.R. \u00a7 387.7(a) (2009) (stating that no motor carrier shall operate a vehicle until it has obtained the required level of insurance). In particular, the policy includes the federally mandated \u201cMCS-90 Endorsement.\u201d <em>See </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 387.1-387.15 (2014). We must construe the policy\u2019s \u201cterms and conditions ... as amplified, extended, or modified\u201d by that endorsement. Ga.Code \u00a7 33-24-16; <em>see also Aequicap Ins. Co. v. Canal Ins. Co., </em>303 Ga.App. 508, 693 S.E.2d 863, 866-68 (2010) (using federal motor carrier regulations and an MCS-90 endorsement to interpret an insurance policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">The endorsement provides that the policy\u2019s insurance \u201cdoes not apply to injury to or death of the insured\u2019s <em>employees </em>while engaged in the course of their .employment\u201d (emphasis added). Under the regulations that govern the endorsement, \u201cemployee\u201d includes \u201can independent contractor while in the course of operating a commercial motor vehicle.\u201d 49 .C.F.R. \u00a7 390.5 (2015).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Not only does that definition of \u201cemployee\u201d modify the policy\u2019s employee exclusion, <em>see </em>Ga.Code \u00a7 33-24-16, but there is also no indication that the term \u201cemployee\u201d is used differently in the endorsement than in the employee exclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>sion. Section 390.5\u2019s definition of \u201cemployee\u201d therefore supplies the definition of that term in the employee exclusion. <em>See Lavoi Corp., </em>666 S.E.2d at 391 (stating that contracts should be construed so that \u201ceach provision is ., given effect and interpreted so as to harmonize with the others.\u201d). And because the employee exclusion applies, Progressive is relieved from its obligations. <em>See Consumers Cty. Mut. Ins. Co. v. P.W. &amp; Sons Trucking, Inc., </em>307 F.3d 362, 364-66 (5th Cir.2002) (concluding that the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d in \u00a7 390.5 supplied the meaning of the term \u201cemployee\u201d for an insurance policy\u2019s employee exclusion, thereby relieving the insurer of the duty to defend).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b777-10\">. Vickie Robinson, the driver's legal guardian, has not made an appearance in this declaratory judgment action and is currently in default.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b777-11\">. The parties raised several other arguments in the district court concerning whether the policy\u2019s terms relieve Progressive from its obligations, but on appeal they focus on the employee exclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b777-17\">.The federal motor carrier regulations are \"applicable to all employers, employees, and commercial motor vehicles, which transport property or passengers in interstate commerce.\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 390.3(a) (2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b778-5\">. IPSCO contends that we should dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the issue of whether Progressive must indemnify Madd is not ripe for adjudication until Madd is held liable (if at all) in the Pennsylvania lawsuit. However, Progressive asserts that it does not have a duty to <em>defend </em>Madd, and the issue of the insured's \"ultimate liability ... is irrelevant to the question of whether the insurer [is] obligated to defend the insured[] in [a] tort action.\u201d <em>Penn-America Ins. Co. v. Disabled Am. Veterans, Inc., </em>224 Ga.App. 557, 481 S.E.2d 850, 852 (1997); <em>cf. Edwards v. Sharkey, </em>747 F.2d 684, 686-87 (11th Cir.1984) (\"[A] case or controversy exists to support declaratory relief between an injured third party and an insurance company even in the absence of a judgment in favor of the third party against the insured.\u201d). And if the policy\u2019s employee exclusion applies, it relieves Progressive of all of its obligations under the policy. Alternatively, IPSCO contends that we should stay the case until the outcome of the Pennsylvania lawsuit. It argues that deciding whether the driver was an \"employee\u201d under the employee exclusion creates the risk of inconsistent judgments. That argument is meritless because our decision has no bearing on whether the driver was an independent contractor under Pennsylvania law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b778-11\">. The driver was attempting to secure a load of pipes on the truck when the accident took place. As the district court noted, IPSCO and Madd did not raise the issue of whether the driver was actually \"operating\u201d the vehicle within the meaning of \u00a7 390.5 since he was not driving it when the accident occurred. The district court therefore declined to reach that issue, as do we. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004) (\"This Court has repeatedly held that an issue not raised in the district court and raised for the first time in an appeal will not be considered by this court.\") (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
