Dhuka asserts the IJ and BIA erred in determining he was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-16\">Credibility determinations \u201cmust be supported by specific and cogent reasons derived from the record\u201d. <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 537 (5th Cir.2009). Because the BIA considered the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, both the BIA and IJ decisions are reviewed. <em>Shaikh v. Holder, </em>588 F.3d 861, 863 (5th Cir.2009). In that regard, \u201c[w]e defer ... to an IJ\u2019s.credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling\u201d. <em>Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-21\">In this instance, the IJ and the BIA gave such \u201cspecific and cogent reasons\u201d to support the adverse credibility determination. Although Dhuka attributed the inconsistencies' in his testimony to his mental suffering and fear, and to advice received from detainees at the detention center, the absence of corroborating evidence in the record does not compel a different conclusion regarding Dhuka\u2019s lack of credibility. Furthermore, the decision to deny relief from removal was based upon a credibility decision; consequently, we need not address Dhuka\u2019s claims that he otherwise established eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. <em>See Chun v. I.N.S., </em>40 F.3d 76, 78-79 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b268-17\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
