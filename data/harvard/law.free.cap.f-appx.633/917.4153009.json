To finance the purchase, he took out two loans from Wells Fargo and executed two security deeds in Wells\u2019s favor. Several years later Wells assigned the first security deed to Bank of America. In April 2014 Bank of America (as creditor) and Wells (as servicer) sent Elliott a notice contemplating a foreclosure sale in June 2014. Elliott filed suit in state court in May against both Wells and Bank of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>After defendants removed Elliott\u2019s suit to federal court, they moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). A magistrate judge recommended granting defendants\u2019 motion, and the district court adopted the R <em>&amp; </em>R and dismissed Elliott\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Elliott makes only two arguments on appeal. He says the district court erred by dismissing his attempted-wrongful-foreclosure claim and his claims of violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Reviewing the dismissal <em>de novo </em>and accepting Elliott\u2019s factual allegations as true, we affirm. <em>See Speaker v. U.S. Dep't of Health &amp; Human Servs. Ctrs. for Disease Control &amp; Prevention, </em>623 F.3d 1371, 1379 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">\n<em>Attempted Wrongful Foreclosure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">In Georgia, \u201cto recover damages for a wrongful attempted foreclosure, the plaintiff must prove a knowing and intentional publication of untrue and derogatoiy information concerning the debtor\u2019s financial condition, and that damages were sustained as a direct result of this publication.\u201d <em>Bates v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA </em>768 F.3d 1126, 1134 (11th Cir.2014) (alteration adopted) (emphasis omitted) (quoting <em>Aetna Fin. Co. v. Culpepper, </em>171 Ga.App. 315, 320 S.E.2d 228, 232 (1984)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">Elliott insists that he has proved as much. He says the foreclosure notice contained \u201cuntrue and derogatory statements concerning [his] financial condition[ ],\u201d <em>id., </em>because it falsely stated that he had defaulted under the terms of the security deed. But Elliott never alleged that he was not, in fact, in default.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> All he alleged is that defendants breached the terms of the security deeds by failing to give him 30 days\u2019 notice and an opportunity to cure his default before accelerating. But these rights \u2014 notice and an opportunity to <em>cure </em>\u2014 presuppose <em>a default. </em>Whether defendants properly accelerated the debt is irrelevant to Elliott\u2019s attempted-wrongful-foreclosure claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>In the district court Elliott argued something different. He pointed to a technical error in the deeds\u2019 legal description of his property and argued that this error rendered defendants\u2019 security interest void. The deeds correctly described the street address, lot number, land lot, subdivision name, county, and district, as well as the subdivision\u2019s plat map. But their descriptions said the plat map was recorded in plat book 268, pages 140-145, when in fact the map was in book 273, pages 90-94. (This incorrect citation to the plat book was the only error in the deeds.) Elliott argued this technical error meant that defendants in fact had no valid security interest in his property, and therefore had no right to foreclose \u2014 making any statements to the contrary \u201cuntrue\u201d statements, <em>Bates, </em>768 F.3d at 1134, that could support his attempted-wrongful-foreclosure claim. Similarly, if the deeds were void, Elliott said he could not have been in default, so the defendants\u2019 statement to the contrary in the foreclosure notice was also untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">We cannot agree. The legal description, while not 100% accurate, was plenty sufficient to convey the property and a security interest. As the magistrate judge explained, \u201c[perfection in legal descriptions of tracts of land is not required\u201d so long as the deed \u201cdiscloses with sufficient certainty\u2019 the grantor\u2019s intention to convey certain property. <em>Wisener v. Gulledge, </em>251 Ga. 419, 306 S.E.2d 642, 643 (1983) (quotation omitted). A faulty description voids a deed only if it is \u201cso vague and indefinite as to afford no means of identifying any particular tract of land.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The deeds here do not come close to meeting that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-9\">In keeping with this principle, Georgia courts have rejected similar challenges to deeds containing minor technical errors where, as here, the description otherwise adequately describes the subject property. <em>See, e.g., Ceasar v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>322 Ga.App. 529, 744 S.E.2d 369, 373 (2013) (erroneous lot number but correct address, land lot, district, and plat). This alternate theory of attempted wrongful foreclosure, which in any event Elliott advances only tangentially on appeal, is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">\n<em>Fair Debt Collection Practices Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">Elliott\u2019s FDCPA claims must fail because they too rest on this unavailing premise. He insists defendants violated the FDCPA when they falsely represented that they had the right to foreclose on his property. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e (prohibiting the use of \u201cfalse ... representation[s]\u201d to collect a debt). He maintains that their representations were false because the technical error in the legal description of his property voided their interest. But as we\u2019ve explained, under Georgia law this minor imperfection in the legal description did not invalidate the security deeds. <em>See Wisener, </em>306 S.E.2d at 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b950-7\">. Indeed, in his briefing in response to the R &amp; R Elliott specifically disavowed any allegation that he was not in default: \"This action is <em>not an action concerning whether Plaintiff defaulted on his mortgage loan </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b950-8\">. Elliott appears to confuse his attempted-wrongful-foreclosure claim with one for (completed) wrongful foreclosure or breach of contract. It is true that a premature or erroneous acceleration of a security deed \u2014 Elliott's principal contention on appeal \u2014 may give rise to wrongful foreclosure or breach of contract claims. Elliott cited cases so holding. <em>See BAC Home Loans Servicing, L.P. v. Wedereit, </em>328 Ga.App. 566, 759 S.E.2d 867, 872 (2014) (\"[Pjremature acceleration of a loan can give rise to a claim for <em>wrongful foreclosure.\" </em>(emphasis added)), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>297 Ga. 313, 773 S.E.2d 711 (2015); <em>id. </em>at 872-73 (affirming summary judgment for plaintiff on <em>breach of contract </em>claim based on premature acceleration and failure to give proper notice of default). But Elliott did not bring a wrongful foreclosure claim. Nor could he, because there has been no foreclosure sale. <em>See Culpepper, </em>320 S.E.2d at 232 (explaining that without a sale of the property there can be no damages that give rise to a wrongful foreclosure claim). Neither did he bring a breach of contract claim. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b950-12\">Elliott does cite a case that he says supports his attempted-wrongful-foreclosure claim, but it is readily distinguishable. In <em>Hauf v. HomeQ Servicing Corp., </em>2007 WL 486699 (M.D.Ga. Feb, 9, 2007) (unpublished), it was undisputed that the mortgagors were <em>not </em>in default. <em>See id. </em>at *6. So when the mortgagee published a notice stating that they <em>were </em>in default, it made an \u201cuntrue\u201d statement, <em>Bates, </em>768 F.3d at 1134, that could give rise to an attempted-wrongful-foreclosure claim, <em>See Hauf, </em>2007 WL 486699, at *6 (\"The Haufs have shown that Defendants published untrue and derogatory information about their financial condition. It is undisputed that the Haufs were not in default on the Loan in 2005. It is further undisputed that Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>dants published a \u2018Notice of Sale Under Power' that stated that the Haufs' Loan is \u2018hereby-declared due because of default under the terms of said [Loan], including but not limited to the nonpayment of the indebtedness as and when due.' \u201d). But Elliott does not allege that he was not in default; he insists only that the acceleration was premature.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
