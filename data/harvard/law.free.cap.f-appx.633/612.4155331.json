Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence if he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that subsequently was lowered by the Sentencing Commission. Amendment 782 did not reduce Salter\u2019s guidelines sentencing range, and so he was ineligible for a sentencing reduction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2) &amp; comment. (n.1(A)); <em>United States v. Bowman, </em>632 F.3d 906, 910-11 (5th Cir.2011). Moreover, he has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion in determining that the seriousness of Salter\u2019s offense and the need to protect the public did not warrant a sentence below the varied sentence that he received. <em>See United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Salter\u2019s appeal does not present a non-frivolous issue and has not been brought in good faith. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). The motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 n. 24 (5th Cir.1997); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b644-5\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
