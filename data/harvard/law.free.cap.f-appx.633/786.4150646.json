Ms. Ollivier contends that the BIA and IJ abused their discretion because their adverse credibility findings were not supported by specific, cogent reasons or by substantial evidence. Following review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-21\">We review factual determinations, including credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence test and must affirm the decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1254-55 (11th Cir.2006). When applying for asylum or withholding of removal, an applicant\u2019s testimony, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof, even without corroborating evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 1255. Conversely, if an applicant relies solely on her testimony, an adverse credibility determination may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>sufficient by itself to support the denial of an application. <em>See Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">Pursuant to the REAL ID Act, a credibility determination may be based on the totality of the circumstances, including (1) the demeanor, candor, and responsiveness of the applicant; (2) the plausibility of the applicant\u2019s account; (3) the consistency between the applicant\u2019s written and oral statements; (4) the internal consistency of each statement; and (5) the consistency of the applicant\u2019s statements with other record evidence. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(l)(B)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Moreover, an adverse credibility determination may be based on inconsistencies, inaccuracies, or falsehoods, regardless of whether they relate to the heart of an applicant\u2019s claim. <em>Id. </em>When the IJ makes an adverse credibility finding, the burden is on the applicant to demonstrate that the decision was not supported by \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d or was not based on substantial evidence. <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1255.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">In this case, both the BIA and the IJ gave specific, cogent reasons to support the adverse credibility finding. First, Ms. Ollivier gave conflicting statements in her asylum interview and at the merits hearing regarding when she left her job. Second, Ms. Ollivier was inconsistent in her description of the duration and the route she took in her flight from Haiti to the Dominican Republic. Finally, in her supplemental statement and her asylum interview, Ms. Ollivier failed to mention her mother\u2019s beating from the chain of events that propelled her forced exodus from Haiti.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">The record, as a whole, does not compel a finding that Ms. Ollivier was credible. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s conclusion that, in light .of the adverse credibility finding, Ms. Ollivier failed to meet her burden of proving eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">Thus, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b818-15\">. Ms. Ollivier\u2019s last name appeared in the administrative proceedings and in her opening brief as \"Ollivier;\u201d but, her surname appears to have been docketed as \"Olliver,\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
