Esparza challenges the denial of his motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Amendment 782 to the Guidelines (retroactive application of lowered offense levels under the drug-trafficking guideline). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. The district court considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the specific circumstances of the matter, and declined to exercise its discretion to reduce Esparza\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">The denial of such relief is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Eg., United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). Sentencing \u201creductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are not mandatory ... [and] merely give[ ] the district court discretion to reduce a sentence under limited circumstances\u201d. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.2009). If the court gave due consideration to the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, there is no abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Esparza contends: the court gave excessive weight to the manner in which his crime was committed; failed to give adequate weight to mitigating factors; and erred in determining that a reduced sentence would not address the relevant sentencing objectives. He further asserts the court failed to take into account that denial of relief would result in unwarranted sentencing disparities among similarly situated defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The court gave due consideration to Es-parza\u2019s motion and, as reflected in its stated reasons for the denial, determined a reduction was not merited in the light of the \u00a7 3553 factors and the circumstances of the case. <em>See id. </em>The court noted, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe fraudulent and sophisticated means that [Esparza] used to smuggle ... marijuana into the country, by using a \u2018cloned\u2019 [Border Patrol] vehicle and wearing clothes similar to ... a [Border Patrol] agent\u201d were extraordinary, and increased the seriousness of his offense. Moreover, it found a sentence reduction would: diminish the seriousness of that offense; fail to provide sufficient punishment; and not protect the public from Esparza\u2019s future crimes. <em>See id. </em>at 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Therefore, the court relied upon permissible factors in determining a reduction was not justified. Accordingly, Esparza has not shown the requisite abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b295-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47,5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
