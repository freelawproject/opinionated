The district court determined that Curtis was eligible for the reduction, but it denied the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and it also denied Curtis\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Curtis now seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his motions. We construe Curtis\u2019s motion as a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">We review the decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011). A district court abuses its discretion if it bases its decision on an error of law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The district court did not make new Guidelines determinations in denying Curtis\u2019s motion; nor did it punish him twice for the same offense. Albeit implicitly, the court began by determining that Curtis was eligible for the reduction, and by determining his amended Guideline range. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). The court then exercised its discretion to conclude that a reduction was not warranted under the particular circumstances of the case, taking into account the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>Id. </em>at 827, 130 S.Ct. 2683. Curtis\u2019s contention that the district court was obliged to sentence him at the bottom of the amended Guideline range is without merit. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009) (noting that a district court is not obliged to grant \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief). Finally, although the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 directs that a district court may consider post-sentencing behavior in determining whether a reduction is warranted, the decision whether to grant the reduction is discretionary. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">In sum, Curtis has not shown that the district court committed legal error, or that it abused its discretion in denying his motion. <em>See Henderson, </em>636 F.3d at 717. Because the appeal is without arguable merit, Curtis\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b304-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir, R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
