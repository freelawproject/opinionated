By moving to proceed IFP, Saldivar is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that her appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">Saldivar contends that, despite her career criminal status, she is entitled to a sentence reduction under Amendment 782 based on the same 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors that supported the district court\u2019s imposition of a downward variance. We review the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">The record reflects that Saldivar was not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction under Amendment 782 because, as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, she was not sentenced based on a guidelines range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790-91 (5th Cir.2009); \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Anderson, </em>591 F.3d at 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-15\">This appeal does not present a nonfrivo-lous issue. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Sal-divar\u2019s IFP motion is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b275-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
