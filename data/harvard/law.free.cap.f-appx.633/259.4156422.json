He contends that proper calculation of his base-offense level and sentencing range under the amended Guidelines could result in his sentence\u2019s being reduced to time served.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-22\">The denial of a motion for reduction of a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>E.g., United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). Amendment 782 revised the Guidelines applicable to drug-trafficking offenses by changing the base-offense levels in \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., Supp. to Appendix C, Amendment 782, Reason for Amendment. But, sentencing \u201creductions under ... \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are not mandatory ... [and] merely give[ ] the district court discretion to reduce a sentence under limited circumstances\u201d. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.2009). If the court gave due consideration to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, there is no abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">In denying Jones\u2019 motion, the court determined he was not eligible for a sentence modification because application of the Amendment would result in the same sentencing range as used for his original sentence: a base-offense level of 35, and resulting range of 292-365 months. A review of . the following demonstrates Amendment 782 lowered Jones\u2019 base-offense level, and ultimately his sentencing range: his Pre-sentence Investigation Report, prepared at the time of initial sentencing; the 17 June 2015 post-motion-for-reduction report prepared for the district court by the United States Probation Office; and the amended Guideline. Pursuant to the Amendment, Jones\u2019 base-offense level decreased to 32 (the level assigned to offenses involving at least one and a half kilograms, but less than five kilograms, of methamphetamine). <em>See </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4). Therefore, based on adjustments made to Jones\u2019 original base-offense level (two-point enhancement for use of a firearm, and three-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility), his total offense level became 31, with a corresponding sentencing range of 188-235 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Accordingly, the court erred in determining Amendment 782 did not lower Jones\u2019 sentencing range. In denying the motion, the court relied solely on its calculation of the offense level, and, therefore, did not consider whether the modification was warranted under the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, or the nature and seriousness of the danger to the community that may be posed by a reduction in the sentence. <em>See United States v. Larry, </em>632 F.3d 933, 937 (5th Cir.2011). Accordingly, the court abused its discretion in denying the motion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The order denying the motion to reduce Jones\u2019 sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is VACATED, and this matter is REMANDED for the court\u2019s reconsideration of the proper calculation of the Guidelines sentencing range in the light of Amendment 782, and also to determine whether the reduction is warranted in the light of the relevant sentencing factors. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C \u00a7 3582(c); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)(i)-(ii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b291-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
