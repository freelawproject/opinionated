California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Moore has filed a response, in which he moves to dismiss counsel. The record is not sufficiently developed to allow us to make a fair evaluation of Moore\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; we therefore decline to consider the claim without prejudice to collateral review. <em>See United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-23\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Moore\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Moore\u2019s pro se motion to dismiss counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b652-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
