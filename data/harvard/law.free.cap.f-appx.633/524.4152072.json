Wolfe appeals, <em>pro se, </em>from (1) the district court\u2019s affirmance of the bankruptcy court\u2019s orders granting the debtors\u2019 motions to strike his pleadings and filings in the bankruptcy proceeding and related adversary proceeding, and (2) a default judgment entered by the bankruptcy court in favor of the debtors in the adversary proceeding. On appeal, Wolfe argues that the bankruptcy court (1) erred by concluding that he lacked standing to appear in the proceedings, and incorrectly applied the rule that a corporation must be represented by an attorney to the facts of this ease; (2) lacked jurisdiction to decide the claims raised in the adversary proceeding; and (3) abused its discretion by entering a default judgment in favor of the debtors and against him and Advanced Shelter Solutions, Inc. (\u201cAdvanced\u201d) in the adversary proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-17\">1. Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b557-18\">As a second court of review of a bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment, we independently examine the factual and legal determinations of the bankruptcy court and employ the same standards of review as the district court. <em>IBT Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Northern (In re Int\u2019l Admin. Servs., Inc.), </em>408 F.3d 689, 698 (11th Cir.2005). We review the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and the legal conclusions of both the bankruptcy court and the district court <em>de novo. Id. </em>A factual finding is not clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>erroneous unless, \u201cafter reviewing all of the evidence, [we are] left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">To have standing in a bankruptcy proceeding, a party must be a \u201cparty in interest.\u201d <em>Walden v. Walker (In re Walker), </em>515 F.3d 1204, 1212 (11th Cir.2008). Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code provides that a \u201cparty in interest\u201d is a debtor or a creditor and that a \u201cparty in interest\u201d may raise and be heard on any issue in a bankruptcy case. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109(b). Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code does not specifically define a \u201cparty in interest.\u201d <em>See Westwood Cmty. Two Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Barbee (In re Westwood Cmty. Two Ass\u2019n, Inc.), </em>293 F.3d 1332, 1337 (11th Cir.2002). However, we have held that the right for a party in interest to be heard in a bankruptcy proceeding, as set out in Chapter 11, also applies in a Chapter 7 case. <em>Id. </em>According to the general provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, a \u201ccreditor\u201d includes an \u201centity that has a claim against the debt- or.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(10)(A). A \u201cclaim\u201d is a \u201cright to payment,\u201d whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, disputed or undisputed, secured or unsecured, or liquidated or unliquidated. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 101(5)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">A corporation cannot appear <em>pro se </em>in litigation and must be represented by counsel because it is an artificial entity only able to act through its agents. <em>Palazzo v. Gulf Oil Corp., </em>764 F.2d 1381, 1385 (11th Cir.1985). This rule applies even where the individual seeking to represent the corporation is an officer or major stockholder. <em>Id. </em>Parties may not evade this general rule by assigning the corporate claims to a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff individually. <em>Id. </em>at 1385-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The bankruptcy court properly struck Wolfe\u2019s <em>pro se </em>pleadings and filings related to a claimed mechanic\u2019s lien, because the mechanic\u2019s lien was held by Advanced, and, as a corporation, Advanced could not proceed without an attorney. <em>See Palazzo, </em>764 F.2d at 1385. Further, the assignment of the mechanic\u2019s lien claim to Wolfe individually could not be used to circumvent the requirement that Advanced be represented by an attorney to litigate the claim. <em>See id. </em>at 1385-86. However, the bankruptcy court erred when it dismissed those portions of Wolfe\u2019s <em>pro se </em>pleadings and filings in the bankruptcy proceeding that related to his status as an individual creditor pursuant to a state court judgment that he held against Rodriguez. Based on this judgment, Wolfe was a creditor and a proper party in interest under the Bankruptcy Code. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101(5)(a), (10)(A), 1109(b); <em>In re Westwood Cmty. Two Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>293 F.3d at 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">2. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">We review jurisdictional issues <em>de novo. In re Walker, </em>515 F.3d at 1210. The discharge of a debt by a bankruptcy court is an <em>in rem </em>proceeding and bankruptcy courts have exclusive jurisdiction over a debtor\u2019s property and estate. <em>Tenn. Student Assistance Corp. v. Hood, </em>541 U.S. 440, 447, 124 S.Ct. 1905, 1910, 158 L.Ed.2d 764 (2004). An adversary proceeding is part of the original bankruptcy case, and falls within a bankruptcy court\u2019s <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 451-52, 124 S.Ct. at 1913. Adversary proceedings are required with respect to various matters, including determining the validity, priority, or extent of a lien or other interest in property. Fed. R. Bankr.P. 7001(2); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b)(2)(A), (K) (providing that core proceedings include matters concerning the administration of the estate, and determinations of the validity, extent, or priority of liens); <em>Trusted Net Media Holdings, LLC v. Morrison Agency, Inc. (In re Trusted Net Media Holdings, LLC), </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>550 F.3d 1035, 1044 (11th Cir.2008) <em>(en </em>banc) (\u201cSubject matter jurisdiction ... is the statutorily conferred power of the court to hear a class of cases.\u201d). However, bankruptcy courts have discretion to \u201cabstain from hearing any proceeding, including core matters, \u2018in the interest of comity \u2022with State courts or respect for State law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stern v. Marshall, </em>564 U.S. 462, 131 S.Ct. 2594, 2620, 180 L.Ed.2d 475 (2011) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(c)(1)). Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(d): \u201c[a]ny decision to abstain or not to abstain made under section (c) ... is not reviewabl\u00e9 by appeal or otherwise by the court of appeals____\u201d28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to hear the claims raised in the debtors\u2019 adversary proceeding, as those claims related to a mechanic\u2019s lien encumbering the debtors\u2019 real property, a core matter in the bankruptcy proceeding. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b)(2)(A), (K); Fed. R. Bankr.P. 7001(2); <em>Tenn. Student Assistance Corp., </em>541 U.S. at 451-52, 124 S.Ct. at 1913.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To the extent that Wolfe asserts that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion by declining to abstain from deciding the issues raised in the adversary proceeding, in light of the pending state court litigation, we lack jurisdiction to review the court\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">3. Default judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">We review the denial of a motion to set aside an entry of default for abuse of discretion. <em>Jones v. Harrell, </em>858 F.2d 667, 669 (11th Cir.1988). We also review the entry of a default judgment for abuse of discretion. <em>Sanderford v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., </em>902 F.2d 897, 898 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">\u201cWhen a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend, and that failure is shown by affidavit or otherwise, the clerk must enter the party\u2019s default.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(a); <em>see </em>Fed. R. Bankr.P. 7055 (providing that Rule 55 applies in adversary proceedings). A bankruptcy court, like a district court, \u201cmay set aside an entry of default for good cause.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(c); <em>see </em>Fed. R. Bankr.P. 7055. Although the court may consider numerous factors to determine whether a litigant has shown good cause to set aside an entry of default, \u201cif a party willfully defaults by displaying either an intentional or reckless disregard for the judicial proceedings, the court need make no other findings in denying relief.\u201d <em>Compania Interamericana Export-Import, S.A. v. Compania Dominicana de Aviacion, </em>88 F.3d 948, 951-52 (11th Cir.1996). Following entry of default, the party may apply to the court for a default judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-13\">The bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion by declining to set aside the entry of default, because Wolfe did not demonstrate good cause for the failure to obtain counsel to represent Advanced in the adversary proceeding. <em>See Jones, </em>858 F.2d at 669. The court also did not abuse its discretion by entering a default judgment against Wolfe and Advanced in the adversary proceeding, because the claims raised in the proceeding related solely to the mechanic\u2019s lien purportedly held by Advanced, and Advanced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>failed to appear or answer in the proceeding. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(a), (b); Fed. R. Bankr.P. 7055; <em>Sanderford, </em>902 F.2d at 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Accordingly, upon review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b559-10\">. To the extent that Wolfe argues that the real property subject to the mechanic\u2019s lien was no longer within the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court because it had been effectively abandoned by the trustee, we decline to address the argument, because it is improperly raised for the first time in Wolfe\u2019s reply brief. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (providing that issues raised for the first time in a litigant's reply brief will not be addressed).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b560-24\">.
