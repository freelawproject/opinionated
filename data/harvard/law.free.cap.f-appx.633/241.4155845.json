The sentence constituted a nine-month increase from the applicable guidelines range of 15-21 months, which the district court stated was an upward departure pursuant to two sections of the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court\u2019s statements at sentencing reflected concern that Guerrero had a prior conviction for the same offense for which he had received a 20-month sentence, only one month below the top of the current guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">On appeal, Guerrero asserts that the district court abused its discretion by imposing the upward .departure. He contends that, the departure may not be justified under \u00a7 5K2.0, which covers aggravating or mitigating circumstances, because the commentary to this policy statement states that departures based on criminal history should be considered under \u00a7 4A1.3. But, he maintains, the court could not rely on \u00a7 4A1.3 to support the departure because nothing in that section\u2019s policy statement authorizes an upward departure based on the similarity of the instant offense to the conduct underlying a prior conviction. The Government asserts that we should review Guerrero\u2019s claims for plain error because he did not raise these grounds in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">We need not resolve the proper standard of review, as Guerrero\u2019s claims fail even under the more onerous abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006). This court has upheld an upward departure based on the similarity between the defendant\u2019s prior and current convictions under each of the policy statements relied upon by the district court. <em>See United States v. Schmeltzer, </em>20 F.3d 610, 613 (5th Cir.1994) (\u00a7 5K2.0); <em>United States v. De Luna-Trujillo, </em>868 F.2d 122, 124-25 (5th <em>Cir.1989) </em>(\u00a7 4A1.3). Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b274-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
