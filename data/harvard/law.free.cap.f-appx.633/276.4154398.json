After the Italian civil suit was unsuccessful, Bradford filed the present <em>pro se </em>action against GHW, alleging that GHW had committed legal malpractice during the course of its representation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On September 8, 2014, the district court granted GHW\u2019s motion for summary judgment, dismissing Bradford\u2019s claims with prejudice. On May 15, 2015, Bradford filed a Rule 60(b) motion, requesting relief from the earlier judgment on the grounds of newly discovered evidence, fraud by GHW, and any other reason that justifies relief. The district court denied the Rule 60(b) motion, and Bradford timely appeals that denial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-19\">\u201c[T]he decision to grant or deny relief under Rule 60(b) lies within the sound discretion of the district court and will be reversed only for abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Edwards v. City of Hous., </em>78 F.3d 983, 995 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>(5th Cir.1996) (en banc). Bradford argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying her relief on the grounds of \u201cnewly discovered evidence,\u201d fraud, and \u201cany other reason that justifies relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(2)-(3), (6). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">First, in order to prevail on the grounds of newly discovered evidence, \u201ca movant must demonstrate: (1) that [she] exercised due diligence in obtaining the information [and] (2) that the evidence is material and controlling and clearly would have produced a different result if presented before the original judgment.\u201d <em>Hesling v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>396 F.3d 632, 639 (5th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Goldstein v. MCI World-Com, </em>340 F.3d 238, 257 (5th Cir.2003)). In particular, the movant must have \u201cused due diligence to discover the evidence <em>at the time of trial.\u201d Johnson Waste Materials v. Marshall, </em>611 F.2d 593, 597 (5th Cir.1980) (emphasis added). Bradford has failed to demonstrate that she exercised due diligence because the \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d consists of documents and emails that were in the possession of Marco Chiari, Bradford\u2019s Italian counsel (and GHW\u2019s former co-counsel) in the Italian civil suit. Bradford has provided no explanation for why she had not previously obtained this evidence and expressly stated that she only initiated her investigation into the evidence after her claims were dismissed with prejudice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in denying relief under Rule 60(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">Second, Bradford alleges that GHW engaged in fraud by withholding documents during discovery, and therefore the district court erred by not granting relief under Rule 60(b)(3). <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3) (providing relief if an opposing party commits \u201cfraud (whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or misconduct\u201d). However, the movant must establish not only that the adverse party engaged in fraud or other misconduct, but that \u201cthis misconduct <em>prevented the moving party from fully and fairly presenting [her] case.\u201d Hesling, </em>396 F.3d at 641 (emphasis added). Even if GHW had wrongfully withheld documents during discovery,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Bradford has failed to show that she was prevented from presenting her case because she could have easily obtained those documents from Chiari. Indeed, attached to Bradford\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion were multiple exhibits where Chiari stated that he still possessed the original documents from the Italian civil suit. Accordingly, there was no abuse of discretion in denying relief under Rule 60(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">Finally, Bradford was not entitled to relief for \u201cany other reason that justifies relief.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6). Bradford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>has failed to advance any separate ground for relief under Rule 60(b)(6) that is not already covered by Rule 60(b)(2) and (b)(3). <em>See Hesling, </em>396 F.3d at 643 (\u201cThe reason for relief set forth under 60(b)(6) cannot be the reason for relief sought under another subsection of 60(b).\u201d); <em>Hess v. Cockrell, </em>281 F.3d 212, 216 (5th Cir.2002) (\u201c[Rule 60(b)(6)] is a catch-all provision, meant to encompass circumstances not covered by Rule 60(b)\u2019s other enumerated provisions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b308-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir, R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-16\">. While Bradford's complaint does not expressly allege a claim for legal malpractice, \u2018\u2018[a] <em>pro se </em>complaint is to be construed liberally,\u201d <em>Johnson v. Atkins, </em>999 F.2d 99, 100 (5th Cir.1993). Bradford\u2019s amended complaint relies on certain actions taken, or failures to take action, by GHW during its representation of Bradford. Therefore, like the district court, we construe her complaint as raising a legal malpractice claim against GHW. <em>See </em>La. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 9:5605 (noting that an action for legal malpractice may be \"based upon tort, or breach of contract, or otherwise\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b308-20\">. Bradford filed her Rule 60(b) motion eight months after the district court entered final judgment, and therefore \"it did not restart the time limit for filing a timely notice of appeal from the dismissal of [her] suit.\u201d <em>Chhim v. Univ. of Hous., </em>582 Fed.Appx. 406, 406 (5th Cir.2014) (per curiam) (unpublished); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(vi). \u2022 Bradford timely appealed the district court\u2019s denial of Rule 60(b) relief, but \"an appeal from the denial of Rule 60(b) relief does not bring up the underlying judgment for review.\u201d <em>Williams v. Chater, </em>87 F.3d 702, 705 (5th Cir.1996). We therefore only consider Bradford\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of the Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b309-6\">. Moreover, while Bradford relies heavily on an expert report she submitted with her Rule 60(b) motion, she previously waived her right to utilize expert testimony, and she has not provided any plausible ground for why she did not previously pursue such an expert report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b309-7\">. Throughout the proceedings below, Bradford repeatedly made conclusory allegations that GHW withheld documents during discovery without providing significant evidentiary support. <em>See Hesling, </em>396 F.3d at 641 (\"The moving party has the burden of proving the misconduct by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d). And, as the district court correctly noted, the majority of the \"newly discovered evidence\u201d involved emails sent and received by Chiari that were not in GHW\u2019s possession, custody, or control. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 34(a) (allowing a party to request certain items within the \"responding party\u2019s possession, custody, or control\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b309-13\">.While Bradford contends that the district court failed to address her request for relief under Rule 60(b)(6), the district \u2022 court expressly held that \"[Bradford] is not entitled to relief from final judgment [under Rule 60(b)(3) ] or <em>any other basis.\u201d</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
