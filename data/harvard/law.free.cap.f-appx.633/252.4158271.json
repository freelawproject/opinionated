Martinez-Magallanes has abandoned any challenge to the denial of asylum and withholding of removal under the CAT by failing to address these issues in his brief. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-22\">Contrary to his argument, Martinez-Magallanes claimed membership in a particular social group as \u201ca homeowner who is a victim of extortion by Mexican gangs.\u201d Aside from conclusional assertions, Martinez-Magallanes provides no argument regarding why these characteristics meet the requisite standards of social visibility or distinction and particularity. <em>See Orellanar-Monson v. Holder, </em>685 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2012). Accordingly, he has not shown that the BIA and IJ erred in determining that he failed to establish membership in a particular social group and denying him withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 517-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-23\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b284-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
