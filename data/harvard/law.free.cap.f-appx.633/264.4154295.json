In that agreement, Rapoport waived the right to appeal his sentence, with some exceptions, including if his constitutional rights were violated by, <em>inter alia, </em>ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Rapoport was sentenced to a within-advisory-Guidelines term of 16 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Rapoport acknowledges the appeal waiver but maintains the issues presented fall within the ineffective-assistance exception. In that regard, he contends his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance at sentencing by failing to object to: his not receiving a minor-role adjustment, pursuant to Guideline \u00a7 3B1.2; and, the procedural and substantive unreasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Generally, \u201cclaims of ineffective assistance of counsel should not be litigated on direct appeal, unless they were previously presented to the trial court\u201d. <em>United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 123, 190 L.Ed.2d 94 (2014). For ineffective-assistance claims not presented in district court, \u201c[i]t is only in rare cases in which the record allows a reviewing court to fairly evaluate the merits of the claim that we will consider such a claim\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also United States v. Kizzee, </em>150 F.3d 497, 502-03 (5th Cir.1998) (record insufficient for review where district court did not hear testimony or make factual findings as to ineffective-assistance claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">Although Rapoport\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims fall within an exception to his appeal waiver, the record is not sufficiently developed to afford them fair consideration due to his failure to raise them in district court. <em>See Isgar, </em>739 F.3d at 841. Accordingly, we decline to consider his claims on direct appeal; Rapoport may raise them on collateral review under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 508-09, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
