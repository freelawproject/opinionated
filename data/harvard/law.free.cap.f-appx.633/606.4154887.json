He contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-17\">Section 3582(c)(2) establishes a two-step inquiry. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826-27, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). At the first step, a district court is to determine whether a reduction is consistent with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 by determining the prisoner\u2019s eligibility for a reduction and the extent of the authorized reduction. <em>See id. </em>In the second step, a district court is to \u201cconsider any applicable [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors and determine whether, in its discretion, the reduction authorized by reference to the policies relevant at step one is warranted in whole or in part under the particular circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 827, 130 S.Ct. 2683.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-22\">We review the district court\u2019s refusal to reduce Lopez\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 671-72 (5th Cir.2009). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion if it bases its decision on an error of law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-23\">Lopez claims that the district court procedurally erred by failing to ensure that the record reflects that the calculations required to arrive at the amended guidelines range were performed correctly. Lopez is correct that the district court did not explicitly perform the first step of the analysis set forth in <em>Dillon </em>by analyzing his eligibility for a reduction pursuant to Amendment 782 or the extent of the authorized reduction. However, the district court\u2019s determination that Lopez was eligible for a sentence reduction is implied by the district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court\u2019s implicit determination that Lopez was eligible for a sentence reduction is sufficient. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number><em>See United States v. Larry, </em>632 F.3d 933, 936 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">As for the second step of the analysis under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), Lopez contends that the district court erred in denying a reduction based on clearly erroneous facts and in failing to consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and his post-sentencing rehabilitation. Pursuant to the guidelines commentary, when determining whether a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is warranted and the extent of any such reduction, the district court \u201cshall consider\u201d both the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and \u201cthe nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that may be posed by a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment.\u201d \u00a7 1B1.1Q, comment. (n.1(B)(i)-(ii)). The district court \u201cmay consider\u201d the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(B)(iii)). However, a district court has no obligation to grant \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Here, the record reflects that the district court appropriately considered Lopez\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as a whole, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and took into account the danger to the community that might result from a reduction in Lopez\u2019s term of imprisonment. Additionally, although the district court did not discuss Lopez\u2019s post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts, an argument concerning such efforts was presented to the district court, and we may assume that the district court considered it. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673. In light of the foregoing, Lopez has failed to show that the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was an abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b638-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
