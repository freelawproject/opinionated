In calculating Gonzalez-Perez\u2019s departure sentence, the district court found that Gonzalez-Perez\u2019s criminal history was underrepresented pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, based on the fact that he had five prior apprehensions for illegal entry, and that the circumstances surrounding Gonzalez-Perez\u2019s prior sexual contact conviction was a matter that the Sentencing Commission had not considered pursuant to \u00a7 5K2.0(a)(2)(B). Accordingly, the district court made an upward adjustment to Gonzalez-Perez\u2019s sentence, effectively increasing his criminal history category from II to VI and his offense level from six to eight. Gonzalez-Perez did' not object, and the district court sentenced Gonzalez-Perez within the post-departure range to 24 months of imprisonment, which was the statutory maximum for the subject offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">In the sole issue he raises on appeal, Gonzalez-Perez argues that the district court ex-red in making the upward adjustment because it did not employ the proper methodology set forth in <em>United States v. Lambert, </em>984 F.2d 658 (5th Cir.1993), and did not adequately explain the reasons underlying the upward departure. To demonstrate plain error, Gonzalez-Perez must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and -that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Even if we assume for the sake of argument that the district court erred in making the upward adjustment, we cannot say that such an error affected Gonzalez-Perez\u2019s substantial rights. After imposing the departure sentence, the district court made it abundantly clear that, even if it had imposed the upward departure in error, it would have imposed the same sentence based upon its consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and Gonzalez-Perez\u2019s criminal history and personal circumstances. Thus, Gonzalez-Perez cannot show that his substantial rights were affected by the district court\u2019s departure sentence. <em>United States v. Blocker, </em>612 F.3d 413, 416 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
