The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Appellees because Terry had failed to establish a prima facie case of race discrimination or demonstrate that Appellees\u2019 legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for their actions were pretextual. Terry now appeals to this Court, but her briefing fails to engage with the district court\u2019s reasoning, cite to the record, or cite relevant case law. \u201cAlthough we liberally construe briefs of <em>pro se </em>litigants and apply less stringent standards to parties proceeding <em>pro se </em>than to parties represented by counsel, <em>pro se </em>parties must still brief the issues and reasonably comply with the standards of Rule 28.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Terry has failed to do either, and we thus affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of her Fair Housing Act claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Terry devotes most of her briefing to a number of state law claims. Appellees urge that we need not address these claims because they were not alleged in the second amended complaint or argued in Terry\u2019s opposition to their motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Terry did, however, raise these claims in her objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, conclusions, and recommendation. Given Terry\u2019s pro se status, the district court should have construed her objections as a motion for leave to amend her complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Though this Court normally reviews the district court\u2019s failure to comment on such an implicit motion for abuse of discretion,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we decline to do so here because it is unclear if the district court would choose to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over any potentially meritorious state law claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, we remand to allow the district court to consider whether to grant Terry leave to amend,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and if so, to consider whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over any newly added state law claims. We note that if the district court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Terry\u2019s state law claims the dismissal \u201cshould expressly be <em>without </em>prejudice so that the plaintiff may ref\u00edle h[er] claims in the appropriate state court.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">We AFFIRM the dismissal of Terry\u2019s Fair Housing Act claims and REMAND <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>for consideration of Terry\u2019s implicit motion for leave to amend.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
