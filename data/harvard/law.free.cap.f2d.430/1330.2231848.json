See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir., 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part <em>I; </em>and Huth v. Southern Pacific Company, 5 Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 526, Part I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-24\">In this moonshine case, appellant was found guilty on both counts of an indictment charging violation of federal Internal Revenue laws, Sections 5179(a) and 5601(a) (1), 5601(a) (7), Title 26, U.S.C.A. The only issues on appeal are whether the paraphernalia Hollon had in his possession constituted a still and whether venue of the crime was proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-25\">The paraphernalia in defendant\u2019s barn, together with the 140 gallons of rye mash <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>in the seven 55-gallon fermenters certainly met the \u201cset up\u201d test of Phillips v. United States, 5 Cir., 1970, 427 F.2d 1025, a recent case in which Chief Judge Brown of this Circuit so ably discussed the statutory provisions of 26 U.S.C.A., \u00a7\u00a7 5179(a) and 5601(a). Hollon relies upon the case of Liverman v. United States, 4 Cir., 1958, 260 F.2d 284, but under the facts in the case at hand, <em>Liver-man </em>does not compel a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-5\">A perusal of the entire record clearly indicates that there is no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that venue was not proved in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
