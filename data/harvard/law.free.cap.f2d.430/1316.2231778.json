App. \u00a7 462. He had applied to his local Selective Service Board for classification as a conscientious objector, but his application was rejected both by the Local Board and by the Appeal Board. Neither board stated any reasons for its action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-17\">In his SSS form 150 and in letters, Kol-ster made out a prima facie case for classification as a conscientious objector. His case is stronger than that of the appellant in Welsh v. United States, 1970, 398 U.S. 333, 90 S.Ct. 1792, 26 L.Ed.2d 308, in that Kolster expressed belief in a Supreme Being, and based his views against war upon Christian principles. There is no evidence whatever in the record that would provide a basis in fact for a finding that Kolster\u2019s beliefs are not sincere. The government makes no claim that they are not sincere. The government\u2019s case is based upon the theory that Kolster\u2019s beliefs are political, sociological, or philosophical, or a merely personal moral code rather than religious. (50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(j)). Whatever support there may have been for the government\u2019s position in the decisions prior to <em>Welsh, </em>that support has now vanished. See also United States v. French, 9 Cir., 1970, 429 F.2d 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-18\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
