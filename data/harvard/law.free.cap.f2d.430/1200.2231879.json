A prior final adjudication of the district court established that this Bank\u2019s ownership and management of this same type of armored car service was a violation of Georgia branch banking laws. While the incorporation of a one-bank holding company and the paper transfer of the armored car service to a counterpart subsidiary corporation of that holding company might terminate the violation in strict form, it changes not a whit of the substance. Since the whole scheme of maintaining competitive equality between the national and State banking systems looks to substance not form, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-25\">The facts are stated most favorably to the appellee and full accord is given to the findings of fact and conclusions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>law made by the district court in an earlier phase of this ease in an order dated October 22, 1968, the appeal from which was voluntarily dismissed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The order is now final and is the law of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-5\">Approximately three years ago the Bank purchased three armored cars, which it illegally utilized as branch banks.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> *****8 After the October, 1968 order of the trial court halted this activity, the Bank sought to do indirectly that which the district court had prohibited it from doing directly. The Bank chartered two Delaware corporations, one as a holding company of the bank and the other as a subsidiary of the holding company. The Bank then transferred operation and ownership of the armored car service to the subsidiary corporation, which continued to operate the service exactly as it had been operated before solely on behalf of the bank for the benefit of the bank\u2019s customers. The armored ear service charged the Bank\u2019s customers nothing and had no visible means of financial support. Obviously it lived in the land where profit is the lifeblood of business by drawing fiscal sustenance from the Bank, using the holding company as its artery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-6\">The Bank instituted this action seeking a judgment declaring that the operation of the armored ear service by the holding company did not constitute branch banking. The district court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-7\">\u201cThe court is of the opinion that the activities presently conducted clearly constitute \u2018branch banking\u2019 within the meaning of the <em>Dickinson </em>decision. [See <em>infra.] </em>As such, they are prohibited by 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 36(f) and Georgia Code \u00a7 13-204.1 except upon bank premises as defined by the state statute. The fact that they are now performed by a sister subsidiary of the Holding Company controlling the Cornelia Bank is of no avail as this contractual arrangement merely accomplishes indirectly what the bank is prohibited from doing directly. Nor is the fact that bank holding companies in Georgia have been permitted to engage in other activities such as real estate, stock investments, life insurance, etc. persuasive. The point is that none of those activities constitute \u2018branch banking\u2019 as now defined, but rather relate to non-banking functions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1261-17\">We agree. The ownership of the armored cars was never dispositive of the case. Every Georgia bank is forbidden to use armored cars to extend the geographic reach of their banking facility in the form followed here. The transfer of ownership of the armored trucks from the Bank to a holding company did not affect the continued prohibition on the use of such trucks by the Bank to extend its area of banking operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-18\">In First National Bank in Plant City, Florida v. Dickinson, 396 U.S. 122, 90 S. Ct. 337, 24 L.Ed.2d 312 (1970), the Supreme Court made it quite clear that in determining whether activities by national banks violated the principle of \u201ccompetitive equality\u201d with State banks that form should not prevail over sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>stance. In that cas\u00e9, the bank argued that its armored cars which picked' up deposits were not engaged in branch banking because the depositors entered into a contract with the bank that the deposits delivered to the armored car would not be deemed received until they were physically delivered into the hands of the teller on the bank\u2019s premises. The court answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-7\">We need not characterize the contracts as a sham or subterfuge in order to conclude that the conduct of the parties and the nature of their relations bring First National\u2019s challenged activities within the federal definition of branch banking. <em>Here, penetrating the form of the contracts to the underlying substance of the transaction, </em>we are satisfied that at the time a customer delivers a sum of money either to the armored truck or the stationary receptacle, the bank has, for all purposes contemplated by Congress in \u00a7 36(f), received a deposit. The money is given and received for deposit even though the parties have agreed that its technical status as a \u201cdeposit\u201d which may be drawn on is to remain inchoate for the brief period of time it is in transit to the chartered bank premises. The intended deposits are delivered and received <em>as part of a large-scale continuing mode of conducting the bank-( ing business designed to bring basic bank services to the customers.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-8\">396 U.S. 137, 90 S.Ct. at 395 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1262-9\">So too in this ease the armored cars were used as \u201ca large-scale continuing mode of conducting the banking business designed to bring basic bank services to the customers.\u201d The law of this case is that armored cars may not be operated as branch banks by federally chartered banks, because state banks may not engage in branch banking. Here, as in <em>Plant City, </em>we don\u2019t need to call a sham a sham. To ignore the substance of the operation of the armored cars in this ease and allow rolling branch banks to be provided \u201con behalf of the bank\u201d through the real or fictional largesse of a parent holding company, would illegally disrupt the competitive equality between federal and state banks in Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1261-8\">.
