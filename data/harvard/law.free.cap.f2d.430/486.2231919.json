According to his complaint, appellant was picked up without probable cause and held for two days by the Los Angeles police. Never accorded a judicial hearing on the legality of his detention, he was finally released when the police were \u201cfully satisfied\u201d that no basis existed for charging him with crime. Subsequently, the FBI obtained appellant\u2019s fingerprints and the additional information at issue, which it maintains in its criminal identification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>files.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to the complaint, the information retained is misleading and incomplete; and it will become available, to appellant\u2019s detriment, to law enforcement officers, potential employers, and other persons. Accordingly, appellant seeks to have it purged from the files.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Both sides moved in the District Court for summary judgment; appellant\u2019s motion was denied, and appellees\u2019 was granted. On this appeal, the parties agree that the case was ripe for decision on the cross-motions for summary judgment; they differ only as to the proper outcome. For the reasons hereafter set forth, however, we believe that final decision should have awaited a more complete factual development. Consequently, we remand the case for trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">In support of his motion for summary judgment, appellant did not rely upon the full breadth of his complaint. Instead, he reasoned as follows. Appellees admit that their files contain a card bearing appellant\u2019s fingerprints and a notation indicating that he had been picked up by the California police and released without formal charges being lodged against him. A California statute provides that, with exceptions not here relevant, such a procedure is proper only if the police are satisfied \u201cthat there is no ground for making a criminal complaint against the person arrested.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Subsequently, the incident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>\u201cshall not be deemed an arrest but a detention only.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant strenuously argues that the FBI has statutory authority to maintain in its criminal identification files only \u201ccriminal\u201d records; that the material at issue cannot, in light of the California statute referred to, fairly be characterized as a \u201ccriminal\u201d record;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that therefore it must be removed from the FBI\u2019s files.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\"> Assuming that the FBI\u2019s statutory authority is limited as appellant suggests,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we do not believe that the facts established on the motion for summary judgment<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> are such as to bring the records of appellant\u2019s detention outside of a fair reading of the term \u201ccriminal records.\u201d For we cannot say that Calif.Penal Code, \u00a7 849(b) (1), the provision relied upon, was intended to limit the substantial element of discretion normally exercised at the intake stages of the criminal process in deciding who, of the many persons who may be guilty of criminal activity, shall be formally charged and prosecuted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Release under \u00a7 849(b) (1) does not necessarily imply that investigation has exonerated the one arrested; it is proper if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-8\">(1) further investigation exonerated the arrested party, (2) the complainant withdrew the complaint, (3) further investigation appeared necessary before prosecution could be initiated, (4) the ascertainable evidence was insufficient to proceed further, (5) the admissible or adducible evidence was insufficient to proceed further, or (6) other appropriate [reasons].<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">Despite the statutory difference in denomination,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> therefore, nothing estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>lished on the motion for summary judgment would differentiate the incident involving appellant from any other arrest and release without charge. Appellant does not suggest that Congress intended to deny the FBI power, in some circumstances at least, to maintain records of an arrest not followed by the filing of formal charges. \u201cOn summary judgment the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts contained in [the supporting] materials must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment was properly denied.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Appellees, on the other hand, would have us uphold the award of summary judgment in their favor on the theory that, once it be admitted that appellant was arrested by the California police, they are justified in maintaining his fingerprints and a record of his detention in the criminal identification files of the FBI.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We do not find the question so simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-14\">Information denominated a record of arrest, if it becomes known, may subject an individual to serious difficulties. Even if no direct economic loss is involved, the injury to an individual\u2019s reputation may be substantial.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Economic losses themselves may be both direct and serious. Opportunities for schooling, employment, or professional licenses may be restricted or nonexistent as a consequence of the mere fact of an arrest, even if followed by acquittal or complete exoneration of the charges involved.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> An arrest record may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>used by the police in determining whether subsequently to arrest the individual concerned,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> or whether to exercise their discretion to bring formal charges against an individual already arrested.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Arrest records have been used in deciding whether to allow a defendant to present his story without impeachment by prior convictions,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and as a basis for denying release prior to trial or an appeal; <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> or they may be considered by a judge in determining the sentence to be given a convicted offender.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\"> Adverse action taken against an individual because of his arrest record is premised upon certain assumptions regarding the meaning of an arrest.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Insofar as these assumptions differ from reality, the adverse actions will have an erroneous basis.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We do not understand appellees to be asserting, for example, that they would be entitled to maintain, use, or disseminate the records at issue if no arrest had ever taken place. Yet it is not obvious to us why a different rule should obtain if the arrest was made without probable cause. There is, to say the least, serious question whether the Constitution can tolerate any adverse use of information or tangible objects obtained as the result of an unconstitutional arrest of the individual concerned.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Even if an unlawful arrest may, for some purposes, subsequently be legitimized by the later development of incriminating information,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> it is hard to see how an arrest not based on probable cause, followed by complete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>exoneration of the person arrested,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> could be used to support any adverse inferences whatsoever regarding him. We do not understand appellees to be suggesting that the uses made of appellant\u2019s arrest record will be benign; in consequence, if appellant can show that his arrest was not based on probable cause<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> it is difficult to find constitutional justification for its memorialization in the FBI\u2019s criminal files.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Even if the arrest was made with probable cause, it does not necessarily follow that no relief may be warranted. Particularly if the FBI has actual knowledge that further investigation exonerated appellant,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> it may be under a duty at the very least to supplement its files to indicate that fact.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Of course no system of records may reasonably be expected to contain every scrap of information about a particular incident, and presumably the FBI is vested with substantial discretion in determining how detailed their criminal identification files shall be. Yet it is clear that the government may not, wittingly or unwittingly, engage in wanton defamation of individuals and groups,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and there is limit beyond which the government may not tread in devising classifications that lump the innocent with the guilty.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Of course the point at which that limit has been passed may vary with the extent to which the information may be disseminated; that is, a record may be sufficiently complete for some purposes but woefully inadequate for others. The present record gives no indication of the extent to which appellant\u2019s record may be disseminated, within or without the government,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> or of the uses to which it may be put.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>we assume that the cryptic reference on appellant\u2019s fingerprint card to release \u201cin accordance with 849(b) (1)\u201d would be understood by police, it is questionable whether it would be understood by potential employers or the general public. If appellant can show that his record may, as he alleges, be widely disseminated,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> it may well be that he has a right to limit its dissemination or to require its amplification.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">We do not underestimate the magnitude of the problems suggested by the present record. It is certain that, every year, a multitude of persons guilty of no criminal activity are arrested and charged with crime. An arrest may be made if there is \u201cprobable cause\u201d to believe that an offense has been committed and that the person to be arrested committed it. Since \u201cprobable cause\u201d necessarily implies substantially less than absolute certainty,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> it follows that a significant number of those arrested will not in fact have committed the offense for which they have been detained.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">But this by no means exhausts the scope of the problem. Many individuals have unjustly acquired arrest records without even the excuse of an honest and unavoidable mistake by the police. In the District of Columbia alone, literally thousands of persons were once arrested \u201cfor investigation\u201d and then released;<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> but their records often remain.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Dragnet arrests are at best matters of recent memory.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>worse are those occasions, far more common than we would like to think, where invocation of the criminal process is used \u2014 often with no hope of ultimate conviction \u2014 as punitive sanction.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Hippies <footnotemark>43</footnotemark> and civil rights workers<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> have been harassed and literally driven from their homes <footnotemark>45</footnotemark> by repeated and unlawful arrests, often made under statutes unconstitutional on their face.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Innocent bystanders may be swept up in mass arrests made to clear the streets either during a riot or during lawful political demonstrations.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Use of the power to arrest in order to inflict summary punishment is, of course, unconstitutional;<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> but even if the arrest was made lawfully and with the best of intentions,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> if the person arrested has been exonerated it is difficult to see why he should be subject. to continuing punishment by adverse use of his \u201ccriminal\u201d record.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-18\">The very seriousness of the problem underscores the necessity for a clear and complete factual record as a basis for adjudication.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> We are not unaware of many considerations which might lead to the conclusion that the maintenance of arrest records is a matter properly committed to the discretion of the Department of Justice, subject of course to such rules as Congress and the President may see fit to impose.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>such discretion, assuming it exists, may not be without limit. Particularly troublesome is the possibility, by no means eliminated on the present record, that information in the FBI\u2019s files may be used for many other than the law enforcement purposes for which its retention may be justified.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The short of the matter is that the facts established on the cross-motions for summary judgment were simply inadequate for proper resolution of the complex questions presented. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court granting appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment is reversed and the case remanded for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-5\">. According to appellees\u2019 answers to interrogatories propounded by appellant, the files originally contained a card bearing appellant\u2019s name and fingerprints and the following notation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">Date Arrested or Received \u2014 8-10-65</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-x\">Charge or Offense \u2014 459 PC Burglary</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACW\">Disposition or Sentence \u2014 8-12-65\u2014Re-leased \u2014 Unable to connect with any felony or misdemeanor at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlV\">Occupation \u2014 Student</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ayg-dedup-0\">Residence of Person Fingerprinted\u2014 Saticoy &amp; Canoga Canoga Park</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AH3\">After the present complaint was filed, the entry under \u201cDisposition or Sentence\u201d was changed to read</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avi\">8-12-65 \u2014 -Released\u2014Unable to connect with any felony or misdemeanor \u2014 in accordance with 849b(l) \u2014 not deemed an arrest but detention only.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"adm-dedup-0\">Surprisingly, according to appellees\u2019 answers the card appears to contain no indication of the source of the information or the state in which the incident took place.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b548-7\">. Appellees have admitted that their files contain a record of appellant\u2019s detention; the contents of the file, as set forth in note 1 <em>supra-, </em>and that they know of no crime committed by appellant or incident to his detention. The remaining allegations of appellant\u2019s complaint were denied, and have not been the subject of affidavits filed by either side in the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b548-8\">. Language in appellees\u2019 brief could be read to suggest that, since the incident underlying the present suit took place in California, transfer of this litigation to a federal district court in that state might be appropriate. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a) (1964). Whatever might be the situation in other circumstances, the present record does not indicate that transfer would be appropriate. It appears that the only witnesses present when appellant was taken into custody were appellant and the two arresting officers. Although the officers are presumably still in California, appellant, who has the burden of proof, presently resides in Silver Spring, Maryland. Furthermore, also relevant at trial will be information regarding the practices of the FBI in disseminating its criminal identification records, <em>see </em>notes 33-36 <em>infra </em>and accompanying text, and witnesses regarding these matters would presumably be more accessible in the District of Columbia than in California. Appellant\u2019s choice of forum is itself entitled to some weight. And finally, it might well be thaat appellant, who appeared <em>pro se </em>in the District Court, would be unable to prosecute his suit were it transferred to the West Coast. <em>See generally </em>Van Dusen v.

If such items should be included at all \u2014 and the Advisory Committee would not provide for their inclusion \u2014 at the very least a detailed effort should be undertaken to assure that the reader of the report cannot possibly mistake an arrest for a conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A87\">American Bar Association Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Probation \u00a7 2.3, at 37 (Tent, draft 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b551-16\">. Even if the assumptions are accurate, an arrest record may be used in ways that should be difficult if not impossible to tolerate. Presumably the fact of arrest indicates some possibility that the individual concerned engaged in the criminal activity with which he was charged. Investigation may disclose whether he has or not. Yet so long as there exists an employable pool of persons who have not been arrested, employers will find it cheaper to make an arrest an automatic disqualification for employment. <em>See </em>Hess &amp; Le Poole, <em>supra </em>note 17, at 496.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b551-17\">.

Obviously, those responsible for investigating and prosecuting criminal activity should have the primary responsibility for determining what information will be most helpful in carrying out their task; and so long as they do not infringe the rights of individuals, the courts may not interfere. Similarly, those responsible for maintaining a system of information must bear the responsibility in the first instance for assuring that inaccurate or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>misleading information is not used to an individual\u2019s detriment. Appellant here alleged that prior to filing the instant suit he had sought relief from appellees but had been told that they had \u201cno authority\u201d to do as he requested. We. would urge the Department of Justice to clarify and make public its views regarding its own authority to correct or delete information in its files; and should it find that it has such authority, to devise procedures whereby complaints such as the present one may be handled at an administrative level.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-13\">Any such procedure would be a substantial improvement over a remedy that required any individual anticipating adverse consequences from an inaccurate record to bring a lawsuit in order to protect himself. But we must recognize that, without more, even a full system of administrative remedies cannot be the final answer. Realistically, the FBI cannot be expected to investigate the facts underlying every arrest or detention reported to it; the most it can do is examine the report on its face and, perhaps, investigate further if a complaint is received from the individual concerned. For most of those arrested \u2014 too poor, too ignorant, and often too disheartened to complain\u2014 the only adequate remedy may lie either in severely curtailing any use of records of arrest, or in eliminating altogether their maintenance in a file associated with the individual\u2019s name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"52\">\n<p id=\"b555-14\">. For example, New York State recently passed a statute requiring all employees of securities firms to be fingerprinted, and providing that the fingerprints so obtained be transmitted to the state\u2019s Attorney General \u201cfor appropriate processing.\u201d New York State Laws 1969, ch. 1071, codified as N.Y.General Business Law, \u00a7 359-e(12) (McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 20, Supp.1969). As a result of this statute, several hundred employees have been found to have \u201ccriminal records\u201d and dismissed from their employment; half of those fired had no record of convictions, but only of arrests. New York Times, February 5, 1970, at 1, col. 2; Wall Street Journal, February 5, 1970, at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-16\">It appears that the \u201cappropriate processing\u201d is carried out by the New York State Identification and Intelligence System, which is apparently one of those state agencies authorized to receive information from the FBI\u2019s files. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 534(a) (2) (Supp. IV, 1969). Since no New York statute provides for automatic dismissal of a securities employee with a past arrest record, presumably the information must be passed on to the employer before an individual may be fired. Although 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 534(b) (Supp. IV, 1969), provides that the exchange of records authorized by \u00a7 (a) (2) is \u201csubject to cancellation if dissemination is made outside the receiving departments or related agencies,\u201d we have no indication that this provision is regarded as mandatory or whether it is in fact ever enforced.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
