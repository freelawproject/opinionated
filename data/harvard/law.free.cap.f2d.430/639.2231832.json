The court denied relief and petitioner appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-25\">Petitioner requested a continuance at a preliminary hearing preceding his indictment and trial in state court in order that he could retain a lawyer. The continuance was denied and petitioner was identified by a police officer and the complaining witness. No plea was made. At the conclusion of the hearing, petitioner was held for the Grand Jury. Petitioner attacks his conviction con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>tending the failure to have an attorney at a preliminary hearing violated his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The Supreme Court has held that where a defendant\u2019s rights or defenses may be \u201cirretrievably\u201d lost at a preliminary hearing such that the whole trial is affected, the preliminary hearing is a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the proceedings and the defendant is entitled to an attorney. Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U.S. 52, 54, 82 S.Ct. 157, 7 L.Ed.2d 114 (1961); White v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 59, 83 S.Ct. 1050, 10 L.Ed.2d 193 (1963). Recently in Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 26 L.Ed.2d 387 (1970), the Court concluded that even though a defendant\u2019s rights are not lost at a preliminary hearing, the preliminary hearing is a \u201ccritical stage\u201d and a defendant is entitled to a lawyer. The Court, however, in fashioning a remedy in <em>Coleman </em>decided that the trial court should determine whether the defendant was prejudiced by denial of an attorney. Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). Since denial of an attorney at a preliminary hearing when no rights are lost does not \u201cinvariably deny a fair trial, * * * \u201d we hold that the ruling announced in <em>Coleman </em>is not retroactive. Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 297, 81 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967); United States v. Beard, 381 F.2d 325 (6th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Applying the pr <em>e-Coleman </em>standard, we find in the present case that there is no evidence that anything occurred at the preliminary hearing such that the defendant was deprived of due process of law. <em>Cf. </em>Stovall v. Denno, <em>supra. </em>In Illinois a defendant does not enter a plea at a preliminary hearing. The purpose of the hearing is to determine whether a crime has been committed and whether probable cause exists to bind the defendant over to the Grand Jury for indictment. Ill.Rev.Stat. Chap. 38, \u00a7\u00a7 109-3, 111-2. Further, \u201ca finding of probable cause is not binding upon a subsequent grand jury.\u201d People v. Morris, 30 Ill.2d 406, 411, 197 N.E.2d 433, 436 (1964). While a defendant may waive Grand Jury indictment under Ill.Rev.Stat. Chap. 38, \u00a7 111-2, failure to make such waiver does not affect the fairness of the trial. As to the claim of prejudice by the identifications, petitioner was convicted prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967), which was held not retroactive in Stovall v. Denno, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
