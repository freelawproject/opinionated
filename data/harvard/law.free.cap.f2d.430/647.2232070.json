App. \u00a7 462. He appeals. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-17\">Rink registered for the draft February 16, 1965, and was classified I-A on March 23, 1965. For our purposes now, it is needless to relate the history of Rink\u2019s course before his local and appeal boards between the date of his registration and the final induction order in April, 1968, under which he refused to submit. The significant event in that history is his application for 1-0 classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-18\">At Rink\u2019s request, the local board on May 31, 1966 sent him the requisite Form 150 for conscientious objector. The board issued an induction order June 6 and received the executed Form 150 from Rink <em>on </em>June 10, 1966. The induction was postponed and Rink, in response to the board\u2019s request, personally appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-19\">After this appearance and hearing, the board again classified Rink I-A. He appealed, and the appeal board, in accordance with the then effective Section 6 (j),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sent Rink\u2019s file to the Department of Justice for inquiry and recommendation. The Department recommended against classifying Rink 1-0 or I-A-O. The appeal board thereafter classified Rink I-A. The local board\u2019s final induction order, Rink\u2019s refusal to submit, his indictment, trial and conviction, and the appeal before us followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-20\">On appeal Rink claims denial of due process in the conduct of his local board, the Department of Justice, and the appeal board; error by the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>in his criminal trial with respect to Rink\u2019s burden of proof; and that there is no basis in fact in his file for denial of his application for conscientious objector classification. We do not reach any of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">After the oral argument of this case, the United States Supreme Court decided Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333, 90 S.Ct. 1792, 26 L.Ed.2d 308 (1970), which decision, in our view, requires us to reverse Rink\u2019s conviction. The Court there continued its interpretation of Section 6(j) first made in United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733 (1965), with respect to 1-0 claims based on areligious grounds. The Court concluded that \u201c[S]ection [6(j)] exempts from military service all those whose consciences, spurred by deeply held moral, ethical, or religious beliefs, would give them no rest or peace if they allowed themselves to become a part of an instrument of war.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"auf-dedup-0\">We read <em>Welsh </em>to hold that under Section 6(j) a registrant may qualify for a conscientious objector classification even though his opposition to war is based upon moral and ethical foundations rather than upon more conventional religious training; and that such a registrant\u2019s beliefs, whatever their source, must be \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201cdeeply held\u201d before he will qualify for the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Rink\u2019s Form 150 based his request for 1-0 classification on \u201c(B) I am, by reason of my religious training and belief, conscientiously opposed to * * * war in any form. * * * \u201d He answered in the affirmative the question \u201cDo you believe in a Supreme Being?\u201d In response to the Form direction that he \u201cDescribe the nature of [his] belief,\u201d he wrote \u201cSee attached sheet.\u201d The attached typewritten sheets described his \u201cmoral code, encompassing principles transcend [ing] human relations.\u201d This code, he stated, was based upon teachings of his father, secular books he had read, and the \u201clives of great modern men.\u201d His only references, in the \u201cattached sheets\u201d to religious sources of his beliefs were his statements that he believed it \u201cfundamental to any religious belief\u201d that rational men are not by nature violent and that the Catholic Church taught that all men have a right to life that cannot be abridged by other men.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">In support of its recommendation against Rink\u2019s application the Department of Justice stated: \u201cFurthermore, the registrant\u2019s use of the term \u2018code\u2019 * * * provides the best clue to his position. Section 6(j) * * * does not extend the exemption * * * to those whose position is based on a personal moral code.\u201d The Department concluded that \u201cthe registrant is not sincere in putting forth his claim of conscientious objection <em>on religious grounds. </em>* * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-15\">On the basis of these facts we conclude that Rink's application was based upon his asserted beliefs derived, at best, only in a minor way from conventional religious sources. The general tenor of his application is that the beliefs he holds derive more from secular sources. He referred to his Roman Catholic training and beliefs more because he felt the law required a religious basis for his beliefs, than that his religious training was the true source of his beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-16\">But the rejection of his claim, so far as the record shows, is based solely on the fact that his conventional religious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>beliefs were not sincere. There is no mention anywhere in his file of the sincerity, or of the depth, of his secularly based beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">So far as the record shows, neither the Justice Department nor the Selective Service boards which reviewed Rink\u2019s application considered Rink\u2019s secularly based beliefs to be of any relevance to his application under Section 6(j). The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Welsh </em>demonstrates the error of that conclusion. Under <em>Welsh, </em>before Rink\u2019s application could be properly denied, his local board had the obligation to decide upon not only the sincerity of his conventional religious beliefs but also whether his secu-larly based moral opposition to any war entitled him to 1-0 classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Rink\u2019s conviction must be reversed because the induction order subject of the indictment and trial is invalid for want of due process in the failure of Rink\u2019s local board to determine whether he is entitled to exemption on the ground of his secular based moral code, under the test of Welsh v. United States. This holding is without prejudice to the Selective Service System\u2019s power to reconsider Rink\u2019s Form 150 and supplementary material and to make the required determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-21\">.

The two groups of registrants which obviously do fall within these exclusions from the exemption are those whose beliefs are not deeply held and those whose objection to war does not rest at all upon moral, ethical, or religious principle but instead rests solely . upon considerations of policy, pragmatism, or expediency.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
