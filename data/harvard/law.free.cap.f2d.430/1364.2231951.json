As usual, there is evidence that the employee was discharged for good cause unrelated to her union activities; there is also evidence that the respondent fired the employee because she was an activist for the union. Whatever result this Court might have reached, had it been the Board, we must say that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-6\">We hold also that the Board properly declined to defer to the arbitration procedures provided in the collective bargaining agreement.
