The district court awarded judgment to the taxpayers. The sole issue on appeal is the proper tax treatment of certain cash distributions by At-tebury Elevators, Inc. (Elevators) to its three shareholders<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (taxpayers) during the calendar year 1959, but more than three and one-half months after the corporation\u2019s fiscal year ended on May 31, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-16\">Neither party objects to the district court\u2019s findings of fact, which we summarize as follows. Elevators was incorporated under the laws of Texas on June 1, 1958, with its fiscal year ending May 31 for federal income tax purposes. Effective for fiscal year ending May 31, 1959, Elevators and its three shareholders properly elected to have the corporation treated as a Small Business Corporation pursuant to provisions of Sub-chapter S (sections 1371-77) of the 1954 Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-17\">For the fiscal year ending May 31, 1959, Elevators reported a taxable income of $271,431.22, which the Commissioner changed after audit to $266,-960.27. This amount was reported in proportionate shares by taxpayers in their 1959 calendar year returns pursuant to section 1373(a) and <em>(b).</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>Taxpayers, as sole shareholders and directors, agreed during Elevators\u2019 1959 fiscal year that the corporation would distribute its entire taxable income for the fiscal year ending May 31, 1959, to the taxpayers before or on May 31, 1959, with these payments being treated as dividends.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, during the 1959 fiscal year, taxpayers did not need the funds and no distributions were made. Taxpayers agreed that any one of them could withdraw his share of corporate taxable income as he needed it. Although prior to the end of the corporation\u2019s fiscal year the exact corporate taxable income was unknown, taxpayers could ascertain such income with reasonable accuracy through financial statements. The district court concluded: \u201cDuring May, 1959, there were no substantial limitations or restrictions on the right of any shareholder to withdraw his share of such net income.\u201d</p>\n<p

Taxpayers paid the amount due plus interest and commenced this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">Subsequently, on December 19, 1968, Elevators filed with the Commissioner an election pursuant to the provisions of section 1375(f) and Treasury Regulation \u00a7 1.1375-6 (b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under the election, distributions made by Elevators for three and one-half months (September 15) after the close of its fiscal years ending May 31, 1959 and May 31, 1960, are considered to have been made as of the close of that fiscal year.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On the basis of this election, the district court held that taxpayers were at least entitled to partial refunds. On appeal, the government does not contest this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">The district court also held that taxpayers were entitled to a <em>total </em>refund on alternative theories: (1) that taxpayers were in \u201cconstructive receipt\u201d of all of Elevators\u2019 undistributed taxable income (as defined in section 1373(c)) as if such income had been distributed to taxpayers on the last day of Elevators\u2019 fiscal years ending May 31, 1959 and May 31, 1960; and (2) that the cash distributions in question were payments by Elevators to taxpayers on corporate debts created prior to the end of Elevators\u2019 fiscal year by the declaration of a dividend equal to the amount of the corporation\u2019s taxable income. The government contends on appeal that the district court erred in both holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-12\">Because the government does not object to the district

Since the corporation did have earnings and profits for its taxable year ending May 31, 1960, the distributions in question are includable in taxpayers\u2019 gross income on their 1959 calendar year returns.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Taxpayers, however, argue that they \u201cconstructively received\u201d these distributions on or before May 31,1959, and thus that the payments were only distributions of sums constructively received during Elevators\u2019 taxable year ending May 31, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>Under the government\u2019s argument, the following tax consequences develop. Since there were no cash distributions by Elevators during its taxable year ending May 31, 1959 (except for distributions considered to have been made as of May 31, 1959, under the section 1375(f) election), the corporation\u2019s taxable income is included in taxpayers\u2019 gross income for calendar year 1959 as \u201cundistributed taxable income\u201d pursuant to section 1373 (a) and (b). See note 2, <em>supra. </em>The cash distributions in question, regardless of taxpayers\u2019 intention that they were only to be distributions of the corporation\u2019s previous year\u2019s taxable income, must also be included in taxpayers\u2019 gross income for calendar year 1959 as dividends, to the extent of the corporation\u2019s earnings and profits for its taxable year ending May 31, 1960. The Subchapter S statute, its legislative history, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the government argues, demand this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">Under taxpayers\u2019 \u201cconstructive receipt\u201d argument, the corporation\u2019s entire taxable income for the year ending May 31, 1959, was distributed on or before May 31, 1959. Thus, the corporation\u2019s \u201cundistributed taxable income\u201d is zero, and taxpayers must include the distributions, constructively received as of May 31, 1959, in gross income as dividends.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-5\">Crucial to both arguments is whether or not the distributions in question, in terms of section 1373(c),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> were amounts of money distributed to taxpayers during the corporation\u2019s taxable year ending May 31, 1959. Taxpayers contend that \u201camounts of money distributed during the taxable year\u201d can be construed, pursuant to the constructive receipt doctrine,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to include distributions constructively received by shareholders during the corporation\u2019s taxable year. We agree with the government, however, that the constructive receipt doctrine is inapplicable in determining the \u201camount of money distributed during [a corporation\u2019s] taxable year.\u201d Our conclusion is premised upon the Subchapter S statute, its legislative history, and the regulations promulgated thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-11\">a. <em>Statutory Scheme and Regulations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-12\">Subchapter S (sections 1371-78) permits shareholders of certain closely-held corporations to eliminate taxation at the corporate level on the condition that each shareholder includes in his own gross income his share of the corporation\u2019s income whether or not distributed to him during the corporation\u2019s taxable year. <em>See </em>section 1373(a) and (b); note 2 <em>supra. </em>The amount of corporate taxable income which is not distributed during the corporate year is designated (and is included in the shareholder\u2019s gross income) as \u201cundistributed taxable income.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-13\">In order to avoid the possibility that undistributed taxable income, which has already been included in the shareholders\u2019 gross income in one year, will not be taxed again in a subsequent year when this amount is actually distributed, sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>tion 1375(d)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> provides that the corporation may distribute previously taxed undistributed taxable income without dividend consequences. This section, however, must be read in conjunction with Treasury Regulation \u00a7 1.1375-4(b), which states that \u201ca distribution of previously taxed income <em>may occur only </em>if during its taxable year the corporation makes such money distributions in excess of its earnings and profits for such taxable year.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the tax-free receipt of previously taxed \u201cundistributed taxable income\u201d can occur only in a year in which the total cash distributions<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> exceed that year\u2019s earnings and profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">The peculiar problem arising in this case results when a Subchapter S corporation\u2019s taxable year ends (May 31, 1959) several months before its shareholders\u2019 taxable year ends (December 31, 1959), and the shareholders receive cash distributions in the interval (September 16 and October 1, 1959). The preceding paragraph illustrates that shareholders of Subchapter S corporations could avoid unfavorable tax consequences (often referred to as \u201clocked-in earnings\u201d) by distributing the corporate taxable income currently. However, because of a eor-poration\u2019s lack of cash or the inability on or before the last day of the taxable year to determine accurately corporate taxable income, current distribution of taxable income is not always feasible.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Section 1375(f), enacted in 1966, offers a limited solution to this problem \u2014 cash distributions made within two and one-half months (or within three and one-half months in years prior to 1966) after the close of the corporate taxable year are treated as if they were made on the last day of that taxable year.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1227-14\">It is clear, however, that cash distributions made after the elective three and one-half month period, but before the end of the shareholders\u2019 taxable year, must be included, with one exception, in the shareholders\u2019 gross income for that year as dividends. Under the statutory scheme and regulations thereto,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> these distributions are regarded as having been made out of the earnings and profits of the following corporate taxable year (here, May 31, 1960), and (the one exception, section 1375(d)) are tax-free to the shareholders <em>only </em>to the extent that total cash distributions for that fiscal year exceed earnings and profits for such year.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>The above statutory scheme and regulations dictate that the cash distributions in question must be included in taxpayers\u2019 1959 gross income as dividends. However, taxpayers attempt to avoid this result through application of the constructive receipt doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">Section 1373(c) defines \u201cundistributed taxable income\u201d as \u201ctaxable income * * * minus the <em>amount of money distributed </em>as dividends <em>during the taxable year </em>* * * \u201d (Emphasis added.) Taxpayers argue that \u201cwhen sections 1373(b) and (c) define the corporate income to be taxed to the shareholders as being the amounts distributed to shareholders during the year, plus the undistributed taxable income for the year, the constructive receipt doctrine<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> steps in and defines the amounts which were distributed during the year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-6\">We cannot agree with taxpayers\u2019 argument. In our opinion, the phrase \u201camount of money distributed * * * during the taxable year\u201d means actual cash distributions to shareholders before the end of the corporate year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-7\">The regulations to section 1373 elaborate upon the meaning of this phrase. Regulation \u00a7 1.1373-1 (f) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-8\">\u201c(f) <em>When distributions are considered made. </em>Except as otherwise provided in \u00a7 1.1375-5, an. actual distribution by an electing small business corporation will be considered to be made only at the time it is received by the shareholder, and earnings and profits of such corporation shall not be reduced with respect to such distribution before such time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1228-14\">Taxpayers contend that the wording of the regulation \u2014 \u201creceived by the shareholder\u201d \u2014 means actual receipt of cash <em>or </em>cash unqualifiedly available to stockholders (thus constructively received by stockholders as per the constructive receipt doctrine). Taxpayers seem to overlook the phrase \u201cactual distribution\u201d in the above-quoted regulation. After viewing the entire regulation, we find no merit in taxpayers\u2019 attempt to assimilate the word \u201creceived\u201d to the definition of that word in section 451(a), as contained in the constructive receipt rule of Regulation \u00a7 1.451-2(a), quoted in note 18 <em>supra. </em>The import of Regulation \u00a7 1.1373-1 (f), when read in context with section 1373(c), the regulations,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and the legislative history discussed below, is that a distribution is deemed to occur only when it is actually paid by the corporation.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>Taxpayers also attempt to buttress their position by focusing on the last sentence of section 1373(b).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> They apparently urge that this sentence establishes a statutory presumption that all earnings of a Subehapter S corporation are deemed to have been distributed as of the close of the corporation\u2019s taxable year. This contention is completely without merit. The sole purpose of section 1373(b) is to define the amount of undistributed taxable income which a shareholder must include in his own gross income. The last sentence of section 1373 (b) merely characterizes such income \u201cas an amount distributed as a dividend\u201d in order to illustrate more clearly the ordinary income tax consequences of undistributed taxable income. That such a distribution is a hypothetical one is clearly demonstrated by the first sentence of section 1373(b) \u2014 \u201cthe amount he <em>would have received </em>as a dividend, if on such last day there <em>had been distributed </em>* * * an amount equal to the corporation\u2019s undistributed taxable income. * * * \u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">b. <em>Legislative History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1229-6\">In addition to the above statutory scheme and regulations, the relief pro-visions of section 1375(f), enacted m Act of April 14, 1966, P.L. 89-389, 80 Stat. Ill, demonstrate that the distributions in question are includable in taxpayers\u2019 1959 gross income as dividends <footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1229-14\">It is clear that Congress enacted section 1375(f) to alleviate a problem confronting not only taxpayers but also many Subchapter S corporations. This problem arises when the corporation cannot,make an actual cash distribution of its taxable income before the close of its taxable year, but distributes the taxable income to its shareholders shortly after the end of the taxable year. This problem is especially acute when the corporation\u2019s taxable year does not coincide with its shareholders\u2019 taxable year (as illustrated in this case). In this situation there is a bunching of income during the shareholders\u2019 taxable year, as illustrated in the legislative history of section 1375(f).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-15\">\u201cOne type of situation where hardship may exist in the case of such a distribution made shortly after the end of a year arises where the shareholder is on a taxable year ending 1 month or more after that of the corporation. This can be illustrated by a corporation with the taxable year ending on November 30 and a shareholder with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>taxable year ending on December 31. In such a case, if the corporation has made no distribution by November 30, each shareholder is taxed on his proportionate share of the taxable income of the corporation for that year. If the corporation then distributes this income to the shareholders during December, the shareholder will be faced with a double inclusion of the corporation\u2019s earnings in 1 year since such a shareholder first is taxed on his share of the undistributed earnings as of November 30; then, when the actual distribution is made in the following December, it is treated as a distribution out of the earnings and profits of the corporation for that following year. Thus, this distribution, too, is taxable to the shareholder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">S.Rep.

On May 1, 1967, X distributes $25,000 in money to A and $25,000 in money to B.

Pursuant to new section 1375(f), however, the May 1, 1967 distribution is treated as a distribution of X\u2019s undistributed taxable income for its year ending March 31, 1967, and will not increase A\u2019s and B\u2019s gross incomes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1230-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 2152-2153.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-13\">The legislative history of section 1375 (f) clearly demonstrates that the relief provision was intended to solve the bunching-of-income problem, resulting from a Subchapter S- corporation\u2019s inability to make actual cash distributions of its taxable income before the end of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>its taxable year.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> From the above legislative history, it is clear to us that Congress interpreted the Subchapter S provisions as requiring the following: Unless such actual cash distributions were made before the close of the corporation\u2019s tax year (thus reducing the amount of undistributed taxable income for that year to the extent such distributions were dividends), they were includable in the shareholders\u2019 gross income when ultimately distributed in the subsequent tax year of the corporation to the extent of that year\u2019s earnings and profits.

Once current earnings and profits of a given corporate year are distributed, the next distributions are deemed to be made out of previously taxed undistributed taxable income See note 7 supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-12\">The district court also held that taxpayers were entitled to a total refund in that the distributions made after the close of Elevators\u2019 fiscal years (May 31, 1959 and May 31, 1960) were payments by Elevators to taxpayers on corporate debts created prior to the end of the tax year by the declaration of a dividend equal to the amount of the corporation\u2019s taxable income. Both taxpayers and the district court cite Roe v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 192 F.2d 398 (5 Cir. 1951) and Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Cohen, 121 F.2d 348 (5 Cir. 1941), to support this theory of recovery. We find these cases to be inapplicable and, therefore, conclude that the above holding by the district court is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>Implicit in our decision in Roe, as well as the district court\u2019s holding in this case, is the inclusion in the shareholder\u2019s gross income, when the dividend is declared, of an amount equal to the declared dividends, pursuant to the constructive receipt doctrine. 192 F.2d at 402-403. Since we have concluded that the constructive receipt doctrine is inapplicable, see Part II <em>supra, </em>the <em>Roe </em>decision is clearly distinguishable. As to the <em>Cohen </em>decision, its continued validity is doubtful in light of the later Supreme Court decision in Estate of Putnam v.

However, pursuant to taxpayers\u2019 election under section 1375(f), the July 2-July 31, 1959 distributions are not includable as dividends in taxpayers\u2019 1951 gross income. Thus, taxpayers are entitled to a partial refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-7\">Because the distributions in question (September 16 and October 1, 1959) are regarded as distributions out of Elevators\u2019 earnings and profits for the year ending May 31, 1960, appropriate adjustments must be made on remand in order to determine the tax consequences of the section 1375(f) election and of subsequent distributions to taxpayers during I960.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Upon consideration of these appropriate adjustments, on remand the district court is to determine the correct amounts of the 1959 deficiencies and 1960 overassessments and to enter judgment for taxpayers in an amount equal to the difference in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>amounts paid by taxpayers and the recomputed net deficiencies, see note 28 <em>supra, </em>plus statutory interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1223-9\">.

If there are no cash distributions to the shareholders during the corporation's taxable year (or within <em>2y\u00a1\u00a1 </em>or 3% months thereafter as provided in section 1375(f)), the taxable income of the corporation, as defined by section 1373(d), is labelled \u201cundistributed taxable income\u201d (with certain adjustments not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>pertinent here).

The amount of cash distributions, to the extent they are distributions out of earnings and profits of the taxable year, see section 1373(c), reduce \u201cundistributed taxable income\u201d and, of course, are taxable to the shareholder dividends. The \u201cundistributed taxable income\u201d (or the taxable income of the corporation minus such cash distributions) is included in the gross income of each shareholder.
