The motion of the Retail Stores Employees Union Local No. 20 to intervene. was granted and such intervention was permitted upon briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-12\">In June, 1966, the National Labor Relations Board (hereinafter, the \u201cBoard\u201d) issued a decision and order, 159 NLRB 854 (1966), in which it found that Lou De Young\u2019s Market Basket, Inc. (hereinafter the \u201cCompany\u201d) had violated Section 8(a) (1), (3) and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act and ordered the Company to cease and desist from such unfair labor practices and to take certain affirmative action including recognition and good faith bargaining with the Retail Store Employees Union, Local No. 20 (hereinafter, the \u201cUnion\u201d). Upon petition to enforce the Board\u2019s order, this Court enforced the Board\u2019s initial order in full. In so doing, this Court affirmed the Board\u2019s factual findings that the Company engaged in unlawful \u201cthreats, surveillance and interrogation\u201d in response to the Union\u2019s organizational drive, that the Company discharged three workers during the Union campaign as a result of their Union activities and beliefs, and that the Company had no good faith doubts as to the majority status of the Union adherents when it refused to bargain with the Union in response to the latter\u2019s unequivocal bargaining demand based upon valid authorization cards. Further, this Court characterized the Company\u2019s conduct as \u201ca substantial and sustained effort to thwart * * * [its own] employees in their efforts to organize the store\u201d by committing unfair labor practices which may be described as \u201cflagrantly coercive.\u201d NLRB v. Lou De Young\u2019s Market Basket, Inc., 406 F.2d 17, 25, 26 (6th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-15\">In June, 1969, the United States Supreme Court decided, NLRB v. Gissel Packing Company, 395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1965), in which it laid down guidelines as to when a Company\u2019s refusal to bargain in violation of Section 8(a) (5) may give rise to a bargaining order. Subsequently, the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and remanded this case to this Court \u201cwith instructions to remand * * * to the National Labor Relations Board for further consideration in light of NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., Inc., ante, p. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547.\u201d 395 U.S. 828, 89 S.Ct. 2125. Shortly thereafter, this Court remanded the case to the Board in conformity with the Supreme Court\u2019s order, 414 F.2d 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-16\">In February, 1970, the Board issued a supplemental decision and order in which it found that the various acts of interference, restraint, coercion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>discriminatory discharges committed by the Company in its campaign to defeat the Union\u2019s organizational efforts were \u201cso coercive and pervasive as to destroy the conditions for a free election.\u201d Further, the Board found that the unfair labor practices committed were so severe that the \u201cemployee sentiment as expressed through authorization cards is a more reliable measure of employee desires on the issue of representation than an election in this case.\u201d This later factual finding is based upon the premise that an election would be held after \u201cneutralization by any conventional remedies.\u201d Upon those factual findings, the Board issued an order affirming its original bargaining order. The Company challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the factual findings of the Board as to the possibility of a new election being fair.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">In <em>Gissel Packing, </em>the United States Supreme Court stated that before issuing a bargaining order as a remedy for a \u00a7 8(a) (5) refusal to bargain where an employer has committed independent unfair labor practices, the Board must determine which of three categories of unfair labor practices and circumstances were present. First, in those cases in which \u201c \u2018outrageous\u2019 and \u2018pervasive\u2019 unfair labor practices\u201d occur, a bargaining order may be imposed without need to inquire into the majority status of the representation. Such eases would be limited to those practices of \u201c \u2018such a nature that their coercive effects cannot be eliminated by the application of traditional remedies, with the result that a fair and reliable election cannot be had.\u2019 NLRB v. S. S. Logan Packing Co., 386 F.2d 562, 570 (C.A. 4th Cir. 1967).\u201d \u201cOutrageous\u201d and \u201cpervasive\u201d unfair labor practices would include a situation such as the \u201cillegal discharges of four employees (a majority of the Union adherents and half of its [the Company\u2019s] working force),\u201d G.P.D., Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 430 F. 2d 963, No. 19963 (6th Cir. 1970). <em>See </em>Bok, The Regulation of Campaign Tactics in Representation Elections Under the National Labor Relations Act, 78 Harv.L.Rev. 34, 132-139 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">Second, where a union has made a \u201cshowing\u201d of majority representation \u201cat one point\u201d and. the employer has engaged in \u201cmisconduct\u201d which has the \u201ctendency to undermine majority strength and impede the election process,\u201d the Board has the discretion to issue a bargaining order. In exercising its discretion, the Board should look to the effect of the employer\u2019s conduct on election conditions and the likelihood of the occurrence of unfair labor practices in the future. Further, since the Board \u201cdraws on a fund of knowledge and expertise all its own\u201d in making judgments as to the effect of unfair labor practices, it should be regarded as being in a \u201cbetter\u201d position than reviewing courts to \u201cestimate * * * the effects on the election process of unfair labor practices of varying intensity,\u201d NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. at 612 n. 32, 89 S.Ct. at 1939.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is for the Board, rather than the reviewing courts, to determine whether the discriminatory discharge of employees, the intimidation of Union representatives, United Steelworkers of America v. NLRB, 126 U.S.App.D.C. 215, 376 F.2d 770 (1967), or other coercive and unfair labor practices have made the possibility of a fair rerun election so slight \u201cthat employee sentiment once expressed through cards would, on balance be better protected by a bargaining order.\u201d NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. at 614-615, 89 S.Ct. at 1940. And upon review we are urged not to substitute our discretion for that of the agency, NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. at 612 n. 32, 89 S.Ct. 1918; Consolo v. FMC, 383 U.S. 607, 621, 86 S.Ct. 1018, 16 L.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>Ed.2d 131 (1966), unless it reflects so gross an abuse of power as to be arbitrary. Consolo v. FMC, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Third, where the unfair labor practices have a minimal impact on the election machinery, the Board is charged not to issue a bargaining order. Such \u201cminor\u201d unfair practices would probably include a limited interrogation of employees to poll employee sentiment which while it may be violative of Section 8(a) (1) and the requirements set out in Struksnes Construction Co., 165 NLRB, No. 102, \u201cmight not be serious enough to call for a bargaining order,\u201d NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. at 609, 89 S.Ct. at 1938. <em>See </em>Aaron Brothers, 158 NLRB 1077, Hammond &amp; Irving, Inc., 154 NLRB 1071 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">Applying these guidelines to the instant case, the Board found that the Company\u2019s unfair labor practices were \u201cpervasive\u201d and \u201ccoercive;\u201d and that, in any case, the \u201cuse of traditional remedies\u201d could not assure that an election would better protect the employees\u2019 rights already expressed through authorization cards. The Board points to two pieces of evidence to support its conclusions: the discharging, by the Company of three active union supporters during the Union\u2019s organizational campaign and the occurrence of six other independent violations of Section 8(a) (1), including threats of job layoffs. The Board further points out that this Court has characterized the Company\u2019s conduct as \u201cflagrantly coercive\u201d and a substantial and sustained [unlawful] effort to thwart * * * efforts to organize * * * [the Company\u2019s] store.\u201d NLRB v. Lou De Young\u2019s Market Basket, Inc., 406 F.2d at 25, 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">Upon a review of the entire record including the brief of the parties, we once again cannot say that the findings of fact made by the Board with regard to the Company\u2019s refusal to bargain are not supported by substantial evidence, as the Company contends. NLRB v. Lou De Young\u2019s Market Basket, Inc., 406 F.2d 17. Further, the Board\u2019s remedy of a compulsory bargaining order appears to be a \u201creasonable vindication of the Act and its purposes,\u201d United Steelworkers of America v. NLRB, 376 F.2d 770 (1967), in view of the number and severity of the unfair labor practices engaged in by the Company during the Union organization activities. Such practices, particularly the circumstances of the dismissals of three leading union adherents and the threat of employee layoffs, are sufficient to bring this case within the \u201cintermediate situation\u201d in Gissel Packing Co. in which the Board is given the discretion to determine whether \u201cthe risks that a fair rerun election might not be possible were too great to disregard the desires of the employees already expressed through cards.\u201d NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. at 615, 89 S.Ct. at 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">Finally, the Company contends \u201cthat the issuance of a bargaining order is now clearly inappropriate in view of the substantial and nearly complete turnover of bargaining unit employees which has occurred since\u201d the unfair labor practices took place. Clark\u2019s Gamble Corp. v. NLRB, 422 F.2d 845 (6th Cir. 1970). This precise issue was raised in G.P.D., Inc. v. NLRB, 430 F.2d 963, No. 19963 (6th Cir. 1970) and this Court held that <em>Clark\u2019s Gamble </em>was to be read narrowly and limited to the situation of an unusually long delay and almost complete turnover of employees occasioned by the Board\u2019s own inaction. The instant case, like G.P.D., involves such voluntary Company actions as coercive unfair labor practices and discriminatory discharges which are \u201cgross violations of the NLRA;\u201d and such Company actions \u201cdirectly caused both the turnover of employees and the delay.\u201d G.P.D., Inc. v. NLRB, 430 F. 2d at 963.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-11\">The petition for review is denied and the cross petition for enforcement of the Board\u2019s supplemental order is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b974-5\">. With regard to the effect of specific labor practices the Court did indicate that studies have shown that \u201cthreats to close or transfer plant operations\u201d seem less remediable than \u201cthreats to eliminate benefits or refuse to deal with the union if elected,\u201d 395 U.S. 611 n. 31, 89 S.Ct. 1938.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
