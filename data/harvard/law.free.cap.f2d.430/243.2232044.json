Jenkins from disallowance of her claim to social security benefits. Mrs. Jenkins was 57 years old in April of 1967\u2014 the time of the hearing in this case. She had worked for many years for the Union Carbide Company as a salad maker in the cafeteria. Her husband is also employed there; they have no de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>pendent children. Appellant claims that because of her disabilities<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> she quit work in April of 1966. In September of that year she retired from Union Carbide at a monthly pension of $57.00.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Application for Disability Insurance Benefits filed June 27, 1966, describes the disabilities upon which she relied as \u201cDiabetes, Ulcers, Bursitis,\u201d and stated that she had become disabled on April 1, 1966. Initially, the Secretary, after reviewing what was before him, denied her application. Upon request for reconsideration, the Social Security Administration reviewed the material before it. The Department on February 17, 1967, advised Mrs. Jenkins,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aim\">\u201cYou stated that you became unable to work in April 1966, at age 55, because of diabetes, ulcers and bursitis. Our records show that you have a sixth grade education and worked as a salad maker in a cafeteria. \u201cThe medical evidence includes reports from your treating physican, hospital records and the results of special examinations which were arranged for you. This evidence reveals that you have a history of diabetes and ulcers. However, it is shown that these conditions are controlled by diet and medication and the state of your nutrition is not disturbed. Although you have recurrent attacks of bursitis, the evidence establishes that this condition responds to therapy and does not seriously limit your ordinary activities. We realize that you may experience occasional pain and discomfort. However, the evidence does not support a conclusion that your condition is so severe as to prevent you from performing your usual work. Therefore, the denial of your claim is affirmed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU6\">Upon her request, a hearing was had before a trial examiner at which appellant was represented by counsel. Included in the record made in considering appellant\u2019s application were reports of her hospitalization on several occasions, reports of doctors who had examined her for the Secretary, and reports of her own treating doctor. Of the doctors who examined plaintiff and expressed views as to whether she was disabled, the following were the observations of such of them as examined her at the request of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">On September 7, 1966, Dr. I. Reid Coll-mann concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-9\">\u201cRecommendations: It would appear that this patient does have cholelithia-sis proven by previous x-rays, but this situation could be modified by corrective surgery. Also her diabetes and ulcer situation should be able to be managed by good medical therapy. <em>Following these corrections we feel that this patient is not restricted but probably has some degree of restriction until that time.\" </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">Dr. R. A. Obenour, on January 23, 1967, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-11\">\u201cMinimal arteriolar schlerosis was noted on funduscopic examination. She may have some bronchitis related to her smoking but the extent of this is not thought to be severe. <em>I believe that some improvement could be expected from weight reduction, continued diabetic control, cessation of smoking, and if necessary more specific treatment for her chronic bronchitis. </em>On the basis of the present findings she might be limited by her pulmonary impairment from performing heavy work <em>but would not be limited for performing moderate or light work on a sustained basis. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">Walter C. Shea, who had been her treating physician for some years before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>the present proceedings, said on December 5, 1966:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">\u201cAt times she is ambulatory with limitation of employment due to chronic and persistent illness.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-6\">\u201cShe is unable to hold down any job which requires much physical labor for any prolonged period of time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Finally, on May 7,1967, Dr. Shea stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">\u201cDue to multiplicity of complaints I believe Mrs. Jenkins has shown over the past two years I believe her absenteeism rather marked and she is an unreliable employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-9\">\u201cI believe she can be gainfully employed for short periods of time if she can find employment under these circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">Mrs. Jenkins had a multiplicity of complaints, suffering from bronchitis, diabetes, chronic overweight, bursitis and ulcers. Her weight had varied. At the time of the hearing she was 5' 6\" tall and weighed 185 pounds. She had once reached a weight of 190. She considered that her proper weight was 160 pounds, although about four years prior to the hearing she weighed 139 pounds. She testified at the hearing that she had then quit her diet, finding it too burdensome. Control of her diabetes and ulcers was impaired by her failure to follow the advice of \u00abdoctors. She was then smoking about one package of cigarettes every two days, although she had been advised to quit or to cut down on her smoking to control her bronchial complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">Despite her ailments, all of the doctors, including her own treating physician, expressed the view that appellant could engage in moderate or light work, albeit, according to Dr. Shea, her reliability was questionable as a result of her absenteeism. The vocational counselor, a University of Tennessee professor, expressed the opinion that light work within appellant\u2019s limited competence was available within the area of her place of residence. He testified that such light work included employment as a salad maker, cashier, or nurse\u2019s aid. The trial examiner concluded as a matter of factual finding,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO7\">\u201cThe examining physicians, including claimant\u2019s own treating physician, are unanimous in their findings that even though the claimant does not have the residual capacity to engage in productive substantial gainful activity requiring physical exertion or labor for any prolonged period of time, neither of them rule out claimant\u2019s residual capacity to be gainfully employed in performing moderate or light work on a sustained basis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-14\">and in another style said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-15\">\u201cUpon the basis of all the evidence of record in this case, and the conclusions and deductions made from such evidence, the hearing examiner finds that the claimant has failed to present sufficient evidence to establish that she has an impairment or impairments in combination severe enough to preclude her from engaging in any type of substantial gainful activity for a continuous period, without interruption, of not less thhn 12 months\u2019 duration and that, therefore, her application is without merit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ao-R\">No question is raised as to the competence, integrity or credibility of the medical witnesses Collmann and Obenour who examined appellant for the Secretary. If there is some degree of conflict between Dr. Shea and these doctors, we are not persuaded that we should ignore their testimony or fault the examiner for relying upon their views. Lane v. Gardner, 374 F.2d 612, 616 (6th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-16\">The burden of proving the disability which would entitle an applicant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>to social security benefits is upon such applicant. Henry v. Gardner, 381 F.2d 191 (6th Cir. 1967); Erickson v. Ribicoff, 305 F.2d 638 (6th Cir. 1962); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d) (5). The disability which must be shown is defined in Section 223(d) (1) of the Act as,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-4\">\u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d) (D.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">This Circuit had adhered to a Court made rule that if an applicant has established inability to engage in his or her regular employment, but has some residual capacity for light work, the burden is on the Secretary to show what light work the applicant can do and that such light work is being performed within reasonable proximity to the applicant\u2019s place of residence. Massey v. Celebrezze, 345 F.2d 146 (6th Cir. 1965); Hall v. Celebrezze, 314 F.2d 686 (6th Cir. 1963); May v. Gardner, 362 F.2d 616 (6th Cir. 1966). Whatever the present applicability of such rule, the Secretary\u2019s burden was met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">We affirm the District Judge who granted the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment upon his view that the findings of fact of the Secretary were supported by substantial evidence and were binding upon him. We are of a like view. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); Nelson v. Gardner, 386 F.2d 92, 94 (6th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">We are constrained, however, to say this much more, limited to plaintiff\u2019s \u201cclaim\u201d of impaired eyesight. Appellant did not claim impaired eyesight in her application for benefits. Eye trouble appeared first as a result of some questions put to her by the trial examiner. We discuss it only because the dissent places great weight on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">In her original application for benefits, she described her disabilities as \u201cdiabetes, ulcers, and bursitis,\u201d never once mentioning poor eyesight. The report of disability interview merely cheeks off a box denoting that appellant displayed some difficulty with her eyesight, but otherwise deals at length only with her other complaints. The record made contained reports of Mrs. Jenkins\u2019 hospitalization on several occasions. No mention of eye trouble is contained in any of these \u2014 the last relating to a period from April 22, 1966, the date she gives as the beginning of her total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">A total of ten doctors who had examined appellant on various occasions before and after the time of the claimed commencement of her disabilities,- filed written reports. These included the several doctors who would see her at a hospital visit. In one report dated January 23, 1967, there is a notation \u201cvision reduced in both eyes for about one year.\u201d In another of these reports, the examining doctor includes in his general report of physical examination, \u201cPupils are equal, react to light and accommodation * * *. <em>f </em>Fundoscope examination is negative.\u201d Other than the foregoing, the doctors\u2019 reports make no reference to eye trouble. Her own Dr. Shea, upon whom she had long relied for treatment and upon whom she places chief reliance, makes no mention whatever of impaired eyesight as one of his patient\u2019s difficulties.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">Mrs. Jenkins testified at the oral hearing on April 21, 1967. She was examined by her attorney and then by the trial examiner. On examination by her own attorney, she was asked to give the reasons for her inability to continue working. <em>She did not mention eye </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>trouble.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mention of it appeared only in the resumption of questioning by the trial examiner.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-4\">\u201cQ. Why don\u2019t you drive?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">A. I can't see. Lines runs together and I can\u2019t see which way I\u2019m going. I can\u2019t judge my distance. My eyes just \u2014 letters seems like it just gets foggy. I just don\u2019t try it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">She then went on to say that her eye troubles persisted even when she wore her glasses; that she did not read much at home \u201cwithout its big reading and big print.\u201d She then answered that a Dr. Millis had checked her eyes.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">At the conclusion of the hearing the trial examiner suggested that appellant\u2019s counsel obtain a report from Dr. Millis. The hearing was then adjourned to May 9 to hear testimony of a vocational counselor. On that date appellant\u2019s attorney produced a letter from the optometrist, Dr. Fred B. Millis, O.D., dated at Lenoir City, Tennessee, Mrs. Jenkins\u2019 place of residence, advising of an examination of Mrs. Jenkins on May 4, 1967. The report was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">\u201cRe: Irene C. Jenkins.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-9\">On May 4, 1967 I examined the vision of Mrs. Irene Jenkins of Route 4, Lenoir City, Tenn. This is a record of my findings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-10\">Vision without glasses:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-11\">Rt. Eye 20/200 Lt. eye 20/200 Both 20/200</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"axj-dedup-0\">Vision with glasses:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-12\">Rt. eye 20/20 Lt. eye 20/30 Both 20/20</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-13\">Stereopsis is low; there is a definite vertical deviation in the alignment of her eyes resulting in double vision. The eye pressure was within normal range. Due to the vertical deviation and the inability <em>to see </em>equally as clear out of both eyes, she suppresses vision in her right eye.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-19\">She has a record of variable blood pressure as well as a diabetic condition. Each of which makes it almost impossible to stabilize her visual problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-20\">I have been examining Mrs. Jenkins\u2019 vision since July, 1963; during this period of time I have observed a general deterioration in her vision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-21\">Sincerely,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-22\">/s/ Dr. Fred Millis, O.D.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-23\">In this report Dr. Millis expresses no opinion as to what, if any, effect Mrs. Jenkins\u2019 eye condition would have upon her ability to work. He states that with glasses Mrs. Jenkins\u2019 combined vision of both eyes would be 20/20. To the layman, 20/20 vision is normal vision. The intendment of the optometrist\u2019s other recitals, if of relevancy here, is not expressed. While \u201cdouble vision\u201d sounds ominous, standing alone it gives no idea of the import or frequency of such disorder. What treatment might be employed to alleviate it is not set out. Certainly this report does not justify an assertion that the lady is \u201cnearly blind\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-24\">This report was received in evidence with the examiner's comment that \u201cit [the report] will be received in evidence * * * and the vocational witness, of course, will want to examine it as part of the medical evidence in this case.\u201d Although the examiner made no specific reference to the optometrist\u2019s report in reciting the difficulties and disabilities that were disclosed by the testimony and record, we assume that the vocational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>counselor had examined the optometrist\u2019s report prior to his conclusion that Mrs. Jenkins could be gainfully employed. On cross-examination by appellant\u2019s attorney, the vocational expert did answer that nurses aides and cashiers would require sufficient eyesight to do the customary duties of that work \u2014 reading a thermometer or the numbers on a cash register, taking blood pressure and cheeking pulse.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">At the conclusion of the May 9 hearing, the record was kept open to allow appellant\u2019s counsel to obtain further medical evidence from Dr. Shea. A final report from Dr. Shea, Mrs. Jenkins\u2019 own doctor, dated May 17, 1967, was received. Although the optometrist\u2019s report was then available, Dr. Shea\u2019s report makes no mention whatever of impaired vision. As set out above, he concludes his final letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\">\u201cI believe she can be gainfully employed for short periods of time if she can find employment under these circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">At the same time as the filing of Dr. Shea\u2019s report, Mrs. Jenkins\u2019 attorney filed her affidavit which for the first time included a claim that impaired eyesight was a contributing element to her disability. She said, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6O\">\u201cI have cut myself on these machines on occasion, and to a certain extent they are dangerous for a person with my eyesight, and with my other ailments, which cause me to bleed more easily, to black out, etc.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The trial examiner\u2019s decision considers the late claim of reduced eyesight specifically, but concludes, as previously quoted, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">\u201cUpon the basis of all the evidence of record in this case, and the conclusions and deductions made from such evidence, the hearing examiner finds that the claimant has failed to present sufficient evidence to establish that she has an impairment or impairments in combination severe enough to preclude her from engaging in any type of substantial gainful activity for a continuous period, without interruption, of not less than 12 months duration and that, therefore, her application is without merit.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">The trial examiner found that appellant did not meet her burden of proof. The Secretary joined in that conclusion. Neither the District Court nor this Court can strike down these conclusions unless it can be said that they were without support by substantial evidence. King v. Celebrezze, 341 F.2d 108, 109 (6th Cir. 1965); Hall v. Celebrezze, 340 F.2d 608 (6th Cir. 1965); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). The mere belated mention of impairment of eyesight, without evidence to support a claim that it disabled appellant from gainful employment, will not do to meet her burden of proof, either before the Secretary or the courts on review.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-5\">. Her husband testified that the burden of her work was in part responsible for appellant\u2019s disabilities. He said that after she left her job, Union Carbide <em>had to hire about six people to replace her.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b304-13\">. The record does not warrant the statement that plaintiff was \u201cawarded her <em>full </em>retirement benefits for <em>total </em>disability.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b305-17\">. Despite these chronic illnesses, Mrs. Jenkins had a good earnings record up to April 1, 1966. For the 25 quarters after 1959, her average quarterly earnings were $1,082.51.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b307-14\">. After testifying at length about her difficulties without any mention of eye trouble, the following testimony was given, under questioning by her own counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-15\">\u201cQ. Did you have any other problems about doing your work other than your legs and your back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-16\">\u201cA. Well, no, not nothing but through my arms and my shoulders. Well, they got, you know, with that bursitis and stuff and I couldn\u2019t lift no pans or anything up over my head; and we had to lift them and put them up in a box; and I couldn\u2019t lift them up, had to have help on that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-26\">We are not convinced that failure to rely on eye trouble was the fault of appellant\u2019s lawyer. The entire record is persuasive of appellant\u2019s belated reliance on it as a disability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b308-9\">. The vocational counselor did not say that plaintiff needed \u201cunusually good vision\u201d for this work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b308-18\">. The hearing examiner did not say that \u201cclaimant\u2019s deteriorated visual impairment results from her negligent failure to remedy her diabetes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b355-58\">Column Use</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b308-14\">McALLISTER, Senior Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AjHX\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-15\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-16\">As a preface to this dissent, it may be said that it used to be easy enough for an appellate court to affirm an administrative agency on the ground that the findings were supported \u201cby substantial evidence,\u201d if it could find just a trace of evidence to support them. But that is not the case anymore. Congress grew critical of such affirmances which ignored conflicting evidence and, in turn, brought about harsh criticism of the courts for such decisions on the ground that cases were affirmed merely because the appellate court could find evidence in the record which, <em>viewed in isolation, </em>substantiated a Board\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-17\">In Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Bd., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456, Mr. Justice Frankfurter de-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>dared: \u201cProtests against \u2018shocking injustices\u2019 and intimations of judicial \u2018abdication\u2019 with which some courts granted enforcement of the Board\u2019s orders stimulated pressures for legislative relief from alleged administrative excesses,\u201d with the result that the Taft-Hartley Act provided that such findings of fact must be \u201csupported by substantial evidence <em>on the record as a whole. </em>* * * We conclude, therefore, that the Administrative Procedure Act and the Taft-Hartley Act direct that courts must now assume more responsibility for the reasonableness and fairness of Labor Board decisions than some courts have shown in the past. Reviewing courts must be influenced by a feeling that they are not to abdicate the conventional judicial function. Congress has imposed upon them responsbility for assuring that the Board keeps within reasonable grounds. * * * The Board\u2019s findings are entitled to respect; but they must nonetheless be set aside when the record before a Court of Appeals clearly precludes the Board\u2019s decision from being justified by a fair estimate of the worth of the testimony of witnesses or its informed judgment on matters within its special competence or both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Since, as hereafter appears, there have been a great number of reversals compared to the affirmances of the decisions of the Hearing Examiner and the Secretary, this court has held in Sayers v. Gardner, 380 F.2d 940, 943 (C.A. 6), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\"><em>\u201cthe records should be carefully examined and reviewed by the courts, and an opinion should generally be written, setting forth the facts and the law, to show that the courts have, in reality, assumed more responsibility for the reasonableness and fairness of the decisions of federal agencies, than some courts have shown in the past; </em>and that reviewing courts must be influenced by a feeling that they are not to abdicate the conventional judicial function, as we have been directed and cautioned by the Supreme Court in Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B. <em>supra, </em>for this case obviously means that courts should scrutinize the decisions of agencies, more than they have in the past, to ascertain whether they are reasonable and fair. The great number of errors and reversals, in the past, in these cases, constitute a warning signal.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">The appellate courts obviously took notice of the commands of the Supreme Court as to \u201csearching the record\u201d in review of agency findings, since little has been said by the Supreme Court on that subject since.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">However, in disability benefit cases under the Social Security Act, the decisions of Hearing Examiners and their findings of fact and conclusions of law, upon which the Secretary\u2019s decisions were based, became so unjustifiable and hostile to the rights of poor people who became disabled, that the reviewing federal courts were shocked, and repeatedly reversed those decisions; and later adjudications, reversing like decisions, pointed out the unusual number of such cases that the courts were obliged to reverse, compared to the number that were affirmed, and emphasized what the Supreme Court had said as to <em>searching </em>examinations of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">As an instance, Judge Feinberg in Scott v. Celebrezze, 241 F.Supp. 733, 736 (S.D.N.Y.), emphasized how searching must be the review by the courts of the action of the Secretary, observing that in the cases reported in volumes 227-236 of Federal Supplement, the Secretary had been reversed or remanded 47 times, while upheld only 27 times. Likewise, in Seldomridge v. Celebrezze, 238 F.Supp. 610, 620 (E.D.Pa.), Judge Higginbotham emphasized that for September, October, and November of the 1964 Federal Supplement, the Social Security Administration was reversed in at least 75% of the cases and that 90% of the reversals were because of lack of substantial evidence to support the findings of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">In Miracle v. Celebrezze, 351 F.2d 361, 382 (C.A. 6), this court commented on the statement made in Lightcap v. Celebrezze, D.C., 214 F.Supp. 209, 216, that the court, as adjured by the Supreme Court \u201cmust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>now assume more responsibility for the reasonableness and fairness\u201d of the federal agencies \u201cthan some courts have shown in the past,\u201d and \u201cReviewing courts must be influenced by a feeling that they are not to abdicate the conventional judicial function.\u201d And the court emphasized;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-4\">\u201cThe review of cases for disability benefits under the Social Security Act is onerous from many aspects. The case before the Hearing Examiner is heard informally. This means that there is practically no examination or cross-examination of any witnesses, except the claimant himself, usually a man whose life has been one of hard labor, and with little education; and, sometimes, a Vocational Counselor. The record, for the most part, consists of letters and written statements regarding the disability claimed, the extent of it, or the lack of it. Many of these statements consist of official printed forms of applications and reports filled in, in the handwriting of various individuals; and their reproduction in the record often requires laborious decipherment. These records call for searching investigation by the district courts, and further searching investigation by appellate courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">In the light of the prevailing opinion, therefore, it appeared that a dissent thereto should clearly show that a searching examination of the record has been made, and the undisputed facts fully stated ; and it is this consideration which accounts for the length and detail of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Appellant, Irene C. Jenkins, claimant herein, filed an application for disability benefits under the Social Security Act and, after denial by the Division of Disability Operations, filed an appeal from such denial, and asked for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">On the hearing, the Hearing Examiner denied her claim on the ground that her impairments did not constitute disability under the provisions of the Social Security Act. Appellant sought review by the District Court which, in effect, affirmed the decision of the Hearing Examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">We are of the opinion that the District Court and the Hearing Examiner were in error in holding that appellant was not disabled for the performance of substantial gainful activity by reason of a medically determinable physical impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">The purported evidence, on which the findings of the Hearing Examiner are based, crumbles upon careful analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">The errors in the findings of the Hearing Examiner are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-12\">1. The Hearing Examiner was guilty of prejudicial reversible error in holding that \u201cclinical evidence\u201d meant \u201cobjective clinical evidence\u201d \u2014and, although it appears that there was an enormous amount of \u201cclinical data\u201d or \u201cclinical evidence\u201d supporting the petitioner\u2019s claim, the Hearing Examiner held that there was \u201cvery little data\u201d if any, to support the evidence of claimant\u2019s attending physician, Dr. Shea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-13\">2. The Hearing Examiner was guilty of prejudicial error in making no findings as to the chief cause of claimant\u2019s disability \u2014 musculoskel-etal impairments, which were sustained by a wealth of medical evidence and undisputed by anyone. The doctors employed by the Social Security Administration, upon whom the Hearing Examiner relied, never mentioned claimant\u2019s musculoskeletal disorders, which were the chief bases of her claim for disability. The Hearing Examiner did not even address a question to his so-called expert, the Vocational Counselor, with regard to these musculoskeletal impairments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-14\">3. The Hearing Examiner\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s diabetes was mild and could be controlled was not sustained by substantial evidence, while the evidence of her attending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>physician was clear and definite that, even with the administration of insulin, her diabetes was uncontrollable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">4. The Hearing Examiner was guilty of prejudicial error in giving more credence to the report of a physician employed by the Social Security Administration, who had seen claimant on only one occasion, and dismissed the. evidence of the physician who had attended her for six years and also reported on her impairments, treatments, and hospitalizations, together with numerous other physicians who had examined claimant over a period of years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">5. The Hearing Examiner was guilty of prejudicial error in his findings that claimant\u2019s impairment of eyesight and vision was due to her negligence in not following her treating physician\u2019s directions for diet to control her diabetes, when there was no evidence that claimant\u2019s impairment of vision resulted from her failure to follow her physician\u2019s instruction as to diet to control her diabetes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">6. The Hearing Examiner was guilty of reversible error in holding that claimant\u2019s attending physician, and the reports of other medical witnesses, were unanimous in their findings that, even though the claimant does not have the residual capacity to engage in productive substantial gainful employment, requiring physical exertion or labor for any prolonged period of time, neither of them rules out claimant\u2019s residual capacity to be gainfully employed in performing moderate or light work on a sustained basis. In fact, they indicate she has the capacity to engage in moderate work on a sustained basis. Claimant\u2019s attending physician did not make any finding that claimant could do moderate work on a sustained basis. He stated that he believed only that \u201cshe can be gainfully employed for short periods of time * * Ability to do moderate work for short periods of time is not the capacity to engage in \u201csubstantial gainful activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-10\">7. The Hearing Examiner was guilty of prejudicial error in his findings in paying no attention to the evidence of claimant\u2019s pain, which was the causative factor in her stopping her work, and in failing to inquire of his Vocational Counselor what result such pain might have if she tried to resume her work\u2014 and in failing even to mention \u201cpain\u201d in his hypothetical questions to the Vocational Counselor, and in failing even to mention the word \u201cpain\u201d in his findings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">As a preliminary matter to the understanding of the issues, certain statements in the prevailing opinion warrant discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">First, the prevailing opinion states that there are three errors in the statement of fact in this opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-13\">1. \u201cthe Hearing Examiner did not say that \u2018claimant\u2019s deteriorated visual impairment results from her negligent failure to remedy her diabetes.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-14\">As a statement preliminary to the discussion of the case, it is to be said that the Hearing Examiner not only said that\u2014 he said it much more specifically and emphatically when he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-15\">\u201cSince the filing of her application, claimant also complains of <em>poor vision. </em>* * * She has, however, visited an Optometrist, who examined the claimant as late as May 4, 1967, and found that her poor vision is correctable with glasses to 20/20 in the right and 20/30 in the left. He further notes that claimant has a record of variable blood pressure as well as a diabetic condition which makes it almost impossible to stabilize <em>her visual problem </em>and that he has observed a <em>general deterioration </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number><em>in her vision, </em>since July 1963. Again, it is noted here that with claimant\u2019s full cooperation with her treating physician in following his instructions for controlling her diabetes and obesity, this impairment, too, can be greatly improved and stabilized.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">It is to be remarked that the optometrist did not find that \u201cher poor vision\u201d is \u201ccorrectable with glasses.\u201d He did not mention the phrase, \u201ccorrectable with glasses.\u201d He did state that during the prior four years, there was \u201ca general deterioration of her vision.\u201d There is a difference between vision with glasses and \u201cpoor vision,\u201d as a result of disease. The so-called \u201cpoor vision\u201d was not correctable with glasses because claimant had what he stated was \u201cdouble vision\u201d; and her stereopsis, or depth perception, was low, and she had been suffering a general deterioration in her vision for several years. However, to revert to the statement that \u201cthe Hearing Examiner did not say that claimant\u2019s deteriorated visual impairment results from her negligent failure to remedy her diabetes,\u201d the foregoing quotation from the Hearing Examiner\u2019s findings is certainly a statement that if she cooperated with her treating physician in controlling her diabetes \u2014 which the Hearing Examiner found she did not do \u2014 this deterioration and impairment of her vision could be greatly improved and stabilized. Is this not the same as a statement that claimant\u2019s deteriorated visual impairment results from her negligent failure to remedy her diabetes ? That is what the Hearing Examiner stated and meant. The statement in the prevailing opinion to the contrary was apparently made under a misapprehension of what the record showed.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">There is no evidence of any kind to support the finding that claimant\u2019s visual impairment could be improved by following instructions for controlling her diabetes. No one ever contended that claimant's visual impairment could be remedied by following instructions for controlling her diabetes during the hearing; no one testified to it or mentioned it, and no medical report faintly suggested it.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">In the prevailing opinion it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">\u201cThe record does not warrant the statement that plaintiff was \u2018awarded her full retirement benefits for total disability.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">What the record shows, however, is that, after her employer paid her full salary for four months, during which she was physically incapacitated but kept on the rolls as an employee, the employer, when claimant\u2019s personal physician ordered her not to work anymore, arranged with his insurer, and paid her a disability pension of a lump sum of $900.00, and a monthly pension of $56.37. These payments were made for claimant\u2019s total disability. They were considered retirement benefits for total disability. Were they the <em>full </em>retirement benefits for total disability? That does not specifically appear in the record. Whether they were the <em>full </em>retirement benefits for total disability- \u2014 \u25a0 and the prevailing opinion questions the use of the word \u201cfull\u201d \u2014 or substantial benefits for total disability, is not a crucial issue here, and makes no difference as far as this case is concerned; and, if it causes any dispute, the word \u201cfull\u201d can be omitted \u2014 and it is hereby omitted\u2014 without affecting the results for which this opinion stands; although I believe, as far as the employer and the insurer go, the payments were for <em>full </em>retirement benefits for total disability. Without the addition of the word \u201cfull,\u201d the record substantiates that the payments made by the employer and insurer to the claimant were retirement benefits for disability from doing any work whatever for her employer (which was ordered by claimant\u2019s personal physician) \u2014 or, for total disability. This important point is undisputed that the retirement benefits paid to claimant by the employer and his insurer were for total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">The third and final statement in the prevailing opinion with regard to the statement of facts in this opinion is that the report of Dr. Fred Millis</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>3. \u201cdoes not justify an assertion that the lady is \u2018nearly blind.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">In this opinion, it is not stated that the report of Dr. Fred Millis justified an assertion \u201cthat the lady is \u2018nearly blind.\u2019 \u201d Dr. Millis had made a report with regard to claimant, stating that \u201cstereopsis is low.\u201d When stereopsis is low, it means that the person\u2019s visual depth perception is low. Dr. Millis also said that she had a vertical deviation in the alignment of her eyes resulting in double vision. (I shall demonstrate later that double vision is perfectly understandable by reference to Webster\u2019s International Dictionary; and the court takes judicial notice of dictionary definitions.) Dr. Millis also said that \u201cdue to the vertical deviation and inability to see equally as clear out of both eyes, she suppresses vision in the right eye.\u201d He also stated: \u201cIt is almost impossible to stabilize her vision properly.\u201d He further stated that for four years before his examination on March 4, 1967, he had \u201cobserved a general deterioration in her vision.\u201d In addition to the foregoing, claimant, who had always driven a car, testified that for the previous year she had been unable to drive a car because the lines kept running together. She further stated, as observed in the prevailing opinion, \u201cthat her eye troubles persisted even when she wore glasses; that she did not read much without it\u2019s big reading and big print.\u201d Also quoted in the prevailing opinion is her examination before the trial examiner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">\u201cQ. Why don\u2019t you drive?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-8\">A. I can\u2019t see. Lines run together and I can\u2019t see which way I\u2019m going. I can\u2019t judge my distance. My eyes just \u2014 letters seems like it just gets foggy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">It was not stated in this opinion that Dr. Millis reported that \u201cthe lady is \u2018nearly blind.\u2019 \u201d But, as this opinion demonstrates and as shall be shown later, the statement that \u201cshe is nearly blind\u201d seems completely justified by the uncon-tradicted evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">As far as the statement in the prevailing opinion goes that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">4. \u201cThe Vocational Counselor did not say that plaintiff needed \u2018unusually good vision for this work.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">(reading clinical thermometers as a nurses\u2019 aide and checking patients\u2019 pulse with the use of a second hand on a watch) \u2014extensive discussion follows later.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">Claimant is a woman fifty-eight years old. She is five feet, six inches tall and weighs 185 pounds. She never went beyond the sixth grade, and has never had any special training. She is married but has no children under the age of eighteen. Her only work experience has been as salad-maker in a cafeteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">As early as November 5, 1960, seven years before the hearing in this case, claimant was admitted to the East Tennessee Baptist Hospital. She was then suffering from a number of afflictions. She was a patient in the hospital at that time for a period of ten days. Doctors Inge, Willien, and Crumley, in consultation, made a diagnosis of claimant, finding that she was suffering from sub-deltoid bursitis, right, and psychoneurosis. At the same time, Dr. Dan Davis reported a diagnosis, which he made at the hospital, of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-14\">\u201c(1) Acute periarthritis, right shoulder</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-15\">(2) Diabetes mellitus, mild, controlled (history)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-16\">(3) Anxiety reaction with conversion manifestations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-17\">With this condition existing in 1960, claimant\u2019s physical and mental state appears to have deteriorated greatly since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-18\">We shall first discuss claimant\u2019s own testimony; that of her husband, and the evidence of the doctor who examined her to attempt to remedy her visual defects for several years, up to the date of the hearing. Thereafter, we shall examine and consider the general medical evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>On the hearing held on April 21, 1967, claimant testified, first, with reference to her obesity, stating that diet did not affect it; that, when in the hospital, she was placed on a diet of 1500 calories, she gained, in a short time, four pounds; that she had not driven a car for a long time because her eyesight had become so poor, that the lines ran together and she could not see where she was going; that her optometrist, Dr. Fred B. Millis of Lenoir City, Tennessee, had tried to check her eyes in the Summer of 1966, but that, because of the diabetes \u2014 \u201cthe sugar has been running so high on me that he can\u2019t check \u2019em.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">While the hearing was still open, and upon the request of the Hearing Examiner for a further report from Dr. Millis, her optometrist, the latter, on May 4, 1967, furnished the requested report, in which he gave his findings of her vision and stated that she had a vertical deviation in the alignment of her eyes resulting in double vision; that due to the vertical deviation and inability to see equally as clear out of both eyes, she suppressed vision in her right eye, and that during the prior four years there had been a general deterioration in her vision.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">This was the only expert evidence in the case with regard to claimant\u2019s vertical deviation in the alignment of her eyes, resulting in double vision, inability to see equally as clear out of both eyes, inability to stabilize her vision because of variable blood pressure and a diabetic condition, and general deterioration of her vision over the preceding four years, up to and including the time of the hearing; and it supports the undisputed testimony of claimant that she could not drive a car because of her poor eyesight which caused the lines of the road to run together, resulting in her not being able to see where she was going; that her glasses did not help her in reading\u2014 \u201cI can\u2019t do no good with my glasses, either\u201d; and that she was not able to read \u201cwithout it\u2019s awful big reading and big print * *</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Claimant testified she worked as a salad-maker in the cafeteria at Oak Ridge, for the Union Carbide Company for twenty years and seven months. She stated that the last work she performed was on June 18, 1966; that she felt sick all that week, and on the following Monday morning, she got up to go back to work, and \u201cI just couldn\u2019t stand up. My back and legs just wouldn\u2019t work with me. I was just sick. * * * I went to the doctor that day.\u201d Up to the last day of her work, she testified, \u201cI hadn\u2019t been too regular [in her work]. I\u2019d been, you know, I was sick so much. Well, right at the first of \u201966, why I held out pretty good; then about six months of it then, I had it from there on out, you know, just up and down in the hospital, back home. He [the doctor] would keep me off four or five weeks then I\u2019d go back and work a while, and then I went back, I was sick again. He put me in the hospital, and I went back home.\u201d For the first fifteen years that she worked for Union Carbide, \u201cI made it pretty good. * * * The last five years went to going down on me.\u201d She testified it got \u201creally bad, * * * in \u201966, and \u201965. The last of it. * * * I would work some maybe and I was off some. * * * Got to where I stayed off so much, well in \u201966 I was off a lot and so they \u2014 I just couldn\u2019t make it. * * * They just stopped; see, they terminated me and I didn\u2019t get to go over there. I didn\u2019t get to go back and make it. * * * They terminated me while I was off sick.\u201d The ground of termination was loss of time. The company told her that if she didn\u2019t take her retirement, they would \u201cautomatic fire me, terminate me,\u201d so she told them that if that\u2019s the way they felt about it, she didn\u2019t have any other choice, so she retired. She testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">\u201cQ. What was the reason that you couldn\u2019t do the work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">A. Well, I just wasn\u2019t able to do it. I wasn\u2019t able to stand on that concrete and do it. I just couldn\u2019t hold out there. They took me off of it and wouldn\u2019t let me go back on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Q. Who did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">A. Dr. Shea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">Q. Dr. Shea? Is he your family doctor ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">Q. Well, what would happen while you were working? You say you couldn\u2019t stand up under it? Explain just what\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">A. Well, my back \u2014 my back and legs would hurt me and they just would give down on me, and I fell two or three times over there, and I just couldn\u2019t stand to stand up under it, and I couldn\u2019t do the work. It was too much heavy lifting, and I just couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">Claimant testified that her job as a salad-maker \u2014 making different kinds of salad- \u2014 -required her to stand on her feet eight hours, \u201cthe whole time, we got thirty minutes for lunch.\u201d She also stood in the line and served the salad. \u201cSome of us stood in line and served it and kept the line going; and others would go back in the back and keep things \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-11\">\u201cQ. Did you have any other problems about doing your work other than your legs and your back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-12\">A. Well, no, nothing but through my arms and my shoulders. Well, they got, you know, with that bursitis and stuff and I couldn\u2019t lift no pans or nothing up over my head; and we had to lift them and put them up in a box; and I couldn\u2019t lift them up, had to have help on that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">Part of the claimant\u2019s job was lifting the pans, putting them in the refrigerator ; and she could not lift her arms over her head. She didn\u2019t have the strength to hold things without bracing her arms against her side; if she didn\u2019t, she would drop them. At the time of the hearing, she had had that condition nearly a year. She had not had an operation, because she said they couldn\u2019t operate on her because of her diabetes, because of \u201cthis sugar. * * * It won\u2019t heal up.\u201d She also had ulcers, according to her family physician, Dr. Shea. She had been in the hospital six times during the two years prior to the hearing, once for seventeen days, the other times, for eight or nine days, except the last time for five days. She was in the hospital for the arthritis, and then for her diabetes;, and, afterward, for ulcers and a few months before the hearing, for pneumonia. Her diabetes, she said, made her dizzy. She took 65 units of insulin every morning. Before insulin, which she had been taking for about six months, the disease had been fairly well controlled by pills\u2014 Orinase. She also was troubled with \u201csmothering,\u201d a difficulty in catching her breath, nervousness. There was no question that she had gall-bladder disease, and had gallstones for several years before the hearing. At the time of the hearing claimant testified she did the cooking for her husband and herself. She could not clean the house, or do sweeping; she had been hiring a woman to do that. Since the cleaning woman had been sick, claimant said she had been \u201cpretending\u201d to sweep and clean, but she couldn\u2019t do it. She could not mop or wax. \u201cIt just kills me * * *. It just pulls my back in two.\u201d Claimant\u2019s husband testified that, in addition to his work as a truck driver for Union Carbide, he did the mopping and waxing when he got home at night; that he was worried about her trying to do any such housework because of her diabetes; that a few months before the hearing, he had found claimant on her bed, \u201cblacked out\u201d; \u201cshe couldn\u2019t breathe, and I rushed her to the hospital.\u201d He also testified that she had fallen at work on several occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-15\">First of all, it is to be emphasized that the Union Carbide Company, claimant\u2019s employer at the cafeteria where she worked at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, awarded her retirement benefits for total disability, after her employment with the company for a period of twenty years and seven months. The disability payments from the company commenced in October 1966. At that time claimant was awarded a lump sum payment of $900.00 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>and payments on disability pension of $56.37 a month. In spite of a high absentee record, because of her numerous hospitalizations, and because of her doctor\u2019s orders to remain at home during many of her painful and chronic illnesses \u2014her last p,eriod of absence from work being for four full months, from June 1, 1966, to October 1, 1966 \u2014 the company continued to pay her full pay during that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The reason claimant gave for the award of retirement benefits from the company for her disability was: \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to work and I wasn\u2019t able to keep up my job and hold up my job * * * I just wasn\u2019t able to do [the work]. I wasn\u2019t able to stand on that concrete and do it. [Dr. Shea] took me off of it and wouldn\u2019t let me go back on it. [He] is [my] family doctor. * * * my back and legs would hurt me and they would just give down on me, and I fell two or three times over there, and I just couldn\u2019t stand to stand up under it, and I couldn\u2019t do the work. It was too much heavy lifting, and I just couldn\u2019t do it * * * my feet flew out from under me or something happened, and I fell and went back under the back. * * * I fell in the canteen hall there [another time] I fell on my back there * * * I got to where, you know, I couldn\u2019t make it back over there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">We proceed, then, to discuss the medical evidence in the case. As has been remarked, in 1960, seven years before the hearing, claimant was admitted to the East Tennessee Baptist Hospital in Knoxville, where she was a patient for ten days, and where three physicians, in consultation, made a diagnosis that claimant was suffering from subdeltoid bursitis, right, and psychoneurosis, and Dr. Dan Davis reported a diagnosis of acute periarthritis, right shoulder, diabetes mellitus, mild, controlled (history), and anxiety reaction with conversion manifestations.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">On April 22, 1966, claimant was admitted to the Charles H. Bacon Hospital, in London, Tennessee, with an admitting diagnosis of purulent bronchitis, cervical myositis, and hemorrhoids, and a past history of diabetes mellitus, duodenal ulcer, recurrent cystitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. She had a cough and a low grade fever. Her response to antibiotics was poor, and her diabetes poorly controlled. Her doctor, as was stated in the hospital case history, was Walter C. Shea, Jr. Dr. Shea, in the hospital report at that time, stated that he had been treating claimant for two years for bronchitis, gastroenteritis,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pyelitis, and that her last illness \u201chas been for Puru-lant Bronchitis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-13\">On an official \u201cReport of Disability Interview\u201d by William P. Merritt, on behalf of the Social Security Administration, on June 27, 1966, Mr. Merritt, after reciting what claimant stated about her complaints, went on to report: \u201cShe seemed to walk with difficulty. She had rather extreme difficulty in talking to the point, that at times she was incoherent. When she first sat down she seemed out of breath. Her left arm seemed to be stiff, and she appeared to have limited use of it. * * * She had trouble remembering, writing, responding and understanding questions. She also seemed very nervous. She certainly appeared to be in some noticeable physical distress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-14\">On July 20, 1966, at the request of the Social Security Administration in Knoxville, Tennessee, Dr. Gino Zanolli examined claimant and rendered a general medical report. Dr. Zanolli is a specialist in occupational medicine and preventive medicine, and is Assistant Director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratories at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which is in charge of periodic physical examinations of employees of the Union Carbide Company, for which claimant worked. Dr. Zanolli reported that claimant was found to be a diabetic in 1959, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>disease had been controlled with diet and oral medication, but that as a result of a number of annual examinations, most observers felt that the control of her diabetes was only fair, at best; that she had upper gastrointestinal complaints which have been diagnosed as peptic ulcer, \u201cand has had flare ups periodically on this basis. Was diagnosed many years ago as having possible gall bladder disease. * * *\u00bb j)r. Zanolli also reported to the Social Security Administration that claimant \u201chas had musculoskeletal complaints of a chronic nature and intermittent back complaints. Several multiple episodes of bursitis, particularly affecting left shoulder and lower extremity joints. She has also had intermittent GU (genito urinary) complaints, presumably on a recurrent cystitis basis. * * * She has had some evidence of peripheral arteriosclerosis, likely associated with her diabetes. She has been overweight most of her work period, ranging from a few pounds to as much as 40 lbs, and has a high absentee record.\u201d Dr. Zanolli\u2019s diagnosis was: Diabetes mellitus, controlled with diet and medication since 1959 but, as he had previously noted, most of the medical observers in \u201cperiodic examinations on an annual basis\u201d for the seven years prior to his examination, felt that such control was \u201cfair at best.\u201d Dr. Zanolli diagnosed claimant as also suffering from chronic upper gastrointestinal complaints compatible with peptic ulcer syndrome; multiple joint complaints, low grade, possibly indicative of low grade rheumatoid arthritis; obesity, varying from mild to considerable; borderline high blood pressure; possible chronic gall bladder disease, and sporadic episodes of cystitis.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Under the heading of \u201cPhysical Findings\u201d appearing on the official approved form of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, provided by the Social Security Administration for Dr. Zanolli\u2019s report, Dr. Zanolli listed the findings of the \u201cLast complete periodic examination * * * done on 4-13-65, performed by Dr. A. Seaton Garrett, Jr., ORNL (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) Health Division Staff Physician. <em>Specific findings </em>on that occasion were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxO\">\u201c(1) Diabetes mellitus</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-10\">(2) Hypertension (BP [Blood Pressure] within normal limits today)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-11\">(3) Duodenal ulcer (minor symptoms at present)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-12\">(4) <em>Cholelithiasis with recent episode of cholecystitis</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-13\">(5) Obesity</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-14\">(6) Post-menopausal vaginal bleeding, etiology undetermined.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-15\">Cholelithiasis is defined as: \u201cThe production of, or condition of being affected with, biliary calculi, or gallstones.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-17\">Cholecystitis is defined as: \u201cInflammation of the gall bladder.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-19\">On December 5, 1966, Dr. Walter C. Shea, Jr. wrote a letter to claimant\u2019s attorney, which was a part of the evidence before the Hearing Examiner, in which Dr. Shea stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-20\">\u201cThe information we have sent to Social Security is completely inadequate for evaluation of her disability for Social Security.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-21\">\u201cHer condition at this time is that she is a Diabetic on Insulin for some six (6) months, prior to this she was fairly well controlled on oral medication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-22\">\u201cShe has had two episodes of Duodenal Ulcer with partial obstruction and has had recurrent urinary tract infection with one episode of Pyelitis.

This developed into Fibrositis aggravated by Cervical Arthritis. She was out of work the month of June and was hospitalized June 23, 1966, and was discharged on July 2, 1966. She remains out of work all of this time due to shoulder trouble, through September, 1966.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-14\">\u201cIn October she had a laceration of the left hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-15\">\u201cIn November, 1966, she had an acute flare-up of her Cervical Arthritis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-16\">\u201cIn February, 1967, she was hospitalized for an acute Bronchitis. She was hospitalized for six days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-17\">\u201cAt this time [May 17, 1967] her Diabetes is still uncontrolled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-18\">\u201cDue to multiplicity of complaints I believe Mrs. Jenkins has shown over the past two years I believe her absenteeism is rather marked and she is an unreliable employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-19\">\u201cI believe she can be gainfully employed for short periods of time if she can find employment under these circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-20\">In addition, then, to the reports and diagnoses of Doctors Davis, Inge, Willien, and Crumley, in 1960 (which were made while claimant was confined in the East Tennessee Baptist Hospital), we here repeat and group together in outline form, for greater clarity, the treatment and diagnoses of Dr. Shea, Dr. Zanolli and Dr. Garrett to emphasize the musculo-skeletal afflictions of claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-21\">Dr. Shea had treated and diagnosed claimant\u2019s illnesses and afflictions from July 11, 1961, to May 17, 1967, and, in addition to twenty-nine office calls in a little over three years, from July 11, 1961, to November 11, 1964, had treated her as his patient during hospitalization for (1) duodenal ulcer; (2) diabetes mellitus; (3) myositis of the left shoulder in January 1965, and chronic backache and peripheral edema (disabling claimant for work on March 1, 1965); (4) acute flareup of arthritis with low back strain in November 1965; (5) acute low back strain and acute myositis of the left shoulder, developing into fibrositis aggravated by cervical arthritis in June 1966 (claimant, as a result of shoulder and low back trouble, was hospitalized on June 23, 1966, discharged on July 2, 1966, and remained out of work all of this time from June through September 1966 because of pain resulting therefrom) ; (6) on July 20, 1966, Dr. Zanolli <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>diagnosed claimant as suffering from multiple joint complaints, low grade, possibly indicative of low grade rheumatoid arthritis. Dr. Zanolli, in an official Medical Report of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, further stated: (7) \u201cMrs. Irene C. Jenkins has been an employee of Union Carbide for the past 21 years. <em>She has had a number of different medical entities in this time, and has had a number of periodic examinations on an annual basis in this time </em>[twenty-one years]. * * * She has had musculoskeletal complaints of a chronic nature and intermittent back complaints. (8) Several multiple episodes of bursitis, particularly affecting left shoulder and lower extremity joints.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) (9) In November 1966, Dr. Shea diagnosed claimant as suffering from acute flare-up of cervical arthritis.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">None of the foregoing acute, painful, chronic conditions are doubted or questioned by anyone. For more than six years, claimant, although suffering almost continual pain from bursitis, peri-arthritis, acute myositis of the left shoulder, chronic backache, acute low back strain, cervical arthritis and other musculoskeletal afflictions, kept on with her work, as well as trained new personnel, in spite of being hospitalized many times; and, in spite of a high absentee record \u2014 because of her afflictions and as a result of doctor\u2019s orders \u2014 increased her earnings to the point that, as the Hearing Examiner remarked, she had an \u201cexcellent earnings record. She hadn\u2019t missed a single quarter of earning social security credits up through March 31st, 1966, and her earnings in some of those years were * * * at least the maximum that is subject to social security taxes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">However, <em>the finding of fact of the Hearing Examiner, </em>sustained by the Appeals Council and the Secretary, <em>that the recurrent episodes of \u201cmusculoskeletal complaints were associated with claimant\u2019s failure to follow the regime for diet and medical control for her diabetes\u201d is without any support in the evidence, </em>either in the medical reports filed in evidence, or in the testimony of any of the witnesses; and, in this regard, we refer to the medical witnesses employed by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">Two physicians were retained by the Social Security Administration to examine the applicant: one, Dr. I. R. Coll-mann, referred to by the Hearing Examiner as a specialist in gastroenterology, and the other, Dr. R. A. Obenour, referred to as a specialist in pulmonary diseases. Dr. Collmann and Dr. Obenour saw claimant on only one occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">In Dr. Collmann\u2019s Medical Evaluation of Claimant he has this to say under the heading \u201cMusculoskeletal: Numerous musculoskeletal complaints not well localized but generally affecting all joints, including the back. I cannot get these categorized with any swelling or any significant visible arthropathy.\u201d Under the heading of \u201cImpression\u201d in the Medical Evaluation, Dr. Collmann made no mention of musculoskeletal conditions. Under the heading \u201cRecommendations,\u201d Dr. Collmann stated: \u201cWe will evaluate the studies that have been ordered up to the present time, and make final recommendations following that report.\u201d Under \u201cPhysical Examination,\u201d Dr. Coll-mann, with regard to claimant\u2019s muscu-loskeletal condition, stated: \u201cShow minimal osteoarthropathy, nothing else.\u201d Dr. Collmann had no X-rays taken, except for the chest and for gastrointestinal trouble; none for musculoskeletal conditions. In the \u201cRecommendations\u201d made following that report, Dr. Collmann in his final statement made no mention whatever of claimant\u2019s musculoskeletal condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">Dr. Obenour, in his report, under the heading \u201cImpression\u201d did not mention anything whatever about claimant\u2019s musculoskeletal condition; and under the heading \u201cDiscussion\u201d he stated that claimant presented multiple <em>complaints </em>referable to the musculoskeletal system; but in his final discussion and report to the Social Security Administration, Dr. Obenour said nothing whatever about her musculoskeletal condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>All of the foregoing undisputed evidence clearly supports claimant\u2019s own testimony that when she was ordered by her family physician, Dr. Shea, to enter the hospital on June 23, 1966, and, on his orders, remained out of work from then on through September 1966, it was because of her musculoskeletal afflictions already described in detail by six different doctors and that, accepting such undisputed medical evidence, her testimony in conformity therewith is also to be accepted \u2014 she wasn\u2019t able to do the work; that she wasn\u2019t able to stand and do it; that her back and legs would hurt and \u201cgive down\u201d on her; that, as a result she fell two or three times in the cafeteria toward the end of her service there; that she couldn\u2019t stand up under it and couldn\u2019t do the work; that the work of heavy lifting was too much for her; that her feet flew from under her causing her to fall on her back or fall to the floor at other times while she was at work; that she got to where she \u201ccouldn\u2019t make it back over there\u201d; and that during this time she suffered almost continual pain resulting from these disabling afflictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">There is no evidence that, in the most remote way, suggests that claimant\u2019s testimony in this regard is not true. In fact, all of the evidence points to the absolute truth of her statements of her cervical pain, shoulder pain, and low back pain as a result of disabling bursitis, arthritis, periarthritis, fibrositis, and other musculoskeletal disablement. To all of this evidence, the Hearing Examiner pays no attention. He makes no findings on the subject, except to indulge in the plainly erroneous statement that claimant\u2019s musculoskeletal complaints \u201cwere associated with her failure to follow the regime for diet and medical control of her diabetes,\u201d a finding that, as previously mentioned, is contrary to the undisputed evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The foregoing, it is to be observed, <em>is solely concerned, with claimant\u2019s musculo-skeletal afflictions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">This brings us to the discussion of <em>claimant\u2019s diabetes and its effect on her disability.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">As heretofore mentioned, claimant was suffering from diabetes in the latter part of 1959, which had been controlled up to July 20, 1966, according to Dr. Zanolli, the Assistant Medical Director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, who had examined her for her employer, the Union Carbide Company, on that date. It is to be emphasized that the diabetes had been controlled during this time in spite of the fact that, as Dr. Zanolli said, claimant had been overweight during most of the work period of more than twenty years, her overweight ranging from a few pounds to as much as forty pounds; and during the period of more than six years, from the time the disease of diabetes had been discovered, it is especially to be noted that <em>it had been controlled by diet and oral medication.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Dr. Dan Davis reported in 1960 that claimant\u2019s diabetes was controlled at the time she had been a patient in the East Tennessee Baptist Hospital for ten days in November of that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">Dr. Shea reported her diabetes was out of control in January 1965. In April 1966, Dr. Shea again reported her diabetes was out of control after hospitalization, and on May 4,1966, she was placed on insulin instead of the oral medication of Orinase. Throughout May 1966, Dr. Shea reported \u201cher blood sugar remained elevated even on Insulin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">In June 1966, she was hospitalized again \u2014 this time for acute low back strain, acute myositis of the left shoulder, developing into fibrositis aggravated by cervical arthritis, and, as a result of Dr. Shea\u2019s advice, claimant remained out of work for four months until October 1966; and in November 1966 had an acute flare-up of her cervical arthritis.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">On December 5, 1966, Dr. Shea reported that claimant had been on insulin for six months; that, before that time, her diabetes was fairly well controlled on oral medication; but that, afterward, even on insulin, her diabetes \u201cbecomes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>out of control.\u201d Claimant was hospitalized again in February 1967, during six days, for acute bronchitis. On April 21, 1967, claimant had testified before the Hearing Examiner. Afterward, on May 17, 1967, Dr. Shea reported her diabetes was still out of control even on insulin; and that was the last report filed in evidence. The two physicians employed by the Government, Dr. Collmann and Dr. Obenour, also made reports that were filed in evidence relating to claimant\u2019s diabetes, several months to a year before Dr. Shea\u2019s reports above mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Dr. Collmann examined claimant on September 29, 1966, and reported with reference to her diabetes: \u201cShe has a history of diabetes for several years but has been taking Insulin at the rate of 30 units per day since earlier this year, which seems to fairly well control it. She has been obese for a long time and has been gaining weight rather than losing weight <em>in spite of the fact she has chronic indigestion and pain throughout her abdomen particularly in the epigas-trium, not related specifically to type of food, </em>but stating if she puts a little bit of food in her stomach she is comfortable and if she puts too much she is uncomfortable or if she is empty she is uncomfortable.\u201d (Emphasis supplied) This was the only mention of diabetes by Dr. Collmann in his medical evaluation of claimant. His recommendations as to claimant\u2019s diabetes was: \u201cAlso her diabetes and ulcer situation should be able to be managed by good medical therapy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Dr. Collmann\u2019s medical evaluation, stating that claimant\u2019s diabetes seemed fairly well controlled under insulin, was made, it is to be noted, on August 29, 1966. This was three months after Dr. She\u00e1 had reported that claimant\u2019s blood sugar had remained elevated even on insulin, and was prior to Dr. Shea\u2019s report of December 5, 1966, that \u201cher Diabetes becomes out of control\u201d \u2014 and five months before Dr. Shea\u2019s final report that \u201cher Diabetes is still uncontrolled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Dr. Collmann\u2019s statement that, according to her history, claimant\u2019s diabetes <em>seemed </em>fairly well controlled since she had been taking insulin, was from her prior history which obviously was from Dr. Zanolli\u2019s report of July 20, 1966, in which he used the words \u201cthat control is fair at best\u201d with oral medication and diet, and from some prior report of Dr. Shea, which told of the shift to the use of insulin, in which he used the same words as Dr. Collmann that the diabetes was \u201cfairly well controlled\u201d before insulin, which, however, Dr. Shea, in the final medical report filed in the hearing, stated became \u201cout of control.\u201d We mention the source of Dr. Collmann\u2019s medical evaluation \u2014 \u201cshe has a history of dia<em>betes\u201d </em>\u2014 because <em>of the fact that he took no tests of her blood sugar. </em>He also stated that she had been \u201cobese for a long time and has been gaining weight rather than losing weight,\u201d although, he stated, this was not related to the type of food she ate. In fact, his further evaluation on this point was entirely contrary to the Hearing Examiner\u2019s finding that the increase in weight was due to caloric intake. Dr. Collmann did not mention her increase in weight as due to caloric intake. Dr. Collmann did not know, at the time of his report on August 29, 1966, that, as claimant testified on April 21, 1967, when Dr. Shea put her on a diet, <em>he told her the insulin shots would definitely make her gain </em>weight: that when he \u201cstepped them up\u201d \u201cwhy, my weight shot up!\u201d Everyone knows that increase of weight comes from other factors than caloric intake. Glandular trouble causes increase in weight, and drugs and medicines, of which insulin is one, affect certain glands. Moreover, after a challenging cross-examination by the Hearing Examiner, who was trying to prove that her weight increase was due to not following a diet of Dr. Shea, claimant, without qualification, stated that the last time she saw Dr. Shea she had \u201cbeen eating tomato and lettuce and stuff like that and bacon and eggs. That\u2019s what he told me to fix and eat, and cottage cheese, and stuff like that, and lettuce.\u201d It is undisputed that claimant was following this specific diet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>that Dr. Shea had finally and definitely told her \u201cto fix and eat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">In summation of Dr. Collmann\u2019s medical evaluation and recommendations as to claimant\u2019s diabetes, he stated: \u201cAlso her diabetes and ulcer situation <em>should </em>be able to be managed by good medical therapy.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) This is pretty indefinite. What kind of good medical therapy ?</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">This statement by Dr. Collmann is identical to the statement made by a physician employed by the Social Security Administration and rejected as substantial evidence in the recent case of Burrell v. Finch, 308 F.Supp. 264, 266 (D.C.Kansas) where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">\u201cThis doctor managed to report that in his opinion \u2018this patient is not at the present time totally disabled for gainful employment.\u2019 However, this opinion was modified by the statement, perhaps inadvertently overlooked by the Secretary, that this could be done \u2018with appropriate medical therapy and possibly psychotherapy.\u2019 He does not mention what this appropriate therapy might be, and success from treatment not described is speculative to say the least.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The reason for rejecting Dr. Collmann\u2019s testimony as speculative is even greater than the reason for rejecting the testimony in the <em>Burrell case, supra, </em>as the physician in the latter ease said that the situation \u201ccould be done with appropriate therapy,\u201d while Dr. Collmann reported only that it \u201cshould be able to be managed by good medical therapy.\u201d In either case, such medical evidence was too speculative to be considered as substantive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Dr. Shea had been treating her for years for diabetes, first, with oral medication, Orinase, which kept the diabetes under fairly good control and, afterward, when oral medication could not control it, with insulin, when the diabetes kept getting out of control, until his last report on May 17, 1967, nine months after Dr. Collmann\u2019s medical evaluation and report, when Dr. Shea finally reported:</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">\u201cAt this time her Diabetes is still uncontrolled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">There is nothing to indicate the treatment claimant was receiving during the years from Dr. Shea was not \u201cgood medical therapy.\u201d There was nothing that Dr. Collmann suggested that was stated to be better or different from the therapy that Dr. Shea was using. In his final recommendations, Dr. Collmann, after observing that claimant had gallstones, that this condition could be modified by a surgical operation, and that her ulcers and diabetes <em>should be able to be managed by good medical therapy, </em>stated that, following these corrections, he felt that claimant \u201cis not restricted but probably has some degree of restriction until that time.\u201d It is to be noted that Dr. Collmann, in his recommendations, never mentioned the musculoskeletal afflictions which were the chief cause of claimant\u2019s pain, suffering and disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">The reason that Dr. Collmann made no diagnoses of, or recommendations as to, claimant\u2019s musculoskeletal afflictions was that, because he was a specialist in gastroenterology, he was concerned with claimant's affliction of gallstones and recommended that this could be remedied by corrective surgery, and that after such surgery, claimant would not be \u201crestricted.\u201d It is to be emphasized that Dr. Shea, claimant\u2019s physician, who had been treating her continuously for six years, did not even mention the disabling effect of the gallstones \u2014 although the X-rays disclosed them, and although Dr. Garrett had found that claimant was suffering from inflammation of the gall bladder as a result. Dr. Shea obviously considered claimant to be in such a disabled condition from other afflictions that he considered it unnecessary to add to them, the items of gallstones and inflammation of claimant\u2019s gall bladder, from which admittedly she was suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">The next witness retained by the Government was Dr. Obenour, as previously mentioned. As to her diabetes, Dr. Obenour reported: \u201cShe has changes in her neurological examination consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>with peripheral neuropathy which may be related to her diabetes. * * * It is my understanding that she takes 65 units of insulin daily to control her diabetes. * * * She may have <em>some </em>bronchitis related to her smoking <em>but the extent of this is not thought to be severe. * * * </em>I believe that some improvement could be expected from weight reduction, continued diabetic control, cessation of smoking, and if necessary more <em>specific treatment </em>for her chronic bronchitis. On the basis of the present findings <em>she might </em>be limited by her pulmonary impairment from performing heavy work but would not be limited for performing moderate or light work on a sustained basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">The reason Dr. Obenour said nothing about claimant\u2019s musculoskeletal afflictions was because he never made an examination of her condition in this regard and stated in his report only, as to disability \u201con the basis of the present findings, she <em>might </em>be limited by her pulmonary impairment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Dr. Obenour\u2019s testimony that claimant <em>\u201cmay </em>have <em>some </em>bronchitis related to her smoking but the extent of this is not <em>thought </em>to be severe\u201d; that <em>\u201csome </em>improvement <em>could be expected </em>from weight reduction, continued diabetic control, cessation of her smoking, and if necessary <em>more specific treatment </em>for her chronic bronchitis,\u201d and that \u201cshe might be limited by her pulmonary impairment from performing heavy work,-but would not be limited for performing moderate or light work on a sustained basis\u201d \u2014 is as speculative as the testimony of Dr. Collmann: \"May have some bronchitis\u201d; \u201cnot thought to be severe\u201d; \u201cbelieve some improvement could be expected\u201d with \u201cmore specific treatment\u201d (not mentioning, however, what such specific treatment might be) and <em>\u201cmight be limited </em>by her pulmonary impairment\u201d \u2014all these statements are as speculative as those held to be too speculative to constitute substantial evidence in the <em>Burrell case, supra; </em>and as said by the court in that case, constituted \u201can opinion hedged with \u2018ifs\u2019 and \u2018possibilities,\u2019 \u2019 and that \u201ca denial of benefits should not be withheld from this claimant on this kind of evidence in the face of findings of <em>treating </em>physicians and the convincing facts and circumstances of the case.\u201d P. 266 (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Dr. Obenour, like Dr. Collmann, saw claimant on only one occasion, on January 23, 1967. He found that her blood sugar and urine sugar were normal \u201cat this examination.\u201d He believed that some improvement could be expected from weight and <em>continued diabetic control. </em>The fact was that, as appeared from the evidence of Dr. Shea, who had been regularly attending her over a period of six years, claimant\u2019s diabetes was out of control in January 1965. It was out of control in April 1966. Claimant was placed on insulin in May 1966, but her blood sugar remained elevated even on insulin. In May 1967, her diabetes was still uncontrolled, although insulin was being continually used by her. The foregoing evidence of Dr. Shea was the final medical evidence received on the hearing by the Examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">Here, then, are the reports of the doctors employed by the Social Security Administration, each of whom saw the claimant on only one occasion, and who made no mention of her musculoskeletal afflictions, from which the uncontra-dicted evidence shows she was suffering and which were the principal cause of her disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">FINDINGS OF HEARING EXAMINER</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">The findings of the Hearing Examiner are numerous and are so interspersed throughout a long opinion that, in order to demonstrate that they are unsupported by substantial evidence, it is necessary to disengage them from the body of the opinion and to discuss them in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">At the commencement of his findings, the Hearing Examiner states what appears to be his view of a broad and guiding rule for appraising the high value to be given to the evidence of physicians <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>employed by the Social Security Administration \u201cfor verification of the disability\u201d of a claimant for benefits under the Act, as contrasted with the doubtful value of the evidence of a physician to whom a patient goes for \u201ctreatment\u201d of his disability or, in other words, the value of the evidence in this case of physicians employed by the Social Security Administration for verification of a claimant\u2019s disability \u2014 and who see the claimant on only one occasion \u2014 and the lesser or doubtful value of the evidence of a physician who has treated the claimant for a continuous period of six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The Hearing Examiner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">\u201cThe evaluation of medical evidence for disability purposes is not always simple. The difficulty becomes apparent when we consider the difference in attitude of a patient who goes to a doctor for treatment, and a patient who goes to a doctor for verification of his disability. In the first case, the doctor has no reason to doubt the patient\u2019s story of his various symptoms, and clinical verification might be expensive and of little practical use in treatment. In the second case, where the patient is or may be seeking disability benefits of one kind or another, subjective symptoms have very little significance unless supported by clinical evidence. Too often the busy doctor fails to differentiate between these cases, and bases his diagnosis of the impairment of the disability applicant on the same subjective evidence he would consider important for the ordinary patient.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">In the foregoing statement, the Hearing Examiner misunderstands the meaning of the terms, \u201cclinical verification\u201d and \u201cclinical findings.\u201d He states that in the case where a patient goes to a doctor <em>for treatment, </em>\u201cclinical verification might be expensive and of little practical use in treatment,\u201d and that \u201csubjective symptoms have very little significance unless supported by clinical evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Clinical verification and clinical evidence are not limited to objective evidence. Clinical evidence means the recognition, assessment, and evaluation by a physician of a subjective complaint, such as pain, or of objective evidence, such as physical manifestations. In other words, clinical evidence is evidence applying to either objective or subjective symptoms. Homm v. Gardner, 267 F. Supp. 926 (D.C.Mo.). \u201cClinical verification\u201d or \u201cclinical evidence\u201d can only mean the recognition, assessment, and evaluation by a physician of subjective or objective symptoms. \u201cClinical\u201d is defined as: \u201cPertaining to or founded on actual observation and treatment of patients, as distinguished from theoretical or experimental.\u201d Dorland\u2019s Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 23rd Edition, Reprinted August 1960, W. B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia and London. It is obvious, then, that the statement of the Hearing Examiner that where a patient goes to a doctor for treatment, \u201cclinical verification\u201d might \u201cbe expensive and of little practical use in treatment,\u201d is meaningless since, as above stated, the word, \u201cclinical,\u201d means pertaining to, or founded on treatment of a patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">The further statement of the Hearing Examiner that \u201cwhere the patient is or may be seeking disability benefits of one kind or another, subjective symptoms have very little significance unless supported by clinical evidence,\u201d appears unintelligible, unless the Hearing Examiner considers clinical evidence to be the same as objective clinical evidence. It is difficult to imagine a case in which subjective symptoms are in issue, where there is no recognition, assessment, and evaluation of the symptoms by a physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">As an appraisal of the high value to be placed on the evidence, in this case, of the physicians employed by the Social Security Administration for \u201cclinical verification\u201d of disability, and the lesser importance to be placed upon the evidence of the personal physician of claimant, who is described under the classification of \u201cthe busy doctor\u201d who \u201cfails to differentiate between these cases\u201d \u2014 that is, between the case of the \u201cclinical veri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>fication\u201d of the patient\u2019s disability, and the \u201ctreatment\u201d of the patient, we are of the view that the Hearing Examiner, at the outset, fell into the prejudicial error of considering the evidence of the physicians of the Social Security Administration of a higher quality and value than the physician who had treated claimant over a period of many years and who understood her particular physical afflictions ; and that the Hearing Examiner\u2019s mistake was due to his misunderstanding of the terms, \u201cclinical verification\u201d and \u201cclinical evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The only explanation of this error that makes sense is that the Hearing Examiner considered that clinical evidence meant objective clinical evidence, and that clinical findings meant objective clinical findings. This was the prejudicial error in which the Hearing Examiner indulged in the cited case of Homm v. Gardner, <em>swpra, </em>and in a multitude of other cases, especially in this court, in which it has been decided that it was reversible error for a Hearing Examiner to hold that the requirement that a medical determination, supported by clinical findings, meant that it be \u201csupported by objective clinical findings. * * * The Act means nothing of the kind. * * * It was error on the part of the Hearing Examiner to hold, in this case, that the physician\u2019s opinions or conclusions must be supported by adequate objective clinical findings.\u201d Ross v. Gardner, 365 F.2d 554 (C.A. 6); Polly v. Gardner, 364 F.2d 969 (C.A. 6); Sayers v. Gardner, 380 F.2d 940 (C.A. 6); Marion v. Gardner, 359 F.2d 175 (C.A. 8); Lightcap v. Celebrezze, 214 F.Supp. 209 (D.C.Pa.); Page v. Celebrezze, 311 F.2d 757 (C.A. 5); Ber v. Celebrezze, 332 F.2d 293 (C.A. 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Pain, suffered by a Social Security claimant and disclosed only by subjective symptoms, does not mean that it ranks as a lesser type of disability than a disability with objective symptoms. Blan-scet v. Ribicoff, 201 F.Supp. 257 (D.C. Ark.). The Hearing Examiner obviously went upon the supposition that subjective evidence of pain ranks as a lesser type of disability than a disability with objective symptoms. The Hearing Examiner\u2019s statement that subjective symptoms have little significance unless supported by clinical evidence, would be irrelevant unless he meant that subjective symptoms have very little significance unless supported by objective clinical evidence; and such a holding would be reversible error. Yet, such obviously is the holding of the Hearing Examiner in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">For, from the Hearing Examiner\u2019s findings with regard to the evidence of claimant\u2019s personal physician, Dr. Shea, it clearly appears that the Hearing Examiner considered that clinical evidence means objective clinical evidence, since, in his Findings and Conclusions, he states \u201cthat the most favorable evidence in support of her application appears in the statements made by her treating physician, Dr. Walter C. Shea, Jr. (Exhibits 14 and 23) as summarized and quoted above at pages 5, 12 and 13. It is noted, however, that <em>very little clinical data, </em>if any, appears in his statements. He presents a long list of ailments and indicates claimant\u2019s frequency of visits for treatment since July 11, 61.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) What the Hearing Examiner means by \u201cvery little clinical data\u201d is very little objective clinical data. The clinical data appearing in Dr. Shea\u2019s statements and reports is enormous: A history of continual medical treatment of claimant over a period of six years, including treatment for duodenal ulcer, bronchitis, diabetes mellitus, recurrent cystitis, rheumatoid arthritis, purulent bronchitis, cervical myositis, gastroenteritis, pyelitis, urinary tract infection, bursitis, tendonitis, fibrosis secondary to acute bursitis of the left shoulder, chronic pulmonary disease, upper respiratory infection, osteoarthritic changes of the spine, labile hypertension, peripheral neuritis, chronic backache and peripheral edema \u2014 all of such diagnoses and treatment having occurred during a period of from several years before claimant filed her application for disability benefits up to and including a couple of months be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>fore the Hearing Examiner made his findings in this case. During this period of treatment, claimant was hospitalized for considerable periods under the supervision and treatment of Dr. Shea. He prescribed certain medicine for her ulcer, and Orinase and insulin for her diabetes over a long period of time, as well as medicine for her pain and diathermy treatments for various of her musculo-skeletal afflictions. In less than three and one-half years from July 11, 1961, to November 21, 1964, claimant had visited her physician\u2019s office on twenty-eight occasions, during which time she was hospitalized for two weeks in 1962; for ten days in April 1966; for four days in June 1966, and for six days in February 1967. After her hospitalization in June 1966, she remained out of work because of her shoulder trouble for four months, during which she was paid her regular salary by her employer. Finally, Dr. Shea told her she was to stop working. \u201cHe didn\u2019t let me go back on it.\u201d All of the time Dr. Shea was her attending physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">An order by a family physician to a person not to work is, to that person, controlling and should be given its deserved weight in determining disability. Smith v. Celebrezze, D.C., 239 F.Supp. 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">In spite of Dr. Shea\u2019s diagnoses and treatments of claimant during this long period of time, the Hearing Examiner filed findings that there was very little clinical data, if any, in Dr. Shea\u2019s statements, his long list of claimant\u2019s ailments, and the frequency of claimant\u2019s visits to him for treatment. The findings of the Hearing Examiner that the foregoing statements of diagnoses disclosed very Tittle clinical data, if any, is without any evidence to support it. Obviously, the Hearing Examiner considered that no data was clinical data unless it was objective clinical data. The fact that clinical data or clinical evidence means the recognition, assessment, and evaluation by a physician of subjective or objective symptoms was ignored by the Hearing Examiner, and the only explanation of that fact is that he mistakenly thought that clinical data or evidence meant objective clinical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">In Branham v. Gardner, 383 F.2d 614 (C.A. 6), a Hearing Examiner had held that \u201cthe Act requires that the impairment be \u2018medically determinable\u2019; that is, the existence of an impairment must be established by <em>objective </em>medical, clinical, or laboratory evidence.\u201d This court determined that the \u201cforegoing holding constituted prejudicial and reversible error,\u201d under the authority of Polly v. Gardner, 364 F.2d 969 (C.A. 6) and Ross v. Gardner, 365 F.2d 554 (C.A. 6). (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">In Branham v. Gardner, <em>supra, </em>the court stated that the rule governing the case was clearly set forth in Ferran v. Flemming, 293 F.2d 568, 571 (C.A. 5), in which it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-9\">\u201cOur review is ordinarily, of course, limited to determining merely whether there is substantial evidence to support the administrative findings. But here, just as in the \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 review of a judge\u2019s findings, <em>when the fact-finder has failed to employ the proper legal standard in making its determination the finding may not stand. </em>Mitchell v. Mitchell Truck Lines, 5 Cir., 1961, 286 F.2d 721; Henderson and Poole v. Flemming, 5 Cir., 1960, 283 F.2d 882; United States v. Williamson, 5 Cir., 1958, 255 F.2d 512; Mitchell v. Raines, 5 Cir., 1956, 238 F.2d 186. <em>The facts must be evaluated by the administrator in the light of correct legal standards to entitle the administrative findings to the insulation of the substantial evidence test.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">This court concluded that where the Hearing Examiner had held that the existence of an impairment must be established by objective clinical evidence, he was in error in evaluating the facts by correct legal standards and that, accordingly, there was no substantial evidence to support his findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">In Hall v. Celebrezze, 314 F.2d 686, 689, 690 (C.A. 6), an early leading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>case on the subject of disability benefits under the Social Security Act, Judge Weick, speaking for this court, declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">\u201cThe Secretary gave no weight to the uncontradicted opinion evidence of Doctors Scott and Blair heretofore set forth with respect to Hall\u2019s disability. Since the statute required that the disability result from a \u2018medically determinable physical or mental impairment\u2019 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(i) (1) and \u00a7 423(c) (2)), the claimant had no way of establishing his case if his credible medical evidence is disregarded. While the Secretary may have expertise in respect of some matters, we do not believe he supplants the medical expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">\u201cIn our opinion, it was competent for medical experts to testify as to the nature and extent of Hall\u2019s ailments, whether temporary or permanent, their treatment and prognosis. They could testify as to what effect these ailments had on his health and his ability to perform manual labor including the degree of his disability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The last important decision on the subject of a Hearing Examiner in applying improper standards in the determination of disability under the Social Security Act is to be found in Nelms v. Gardner, 386 F.2d 971, 973 (C.A. 6), where Judge Peck, speaking for the court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">\u201cThe record may fairly be considered conclusive as to appellant\u2019s inability to engage in gainful activities consisting of heavy manual labor, where lifting and bending is required, and in work requiring a relatively high degree of dexterity. <em>Thus, the principal impairment </em>alleged which might preclude appellant\u2019s employment in those light, sedentary jobs which demand neither of the above qualifications <em>is his complaint of continuous, knife-like pains in his back. </em>In discounting the severity of the pain complained of, the Secretary did not apply the proper standards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">\u201cFirst, the examiner stated that \u2018general conclusions or naked medical diagnoses are insufficient [to establish a medically determinable impairment].\u2019 This holding was erroneous (Ross v. Gardner, 365 F.2d 554 (6th Cir. 1966); Polly v. Gardner, 364 F.2d 969 (6 Cir., 1966)), as was the corollary ruling that \u2018the existence of a condition must be established by objective medical, clinical or laboratory evidence.\u2019 Ross v. Gardner, supra; Polly v. Gardner, supra; Branham v. Gardner, 383 F.2d 614 (6th Cir. 1967). It is clear from the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision that these errors were prejudicial and the case therefore must be reversed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">The Hearing Examiner\u2019s findings and conclusion that there was very little, if any, clinical evidence in Dr. Shea\u2019s reports of claimant\u2019s condition, afflictions, pains, and treatment, are completely unfounded in the evidence, and constitute prejudicial and reversible error. It is obviously based upon the supposition that clinical evidence means objective clinical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">The Hearing Examiner found \u201cthat the presence of an organic basis for the multiple complaints claimant has made, involving diabetes, gastrointestional disorder, and bursitis, etc., is not sufficient to establish disability within the Act,\u201d and that claimant \u201chad difficulty with the diabetic problem ever since 1959, which was aggravated by her exogenous obesity resulting in recurrent episodes of acute exacerbations of gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and vascular disorders, manifested by symptoms of duodenal ulcer * * *; possible gallstones; acute attacks of arthritis and bronchitis of brief duration.\u201d We refer to this finding to illustrate the Hearing Examiner\u2019s own acknowledgement of the almost unbelievable number of afflictions from which claimant suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">However, the Hearing Examiner made a finding that the evidence in the case, according to the two physicians employed by the Social Security Administration, disclosed that claimant's gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and vascular disorders were not severe, and were secondary to claimant\u2019s diabetic and obese condition; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>that her treating physician recommended a limited diet and control of diabetes by oral medication, commencing late in 1959 and extending to the Spring of 1966; that there was nothing else of record to show that claimant\u2019s obesity could not be controlled by a limited caloric intake; and that there was no indication that claimant had diligently followed her physician\u2019s advice with respect to diet, but had \u201cconfessed at the oral hearing that she did not stay on her diet regularly. There is also some indication that she does not take her insulin with sufficient regularity to keep her diabetes under control.\u201d However, upon a careful review of the record, we find there is no evidence to support any of the findings of the Hearing Examiner set forth in this paragraph on which the Government relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">As to the finding that claimant\u2019s diabetic problem \u2014 ever since 1959 \u2014 culminating in recurrent episodes of acute exacerbation of gastrointestinal, musculo-skeletal, and vascular disorders manifested by acute attacks of arthritis and bronchitis, was \u201caggravated by her exogenous obesity,\u201d a meticulous review of the record in this case, which has been studied and restudied for evidence, discloses that there is no evidence whatever to support a conclusion that claimant\u2019s diabetes was aggravated by exogenous obesity. No medical witness ever made such a statement. The word \u201caggravated,\u201d or any term similar to it in meaning, was never used by any witness; and the word itself appears nowhere in the record except in the Hearing Examiner\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">From 1959 to 1967, claimant was treated or examined by eight qualified physicians. None of these mentioned, in any diagnosis or report, \u201cexogenous obesity.\u201d Dr. Zanolli, in July 1966, reported that claimant had been found to be a diabetic in 1959, but that the disease had been controlled with diet and oral medication. In January 1967, Dr. Oben-our, the <em>ninth </em>physician to examine claimant, saw her on the single occasion when he was employed by the Social Security Administration to examine her. He reported that his \u201cimpression\u201d was that claimant\u2019s obesity was exogenous. He apparently arrived at this conclusion because claimant was considerably overweight. He did not know that claimant had been overweight sometimes as much as forty pounds during her entire working period. He did not know that Dr. Shea had told claimant that the insulin which she took would make her weight shoot up; and that it would definitely make her continue to gain weight as he increased the dosage. Dr. Obenour seems not to have inquired from claimant as to her diet, since she testified that her weight fluctuated, and that diet did not help her, and that when she was in the hospital on a diet of 1500 calories, she gained four pounds. Dr. Obenour made no examination of her to ascertain whether her obesity was exogenous but merely gave that as \u201chis impression.\u201d \u201cExogenous\u201d means that there is no physical malfunction of the body which causes obesity. Recognized causes of involuntary obesity include psychological factors. See opinion of Judge Edwards in Mefford v. Gardner, 383 F.2d 748, 765 (C.A. 6), dissenting from the majority opinion only as to cause of disability. Claimant had been diagnosed as suffering from psychoneurosis and anxiety reaction with conversion manifestations as early as 1961. See Branham v. Gardner, 383 F.2d 614 (C.A. 6), for discussion of psychoneurosis and anxiety reaction as factors in disability cases under the Social Security Act. Dr. Obenour found that claimant had changes in her neurological examination consistent with peripheral neuropathy (an affection of the nervous system) which may be related to her diabetes. This finding, then, supports claimant\u2019s testimony that her weight fluctuated and that diet did not help her, since Dr. Obenour\u2019s conclusion, which was supported by laboratory findings, that she had neurological changes consistent with peripheral neuropathy, disclosed psychological factors which are recognized causes of involuntary obesity.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>There was no evidence showing that claimant\u2019s obesity, exogenous or otherwise, resulted in recurrent episodes and acute exacerbation of gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and vascular disorders. As heretofore stated, claimant had been obese during all of her working period of twenty-one years, and overweight during that time, ranging from a few pounds to forty pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">In Sayers v. Gardner, 380 F.2d 940, 953 (C.A. 6), the Hearing Examiner, on the evidence of one of the medical reports that the applicant was obese, stated that obesity, in almost all cases, was remediable, and that, if claimant lost some weight, it might well be that she would have less pain and discomfort. <em>This court, in passing upon the accuracy of the Hearing Examiner\u2019s statement in the cited cases, declared that he obviously forgot that appellant had always been obese, </em>and had weighed approximately 195 pounds, not only at the time she underwent the medical examinations as a basis of securing disability benefits and at the time of the hearing, but was also of the same weight during all of her working years; <em>and that this fact showed lack of justification for the Hearing Examiner\u2019s view that appellant would suffer less pain if she lost some weight.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Obesity, which seems to be a fairly common condition in workers who have been disabled, is a consideration, not for rejecting their claims for disability benefits, but in explanation why, in many cases, employment in a different field is not available to them. Mefford v. Gardner, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">It is unreasonable to suppose that an abnormally obese', illiterate fifty-six-year-old, who is able to work with her arms and shoulders only with pain, and who is able to locomote at all only with labor, would be able to obtain and pursue substantial gainful activity. Brown v. Gardner, D.C., 251 F.Supp. 770, 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">If the claimant in the case before us was overweight ranging from a few pounds to forty pounds during her entire work experience of twenty-one years, her being overweight to the same degree at the present time is no evidence that her present disabled condition is the result of her being overweight.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">Dr. Obenour\u2019s report, which is so strongly relied upon by the Hearing Examiner in his finding that claimant\u2019s diabetes is remediable, is speculative on its face. Dr. Obenour stated: <em>\u201cI believe some improvement could be expected </em>from weight reduction\u201d and \u201ccontinued diabetic control.\u201d Dr. Obenour\u2019s statement of belief that <em>some improvement could be expected </em>points to speculation on his part. In Whalaen v. Ribicoff, 197 F.Supp. 1, 3 (D.C.Mass.), the court held that the phrases \u201cit would appear that,\u201d and \u201cwould not seem\u201d and \u201csome substantial gainful activity\u201d pointed to speculation on the part of the Referee and are too vague and indefinite to furnish a basis for the ultimate finding. For the same reason in the instant case, the mere statement of <em>belief </em>that <em>some improvement could be expected </em>is too indefinite to furnish a basis for the ultimate finding of the Hearing Examiner that sufficient improvement would result from weight reduction to remedy claimant\u2019s diabetes and to enable her to perform moderate or light work on a sustained basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">Likewise, Dr. Collmann\u2019s statement that claimant\u2019s diabetes <em>\u201cshould be able to be managed by good medical therapy,\u201d </em>and that \u201cfollowing these corrections, we <em>feel </em>that this patient is not restricted but <em>probably </em>has <em>some degree of restriction </em>until that time\u201d is likewise speculative and too indefinite to furnish a basis for the ultimate finding of the Hearing Examiner that claimant\u2019s diabetes is remediable.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">Without casting an implication of discredit upon Dr. Collmann and Dr. Obe-nour, it must be said that, in the light of the other medical reports in the ease embodied particularly in the evidence of Dr. Zanolli, who was in charge of the medical clinic that made annual physical examinations of claimant over a period of more than twenty years, and the evidence of Dr. Shea, who continuously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>diagnosed and treated claimant over a period of more than six years, the medical reports of Dr. Collmann and of Dr. Obenour are pretty skimpy, because they did not know that claimant had been obese and, at times, forty pounds overweight during various periods of her twenty-one years\u2019 service with her employer, and did not know of her musculoskeletal afflictions which were diagnosed as early as 1960 and treated continuously by Dr. Shea from 1961 to the middle of 1967. This is a valid explanation for their rather speculative statements since they saw claimant on only one occasion, when they were employed to examine her on behalf of the Social Security Administration which was opposing her claim for disability benefits. It is to be noted also that the fact that physicians were employed by the Social Security Administration, goes to the weight to be given their evidence. Colwell v. Gardner, 386 F.2d 56 (C.A. 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">It will be recalled that Dr. Collmann, who saw claimant once when, on behalf of the Social Security Administration, he examined her, stated in his \u201cRecommendations\u201d : \u201cIt does appear that this patient does have cholelithiasis proven by previous X-rays, but this situation could be modified by corrective surgery. Also her diabetes and ulcer situation should be able to be managed by good medical therapy. Following these corrections, we feel that this patient is not restricted but probably has some degree of restriction until that time.\u201d Dr. Collmann was completely mistaken about the amount of insulin which claimant was taking, stating that she was taking 30 units per day when her uncontradicted testimony was that she was taking 65 units per day. If he had not mistaken the amount of insulin which claimant was taking, he might have considered that her dosage of 65 units per day was \u201cgood medical therapy.\u201d Dr. Collmann \u2014 if we overlook the fact that his statement is speculative on its face, is concerned only with cholelithiasis, or gallstones, and with managing the diabetes and the ulcer by good medical therapy \u2014 which means only good remedial treatment. No details were given as to what such treatment should be, or whether or not claimant was already receiving it from Dr. Shea.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Dr. Obenour, after reviewing many of claimant\u2019s afflictions and the possibility of some improvement of them, stated that: \u201cOn the basis of the present findings <em>she might be limited by her pulmonary impairment </em>from performing heavy work but would not be limited- for performing moderate or light work on a sustained basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">The foregoing shows that one physician employed by the Social Security Administration was concerned with gallstones and corrective surgery and his opinion was that the diabetes and ulcer should be able to be managed by good medical therapy (although he did not know how much insulin claimant was taking at that time); and the other physician employed by the Social Security Administration reported that claimant\u2019s only impairment was pulmonary impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">The above evidence of Dr. Collmann and Dr. Obenour is not to be taken as substantial evidence controverting the other medical evidence of a greater disability, based on a larger number of disabling factors, of the seven other physicians examining or treating claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">As stated in the prevailing opinion, with reference to the evidence of Dr. Coll-mann and Dr. Obenour, no question is raised as to their competence, integrity, or credibility, and that if there is some degree of conflict between these doctors and Dr. Shea, the claimant's personal physician, he is not persuaded to fault the Examiner for relying on their views.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">It is admitted that no question is raised as to the competence, integrity, or credibility of Dr. Collmann and Dr. Obe-nour. But it does not matter how competent a doctor may be, a single examination by a physician employed by the Social Security Administration, <em>who saw a claimant only once, as contrasted with the evidence of a practicing physician who had been treating the claimant over </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number><em>a period, of years, would not be sustained by substantial evidence. </em>Teague v. Gardner, 281 F.Supp. 43, 48 (E.D.Tenn. N.D.), Miracle v. Celebrezze, 351 F.2d 361, 379 (C.A. 6), Combs v. Celebrezze, 382 F.2d 459 (C.A. 6), Colwell v. Gardner, 386 F.2d 56, 71 (C.A. 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Moreover, Dr. Collmann, on the single examination he made, reported on claimant\u2019s diabetes, and stated her diabetes \u201cshould be able to be managed by good medical therapy.\u201d Dr. Collmann knew nothing whatever about her diabetes except as he said, \u201cby history\u201d \u2014 that is, by some report, probably by Dr. Shea, claimant\u2019s personal physician. Dr. Coll-mann said: \u201cShe has a history of diabetes for several years.\u201d Since he saw her only once, he was telling what he found in some report. He knew nothing about the nature of her diabetes, or whether \u201cit should be able to be controlled by good medical therapy.\u201d (Meaning good medical treatment.) How could he know anything about the severity of her disease? He never even took a blood test to ascertain the amount of her blood sugar! In any event, one examination made as a paid representative of the Social Security Administration is not substantial evidence as contrasted with the evidence of continuous treatment during six years by claimant\u2019s personal physician; and the same rule of law, substantiated, as cited above, by numerous decisions of the federal courts, without dissent, applies equally to the evidence of the single examination of claimant which was made by Dr. Obe-nour.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">So, in commenting on the statement in the prevailing opinion that if there is some degree of conflict between the evidence of Dr. Shea (the physician who had treated claimant continuously for six years) and these other two doctors, who had seen claimant for a physical examination on one occasion only, we should not fault the Examiner for relying on their views, the answer is that, as against the evidence of Dr. Shea, the evidence of the Social Security Administration\u2019s medical witnesses, would not, by the unanimous rule of the federal eases, be sustained by substantial evidence as shown by the authorities above cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">The medical evidence of a qualified physician, no matter how unquestioned his competence, integrity, or credibility is, who sees a patient with regard to her impairments, diseases, and afflictions on one occasion only, cannot be considered substantial evidence as compared to the evidence of a qualified physician who has been treating a patient for such impairments, diseases' and afflictions over a continuous period of six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">Under this rule, the medical testimony or report of Dr. Shea constituted substantial evidence to support petitioner\u2019s claim; the medical report of Dr. Coll-mann and the medical report of Dr. Obe-nour do not constitute substantial evidence as against the evidence of Dr. Shea.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">An examination of the single examination by Dr. Collmann and the single examination by Dr. Obenour is convincing that, under the recognized law in Social Security cases, their reports cannot be considered substantial evidence as against the evidence of Dr. Shea, Dr. Millis, and all of the other medical evidence in the case. Dr. Obenour and Dr. Collmann did not mention claimant\u2019s musculoskeletal disorders, or the uncontrollable nature of claimant\u2019s diabetes, or of her bursitis, periarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, pyelitis, cervical myositis, purulent bronchitis, tendonitis, fibrosis secondary to acute bursitis of left shoulder, chronic backache, osteoarthritic changes of the spine, peripheral neuritis, peripheral anemia, and labile hypertension \u2014 all shown by uncontradicted medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">In determining whether claimant is precluded from performing substantial gainful employment and thus entitled to disability benefits, physicians\u2019 testimony as to a partial disability, based upon one disabling factor, is not substantial evidence controverting undisputed testimony of other physicians as to a greater disability, based on a larger number of disabling factors. Social Security Act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>\u00a7 1 et seq. as amended, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 301 et seq., Massey v. Celebrezze, 345 F. 2d 146 (6 Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">In 81 C.J.S. Social Security \u00a7 44.6 (Cumulative Parts) the general rule is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">\u201cWhen claimant comes forth with evidence of serious physical impairment, the record must contain evidence on which the denial of the claim can be based; and where there is uncon-troverted medical testimony that the applicant is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity it is the duty of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to award him the relief requested, assuming that all other qualifications are met. The government must adduce evidence from which the finding could be made that claimant can do some type of available work if claimant proves inability to perform the type of work he has done in the past and lack of experience for other work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The instant case is so similar to Bur-rell v. Finch, 308 F.Supp. 264 (D.C. Kan.), in which Judge Templar wrote the opinion, that it well merits quoting as being an instance where a claimant was deprived of her just rights by a Hearing Examiner wrongfully ignoring all the medical evidence that confirmed the proven disability claimed by the plaintiff :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">\u201cThe finding against plaintiff made in this case was arrived at by the simple expedient of excluding from consideration on one pretext or another the medical evidence that confirmed the condition of disability as claimed by plaintiff herself and to which she testified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">\u201cIt is not necessary that plaintiff be bed-ridden to come within the statute\u2019s provisions. Neither is she required to try to sell apples. She is not required to meet every remote possibility which may be conjured up. The denial of this claim by the Secretary, if it can be supported at all, must rely on the reports of Dr. Sweeney who examined her on two occasions. This doctor managed to report that in his opinion \u2018this patient is not at the present time (June 1, 1963) totally disabled for gainful employment.\u2019 However, this opinion was modified by the statement, perhaps inadvertently overlooked by the Secretary, that this could be done \u2018with appropriate medical therapy and possibly psychotherapy.\u2019 He does not mention what this appropriate therapy might be, and success from treatment not described is speculative to say the least. Dr. Sweeney\u2019s second report (July 2, 1965) contains an opinion hedged with \u2018ifs\u2019 and \u2018possibilities.\u2019 A denial of benefits should not be withheld from this claimant on this kind of evidence in the face of the findings of treating physicians and the convincing facts and circumstances of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">\u201cThis Court is impressed with the admonition contained in Mefford v. Gardner, 383 F.2d 748 (6th Cir. 1967), at 761:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-11\">\u201c \u2018Merely because a physician states that an applicant is not suffering from an impairment that precludes him from engaging in substantial gainful activity, that he has only a slight limitation of activity; and that he should be able to do some work, is not substantial evidence that applicant can engage in substantial gainful activity, when viewed in the light of the evidence of other doctors who had continuously treated applicant, and testified to the contrary, and in the light of the facts reflected in the transcript as a whole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-12\">\u201c \u2018The foregoing authorities clearly enunciate the law to the effect that it is the duty of courts to examine meticulously the evidence, no matter how burdensome that duty is, because of the helter-skelter nature of the records in these cases, and not adopt the facile way of disposing of an injured applicant\u2019s case by reference to, and reliance upon, the statements of one or two physicians, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>as against the considered statements of many physicians and surgeons who have had more opportunity of examining and treating the applicant, more occasions of making medical reports upon him, and more expertness in diagnosis, as well as upon consideration of the facts reflected in the transcript as a whole.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In the instant case, the foregoing was totally ignored by the Hearing Examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">In Massey v. Celebrezze, 345 F.2d 146, 157 (C.A.6), this court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">\u201cFurthermore, the evidence of some physicians who testify as to a partial disability based upon one disabling factor is not to be taken as substantial evidence controverting the undisputed testimony of other physicians who testify as to a greater disability based on a larger number of disabling factors. So, where a physician testified <em>that, because of a certain slightly diminished pulmonary capacity, </em>a man is not disabled from doing certain work, this is not substantial evidence that the man is disabled only to a slight degree, <em>when compared with un-controverted medical evidence that the man </em>is totally disabled because of emphysema, hypertension, tachycardia, osteoarthritis, and other ailments.\" (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Dr. Collmann and Dr. Obenour never considered disability resulting from claimant\u2019s musculoskeletal or joint disorders. Yet, this was the chief reason for her disability according to claimant\u2019s own testimony and the evidence of Dr. Zanolli that she was suffering from sporadic episodes of cystitis, multiple episodes of bursitis affecting her left shoulder, and lower extremity joints, musculoskeletal complaints of a chronic nature, and intermittent back complaints; and, from the evidence of Dr. Shea, that she was suffering from myo-sitis of the left shoulder, chronic backache and peripheral edema, acute low back strain and cervical arthritis.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">It was the multiplicity of her complaints upon which Dr. Shea based his opinion that she could only be intermittently or sporadically gainfully employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">The Hearing Examiner gave no consideration to claimant\u2019s disability as resulting from the multiplicity of her complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-13\">In determining whether a disability claimant is disabled for social security purposes, inquiry should be directed to the effect of a combination of ailments, not merely the effect of each of them. Dillon v. Celebrezze, 345 F.2d 753 (C.A. 4). In the cited case, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-14\">\u201cViewing the record in this case as a whole, we do not think it contains substantial evidence to support the examiner\u2019s conclusion <em>that the combination of Dillon\u2019s ailments </em>had not reached such a stage of severity * * that he was precluded from engaging in any substantial gainful activity.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-15\">The Hearing Examiner in the instant case dismissed all of the undisputed testimony and evidence of claimant\u2019s mus-culoskeletal disorders and chronic joint afflictions, by merely stating that her diabetic problem and exogenous obesity had caused her musculoskeletal disorders, as well as her impaired and continuously deteriorating vision. There was no evidence whatever to support this statement and finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-16\">As to claimant\u2019s testimony of pain and suffering resulting from her various disorders, which was supported by the evidence of her attending physician with respect to the acute nature of her joint and musculoskeletal disorders and her repeated hospitalizations for myositis, chronic backache, arthritis with low back strain, fibrositis and cervical arthritis and uncontrollable diabetes, the Hearing Examiner made no mention except to find that \u201cmost of the impairments about which claimant complains and upon which she alleges disability, are remediable.\u201d There is no evidence to support this finding in any particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>With regard to the Hearing Examiner\u2019s finding that there was nothing in the record to show that claimant\u2019s diabetes and obesity could not be remedied by a limited caloric intake, strangely enough this is contrary to another finding of the Hearing Examiner on the same point that, even when claimant was 40 pounds overweight, her diabetic condition remained mild, as well as the testimony of claimant herself, undisputed by any direct evidence or by any inference to be drawn from the evidence, that \u201cdiet don\u2019t affect me. They put me in the hospital, and they put me on a calorie diet [of 1500 calories] and I gained four pounds;\u201d that when Dr. Shea \u201chad me on a diet, I just gain\u201d; that he told her the insulin shots definitely made her gain weight; that \u201cwhen he stepped them up, why my weight shot up.\u201d This is undisputed evidence in the record, contrary to the Hearing Examiner\u2019s finding that there was nothing in the record \u201cto show that claimant\u2019s obesity could not be remedied by a limited caloric intake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The Hearing Examiner also found that there was some indication that claimant \u201cdoes not take her insulin with sufficient regularity to keep her diabetes under control.\u201d It can be categorically stated that there is no evidence whatever in the record that can be said to remotely sustain this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The Hearing Examiner found that claimant\u2019s gastrointestinal, musculo-skeletal and vascular disorders are not severe, and that they are secondary to her diabetic and obese condition. There is no evidence in the record to sustain this finding. None of the physicians, neither the physicians employed by the Social Security Administration nor claimant\u2019s personal physician, nor the other six physicians, mentioned that claimant\u2019s gastrointestinal disorders were \u201csecondary\u201d to her diabetic and obese condition. Dr. Obenour, the Government\u2019s physician, never mentioned anything about a gastrointestinal disorder. Dr.. Collmann, the other Government physician, a gas-troenterologist, said nothing about her gastrointestinal disorder being secondary to her diabetic condition. He stated, as heretofore noted in a different connection, that \u201cin spite of the fact she has chronic indigestion and pain throughout her abdomen particularly in the epigastrium, not related specifically to type of food,\u201d but stating \u201cif she puts a little bit of food in her stomach she is comfortable and if she puts too much she is uncomfortable or if she is empty she is uncomfortable.\u201d Dr. Collmann said nothing about this, condition being secondary to her diabetic condition. On the other hand, he considered that her gastrointestinal disorder arose from an ulcer and gallstones, and that the gallbladder disease could be modified by corrective surgery. He mentioned nothing whatever about her gastrointestinal disorder being secondary to her diabetes.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">No physician or any other witness mentioned that claimant\u2019s musculoskele-tal disorders were <em>secondary </em>to her diabetic condition. Dr. Obenour stated of claimant: \u201cThis patient presents multiple <em>complaints </em>referable to the musculo-skeletal cardiorespiratory, metabolic and gastrointestinal systems.\u201d He never mentioned the word \u201cmusculoskeletal\u201d again. He found claimant limited for performing heavy work only because of her pulmonary impairment. But nothing can be gleaned from his report that indicates in any way that claimant\u2019s mus-culoskeletal disorders were secondary to her diabetic condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">As to the finding of the Hearing Examiner that claimant\u2019s diabetes was aggravated by her exogenous obesity resulting in recurrent episodes of acute exacerbations of <em>vascular disorders, </em>there is nothing in the case relating to any vascular disorders, or claim of vascular disorders, so this finding is irrelevant as well as without any foundation in the evidence. \u201cVascular disorders\u201d is a term that seems to have been a phrase abstracted from a medical text; but it nowhere appears in claimant\u2019s application for benefits, or in any of the medical reports or testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">The Hearing Examiner\u2019s finding that, if claimant returned to regular work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>with her employer, there is an implication that her employment would be resumed, is totally without evidence to support it, and, in fact, is contrary to the undisputed evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">It is absurd to think that claimant would not return to the job for which she was paid approximately $5,000 a year, if she could have done so. She made every effort to do so, and finally gave up the idea only when her attending physician, after all her hospitalizations, ordered her not to go back to work anymore.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">It is somewhat illuminating with regard to the Hearing Examiner\u2019s attitude toward claimant\u2019s application for disability benefits, that, while he based his above-mentioned finding on the obviously unsubstantiated hearsay of claimant\u2019s husband that her employer tried to make it rough on her and now had six people doing the work that claimant used to do, the Hearing Examiner ignored, and did not mention, the substantive evidence of claimant\u2019s husband that \u201cshe\u2019s not able to work, that\u2019s for sure\u201d; that since she could work no longer at her place of employment, he was obliged to do all the mopping and waxing in their home; that claimant had tried to do these things, \u201cbut she wasn\u2019t able to make it at all\u201d; that he was afraid she would fall and hurt herself; that he would rather she wouldn\u2019t be up trying to do it, because \u201cif * * * she happened to break a leg or arm, why, that \u2014 I had just rather she wouldn\u2019t be up.\u201d When he was at the table on one occasion, he heard her in another room. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong with her. When we found her she was in there on the bed.\u201d She \u201cblacked out * * * I found her on the bed and she couldn\u2019t breath and I rushed her to the hospital. * * * I called the ambulance, and she had to go to the hospital.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">The foregoing was important testimony by claimant\u2019s husband in support of her application. It was not mentioned, but was ignored by the Hearing Examiner. However, when hearsay testimony on the part of claimant\u2019s husband to the effect that her employer made \u201cit rough on her\u201d and now had six people doing the work she had done \u2014 of which the husband had no personal knowledge, and which testimony was contrary to the testimony of claimant herself and of the official interviewer of the Social Security Administration \u2014 it was nevertheless emphasized by the Hearing Examiner, as evidence militating against her application \u2014 \u201cthat claimant\u2019s inability to work [for her employer] was due to the fact that they had imposed upon her greater burdens than a normal individual with her age, education and training, could be expected to do.\u201d This finding was unsupported by any substantial evidence and cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">The Hearing Examiner\u2019s conclusion that claimant\u2019s employer wanted to get rid of her by trying to make it \u201crough on her\u201d is unrealistic and unreasonable in the light of her own testimony that the reason she couldn\u2019t do the work was because she couldn\u2019t stand it \u2014 because her back and legs hurt her so; that up to the first part of 1966 she held out pretty good; then after about six months, \u201cI had it from there out * * just up and down in the hospital, back home.\u201d Dr. Shea would keep her off four or five weeks and then she would go back and work awhile, and when she went back she was sick again, and Dr. Shea put her in the hospital and afterward she went back home. She testified that her condition really got bad in 1966, \u201cthe last part of . it * * *. I would work some * * * and then I was off some, got to where I stayed off so much, well in \u201966, I was off a lot and so they \u2014I just couldn\u2019t make it.\u201d She received her pay for June through September 1966, while she was sick and under the care of her doctor and then they just stopped; they \u201cterminated\u201d her. \u201cI didn\u2019t get to go back and make it.\u201d They terminated her \u201cwhile I was off sick.\u201d They said the termination was because of loss of time \u2014 \u201cIf I didn\u2019t take my early retirement and go on and come home they would in three \u2014 three <em>times </em>I\u2019d, you know, been off sick, why they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>would lay me off.\u201d And they \u201cterminated\u201d her. She told the company: \u201cIf that\u2019s the way they felt about it, I wouldn\u2019t have no other choice.\u201d She then received retirement benefits for complete disability \u2014 a lump sum of more than $900, her pay and vacation allowance and a pension of $56.37 a month. She further testified that the reason she couldn\u2019t do the work \u2014 she couldn\u2019t hold on, was because of the pain in her back and legs; that Dr. Shea took her off the work and wouldn\u2019t let her go back on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">As additional evidence that claimant\u2019s employer did <em>not </em>want to get rid of her and was <em>not </em>trying to make it \u201crough on her,\u201d the official interviewer of the Social Security Administration reported that claimant\u2019s supervisor had told her \u201cto try and take it easy.\u201d Her employer obviously considered her such a valuable employee that he paid her regular salary for the last four months with the company although she was unable, because of hospitalization and because of pain, after her return to her home, to do the work; that, when she couldn\u2019t return to work after the period of four months above-mentioned, and her doctor ordered her not to return, claimant agreed that she could no longer do the work and was willing to take the pension benefits for her long service.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The Hearing Examiner\u2019s finding that, if claimant now returned to regular work with her employer, there is an implication that she would be reemployed, is totally unsupported by any substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The Hearing Examiner found: \u201cIt is obvious from claimant\u2019s earning record that these intermittent episodes of illness did not significantly affect her ability to engage in substantial gainful activity. Her earnings record reveals that the claimant had not been absent from work to any significant extent since January 1961, until she quit working on June 17, 1966.\u201d Claimant herself testified that prior to June 1966, \u201cI hadn\u2019t been too regular. I\u2019d been, you know, I was sick so much. Well right at the first of \u201966, why I\u2019d held out pretty good; then about six months of it then, I had it from there on out, you know, just up and down in the hospital, back home. He [Dr. Shea] would keep me off four or five weeks then I\u2019d go back and work awhile, and then I went back, I was sick again. He put me in the hospital, and I went home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">She further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">\u201cQ. For the first fifteen years that you worked for Union Carbide, did you have much sickness or off from work much?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-10\">A.

Uh-huh.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">We have already rehearsed the numerous times claimant was hospitalized. In April 1966, she was hospitalized for 12 days. In June 1966, she was hospitalized for 4 days. In February 1967, she was hospitalized for 6 days. All during these hospitalizations, her employer paid her full pay. When she was out of work for four months, in June, July, August and September, 1966, because of shoulder pain, her employer paid her full wages. During all the time she was hospitalized prior to 1966, she received her full pay. She had a generous employer. The Hearing Examiner was clearly mistaken when he made the finding that her earning record, during her illnesses, shows that her impairments did not affect her ability to engage in substantia] gainful activity. On the contrary, her earnings during her illness did not reflect her ability to engage in substantial gainful activity, because it is undisputed that her employer paid her her full wages during all the periods she was unable to engage in substantial gainful activity. There is no support, therefore, in the evidence for the Hearing Examiner\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s illnesses did not significantly affect her ability to engage in substantial gainful activity. The fact was that claimant\u2019s illnesses did not affect her employer\u2019s generosity in paying her her full wages during the period she was admittedly unable to engage in substantial gainful activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">The chief, and practically the only, reason for the Hearing Examiner\u2019s denial of disability benefits to the claimant is that her diabetes is remediable; that claimant refuses to do anything to remedy her diabetes; and that all of claimant\u2019s multitudinous afflictions and suffering over a period of twenty working years are due to her own deliberate acts in refusing to follow Dr. Shea\u2019s instructions as to her diet.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-15\">In order to arrive at this conclusion, the Hearing Examiner seized upon an isolated statement of claimant that Dr. Shea had her on a diet, but she went \u201coff\u201d because she \u201cgot tired\u201d of the dieting\u2014 not \u201cplumb off\u201d; and that the last time she saw Dr. Shea he said \u201cstay on what I was on but I\u2019ve been eating tomato and lettuce and stuff like that and bacon and eggs. That\u2019s what he told me to fix and eat, and cottage cheese, and stuff like that, and lettuce.\u201d Claimant\u2019s testimony that she is eating what Dr. Shea told her \u201cto fix and eat\u201d is not disputed. After claimant\u2019s testimony, the Hearing Examiner stated to claimant\u2019s counsel that he wanted a further statement from Dr. Shea, saying: \u201cI want information in that statement as to the frequency of [claimant\u2019s] visits, the type of treatment he gives on each visit, and what the change, if any, he finds, and whether or not he has had any \u2014 made any frequent examinations. Of course, from what she says, I assume that he had had some additional tests made from time to time; and I would like to have a copy of what his records show as findings from the examinations of his tests.\u201d The Hearing Examiner then stated to claimant\u2019s counsel that within a certain time, counsel could get Dr. Shea\u2019s additional statement, and counsel agreed to get the statement. Thereafter, Dr. Shea\u2019s statement was given to the Hearing Examiner and filed in the case. The statement showed the diagnoses and all of the dates of claimant\u2019s office visits from July 11, 1961, to November 21, 1964, and all of the treatments of claimant from January 1965 to May 17, 1967, including the time claimant\u2019s diabetes was out of control, the fact that she was placed on insulin for her diabetes, the report that her blood sugar remained ele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>vated even on insulin; and the fact that, as of the date of the final report, claimant\u2019s diabetes was still uncontrolled. In addition, Dr. Shea reported the myriad musculoskeletal afflictions, sufferings and hospitalizations of claimant during the two years and five months prior to the date of this last report.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">The Hearing Examiner received all the information which he had requested of Dr. Shea. He specifically asked for every important item that he considered might affect claimant\u2019s application, including the number of times claimant had visited him, data showing the frequency of his examinations, and the changes he found in her condition. The Hearing Examiner was not interested in her diet, and, accordingly, did not request that any information be secured from Dr. Shea as to diet. From everything that appears in the case, the Hearing Examiner accepted, at that time, as true, the testimony of claimant that the food she was eating at the time of her testimony before him, was what Dr. Shea told her \u201cto fix and eat\u201d \u2014 tomatoes, lettuce, bacon, eggs and cottage cheese \u2014 and that Dr. Shea told her she should \u201cstay on\u201d that diet \u2014 which she did. The Hearing Examiner received from counsel for claimant all the information he requested. Not then being concerned about her diet, he at no time mentioned that he wanted information from Dr. Shea about her diet, or did he ever point out that such information was not contained in Dr. Shea\u2019s report. It was not until the final report of Dr. Shea was filed as the last evidence in the hearing, and after the case was closed and submitted that, two and a half months later, the Hearing Examiner filed his findings and conclusions in which he held that claimant\u2019s refusal to follow the diet prescribed by her personal physician resulted in her obesity and diabetes, causing the recurrent episodes of acute exacerbation of gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal and vascular disorders that had been kept under control since the early 1960\u2019s\u2014 and that there was nothing in the record to show that claimant\u2019s obesity could not be remedied by a limited caloric intake. All of these findings in all of their particulars have been demonstrated to be without any substantial evidence to sustain them. And now, finally, the finding that her diabetes and obesity resulted from failure to follow the diet prescribed by her personal physician, causing all her afflictions and pain, is found to be without any foundation in the evidence; and claimant\u2019s testimony that the diet was approved by her personal physician is undisputed, although the Hearing Examiner, in requesting further information from her personal physician, asked for every pertinent bit of evidence of frequency of visits, type of treatment, additional tests made from time to time, findings from the examination of tests, and changes, if any, which he found, and made no request or suggestion as to diet, or inquiry as to whether claimant failed, or did not fail, to follow any prescribed diet, obviously, for the reason that diet, which now looms as the chief, or only, reason on which the Hearing Examiner bases his denial of disability benefits, was never considered at that time of being of any importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">To deny claimant\u2019s application for disability benefits after at least seven years of musculoskeletal afflictions, a diabetic condition which remains out of control even with regularly increased dosages of insulin, and constant pain \u2014 on the ground that she is to blame for her diabetic condition, is without support in common sense, or in the evidence, and is an illustration of mistaken administration of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">In this regard, the finding of the Hearing Examiner sets forth that, although between April 13, 1965, and August 29, 1966, claimant\u2019s weight increased from 163 pounds to 181 pounds\u2014 a total of 18 pounds \u2014 and that by January 23, 1967, her weight increased another 10 pounds, to a total of 191 pounds \u2014\u201cin spite of this significant increase in claimant\u2019s weight, <em>her diabetic condition remained mild.\u201d </em>It is impossible to conclude from the foregoing that a reduction of weight would have remedied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>claimant\u2019s diabetic condition. None of the medical evidence sets forth that reduction of weight would remedy the claimant\u2019s diabetic condition \u2014 only a speculative statement that some general improvement might be expected from reduction of weight \u2014 and the foregoing only adds to the weight of our conclusion that the Hearing Examiner\u2019s finding, that claimant\u2019s refusal to follow a diet to reduce her weight was a deliberate act on her part to refuse to remedy her diabetes, was without any evidence to support it; and, as heretofore set forth, claimant was undisputed in her testimony that she followed a diet approved by her personal physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Once it is seen from the uncontradicted evidence that claimant is not to blame for her diabetic condition; that no matter how much overweight she is, \u201cher diabetic condition remained mild,\u201d as the Hearing Examiner found; that claimant\u2019s weight increased even on a caloric diet prescribed for her in the hospital; that her weight increased because of the effect of insulin; that there was no evidence of any kind in the case that claimant\u2019s diabetes was remediable; that the diet which she followed was approved by her personal physician \u2014 then, the Hearing Examiner\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s diabetes is remediable, and that all of claimant\u2019s pain and afflictions result from her failure to follow the regime for diet and medical control of her diabetes, is without any substantial evidence to sustain it, and the whole case for denying her disability benefits falls apart.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">We come, then, to the findings of the Hearing Examiner based upon the testimony of the Vocational Counselor.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Regardless of all the medical evidence and the evidence of Mr. Merritt, who was the interviewer representing the Social Security Administration, and the testimony of claimant and her husband, the Hearing Examiner found that, in spite of her diabetes and musculoskeletal afflictions, claimant, according to a Vocational Counselor, was not precluded from returning to her former type of work as a salad-maker in a restaurant or cafeteria, or from performing other duties in a restaurant, such as a cashier; that she had failed to present sufficient evidence to establish that she had an impairment or impairments in combination severe enough to preclude her from engaging in any type of substantial gainful activity for a continuous period without interruption of not less than twelve months\u2019 duration; and that, in spite of her diabetes and musculoskeletal afflictions, she also had the residual capacity to engage in the further work, concerning which the Vocational Counselor testified, such as a nurses\u2019 aide in hospitals or nursing homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">When, at the close of claimant\u2019s testimony, during a colloquy between the Hearing Examiner and claimant\u2019s counsel, the latter stated he would like to know what possible \u201clight\u201d work claimant could perform on a sustained basis, the Hearing Examiner replied that \u201cto give you a <em>scientific correct answer to that question, </em>I am going to have to call a vocational witness in here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">The vocational witness was William L. Holbert, a teacher at the University of Tennessee in the Graduate Counselor Training Program. He had been given the exhibits or medical and hospital reports with regard to claimant, and a transcript of all the testimony in the case. Armed with this data, he stated he had sufficient information to form and express an opinion with regard to the jobs a person could do who had the claimant\u2019s impairments as described in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">He was then asked the following question by the Hearing Examiner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-14\">\u201cQ. Assuming that I, as a hearing examiner in this case, should find examination of all the record in this case particularly the medical evidence, that this claimant has had diabetes mellitus, which is controllable by insulin and dieting, and that she is overweight due to what is described as exogenous obesity which can be reduced by caloric intake, and she had had an ulcer, a duodenal ul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>cer, by history of which has given her trouble in the past but can be kept under control by proper medication and dieting, and if she has a chronic upper respiratory infection, which is describ\u00e9d as bronchitis, which is severe enough to create a mild obstructive ventilatory insufficiency, which would preclude her from engaging in activity that required her to do any standing on her feet for a period of time; and engaging in sustained work, but that she has the residual capacity to engage in what is commonly described as light sedentary work and that she has been working for a number of years as a salad maker in a cafeteria * * * \u2014 twenty years, based on that background of work experience, and with her education as you noticed exists in the record and coupled with the impairments I have just described which imposes the limitations I have just mentioned \u2014 inability to stand on her feet or do extensive walking \u2014 I may also add bending or lifting. Assuming she can\u2019t do those things, there is a functional limitation upon performing of those acts and sustained work, are there other jobs that she would have the residual capacity to perform and which she could adapt her past experience and training and so forth, to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-4\">A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Before we proceed to the answer of the Vocational Counselor, it is to be emphasized that, in the foregoing question, addressed to this witness by the Hearing Examiner, he did not include the fact that the claimant had greatly impaired vision, which will hereafter be set forth. Moreover, the Hearing Examiner had assumed, in his question to the Vocational Counselor, that claimant\u2019s diabetes was controllable by insulin and proper dieting, when the only evidence of the actual state of her diabetes was the evidence of her personal physician, Dr. Shea, who reported that even after he had changed her treatment from the oral medication of Orinase to insulin, her diabetes was out of control in January 1965 and in April 1966, and that the final evidence received on the hearing was Dr. Shea\u2019s reports dated May 17, 1967, in which he stated that, even on insulin, her diabetes was still uncontrollable. Moreover, while the Hearing Examiner stated in his question to the Vocational Counselor that claimant had a chronic upper respiratory infection described as bronchitis, which is severe enough to create a mild obstructive ventilatory insufficiency which would preclude her from engaging in any activity that required her to do any standing on her feet for a period of time, and engaging in sustained work or lifting or bending \u2014 this is a garbled hodge-podge of the proofs, since there was no evidence that claimant\u2019s bronchitis or ventilatory insufficiency precluded her from standing for a period of time, or engaging in sustained work or bending or lifting. What precluded her from standing for a period of time or engaging in sustained work or bending or lifting was the great number of musculoskeletal and joint disorders that had caused her pain and suffering over a period of years, until she was no longer able to do any work because of them\u2014 and musculoskeletal and joint disorders were never mentioned in the questions of the Hearing Examiner or considered in the answers of the Vocational Counselor \u2014all of which were disorders described by five physicians at various times over a six-year period, and some of them being periarthritis, suborbital arthritis, mus-culoskeletal complaints of a chronic nature, bursitis of left shoulder and lower extremity joints, tendonitis of the shoulders, fibrosis, myositis of the left shoulder, cervical arthritis and many other joint and musculoskeletal afflictions. Why these were not mentioned or considered by the Hearing Examiner or the Vocational Counselor in appraising claimant\u2019s disability is unexplained. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>were proved by the uncontradicted testimony of claimant and sustained by the evidence of medical experts. Their existence and severity were undisputed. Were they forgotten or overlooked, or ignored by the Hearing Examiner? Whatever the reason, the failure to consider them resulted in prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">We return, then, to the testimony of the Vocational Counselor who proceeded to answer the question of the Hearing Examiner as to what work claimant was capable of performing in the light of her disabilities. The Vocational Counselor\u2019s testimony was what the Hearing Examiner described as the \u201cscientific correct answer\u201d to the question asked by counsel for claimant as to what light work claimant could possibly do in her condition. The testimony is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">\u201cQ. (By the Hearing Examiner) * * * I wish you would enumerate such jobs, giving the titles, describe those type of jobs, and the kind of function or activity it required * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">A. (By Vocational Counselor) After reading the medical record, I went by Byerley\u2019s Cafeteria and talked with them about the job of salad girl that they have there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">This seems a strange line of investigation for the Vocational Counselor to pursue, as claimant had been obliged, because of her disability, to quit the identical job of salad girl at the cafeteria where she had been employed for twenty years. Nevertheless:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">\u201cQ. Now, where is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">A. It is out by the U.T. (University of Tennessee) Campus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-11\">Q. It\u2019s practically on University Campus ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-12\">A. Yes, sir. It\u2019s about a block off Cumberland there. I went up there at lunch, and I talked to one of the people that was tending the salad. I didn\u2019t get a chance to talk to the manager, but I talked to her about some of the duties that she performs and tried to get an idea of how much physical energy is required as well as psychological relationship with other people, and so forth, (witness has a degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology) and I understand from her that the prime job of salad girl in this particular instance is getting the vegetables prepared; that is, cleaned and ready to go into machines, and they actually have machines that cut up the salad so there is very little lifting, bending. There is a limited amount of walking during the busy hours; that is, during the lunch hour and the evening hour.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-15\">The Vocational Counselor also testified that it was necessary for a salad girl at Byerleys to stand about an hour or an hour and a half, twice a day, while serving salads. Some of the time the work could be done seated. However, a salad girl would have to work a forty-hour week \u2014 eight hours a day, five days a week. The witness testified he also \u201clooked in the yellow pages, and there are several salad shops, professional salad shops in Knoxville. I called one, Sally\u2019s Salad Shop, here in Knoxville and talked to them about the type of work that they perform there. The manager, Mr. Grant Cantwell, wasn\u2019t in, and I talked to his assistant, and she tells me that most of their work in the professional salad shop is done by machinery. There is very little lifting. It is primarily \u2014 the primary work is getting the vegetables ready and put it in the machine, and they have to package it, and they package the salad to go into super markets. They package it in large containers that go to hotels and restaurants and so forth. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-16\">When the Vocational Counselor was asked \u201cWhere is this work done in preparing the vegetables,\u201d he replied: \u201cWell, as I say, I didn\u2019t go back there, but it\u2019s back in the kitchen area. They have sink type set-ups where they wash the lettuce, and they have ice boxes or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>cooling places where they keep the vegetables crisp. It is back in the back of the cafeteria there * * *.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\">\u201cQ. And when they go to get those vegetables \u2014 they\u2019re in \u2014 I think you said a refrigerator?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">A. Well, the cooling area. I doubt if it is a refrigerator. It\u2019s just a cooling area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">Q. Is this a big walk-in cooler or is it shelf type coolers about the head level or just where would they be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">A. Well, as I say, I didn\u2019t go back into the section and look myself. So I\u2019m not sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">Q. Do you have any idea how many salads they make \u2014 the salad girl there prepares them each day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-9\">A. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">This was the identical work that claimant had been doing for her employer before she became so disabled that she could not work any more. The Vocational Counselor\u2019s calling up restaurants and speaking to salad girls and other employees rather than to managers, looking through yellow pages to find how many salad shops there were in the vicinity, and the indefinite and vague information he gave as to their operations and the duties of the employees, throws no light on any important factors in this case \u2014 such as how much physical work was necessary, whether a salad-maker had to lift the vegetables on shelves above head level \u2014 and whether claimant could, in such a place, engage in substantial gainful activity, as a salad-maker, considering her pain, mus-culoskeletal afflictions, acute bronchitis, and uncontrollable diabetes.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">None of the Vocational Counselor\u2019s testimony that claimant could return to her work as a salad-maker in such a restaurant or cafeteria as Byerley\u2019s constitutes substantial evidence to sustain the Hearing Examiner\u2019s finding that claimant was not precluded, by her impairments, from engaging in substantial gainful activity, especially in the light of claimant\u2019s own testimony as to the nature of the work of salad-maker that caused her such pain that she could no longer continue to perform it, all of which was substantiated by the clear weight of the medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">We shall proceed, then, to discuss claimant\u2019s ability to work in a restaurant or cateteria as a cashier, or as a nurses\u2019 aid in a hospital, which were two of the positions the Vocational Counselor had stated that claimant could perform. The Vocational Counselor testified with regard to her performing the services of a cashier in a cafeteria:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-14\">\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of learning to use a cash register, know the \u2014 remembering the price of each item in the cafeteria line in the case of a cafeteria, and punching it in on the cash register and making change * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-15\">Claimant had been only a salad-maker for the twenty years of her working experience, and had never followed any other kind of occupation. A cashier must be a quick-minded person, able to remember immediately the price of numerous different dishes; to punch the proper keys on a cash register; and rapidly make change. It is most unrealistic to propose a job of cashier in a cafeteria for a woman without any such training, whose work experience was completely different up to the hearing, at which time she was fifty-eight years old; and it is unreasonable to think that such a woman, without previous experience, and who is nearly blind, could do the work of a cashier in a cafeteria \u2014 a job that, among other qualifications \u2014 which claimant does not have \u2014 also requires especially good eyesight.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-16\">With regard to the work of a paid nurses\u2019 aide, the Vocational Counselor was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-17\">\u201cQ. Well, in this nurses aide work also, * * * is it not pretty much of a necessity to be able to see well, and to be accurate with what you see such as reading thermometers ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-19\">A. Yes, they would have to see a thermometer, and the nurses aide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>is usually required to take blood pressures. She is required to take pulse and to see a watch dial on timing, so they would have to see \u2014 be able to see.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">The Vocational Counselor also testified that in the position of a nurses\u2019 aide, claimant would have to do simple mathematics; and that she would have to be able to write notes to the nurses for the hospital records. The examination of the Vocational Counselor continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">\u201cQ. And it would also seem to me like the sight would be fairly much a prerequisite in cashier work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-10\">A. Yes, they would have to see. I think a person would have to have eye sight enough to see the numbers on the cash register, and of course they would have to inspect the trays and be able to price it out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">Claimant\u2019s vision was and is so bad that she can hardly see. Claimant was questioned by the Examiner and was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-12\">\u201cQ. Now, you used to drive an automobile ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-13\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-14\">Q. But you haven\u2019t driven in about a year?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-15\">A. No, I ain\u2019t drove in nearly a year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-16\">Q. Why don\u2019t you drive?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-17\">A. I can\u2019t see. Lines run together and I can\u2019t see which way I\u2019m going. I can\u2019t judge my distance. My eyes just \u2014 letters seems like it just gets foggy. I just don\u2019t try it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-18\">Q. I see that you are wearing glasses. Does that happen while you are wearing glasses ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-19\">A. Yeah. I can\u2019t do no good with my glasses, either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-20\">Q. Do you read at home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-21\">A. No, no, not much at all without it\u2019s awful big reading and big print, I can see it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-22\">Q. Have you had your eyes checked?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-23\">A. Dr. Millis checked them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-4\">Hearing Examiner: \u201cI think we\u2019d better get a report from Dr. Millis * * * \u00bb</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-24\">Counsel for Claimant: \u201cI will talk to Dr. Millis and get a report and send it to you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-25\">Pursuant to the Hearing Examiner\u2019s request, Dr. Millis\u2019 report was thereafter filed with the Hearing Examiner; and the doctor confirmed claimant\u2019s testimony as to her greatly impaired vision. Dr. Millis reported:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-26\">\u201cThis is a record of my findings:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-27\">Vision without glasses: Rt. eye 20/200 Lt. eye 20/200</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-29\">Vision with glasses: Rt. eye 20/20 Lt. eye 20/30 \u2014Both 20/20</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-30\">\u201cStereopsis is low; there is a definite vertical deviation in the alignment of her eyes resulting in double vision. The eye pressure was within normal range. Due to the vertical deviation and the inability to see equally as clear out of both eyes, she suppresses vision in her right eye.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-31\">\u201cShe has a record of variable blood pressure as well as a diabetic condition. Each of which makes it almost impossible to stabilize her visual problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-32\">\u201cI have been examining Mrs. Jenkins\u2019 vision since July, 1963 [4 years]; during this period of time I have observed a general deterioration in her vision.\u201d Here, it should be noted that in the prevailing opinion it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-33\">\u201cAppellant did not claim impaired eyesight in her application for benefits. Eye trouble appeared first as a result of some questions put to her by the trial examiner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-34\">\u201cIn her original application for benefits, she described her disabilities as \u2018diabetes, ulcers, and obesity,\u2019 never once mentioning poor eyesight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-35\">The foregoing seems completely unimportant and irrelevant as to the grounds of its consideration, weighing the other testimony and proofs in the case. The evidence was mentioned in this opinion, not to be evidence on which appellant bases her claim of disability, but evidence why she was unable to perform the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>jobs that the Vocational Counselor found she could do \u2014 and which were dependent on good vision.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">First, however, even from the standpoint of considering her double vision and deteriorated vision over a period of four years as a disability, it should be emphasized that appellant\u2019s claim was not made out by her, but by a \u201cdisability interviewer\u201d; and this is evident by the fact that the handwriting shows that the statements in the claim were filled out by someone in the Social Security office, and that the only handwriting of claimant is seen in her signature to the claim. In petitioner\u2019s statement of her claim, she obviously told the disability interviewer that her disabilities were \u201cdiabetes, ulcers, and bursitis.\u201d The disability interviewer, however, obviously following claimant\u2019s statements, cheeked off a box showing that claimant displayed difficulty with her eyesight, and that she had trouble in writing and \u201cappeared to be in some noticeable physical distress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Under the rule of informality in making claims and in procedure under the Social Security Act, these items should warrant a claim of impaired eyesight. If the law is to be liberally construed in favor of the claimant, would it not be construed to include such a claim of poor eyesight in the instant case ?</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The important report of Dr. Millis in this case was obtained and filed only because the Hearing Examiner requested it. Apparently, no one would have thought of getting the report of Dr. Millis at that time, unless the Hearing Examiner directed that it should be secured.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">It is to be noted that the Hearing Examiner did not deny petitioner\u2019s claim with regard to her deteriorated vision on the ground that she had not described it as one of her disabilities in making her claim. He actually passed on this claim, considering it to be one of the issues in the case. In his decision, the Hearing Examiner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">\u201cSince the filing of her application, claimant also complains of poor vision. * * * Again it is noted here that with claimant\u2019s full cooperation with her treating physician in following his instructions for controlling her diabetes and obesity, this impairment, too, can be greatly improved and stabilized.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">Of course, while the Hearing Examiner referred to this <em>impairment, </em>there was no evidence whatever in the case that claimant\u2019s poor vision could be improved or stabilized <em>by following her physician's instructions for controlling her diabetes </em>\u2014 or <em>improved or stabilized in any other way.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">Nevertheless, we return to the observation in the prevailing opinion that petitioner never mentioned a claim of \u201cimpaired eyesight in her application for benefits. Eye trouble appeared first as a result of some questions put to her by the trial examiner. In her original application for benefits, she described her disabilities as \u2018diabetes, ulcers and bursitis\u2019 never once mentioning poor eyesight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">Since the Hearing Examiner passed on this very issue of poor vision, it is impossible to find in the discussion in the prevailing opinion anything more than expression of the view that the claim of poor vision was an afterthought and not entitled to serious consideration. But can all this testimony on the part of claimant that she did not drive because \u201cI can\u2019t see\u201d and her evidence that she had cut herself on the salad-shredding machines because of her poor vision, and all of the evidence of Dr. Millis, be rejected on the ground that claimant did not include \u201cimpaired eyesight\u201d in her claim for disability, when such evidence is used \u2014 not to establish disability, but to show that claimant cannot perform the work requiring good vision which the Vocational Counselor testified she could do, without any mention by the Vocational Counselor of any knowledge of her undisputed impaired eyesight?</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>From the prevailing opinion, I conclude it is considered that the question of claimant\u2019s poor eyesight does not deserve any consideration in this court. I am impelled to the foregoing conclusion by the statement in the opinion that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\"><em>\u201cA </em>total of ten doctors who had examined appellant on various occasions before and after the time of the claimed commencement of \u25a0 her disabilities, filed written reports. These included the several doctors who would see her at a hospital visit. In one report, dated January 23, 1967, [Dr. Obenour\u2019s report] there is a notation \u2018vision reduced in both eyes for about one year.\u2019 In another of these reports, the examining doctor includes in his general report of physical examination, \u2018Pupils are equal, react to light and accommodation * * *. Fundoscope examination is negative.\u2019 Other than the foregoing, the doctors\u2019 reports make no reference to eye trouble. Her own Dr. Shea, upon whom she had long relied for treatment and upon whom she places chief reliance, makes no mention whatever of impaired eyesight as one of his patient\u2019s difficulties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">These observations are without any bearing on this case, and the last observation about Dr. Shea\u2019s reports is contradicted by the undisputed evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">In the first observation by Dr. Obe-nour, it is said: \u201cVision reduced in both eyes for about one year.\u201d Dr. Obenour, as stated, had never seen claimant before his examination, and never saw claimant except on this one occasion. What he stated as happening about her vision being, \u201creduced in both eyes for about a year,\u201d was hearsay \u2014 he got it from some fragmentary report, perhaps. He had no personal knowledge of such reduction of vision. His statement about reduction of vision is under the heading, \u201cHistory,\u201d which means some inadequate information he had secured from someone else, not named. Why should this statement of Dr. Obenour be given such importance ?</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">In the second observation from the foregoing quotation from the prevailing opinion, it is said \u201cthe examining doctor includes in his general report of physical examination, \u2018Pupils are equal, react to light and accommodation * * *. Fundo-seope examination is negative.\u2019 \u201d What possible bearing does this report and fundoscopic examination have upon the issue whether claimant\u2019s eyesight is impaired by double vision, vertical deviation, impossibility of stabilization of her visual problem, and general deterioration of her vision ? Nothing whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">A fundoscopic examination is, in other words, an ophthalmoscopic examination. As Webster\u2019s International Dictionary states: \u201cthe fundus is that part of the eye opposite the pupil\u201d \u2014 that is, the ocular fundus, and as further defined therein, an \u201cophthalmoscope is an instrument for viewing the interior of the eye, particularly the retina.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">In the handbook, \u201cOffice Management of Ocular Diseases,\u201d by Dr. William F. Hughes, published in 1953, Professor and Head, Department of Ophthalmology, University of Illinois College of Medicine, Ophthalmologist in Chief, Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary, and Attending Ophthalmologist, Presbyterian Hospital, Chicago, he states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-11\">\u201cOphthalmoscopic examination of the ocular fundus is important not only for the diagnosis and treatment of ocular diseases, but also for the recognition of certain systemic diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes. In this chapter, the important diseases which can be detected by ophthalmo-scopic examination will be discussed. Except those conditions which produce clouding of the media (cornea, lens, and vitreous) and abnormalities of the disc and optic nerve discussed in Chapter 14, Neuro-Ophthalmology.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">Any fundoscopic, or ophthalmoscopic examination is for the diagnosis of ocular diseases, or conditions that cause the clouding of the lens, cornea and aqueous and vitreous media and abnormalities of the optic disc or optic nerve. None of these diseases, condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>tions or. abnormalities, have anything to do with the condition of claimant\u2019s double vision caused by vertical deviation in the alignment of the eyes; and have nothing to do with claimant\u2019s general deterioration of vision over a period of several years.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The recital that doctors have filed reports that the \u201cpupils are equal,\u201d and \u201creact to light and accommodation,\u201d and the \u201cfundoseope examination is negative\u201d is set forth as showing that such doctors are of the opinion that claimant has no impairment of vision. The reports do not say that; and they have no bearing whatever on the undisputed evidence of claimant\u2019s double vision caused by vertical deviation in the alignment of her eyes, and her continuously deteriorating vision over a number of years, as well as her own testimony \u2014 that is not attacked by any witnesses or evidence, that she can\u2019t see well enough to drive a car, and all the rest of the visual deterioration to which she testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">What bearing does the foregoing fundoscopic examination have on petitioner\u2019s claim of deteriorated vision ? Doctors who make complete physical examinations are not concerned with whether a patient has good vision. The only examination they make of the eyes is a fundoscopic or ophthalmoscopic examination for the purpose of detecting whether the blood vessels in the eyes indicate hypertension or hardening of the arteries, or diseases of the eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The fact that ten doctors examined claimant before and after the commencement of her diabetes, ulcers, and bursitis, and made no mention of her impaired eyesight, is what one would expect from such physicians. The idea, however, that their fundoscopic examinations do not indicate that claimant was suffering from anything which <em>such </em>examination would show, does not faintly indicate that claimant was not suffering from impaired vision in view of the fact that Dr. Millis found that for four years prior to the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision, there was a general deterioration of her vision; that there was a vertical deviation in the alignment of her eyes, resulting in double vision; that \u201cdue to the vertical deviation and the inability to see equally as clearly out of both eyes, she suppresses vision in her right eye, and that it was almost impossible to stabilize her vision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Is all of this evidence to be thrown out of the case, <em>not </em>because the Hearing Examiner found that it was not included in petitioner\u2019s claim for disability, but because after the Hearing Examiner passed on this very issue, this court should proceed to consider that, for the first time in this controversy, it should disregard this evidence on the ground that the claimant did not include poor vision as one of her disabilities?</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">In the prevailing opinion it is said that \u201cWhile \u2018double vision\u2019 sounds ominous, standing alone it gives no idea of the import or frequency of such disorder\u201d; \u201cWhat treatment might be employed to alleviate it is not set out,\u201d and \u201cTo the layman, 20/20 is normal vision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">With regard to the first observation above mentioned \u2014 that \u201cdouble vision sounds ominous standing alone\u201d and that \u201cit gives no idea of the import or frequency of such disorder,\u201d \u201cdouble vision\u201d is the layman\u2019s term for \u201cdiplopia,\u201d which, as defined in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, Second Edition, Unabridged, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-11\">\u201cDouble vision of a single object; * * * in crossed * * *, diplopia, the eyes are focused beyond the object and the image seen by the right eye is at the left, that by the left eye at the right. In direct * * * diplopia, the object is beyond the focus and the image seen by the right eye is on the right side, that by the left eye on the left. In vertical diplopia, one image is above the other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">In this case, claimant had vertical diplo-pia, or vertical double vision.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-14\">We take judicial notice of dictionary definitions. There is nothing abstruse about the foregoing dictionary description of double vision. It is easily understandable. Double vision is the disorder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>of seeing two images at the same time. Here, Dr. Millis reported that double vision was caused by vertical deviation. As described by the dictionary, vertical diplopia, or vertical double vision, is the disorder which consists of seeing two images at the same time, one above the other. Contrary to the statement that \u201cstanding alone, vertical deviation resulting in double vision, gives no import of such disorder,\u201d it seems that the evidence clearly discloses that it does give such import \u2014 that, in fact, it is an important disorder of vision \u2014 to see two images at the same time, one above the other. Moreover, Dr. Millis reported that because of such double vision, \u201cand the inability to see equally as clear out of both eyes, she suppresses vision in her right eye.\u201d Dr. Millis also reported that during the four-year period prior to the hearing before the Hearing Examiner, \u201cI have observed a general deterioration in her vision.\u201d It appears clear that all of this uncontradicted evidence shows\u2014 contrary to the statement quoted above\u2014 that the report of Dr. Millis including the statement of claimant\u2019s double vision, gives a clear idea of the import of her visual disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">With regard to the further statement that the \u201cdouble vision\u201d reported by Dr. Millis gives no idea of the \u201cfrequency of such disorder,\u201d is it necessary for a doctor, once he finds a condition of \u201cdouble vision\u201d and general deterioration of vision over a period of four years, to give an idea of the frequency of such \"double vision,\u201d or general deterioration of vision? Once it is found that a person is suffering from diabetes or some other disease or chronic disorder, is it necessary for a claimant to assume the further burden of proof to present evidence to show how frequent the disorder is? Is it not enough, in this case, that the claimant shows she has the disorder of double vision from her medical report; that, because of double vision, she can no longer drive a car which she had done for the prior twenty years; that Dr. Millis also reported on the impossibility of stabilizing her visual problem; and that for the four prior years he had observed a general deterioration in her vision? Does claimant have to produce further evidence to show how <em>frequent </em>her disorders are, when no question has ever been raised as to that aspect of her impairments? And does she have to prove \u201cwhat treatment might be employed to alleviate it\u201d? If so, this is a new principle regarding the burden of proof that has to be borne by a claimant for disability. To deny that petitioner has made any sufficient showing of her physical disorders, because this court, for the first time in the controversy, brings up the objection that she has not shown the frequency of the occurrence of double vision, would seem to be an unconsciously contrived reason to deny her the benefit of undisputed evidence upon which she relies and upon which her claim depends.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">It is further stated in the prevailing opinion that on the question of appellant\u2019s visual disorders; \u201c[Dr. Shea] states that with glasses Mrs. Jenkins\u2019 combined vision of both eyes would be 20/20. To the layman, 20/20 vision is normal vision.\u201d This is admitted, and such is normal vision, as the layman understands it. It is only normal \u201cCentral Visual Acuity,\u201d according to the Regulations of the Social Security Administration, as hereafter discussed. What 20/20 has to do with is Central Visual Efficiency, according to the Regulations. Twenty/twenty vision has nothing to do with other disorders and impairments of vision. A person can have 20/20 vision which means that, in this case, with glasses claimant had 20/20 in her right eye; 20/30 in the left eye, and that the doctor would conclude that 20/30 in the left eye was so close to 20/20 that, for both eyes, the Central Visual Efficiency would be 20/20. Anyone who has ever had his eyes tested knows that one eye is tested while the other is covered; and the other eye is then tested while the first eye is covered. That is why, in this case, the right eye, along with glasses, shows 20/20 vision, and the left eye, along with glasses, shows 20/30 vi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>sion. Each eye obviously may have this degree of vision (Central Visual Acuity). But this means only that each eye (with glasses) shows 20/20 vision for distance. It does not mean that 20/20 vision for each eye is normal vision, when a person is afflicted with the disorder of double vision. For, after finding such 20/20 vision, Dr. Millis went on to report that her stereopsis was low; that she had \u201ca vertical deviation in the alignment of her eyes resulting in double vision. * * * Due to the vertical deviation and the inability to see equally clear out of both eyes, she suppresses vision in her right eye. She has a record of variable blood pressure as well as a diabetic condition, each of which makes it almost impossible to stabilize her visual problem. I have been examining Mrs. Jenkins since July 1968; during this period of time I have observed a general deterioration in her vision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">All of the medical terms used in the foregoing discussion are made intelligible by resort to the Regulations of the Social Security Administration and Webster\u2019s. International Dictionary; from the testimony of claimant herself about her greatly impaired vision; and from the comprehensive report of Dr. Millis. The statement that \u201cto the layman, 20/20 is normal vision\u201d \u2014 while it may be admitted to be the layman\u2019s idea of normal vision \u2014 does not contradict the undisputed evidence that claimant had severely impaired vision \u2014 double vision \u2014general deterioration of her vision over a period of four years, could hardly read, except when she wore very strong glasses, and the print was big, and could not see well enough to drive a car.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Repeating certain facts in a different connection and with regard to a different legal aspect, reference is made to the fact that in the prevailing opinion, it is stated that petitioner \u201cdid not claim impaired eyesight in her application for benefits. Eye trouble appeared first as a result of some questions put to her by the trial examiner.\u201d It is then said: <em>\u201cWe discuss it only </em>because the <em>dissent places great weight upon it.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The only conclusion, it seems, that one can draw from this statement is that the claim of appellant\u2019s impaired eyesight is discussed only because the dissent places great weight upon it. This, in fact, is a refusal to consider seriously the claim of appellant's impaired eyesight as an important issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The real bearing of the claim of impaired eyesight and the uncontradicted evidence of such impairment go, not to the question whether claimant relied on such impairment as a ground of disability, but whether, after all of the evidence of such impairment was directed to be placed in the record by the Hearing Examiner, claimant is to be told that her claim is only an after-thought, and that she cannot rely on such uncontradieted evidence in order that she may be able to show she could not perform duties which the Vocational Counselor stated she could do as a nurses\u2019 aide, and as a cashier, etc., which require good eyesight.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">. Moreover, in the prevailing opinion it is stated that, at the conclusion of the case, claimant filed her affidavit \u201cwhich for the first time included a claim that impaired eyesight was a contributing factor to her disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">In her affidavit mentioned in the prevailing opinion, claimant said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-11\">\u201cAs a part of my job in the cafeteria with Union Carbide at Oak Ridge, I had to use certain machines which were used for the purpose of shredding, cutting, and preparing vegetables and other foods for salads.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-12\">\u201cI used a big \u2018buffalo\u2019 machine on the job which was a machine that has a blade in a big bowl. The material to be cut was put into this bowl, which in turn cut the vegetables up ready to use in a salad. I had to carry the vegetables and other foods back and forth to this bowl.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-13\">\u201cIn addition, the cafeteria also had a \u2018snail-cutter\u2019 machine which was a knife or cutting blade in conjunction with a big tub. This was a newer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>machine and lettuce, even as much as a case of lettuce, was thrown into this big tub and it shredded or cut the lettuce or other items of food. Of course, this involved considerable amount of lifting and carrying to the machine, which is the same sort of machine that I understand is used in other specialized companies which make salads on a large scale. I have cut myself on these machines on occasion, and to a certain extent they are dangerous for a person with my eyesight, and with my other ailments, which cause me to bleed more easily, to \u2018black out\u2019, etc.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Now, all of the foregoing was admitted in evidence <em>after </em>the Vocational Counselor had testified that claimant could do the work of a nurses\u2019 aide, cashier in a cafeteria and a salad-maker, and who testified, as an expert, on appellant\u2019s job capabilities, without any mention of the prior evidence of claimant\u2019s poor eyesight, double vision, and continuously deteriorated vision.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In the prevailing opinion, it is stated that the Hearing Examiner considered the <em>\u201clate claim </em>of reduced eyesight specifically.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) After the Vocational Counselor testified that claimant could perform the duties of a nurses\u2019 aide, and the other duties mentioned requiring good eyesight, would not claimant have the right to introduce evidence that she did not have good enough eyesight to do that kind of work? It is difficult to discern why it is emphasized that claimant\u2019s affidavit \u201cfor the first time included a claim\u201d for impaired eyesight, and that the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision considered the <em>late </em>claim of reduced eyesight specifically \u2014 when any of claimant\u2019s evidence in rebuttal to the testimony of the Vocational Counsel-lor would not be late because filed after he had testified, and that any rebuttal of his testimony, necessarily, could only be introduced after he had testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Claimant\u2019s affidavit, which was introduced into evidence just before the conclusion of the evidence, went on to say that her impaired eyesight has caused her to cut her hands on the knives of the \u201cbuffalo cutter\u201d and the \u201csnail-cutter\u201d machines, used in shredding lettuce for salads, and that they are \u201cdangerous for a person with my eyesight.\u201d Nevertheless, in the prevailing opinion, it is stated that the Hearing Examiner considered \u201cthe late claim of reduced eyesight specifically.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">It appears that it is thought that claimant is at fault, first, for relying on evidence of poor eyesight and impaired vision which was brought out by her cross-examination by the Hearing Examiner and, secondly, that she is at fault for relying on evidence she introduced as to her poor eyesight and impaired vision, in rebuttal to the evidence of the Vocational Counselor.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">At the risk of some subsequent repetition, it seems necessary at this time to make the following observations:</p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">It is stated in the prevailing opinion that claimant did not, on direct examination, mention eye trouble when asked to give the reasons for her inability to continue working, and it is further stated in the prevailing opinion, as a significant and controlling fact, that \u201cwe are not convinced that failure to rely on eye trouble was the fault of appellant\u2019s lawyer. The entire record is persuasive of appellant\u2019s belated reliance on it as a disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">The foregoing is, in my opinion, a rather difficult conclusion to follow for these reasons: First, although claimant stated in her \u201cDisability Interview\u201d with a representative of the Social Security Administration that she had difficulty with her eyes ten months before her testimony before the Hearing Examiner, claimant did not base her claim to disability benefits upon her poor eyesight; second, shortly after she testified she had no problems about doing her work at the cafeteria of the Union Carbide Company except pains through her arms and shoulders, and bursitis, she was asked why she didn\u2019t drive a car, and she replied because she couldn\u2019t see \u2014 that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>lines ran together, and she couldn\u2019t see where she was going or couldn\u2019t judge her distance. It was then that the Hearing Examiner asked her attorney to get a report from Dr. Millis as to the condition of her vision; and as soon as the report was secured, it was filed in the proceedings by the direction of the Hearing Examiner. It seems to be placing an unwarranted emphasis on this statement of applicant\u2019s impaired vision to say that \u201cthe entire record is persuasive of appellant\u2019s belated reliance on it [eye trouble], as a disability.\u201d Appellant had not relied upon it as a disability in filing her claim for disability benefits. Her poor vision, however, appeared from her own uncontroverted testimony, and from the conclusive report which Dr. Millis filed, upon the order of the Hearing Examiner. The Hearing Examiner never suggested that claimant\u2019s reliance on her poor vision was belated. In his decision, the Hearing Examiner quoted the entire evidence of the statement of Dr. Millis. Not only did the Hearing Examiner quote the entire evidence of Dr. Millis, but undertook to pass upon the question by holding that claimant\u2019s visual problem could be greatly improved and stabilized by claimant\u2019s following the instructions of Dr. Shea for controlling her diabetes \u2014 although there was not the slightest trace of evidence to sustain such a holding. It is clear that no one has ever suggested \u201cappellant\u2019s belated reliance on it [eye trouble] as a disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">However, the result of such a conclusion appears to have the effect of depriving claimant of all of the evidence of Dr. Millis of her impaired eyesight, and her own testimony that she can\u2019t see well enough to drive a car, not because it is advanced as proof of disability, but more than that \u2014 to rebut the evidence of the Vocational Counselor that her \u201cresidual\u201d capabilities include her ability to perform other kinds of work, such as a nurses\u2019 aide in taking the temperature of patients by reading finely graduated clinical thermometers, taking a patient\u2019s pulse by watching the second hand of a watch while counting the pulse, taking the blood pressure of patients, or by working as a cashier in a cafeteria, inspecting the food selections, remembering the prices, striking the keys of a cash register, and making change, where, during rush hours, as the Vocational Counselor testified, \u201cThey have to do it fairly fast.\u201d This kind of work would obviously be beyond the capability of a woman with the poor and continually deteriorating vision of claimant. Even'the Hearing Examiner felt that this must be the case, for he found that claimant\u2019s poor vision was remediable by following instructions to control her diabetes; and that since it was remediable, and \u201ca remediable condition is not generally considered disabling,\u201d \u201cconsequently, claimant was not disabled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Since there is no evidence in the record that the impairment of vision was remediable, but, on the other hand, as Dr. Millis stated, there had been a general deterioration in her vision for the prior four years during which he had examined claimant, neither the majority opinion nor this opinion considers the impaired vision of claimant to be remediable by following instructions to control her diabetes. But the majority opinion is to the effect that the undisputed evidence of claimant\u2019s impaired vision must be disregarded because it was belatedly made, as a ground of disability, while this opinion holds that it would be manifestly unjust to disregard all this evidence of deteriorated vision in rebuttal of the evidence of the Vocational Counselor that claimant could perform other jobs that required especially good, or simply good, vision. All of the claimant\u2019s testimony of her poor vision, as well as the evidence of Dr. Millis, was introduced before the Vocational Counselor testified. He never mentioned it during his examination as a witness, and the Hearing Examiner never asked him any questions about claimant\u2019s impaired eyesight. None of this evidence was thought to be belatedly introduced by the Hearing Examiner, who considered it in his decision. This court cannot strike out this <em>rebutting </em>evidence to the disadvan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>tage of this poor woman on the ground that it was belatedly introduced, especially when it was expressly directed by the Hearing Examiner to be introduced during the hearing. Moreover, the evidence of Dr. Millis embraced facts which were favorable to applicant and were uncontra-dicted. Claimant\u2019s own testimony as to her greatly impaired vision was also un-contradicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">However, it is here to be emphasized that in his examination of the Vocational Counselor, the Hearing Examiner did not include in his hypothetical questions to him, any of these material facts, or any suggestions as to them. It is stated that the Vocational Counselor doubtlessly saw and examined the report of Dr. Millis, but this is very doubtful. However, that fact is not pertinent in any event. For the law in this regard was clearly declared by Judge Judd in Stewart v. Cohen, 309 F.Supp. 949, 956 (E.D.N.Y.) when he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">\u201cThe form of hypothetical question which the examiner used left out material facts favorable to the plaintiff, as pointed out above. Errors on evidentiary rulings are not usually grounds for upsetting an administrative determination, but the effect of the omissions here was so substantial as to make the examiner\u2019s action arbitrary and capricious. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 706(2) (A). It is no answer to assert, as the government does, that the vocational expert had been given the entire record. The hearing examiner\u2019s hypothetical question indicated that the only material portions of the record were those which he enumerated in the question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">For the same reason in this case, the omission in the hypothetical questions of all the evidence relating to claimant\u2019s musculoskeletal afflictions, which were the chief reasons on which she based her claim to disability benefits was so substantial as to make the Examiner\u2019s action in this regard, arbitrary and capricious. Moreover, the hypothetical question of the Hearing Examiner addressed to the Vocational Counselor to the effect that claimant had \u201cdiabetes mellitus which is controllable by insulin and dieting,\u201d was contrary to the evidence of claimant\u2019s attending physician that, at the time of the hearing and for at least two years prior thereto, claimant\u2019s diabetes had not been controllable by any of the recognized medical treatments, including Orinase and insulin. This hypothetical question, based on a complete mistake as to the nature of claimant\u2019s diabetes, also constituted an arbitrary and capricious action. The omission of material facts favorable to the claimant in each and all of such hypothetical questions, was so substantial as to make, under Stewart v. Cohen, <em>supra, </em>the Hearing Examiner\u2019s action arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">It is here to be noted, in view of the statements in the prevailing opinion, that, although the Act provides that disability means \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity,\u201d it is not necessary that the testimony of witnesses or the medical evidence of disability specifically declare that an applicant is unable, in haec verba, \u201cto engage in any substantial gainful activity.\u201d If an applicant testifies that the pain resulting from arthritis, bursitis, or any musculo-skeletal affliction prevents her from going through the physical movements necessary in any work she might do or to which she has always been accustomed, and makes it impossible for her to do such work, then it must be agreed that this is evidence of inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity. Likewise, the evidence of an attending physician that, because of the multiplicity of her afflictions \u2014 stating what they are \u2014she must stop doing the work to which she has always been accustomed, and can be gainfully employed only for short periods of time, this is evidence, too, of inability to engage in any substantial activity. Employment for short periods of time is not substantial gainful employment since it is considered only intermittent and sporadic and, according to the authorities hereafter cited and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>quoted, such employment does not constitute substantial and gainful activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Pei\u2019haps the most striking aspect of the entire case is that the testimony of claimant as to her impaired vision, her inability to see in order to drive, her visual impairment causing her to cut her hands on the slicing machines, and the evidence of Dr. Millis of her double vision, suppression of vision in one eye, and general deterioration of her vision over a period of four years, is <em>completely undisputed and uncontradicted, </em>and there is no testimony or medical evidence that, even inferentially, casts any doubt upon this undisputed evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The only action of the Hearing Examiner with respect to appellant\u2019s claim of impaired vision was to <em>ignore </em>all the evidence supporting such claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">When the Vocational Counselor was sworn, although the Hearing Examiner then had all the evidence of claimant\u2019s impaired vision before him, he examined the Vocational Counselor to secure evidence as to what claimant could do, considering her diabetes, inability to stand on her feet for any length of time, \u201ccoupled with the impairments I have just described which impose the limitations I have just mentioned \u2014 inability to stand on her feet or do extensive walking \u2014I may also add bending or lifting. Assuming she can\u2019t do those things, there is a functional limitation upon the performing of those acts, and sustained work, are there any other jobs that she would have had the residual capacity to perform and which she could adapt her previous experience and training and so forth, to?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The Vocational Counselor was the expert witness whom the Hearing Examiner had previously so described, who was to give evidence as to what \u201cresidual\u201d work claimant could perform, and the evidence of what she could do was to be introduced in his testimony in response to the hypothetical questions addressed to him by the Hearing Examiner. Never, at any time, was the Vocational Counselor asked by the Hearing Exahiiner whether his views as to what claimant could do in residual jobs would be affected by the uncontradicted evidence of claimant\u2019s double vision, general impairments in her eyesight, and general deterioration in her vision for the prior four years, and inability to drive a car.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">At no point, in spite of the uncontra-dicted evidence of claimant herself and Dr. Millis, did the Hearing Examiner ever include any mention of petitioner\u2019s claim and the evidence of her deteriorated vision, or any mention of it, in his hypothetical questions to the Vocational Counselor.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">The only purpose of having the testimony of a Vocational Counselor is to secure his evidence in answer to the hypothetical questions addressed to him. He is a vocational man. He is not a medical man. He has no medical expertise. The only \u201cresidual\u201d jobs which the Vocational Counselor testified that the claimant could perform were jobs that required good eyesight.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">The rebuttal or failure of the Hearing Examiner to submit any questions to the Vocational Counselor regarding the undisputed evidence of claimant\u2019s deteriorated vision was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">Why did the Hearing Examiner fail to submit any questions to the Vocational Counselor as to claimant\u2019s impaired vision? It appears that he must have forgotten all about this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">In the prevailing opinion it is stated that the optometrist\u2019s report was received in evidence and that \u201cwe assume that the vocational counselor had examined the optometrist\u2019s report prior to his conclusion that Mrs. Jenkins could be gainfully employed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-14\">There are no grounds for assuming that the Vocational Counselor' had examined the optometrist\u2019s report prior to his conclusion that Mrs. Jenkins could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>be gainfully employed. The report of Dr. Millis, the optometrist, was received in evidence immediately before the Vocational Counselor was sworn as a witness. It was marked by the Hearing Examiner as \u201cExhibit 22.\u201d No further mention of it was made during the hearing, all of which was transcribed. In receiving it into evidence, the Hearing Examiner said that the vocational witness will want to examine it as part of the medical evidence in this case. There is no indication in the entire transcript that the Vocational Counselor ever examined this evidence of Dr. Millis. He never mentioned it during the hearing or afterward, and the Hearing Examiner never mentioned it during the hearing. The Vocational Counselor never commented on what \u201cdouble vision\u201d meant, or what \u201cdefinite vertical deviation in the alignment of her eyes\u201d meant, or why, because of her inability to see equally clearly out of both eyes, she would suppress vision in her right eye, or upon anything else concerning the admitted general deterioration of her vision during the prior four years. There is no ground for assuming that the Vocational Counselor examined Dr. Millis\u2019 report prior to his conclusion that claimant could act as a nurses\u2019 aide in reading clinical thermometers, in taking the pulse of patients while watching the movement of a second hand on a watch, or acting as a cashier in charge of the cash register in a cafeteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">When the Hearing Examiner came to write his decision, there was the report of Dr. Millis before him. He then felt called upon to make some finding with regard to the undisputed evidence of claimant\u2019s impaired vision. So he made the finding that, in spite of her poor visual condition, \u201cit is noted that with full cooperation of her treating physician in following his instructions and controlling her diabetes and obesity, this <em>impairment\u2019\u2019 </em>as he described it \u201ctoo, can be greatly improved and stabilized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The Hearing Examiner, in his decision, affirmed in the prevailing opinion, was also guilty of reversible error in <em>ignoring </em>the undisputed fact that, at the time of his findings and at the time he examined the Vocational Counselor, claimant\u2019s diabetes was out of control even with the treatment of insulin, and had been out of control for several years. Dr. Shea, whose report of May 17, 1967, was requested by the Hearing Examiner, set forth that in January 1965, her diabetes was out of control; that in May 1966, she was placed on insulin for her diabetes; that throughout May 1966 her blood sugar remained elevated, even on insulin, and that in February 1967 her diabetes was still uncontrolled. All of the foregoing was undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">In May 1967, in his hypothetical question to the Vocational Counselor, the Hearing Examiner stated, among other matters: \u201cAssuming that I, as a hearing examiner in this case, should find (upon) examination of all the record in this case, particularly the medical evidence, that this claimant has had diabetes mellitus, which is controllable by insulin and dieting,\u201d etc. This question was part of the basis on which the Vocational Counselor found that claimant was not suffering any disability. But the undisputed evidence was that, for nearly two years before that time, claimant\u2019s diabetes was not under control \u2014 or controllable \u2014 and that, when the Hearing Examiner put the hypothetical question to the Vocational Counselor, assuming that claimant\u2019s diabetes was controlled by insulin, the diabetes was still uncontrolled even with insulin treatment. There was no basis for the Vocational Counselor to find that claimant was not suffering a disability because her diabetes was under control. This was contrary to the undisputed medical evidence at the time the Vocational Counsel- or was examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Moreover, in his findings, the Hearing Examiner stated that, since claimant was found to be a diabetic in November 1959, her diabetes had been kept under control by diet and oral medication, but in April 1966 the diabetes \u201cwas out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>control when she was hospitalized and put on insulin. By January 28, 1967, the claimant had gained<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> another ten pounds.\u201d But it was undisputed that her weight would increase with the taking of insulin, and that her attending physician had pointed this out to her. Then comes the totally unsupported finding to cut down claimant: \u201cThere is also some indication that she does not take her insulin with sufficient regularity to keep her diabetes under control.\u201d It seemed unbelievable that such a finding, damaging to claimant\u2019s whole case, could be made without any evidence to sustain it. But there is no evidence whatever to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">In the Hearing Examiner\u2019s final findings of fact, he states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">\u201cClaimant has had a history of mild diabetes since late 1959 which has been managed by oral medication. * * * The claimant is obese and her diabetes got out of control intermittently.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">This is directly contrary to the evidence of Dr. Shea, the last evidence introduced in the case \u2014 and undisputed evidence\u2014 that in January 1965 her diabetes was out of control, that even with the use of insulin it could not be controlled, and that at his last examination of her in February 1957, \u201cher diabetes is still uncontrolled.\u201d In the face of this undisputed evidence, how can this court accept the final finding that claimant had had a history of mild diabetes, and that it got out of control intermittently? The intent of the Hearing Examiner\u2019s finding, made to bolster the decision, is that claimant was not suffering from uncontrollable diabetes \u2014 but that the only evidence in the case shoves that she was. Contrary to this finding, the undisputed evidence showed that claimant\u2019s diabetes did not get out of control intermittently. It was a disease that continued to become worse and, according to the undisputed evidence, was finally for the last two years, out of all.control even with insulin.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">\u201cVision\u201d is described as \u201ccentral\u201d or \u201cperipheral,\u201d in the Regulations hereinafter mentioned. \u201cCentral,\u201d as used anatomically and physiologically, means \u201cdistinguished from peripheral.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, Second Edition, Unabridged. \u201cVisual acuity\u201d is defined as: \u201cSharpness of vision in respect to the ability to resolve detail.\u201d Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">The Hearing Examiner\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s \u201cpoor vision is correctible with glasses to 20/20 in the right and 20/30 in the left\u201d means only that \u201cher Central Visual Acuity\u201d is correctable with glasses. Central visual acuity results in the ability to distinguish detail and to read and do fine work; and loss of central visual acuity may be caused by impaired distant vision or impaired near vision. It has nothing to do with vertical deviation resulting in double vision.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">In the Regulations of the Social Security Administration, Title 20, Section 404.1538, Appendix, Section 2.00, it is provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">\u201cA. Causes of disability. Disease or injury of the special sense organs may produce disability by reduction of the ability to see or hear. <em>Loss of central vision </em>results in inability to distinguish detail and prevents reading and fine work. Loss of peripheral vision restricts the ability of an individual to move about freely. * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-11\">\u201cB. Central vision acuity. A loss of central visual acuity may be caused by <em>impaired distant and/or near vision. </em>However, for an individual to meet the level of severity described in Sections 2.02 and 2.04 only the remaining central visual acuity for distance of the better eye with best correction using the Snellen test chart may be used.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">Section 2.02, above mentioned, applies to impairment of the central visual acuity; and Section 2.04 applies to loss of visual efficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Section 2.09 sets forth the Snellen test chart headed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-4\">\u201cPERCENTAGE OF CENTRAL VISUAL EFFICIENCY CORRESPONDING TO CENTRAL VISUAL ACUITY NOTATIONS <em>FOB DISTANCE </em>IN THE PHAKIC AND APHAKIC EYE (BETTER EYE)\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Under this heading, the Snellen Test Chart is as shown in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Section 2.00 C. is concerned with cause of disability due to loss of peripheral vision. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\"><em>\u201cField of vision. </em>Disability due to loss of peripheral vision may result if there is contraction of the visual fields. The contraction may be either symmetrical or irregular.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">The Section then proceeds to outline the tests to show such disability due to loss of peripheral vision. The instant case is not concerned with Section 2.00 C., where disability is due to loss of peripheral vision.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">Claimant\u2019s central visual acuity is measured both for distance and for near vision, using the Snellen notation, each eye being measured separately, and correction of the loss of claimant\u2019s visual acuity was corrected by glasses. However, as Dr. Millis reported, claimant\u2019s stereopsis, or depth perception, is low, which is the reason for her not being able to judge distances; and she has a definite vertical deviation in the alignment of her eyes resulting in double vision, or diplopia. \u201cDiplopia\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, Second Edition, Unabridged, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-13\">\u201cDouble vision of a single object; esp., Med., when constituting a disorder of <em>sight. </em>In <em>crossed, or heteronymous, diplopia, </em>the eyes are focused beyond the object and the image seen by the right eye is at the left, that by the left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>eye at the right.

In Section 2.05, one of these impairments is <em>\u201cComplete homonymous hemianopsia,\u201d </em>or half sight, or vision, of uncrossed images of an object <em>seen double; </em>where the image seen by the right eye is on the right side and that by the left, on the left side; and when one image is above the other, the result is vertical diplopia, as above defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">From the foregoing, it is clear that the Hearing Examiner\u2019s conclusion that Dr. Millis found that claimant\u2019s <em>poor vision </em>could be corrected with glasses to 20/20 in the right and 20/30 in the left is not sustained by substantial evidence, since Dr. Millis found that her stereopsis was low; that there was a definite vertical deviation in the alignment of her eyes, resulting in double vision, and that her vision had deteriorated during the four-year period he had examined her \u2014 all of which resulted in her poor vision and none of which was corrected by glasses\u2014 and resulted in a condition in which she could hardly see big letters with strong glasses, and could not see where she was going when she had tried to drive her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">It seems impossible that any reasonable person would consider that a woman of such poor eyesight would be able to engage in substantial gainful employment as a cashier, using a cash register, where a mistake in striking a key would result in mistakes or losses; where she must see on a tray all the dishes selected by a customer, must remember the prices of all the different items and must make change immediately for the many items purchased. It would be absurd to confide to such a nearly blind person the duty of a nurses\u2019 aid, which requires reading the finely graduated marks in taking temperatures of patients, counting the seconds on the dial of a watch while taking pulse; dong simple mathematics, and writing notes to the nurses for the hospital records. However, where the qualification of eyesight is required, Vocational Counselors and Hearing Examiners are often singularly blind.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">In Massey v. Celebrezze, 345 F.2d 146, 150 (C.A. 6), all \u201cof the doctors reported also on the fact that Massey had lost an eye, which, he had testified, resulted from an explosion. One doctor said that Massey had poor vision in the other eye; another doctor said the remaining eye was defective; and another doctor said he had corrected visual acuity of 20/100 in the remaining eye.\u201d The Vocational Counselor had stated that claimant could have performed the job of a watchman or of a flagman. On review of the disal-lowance of benefits, this court, in the <em>Massey </em>case, stated;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">\u201cOn cross-examination by Massey\u2019s attorney, Dr. Runyan was asked whether he would \u2018recommend this man with just one eye and with his lung condition to a prospective employer for a job as a night watchman or a flagman on a road project, in view of his visual problems and employment problems,\u2019\u2014 and counsel added to his question: \u2018If you were called upon as an expert by a prospective employer to interview this gentleman and such an interview revealed that you obtained the knowledge that you have here today and were then to make recommendation to this prospective employer as to whether or not it would be feasible, economically feasible, to hire this man as an eye-by-night watchman or flagman on the road, what would your recommendation be?\u2019 Dr. Runyan\u2019s reply to this question was: \u2018Well, I\u2019d look at it this way, as I understand it, I\u2019m to point out the residual factors that he has that can be useful, as to whether they take him or not, that will be up to the employer, * * * \u2019 Counsel for Mr. Massey, not receiving a direct answer to his question, pursued the subject by asking:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-10\">\u201c \u2018Counsel: Can I assume from that answer that you would recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>mend to a prospective employer that [he] would let the man be employed either as a night watchman or a flagman ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">Witness: That isn\u2019t in the realm of my duty here today, as I understand what I\u2019m supposed to do is to point out things that he can do at the present time that are required in different types of occupations and I would indicate that he does have a vision comparable to what he had before his injury and he was able to be employed in the mines with its heavy equipment, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that he would be \u2014 well, let\u2019s put it this way, that his vision would not be \u2014 would not preclude him from being employed.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">\u201cObviously, Dr. Runyan would not have recommended a man like Massey, blind in one eye, and with defective vision in the other, as a night watchman or a flagman; but he had listed the job of night watchman and flagman, as a job within Massey\u2019s capability, and he refused to give a candid answer to counsel\u2019s question, when it appeared that such a job for a man in Massey\u2019s condition would be absurd.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">In Miracle v. Celebrezze, 351 F.2d 361, 381 (C.A. 6), the court was confronted by a similar situation in which it was observed :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\">\u201cThere was the evidence of the \u2018Vocational Counselor,\u2019 who has become a stock figure in these cases, and who, as usual, availed himself of the U. S. Dictionary of Occupational Titles to point out what work was available, but his testimony was no more impressive than that of the Vocational Counselors in Massey v. Celebrezze, <em>supra, </em>and Cyrus v. Celebrezze, 341 F.2d 192 (C.A. 4); and his evidence carried no weight. As an instance, the Vocational Counselor felt that among the types of light work which appellant could perform was that of a night watchman \u2014 a rather peculiar occupation for a man whose eyesight was so poor he could not hold down a job of sweeping or dusting machines because he could not see whether or not the dust was removed. Moreover, the Vocational Counselor thought appellant could do the work of a flagman, except for prolonged standing. When asked by appellant\u2019s counsel whether it would affect appellant\u2019s ability to perform such jobs, while he was taking the heavy dosages of drugs and sedatives, already referred to, the Vocational Counselor\u2019s answer was that \u2018for some employers, this would make a difference, I suspect, for others I doubt that it would however.\u2019 Other jobs which the Vocational Counselor suggested for appellant were equally absurd \u2014 armature winding, tool grinding, assembling and repair of electrical equipment, spray painting, \u2018a kind of bench work in some industries,\u2019 machine tending, \u2018the kind of thing where the worker, the employee, trouble shoots the machine, <em>keeps an eye on it </em>to see that everything is running properly.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">The foregoing cases seemed to reach the height of absurdity in holdings of Hearing Examiners that the residual capacity of a nearly blind person included the ability to perform work which required unusually good eyesight.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">Although the Hearing Examiner specifically requested the above-mentioned report from Dr. Millis as to claimant\u2019s vision, he emphasized in his findings that claimant \u201chad sought no medical treatment for this condition.\u201d This was the first and only time that \u201cmedical treatment\u201d was mentioned. Although the Hearing Examiner questioned claimant at length during her testimony on many aspects of her complaints and disabilities, he never asked her whether she had sought medical treatment for her impaired vision. The only report sought by the Hearing Examiner on the subject of claimant\u2019s vision was his <em>specific </em>request for the report of Dr. Millis. This was the only evidence in which the Hearing Examiner was interested on the issue of claimant\u2019s vision. But after the hearing was closed, when the Hearing Examiner found that there was no evidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>case contradicting claimant\u2019s testimony that she could hardly see, and the evidence of Dr. Millis supporting her testimony of her greatly impaired vision and giving the reasons therefor, this whole question had to be taken care of in some way to sustain a denial of disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">The first step the Hearing Examiner followed was the statement, detrimental to claimant, that she had never sought medical treatment for her condition\u2014 although the Hearing Examiner had referred, during the hearing, to the \u201cstatement from Dr. Fred Millis, Optometrist\u201d * * * \u201cas part of the <em>medical </em>evidence in this case.\u201d In this last statement, he was correct. The other statement of the Hearing Examiner that claimant had never sought medical treatment for her condition seems incredible in the light of the fact that the Hearing Examiner made only one specific request, and that was for the additional report of Dr. Mil-lis. Moreover, when he came to reduce his findings and conclusions to written form, the Hearing Examiner seems not to have been aware of the fact that under the new regulations of the Social Security Administration, <em>medical evidence </em>shall include \u201cin cases involving visual impairments, the measurement of visual acuity and visual fields <em>reported by a duly licensed optometrist </em>* * 20 CFR 404.1524.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Further, with regard to claimant\u2019s greatly impaired vision, the Hearing Examiner found: \u201cAgain it is noted here that with claimant\u2019s full cooperation with her treating physician in following his instructions for controlling her diabetes, this impairment, too, can be greatly improved and stabilized.\u201d There was no evidence to sustain this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">The Hearing Examiner disposed of one of claimant\u2019s serious complaints as follows: \u201cHer complaints of smothering etc. were considered due to chronic bronchitis which is not severe enough to cause more than a mild obstructive ventilatory insufficiency which does not preclude her from performing moderate or light work on a sustained basis. Moreover, claimant\u2019s bronchial condition is aggravated by her continuing to smoke. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">There is no evidence that her complaints of \u201csmothering\u201d were considered due to chronic bronchitis. Dr. Obenour gave it as his opinion that she had an \u201cupper respiratory infection\u201d because of her \u201celevated white count.\u201d His study of her pulmonary function was \u201cconsistent with mild obstructive ventilation insufficiency.\u201d Her smothering spells would occur on exertion or at rest. They had no connection with her bronchitis.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">On the hearing, the Hearing Examiner was of the opinion that the \u201csmothering spells\u201d were due to claimant\u2019s nervous condition. Claimant testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-11\">\u201cQ. I think I\u2019ve read something in your reports that you also had problems with smothering?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-12\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-13\">Q. Explain about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-14\">A. Well, I just smother, just seems like I can\u2019t get my breath. I just smother down. I get up and walk and sometimes it will get, you know, cleared up and some- \u25a0 times it don\u2019t. I had one spell at the table and the doctor said it was nerves. I don\u2019t know what what it was. He said it was nerves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-15\">Examiner: <em>That verified what I was telling you just a few minutes ago.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-16\">The Hearing Examiner had no medical expertise, but he at that time believed, and agreed with what claimant\u2019s doctor had said was the cause of her smothering spells \u2014 nervousness, for which she was not to blame. In his findings, however, he found her smothering was the result of her bronchitis, for which, he held, she was to blame, because of her smoking. There was no evidence that claimant\u2019s smothering spells were caused by her bronchitis. The only evidence was that they were caused by her nervous condition that had existed for many years.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-17\">The Hearing Examiner found that the examining physicians, and claimant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>personal physician, \u201care unanimous in their findings that even though the claimant <em>does not have the residual capacity to engage in productive substan-tian gainful activity </em>requiring physical exertion or labor for any prolonged period of time, <em>neither of them rule out claimant\u2019s residual capacity to be gainfully employed </em>in performing moderate or light work on a sustained basis. In fact, they indicate she has the capacity <em>to engage in moderate light work on a sustained basis.\u201d </em>Here, among other misconceptions, including the erroneous statement that claimant\u2019s personal physician made any such findings, the Hearing Examiner failed to note the provisions of the Act with regard to what constitutes disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">In Dunn v. Folsom, 166 F.Supp. 44, 49 (D.C.Ark.), the court correctly observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">\u201cIt should also be noted that the word \u2018substantial\u2019 as used in Secs. 416 and 423 does not modify \u2018gainful\u2019, but rather modifies \u2018activity\u2019. The activity in which the plaintiff must be able to engage must- not only be \u2018gainful\u2019 but it must also be \u2018substantial\u2019. The determinative factor here is not how substantial the gain is, but how substantial the activity in which the plaintiff could gainfully engage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">In his finding above referred to, the Hearing Examiner stated that even though the physicians found that claimant <em>does not have the </em>residual <em>capacity </em>to engage <em>in substantial gainful activity, </em>they did not rule out her residual capacity to be gainfully employed in performing moderate or light work on a sustained basis, and that they indicated that she had the capacity to work on a sustained basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">It is not sufficient that claimant has the <em>residual </em>capacity to be <em>gainfully </em>employed or that she has the capacity to engage in <em>moderate light work </em>on a sustained basis. She must not only have the capacity to engage in gainful activity, but in substantial activity. Failing that standard of capacity to engage in substantial activity and in gainful activity, claimant comes within the definition of disability under the provisions of the Act and becomes entitled to disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">The Hearing Examiner found that \u201cthe presence of an organic basis for the multiple complaints which claimant had made involving diabetes, gastrointestinal disorders, and bursitis, etc., is not sufficient to establish disability within the meaning of the Act.\u201d He bases this view upon the ground that \u201cthe mere presence of a disease or medically determinable impairment does not automatically entitle a claimant to a disability period or disability insurance benefits under the Social Security Act * * *. Upon consideration of all the evidence of record in the case, the hearing examiner has become convinced that most of the impairments about which the claimant complains and upon which she alleges disability are remediable * * * [and] a remediable condition is not generally considered disabling and that her chances for obtaining the same type of work in which she had previously engaged would be increased if she lost weight. <em>Consequently, </em>claimant was not disabled and not entitled to a period of disability and disability benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">This entire foregoing finding is based on the conclusion that since all the impairments upon which claimant bases her claim of disability are remediable, such disabling conditions are not considered disabling (since they are remediable) and, therefore, claimant is not disabled from engaging in substantial gainful activity. The fatal defect in this conclusion is that there is no substantial evidence that all or any of the impairments, on which claimant bases her claim for disability, are remediable. There is no evidence contradicting the statements of claimant\u2019s attending physician, introduced during the hearing, that claimant\u2019s diabetes was at that time uncontrollable, and had been out of control for the prior two and a half years. Moreover, the evidence of Dr. Shea that because of a multiplicity of ailments, including muscu-loskeletal and joint disorders, claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>could perform only sporadic, intermittent work for short periods of time, was undisputed, as was the evidence of Dr. Zanolli that claimant had musculoskeletal complaints of a chronic nature, intermittent back complaints, multiple episodes of bursitis, particularly affecting left shoulder and lower extremity joints, and it is notable that neither of the Social Security Administration physicians reported anything about the musculoskele-tal and joint disorders which were the principal cause of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">From the foregoing, it is clear that there was no evidence to sustain the Hearing Examiner\u2019s findings that all the impairments suffered by claimant were remediable, and that, therefore, claimant could not be considered disabled because of such impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The Hearing Examiner\u2019s final blanket \u25a0finding that, at no time, was claimant precluded from engaging in substantial gainful activity for a continuous twelvemonth period prior to the time of his decision, is not only not sustained by substantial evidence, but is contrary to all that appears from the Hearing Examiner\u2019s conclusions, remarks, and hypothetical questions to his expert witness, during the entire course of the hearing. The Hearing Examiner had insisted that claimant\u2019s impairments were remediable; that her diabetes could be remedied by diet; that her musculoskeletal afflictions \u2014and her great impairment of vision\u2014 resulted from her diabetes; and, in his hypothetical questions which he addressed to his expert witness, the Vocational Counselor, he described the condition of claimant as precluding her from engaging in activity that required her to do any standing on her feet \u201cfor a period of time, and engaging in sustained work,\u201d and in ability to do extensive walking, or bending, or lifting. All of the Hearing Examiner\u2019s own conclusions thus expressed during the hearing, and the undisputed medical testimony with regard to claimant\u2019s condition during the twelve months prior to the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision show that she was disabled from substantial gainful activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">However, because of the evidence of the only two medical witnesses on whom the Hearing Examiner relied, we revert to their medical reports, and the law applicable to their consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">We have mentioned the speculative statement of Dr. Obenour that claimant might be limited by her <em>pulmonary </em>impairment from performing heavy work, but would not be limited for performing <em>moderate or light </em>work on a sustained basis; and Dr. Collmann\u2019s statement that until claimant had a surgical operation for her gallstones she \u201cprobably has <em>some </em>degree of restriction until that time,\u201d but would have no restriction thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Even though the evidence of Dr. Obe-nour and Dr. Collmann did not indicate any consideration or recommendation as to any of claimant\u2019s musculoskeletal and joint disorders, which were the principal causes of her disability, the statements that claimant would not be limited from performing moderate or light work, or would probably have some degree of restriction until a surgical operation, did not constitute substantial evidence upon which to base any findings on their testimony; and the statement of either of these physicians that claimant was not suffering from an impairment that precluded her from engaging in substantial gainful activity; that she had only a slight limitation of activity; and that she should be able to do some work, is not substantial evidence that the claimant could engage in substantial gainful activity when viewed in the light of the evidence of another doctor, or other doctors who had continuously treated claimant and testified to the contrary, and in the light of facts reflected in the transcript as a whole; and the foregoing rule is unanimously declared as the law in the numerous leading cases that have passed upon the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">The general statement of a physician that a claimant could perform \u201clight work\u201d is not substantial evidence that he is able to engage in substantial gainful activity. In Clemochefsky v. Cele-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>brezze, 222 F.Supp. 73, 78 (D.C.Pa.), the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">\u201cOnce proper medical evidence, buttressed by subjective evidence from claimant, has shown a sufficiently severe impairment, it must be determined if such impairment, plus claimant\u2019s educational and work status, preclude any substantial, gainful activity. Blankenship v. Ribicoff, 206 F.Supp. 165 (S.D.W.Va.1962). In cases of this kind, where the claimant alleges inability to engage in substantial, gainful activity, <em>and his personal physician, the man in whose charge claimant has entrusted his health, claims likewise, if examining physicians are to dispute this contention, they must give the medical basis for their opinions. It is not sufficient to say that a man suffers some form of physical impairment yet can do \u2018light work.\u2019 </em>It must be shown medically that he can perform the physical activities certain jobs require without serious aggravation to present physical impairment or to general health. Otherwise, the Hearing Examiner\u2019s findings would amount to pure speculation.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">In Popovich v. Celebrezze, 220 F.Supp. 205, 207 (D.C.Pa.), Chief Judge Gourley was called upon to determine whether the testimony of an expert medical witness, that an applicant \u201ccould do light work,\u201d constituted \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d to support a finding that claimant was able to engage in substantial gainful employment, and he held that such testimony did not constitute such substantial evidence. In determining the case, Judge Gourley said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">\u201cOf the nine medical and hospital reports from five different doctors, none of whom was the personal physician of the claimant, and one hospital, only one doctor affirmatively indicated an ability to do even \u2018light work,\u2019 and none of them even implied that claimant was not continuing to have difficulty with his back. Even Dr. Stuart N. Rowe, who felt that claimant could do light work, found atrophy in the left lower leg and an indentation at L-4, L-5, and gave a diagnosis of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">\u2018? Recurrent herniated disc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahf\">? Epidural scar,\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-10\">stating that patient may require further surgery in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-11\">\u201cThe statement of Dr. Rowe that claimant can do light work cannot be deemed \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 on which to rest the finding that claimant is able to engage in substantial gainful activity, for the reason that the bald statement of Dr. Rowe that claimant \u2018could do light work\u2019 does not even purport to define the extent to which claimant can do light work. Dr. Rowe, in his medical report, expresses no opinion as to whether the claimant is one of that class of persons who have sustained an injury but are capable of steadily performing certain types of light work which are presumably available and procurable, or whether he is one of that class who are not able, uninterruptedly, to do even light work owing to their physical limitations, a person labeled in Pennsylvania as \u2018a nondescript.\u2019 See Stewart v. Commonwealth, 198 Pa.Super. 261, 182 A.2d 100 (1962). Absent such a definition of the extent to which claimant can do light work, the report of Dr. Rowe cannot constitute \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 to support a finding that claimant is able to engage in substantial gainful employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-12\">\u201cAt most, the report of Dr. Rowe can be deemed to constitute \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 to support a finding that claimant can, with interruptions, do light work. Under these circumstances, for claimant to find gainful employment, a job would have to be made for him and we must be realistic enough to understand and appreciate that in the labor market today, jobs are not made for any person. Nothing in the record before the Court suggests that there is any such reasonable possibility available to the claimant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>\u201cOn the basis of the composite medical testimony, the uncontradieted testimony of the claimant, the fact that all of the doctors\u2019 reports were made at the behest of either the Social Security Administration or claimant\u2019s employer\u2019s workmen's compensation carrier, and. the reasonable interpretation to be made of the report of Dr. Rowe when the entire report is considered, it is evident that there simply is not substantial evidence in the record to support a finding that claimant is capable of doing a type of light work of which there is a reasonable possibility of being employed to do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">In Massey v. Celebrezze, 345 F.2d 146, 155 (C.A. 6), this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">\u201cThe instant case is similar to Cyrus v. Celebrezze, 341 F.2d 192 (C.A. 4) decided January 5, 1965, in which it appeared that the physicians who were intimately familiar with the claimant\u2019s medical condition, concluded that he was totally and permanently disabled and impossible to rehabilitate; that, on the other hand, there were assertions of two physicians, hired by the Social Security Administration to evaluate claimant\u2019s condition, and that they expressed the view that claimant would be able to work if he could arrange to sit for two four-hour shifts. One of these physicians was most guarded in his answer, stating that he saw no <em>neurological </em>reason disqualifying the claimant from such an undertaking; but both of the Administration\u2019s physicians frankly admitted \u2018that because they had no prior knowledge of Cyrus\u2019 history and only a limited time in which to examine him, their evaluations might not be entirely accurate.\u2019 The court in arriving at a determination of the case, said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">\u201c \u2018The medical evidence that Cyrus suffers from a disability is uncontradicted.

But where the Secretary places reliance upon one portion of the testimony to the disregard of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, the Secretary\u2019s conclusion may not stand. Thomas v.

Flemming, 183 F.Supp. 450 (D.C.W.D.Ark.), two physicians who had treated the applicant for disability benefits over a period of years stated that he was totally incapacitated, while a physician to whom the applicant had been referred by the Social Security Administration stated that in view of his condition, he would place the applicant in a class \u201cwith slight limitation of activity\u201d and \u201cI believe he should be able to do some work.\u201d The Hearing Examiner on the evidence of the Social Security Administration held that while the applicant was unable to perform work requiring stress, strain, or heavy physical exertion, it did not appear that he would be precluded from engaging in many types of light or sedentary work, and that the \u201cconsultative specialist\u201d expressed the opinion that he should be able to do some work, and that if he could overcome his anxiety, he would get along much more satisfactorily. The Hearing Examiner, accordingly, held that the applicant\u2019s impairments \u201care not of such severity as would continuously preclude him from engaging in any substantial gainful activity * * Chief Judge John E. Miller, in reversing the decision of the Secretary and remanding the case for the granting of disability benefits, held that there was no substantial evidence to support the conclusions of the Secretary, and stated: \u201cTwo doctors who have treated [applicant] over a period of years advise him not to work and state that he is totally incapacitated. The only evidence in support of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Referee\u2019s findings is the medical report of Dr. Hall, based upon one examination of the plaintiff.\u201d In his determination of the case, Judge Miller said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-3\">\u201cAfter reading and considering the whole of the record, the court does not find that the Referee\u2019s conclusions are supported by substantial evidence. It is obvious that the findings of the Referee are based almost exclusively on the medical report of Dr. Hall. However, the court does not find that Dr. Hall\u2019s report is sufficient to constitute substantial evidence in the light of the other medical evidence and other facts reflected in the transcript as a whole. The substantiality of evidence must take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight. Universal Camera Corp. v.

Teague v. Gardner, 281 F.Supp. 43, 48 (E.D.Tenn.N.D.), Miracle v. Celebrezze, 351 F.2d 361, 379 (C.A. 6), Combs v. Gardner, 382 F.2d 949 (C.A. 6), Colwell v. Gardner, 386 F.2d 56, 70, 71 (C.A. 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">We are of the view that one of the principal reasons for the prejudicial error of the Hearing Examiner is that he relied on isolated remarks in the record as the basis of his findings, rather than on the overwhelming evidence to the contrary. . He relied on an isolated statement of Dr. Obenour that claimant might be limited by her pulmonary impairment from performing heavy work but not from performing moderate or light work. He relied on the isolated statement of Dr. Collmann that claimant\u2019s gall-bladder disease could be modified by corrective surgery, and that she would not be \u201crestricted\u201d thereafter. Neither of these doctors knew all of claimant\u2019s musculo-skeletal and joint disorders, which admittedly she had. The Hearing Examiner also relied on an isolated statement that she had \u201cgone off\u201d a diet prescribed for her by Dr. Shea; but he paid no attention to an undisputed statement that the diet she was \u201con,\u201d was approved by Dr. Shea. The Hearing Examiner paid no attention to the voluminous evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>of claimant\u2019s musculoskeletal disorders, or to the undisputed evidence that her diabetes was not controllable. His reason for ignoring all the evidence that showed claimant to be disabled was his view that there was little, if any, clinical evidence to show a medical condition, although we have never had before us, in any case, such a wealth of clinical evidence to show disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">\u201cThis is a classic example of the hearing examiner placing reliance upon one portion of the record to the disregard of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.\u201d Thomas v. Celebrezze, 331 F.2d 541 (C.A. 4). \u201cWhere the Secretary places reliance upon one portion of the testimony to the disregard of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, the Secretary\u2019s conclusions may not stand.\u201d Cyrus v. Celebrezze, 341 F.2d 192, 195 (C.A. 4). \u201cIn other words, the findings of the hearing examiner are not supported by substantial evidence when he relies on isolated remarks in one or two medical reports before him.\u201d Park v. Celebrezze, 214 F.Supp. 153, 162 (D.C.Ark.) \u201cMoreover, we have long endorsed the rule that clinical medical reports are not of themselves dispositive of the question of claimant\u2019s disability, Dillon v. Cele-brezze, 345 F.2d 753 (C.A. 4), but fall into an interrelation with other elements, among which are, in the instant case, documented observations by Social Security Administration employees that claimant appeared to be in \u2018strain and distress\u2019 when sitting for just short periods of time. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\u201cIn making a determination concerning plaintiff\u2019s ability or inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity, consideration must be given not only to the objective medical findings, but also to the subjective evidence of pain and disability as well as plaintiff\u2019s educational background, work history, and present age.\u201d Mullins v. Finch, 303 F. Supp. 1192, 1197 (D.C.W.Va.).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">In the determination of whether a social security claimant for disability benefits is disabled, and unable to engage in any substantial gainful employment, the testimony of lay witnesses is entitled to consideration. Walker v. Gardner, 266 F.Supp. 998 (D.C.Ind.). In the instant case, as heretofore mentioned, the interviewer for the Social Security Administration made a written report stating \u201cthat when the claimant came to the District Office to file her claim, \u2018She seemed to walk with difficulty. * * * When she first sat down, she seemed out of breath. Her left arm seemed to be stiff, and she appeared to have limited use of it. * * * She certainly appeared to be in some noticeable physical distress.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">In Leath v. Flemming, 191 F.Supp. 577 (D.C.Ala.), the court held that the determination of the Secretary that a claimant who suffered from arthritis so severely that he could not remain standing or sitting for long, could walk only short periods of time, and could drive only very short distances, was not so disabled as to preclude him from performing substantial gainful activity, was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">The Hearing Examiner in this case made no mention of, and gave no consideration to, claimant\u2019s pain, testified to by her, and supported by the medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">\u201cPain was brushed aside as a subjective non-entity. Well reasoned opinions and the obvious purposes of the Act compel that great consideration be accorded to that merciless entity called \u2018pain\u2019. The fact that some extra-ordinary individuals can bear it and perform unflinchingly does not mean that such heroics is the \u2018standard\u2019. The criterion is not even the standard of the ordinary man or the average man; the standard is the individual claimant himself, with all his personal assets and liabilities.\u201d Drafts v.

Smith v. Cele-brezze, 229 F.Supp. 827 (D.C.N.C.). Even pain unaccompanied by any objectively observable symptoms, which is nevertheless real to the sufferer and so intense as to be disabling, will support a claim for disability benefits. Ber v. Celebrezze, 332 F.2d 293 (C.A. 2). * * * The notion that pain must be endured, that pain, no matter how severe or overpowering, is not disabling unless it will substantially aggravate a condition, is contrary to law under disability provisions of the Social Security Act which were intended to ameliorate some of the rigors that life imposes. Page v. Celebrezze, 311 F.2d 757 (C.A. 5). The criteria to be considered in determining a claimant\u2019s ability or inability to engage in substantial gainful activity, for purposes of determining his right to social security disability benefits, are objective medical facts, diagnoses, and expert medical opinions on subsidiary questions of fact, subjective evidence of pain and disability testified to by claimant, and claimant\u2019s educational background, work history and present age. Helton v.

An individual\u2019s body may be mechanically capable of use and function, but the pain resulting therefrom may be so great as to preclude them. Indeed, the nervous system in an effort to avoid agonizing pain may in effect impose immobility and inactivity upon the person affected; and in such a case the disability is no less real than it would be if the patient had lost the mechanical use of his body.\u201d Lewis v.

The Social Security Administration must make its own determination and is not bound by the findings or conclusions of claimant\u2019s employer regarding her inability to perform her former duties due to \u2018disability\u2019 as that term is defined under the Retirement Insurance Program of her private employer.\u201d However, the determination of claimant\u2019s employer and the employer\u2019s insurance carrier that claimant is disabled, and the fact that she was retired with full retirement benefits based on her disability are relevant, entitled to weight and must be considered by the Hearing Examiner, since they are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">Determinations of disability made by non-governmental organizations or by another governmental agency are not binding upon Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, nor are conclusions of any physician binding as to extent of disability, but such determinations and conclusions are relevant and must be considered when they are supported by substantial evidence. Ihnen v. Gardner, D. C., 253 F.Supp. 541; and it is held that the determination of another governmental agency as to disability of social security disability benefits claimant, while not binding on hearing examiner who must make an independent determination on question of whether claimant is able to engage in any substantial gainful activity, must be given some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>weight <em>and must be considered along with the other evidence, and the hearing examiner should evaluate standards by which claimant was granted the compensation he claimed before such other agency to determine the significance of those standards. </em>Pendergraph v. Cele-brezze, D.C., 255 F.Supp. 313 (1966). In determining disability within the Social Security Act, Secretary is not bound by outside determinations of disability, such as those of claimant\u2019s life insurer or those of state agencies, but referee need consider such outside determinations along with other evidence. Stol-iaroff v. Ribicoff, D.C., 198 F.Supp. 587. A finding of the Veterans\u2019 Administration that claimant was 100% disabled while not binding on Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare on application of claimant for disability benefits, was entitled to weight in evaluating claimant\u2019s condition. Mischler v. Celebrezze, D.C., 227 F.Supp. 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">We are of the view that the fact that claimant\u2019s employer paid her salary for months while she was ill and disabled, and afterward 'both the employer and its insurer retired her with full monthly benefit payments based on her disability, was relevant to her disability under the Social Security Act; was supported by substantial evidence of her disability, and that the Hearing Examiner was obliged under the authorities cited to consider it as evidence of her disability under the Social Security Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Dr. Shea\u2019s report is undisputed that, due to the multiplicity of her complaints (which he enumerated), during the two years prior to the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision, claimant had a record of absenteeism from her work, and that she could be gainfully employed for only short periods of time, if she could find employment under such circumstances. This kind of employment \u2014 intermittent, sporadic, subject to frequent interruptions because of claimant's ailments\u2014 does not constitute substantial gainful activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">On many occasions the courts have determined that intermittent or sporadic activity does not constitute ability to engage in substantial gainful activity, precluding the establishment of disability of a Social Security claimant. In McGaha v. Ribicoff, 262 F.Supp. 161, 163 (D.C.Del.), the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acg\">\u201cOnly if one is able to perform substantial gainful services with reasonable regularity can he be deemed to be able to engage in substantial gainful activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">\u201cSlight work of an irregular spasmodic character, subject to frequent interruptions because of Plaintiff\u2019s ailment is not substantial gainful activity.\u201d Austin v. Celebrezze, 230 F.Supp. 256, 259 (D.C.Tex.). A work record specifically indicating that a claimant was unable to perform her duties or meet production because of ill health, is of great importance when considered with the remainder of the evidence of record. Smith v. Gardner, 251 F.Supp. 262, 268 (D.C. N.C.).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">In Paul v. Ribicoff, 206 F.Supp. 606, 612 (D.C.Col.), the court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afr\">\u201cBut intermittent or sporadic activities do not necessarily bar a claimant from establishing disability when he prefers not to remain idle during the period of his claimed disability. Rather, a claimant\u2019s ability to work must be regular and substantial, actual and practical, before he may be said to be able to engage in substantial gainful activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">In Lightcap v. Celebrezze, 214 F.Supp. 209, 213 (D.C.Pa.), the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-12\">\u201cThe plaintiff has given evidence of his inability to perform construction work even as a foreman. He has produced evidence of his inability to perform very light work even around the house. But even his statement reported to the Hearing Examiner that he felt he could do light work on some days, as a fact in itself, would not prevent his eligibility for disability insurance benefits. Intermittent, sporadic or infrequent activity does not constitute ability to engage in substantial, gainful activity precluding es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>tablishment of disability under this chapter of the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In McGaha v. Ribicoff, 262 F.Supp. 161, 163 (D.C.Del.), the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">\u201cIn explaining the concept of \u2018substantial g\u00e1inful activity\u2019 in hearings on H.R. 7225 (the Social Security Amendments of 1956), the defendant [Secretary] submitted a statement to the Senate Committee on Finance, 84th Cong., 2d Sess., which read (p. 43):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-7\">\u201c \u2018Substantial gainful activity means the performance of substantial services with reasonable regularity * * complete helplessness is not necessary to a finding of an allowable disability. Sporadic or infrequent activity would not necessarily establish ability to engage in substantial gainful activity.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">In Corn v. Flemming, 184 F.Supp. 490, 493 (D.C.Fla.), the court held that, as pointed out in Lease v. Fleming, D.C., 178 F.Supp. 169, the definition of disability under the Social Security Act \u201cis substantially the same as it was under the old War Risks Claims Act from which a substantial body of authoritative precedent has been established. In a case in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, decided under the latter Act, Ross v. United States, 5 Cir., 1931, 49 F.2d 541, 542, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-9\">\u201c '* * * To be able \u201cto follow any substantially gainful occupation,\u201d within the practical commonsense meaning of the phrase, <em>implies ability to work at it all the time. </em>* * * \u2019 (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">\u201cSimilarly, following the Ross decision, the Fifth Circuit held that even the ability to engage in \u2018 * * * employment for limited periods does not defeat recovery, if it is reasonably certain that disability beginning while the policy was in force would prevent the insured from <em>continuously following a substantially gainful occupation.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">The undisputed evidence was that claimant was able to perform only slight work of an intermittent, irregular, sporadic character, subject to frequent interruptions because of her ailments, and was unable to engage in substantial gainful activity; and that she was, therefore, disabled, under the Act, and entitled to disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-15\">These, then, are the reversible and prejudicial errors of the Hearing Examiner which call for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-16\">The prime error is the holding that the evidence of claimant\u2019s attending physician, Dr. Shea, was not supported by objective clinical findings and that, therefore, there was no evidence to support Dr. Shea\u2019s findings. This error was followed by the deliberate refusal of the Hearing Examiner to make any mention or give any consideration to the undisputed evidence of claimant\u2019s multifarious joint and musculoskeletal disorders that resulted in her many hospitalizations and disability; the repeated holdings that claimant\u2019s diabetes was controllable, in the face of the undisputed evidence of claimant\u2019s attending physician that for more than two years before the hearing her diabetes was out of control, even with insulin treatment, and that at the final date of the hearing, her diabetes was still uncontrollable; the finding, contrary to the evidence, that all of claimant\u2019s musculoskeletal disorders resulted from her diabetes, which was remediable, and that claimant was to blame for her condition because she refused to follow remediable treatment; that, without any evidence to support the finding, the Hearing Examiner concluded that claimant\u2019s deteriorated visual impairment resulted from her negligence in failing to remedy her diabetes; the holding that claimant\u2019s impaired vision was corrected by glasses, when it appears from the medical evidence that the only vision correctable by glasses was her visual acuity for near and far, and that her vision has been deteriorating for the prior four years, the chief impairment resulting from vertical deviation in the alignment of her eyes causing double vision, none of which was mentioned by the Hearing Examiner; the holding that all of the ailments upon which claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>alleged disability were remediable; that claimant had not any impairment or impairments in combination severe enough to constitute disability within the meaning of the Act, contrary to the undisputed evidence of her attending physician that due to the multiplicity of her ailments she could engage only in intermittent, sporadic activity for brief periods of time subject to frequent interruptions because of her ailments.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">As an instance of the failure of the Hearing Examiner to give consideration to the disabilities of claimant, we are faced with his conclusion that in spite of the deterioration or continually increasing impairment of her vision over a period of several years, and with the vertical deviation in the alignment of her eyes resulting in double vision, claimant could perform the duties of a cashier in a cafeteria or of a nurses\u2019 aide in a hospital \u2014 both positions requiring unusually good vision.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Moreover, claimant\u2019s disability resulted from pain and, in this regard, it has been declared that arthritis, as an instance, produces pain, and that pain is one of its expected symptoms is common knowledge. Richardson v. Ribicoff, 205 F.Supp. 802 (D.C.S.C.). \u201cWhere the medical evidence of record before the trier substantially indicates, as it does here, that the ascertainment of the existence of actual disability depends upon determining the truth and reliability of complaints of subjective pain or the medical significance of such complaints once credited, the trier of the fact \u2014 whether Examiner or Appeals Counsel \u2014 has a duty to pass on that issue.\u201d Page v. Celebrezze, 311 F.2d 757, 763 (C.A. 5). No one questions that claimant suffers pain. She testified her pain was so great that she could not continue with her work. There is no medical evidence that suggests that her pain is less than she testified to. On the contrary, the medical evidence shows that she suffered pain and that pain-killing drugs.were often prescribed to spare her suffering. The Hearing Examiner seems not to doubt that she told the truth about her pain, but, as the trier of the fact, he had a duty to pass on this issue which he not only failed to do, but never made any mention of \u201cthat merciless entity called \u2018pain\u2019 \u201d as Judge Hemphill so eloquently characterized, it in Drafts v. Celebrezze, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The Hearing Examiner\u2019s refusal to pass upon the issue of claimant\u2019s pain, caused by her musculoskeletal and joint disorders and resulting in her disability, all of which was supported by credible and uncontradicted evidence, was prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Here, the claimant relied principally on disability because of multiple mus-culoskeletal impairments. The evidence supported her claim. There was no evidence to dispute her. The only answer of the Hearing Examiner to the undisputed evidence was that the musculo-skeletal impairments resulted from claimant\u2019s own negligence in not remedying her diabetes! There was no evidence to support such a finding. It was prejudicial error for the Hearing Examiner to refuse to consider the undisputed evidence of claimant\u2019s musculoskeletal impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">Claimant showed by her attending physician that she was suffering from diabetes that was out of control and had been for at least two years, even with insulin. It was error for the Hearing Examiner to find, without evidence, that claimant was suffering only from \u201cmild diabetes\u201d which was \u201cintermittent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">It was prejudicial error for the Hearing Examiner to find that claimant\u2019s impairments of vision were due to her negligence in not following her attending physician\u2019s instructions to remedy her diabetes \u2014 when there was no evidence that plaintiff\u2019s attending physician had ever mentioned claimant's vision as resulting from her negligence in following directions to remedy her diabetes, and never even mentioned claimant\u2019s vision.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">As heretofore demonstrated, the Hearing Examiner had no basis for his findings that claimant\u2019s own attending physician reported that she could do moderate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>work on a sustained basis, when the actual evidence showed that claimant\u2019s attending physician stated that he believed she could be gainfully employed only <em>\u201cfor short periods of </em>time,\u201d and, therefore, of course, could not perform substantial gainful activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">In accordance with the foregoing, the judgment of the District Court should be reversed, and the case remanded with directions to the Secretary to grant the claimed disability benefits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-10\">.
