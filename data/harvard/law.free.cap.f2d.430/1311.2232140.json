He stated \u201cthe witnesses\u201d he sought were mainly \u201cthe parole officer who was responsible for the arrest of petitioner.\u201d The parole officer arrested the prisoner for violation of probation upon the complaint of one Savannah Hamilton that, contrary to his parole restrictions, appellant had threatened Hamilton over the phone, had admitted to her he had set the fire \u201cas an indication he was serious and she would be next.\u201d (See facts in State Court Opinion \u2014 People v. Watkins, 262 Cal.App.2d 687, 68 Cal.Rptr. 871).</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-9\">Appellant urges that because Savannah Hamilton did not see petitioner at the scene, while her daughter, Patricia Owens, saw petitioner coming out of the premises (a tool-shed), which were burned, that an \u201cinconsistency\u201d existed between the two witnesses\u2019 testimony. This fact is no basis for habeas corpus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-12\">Appellant refuses to recognize the significance of the eye-witness identification, which places him at the scene, running from the tool-shed where a fire had been intentionally started, after he had been convicted and imprisoned for offenses against Savannah Hamilton; had threatened her within hours after his release from prison on parole; and had threatened \u201cto get her next\u201d the morning <em>after </em>the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-13\">Because his attorney refused to call petitioner\u2019s parole officer to testify, appellant claimed he was denied compulsory process for the production of witnesses, and had received inadequate representation by counsel. These issues were discussed and determined adversely to appellant by the State\u2019s Court of Appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree, and we <em>affirm, </em>the denial of habeas corpus relief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1372-10\">. The State Court held that counsel, \u201cin representing a six-time loser merely took a realistic attitude in determining whether to call certain witnesses suggested by the defendant,\u201d was acting in a competent and professional manner.
