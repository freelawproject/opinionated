SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">This appeal presents the recurring question which has plagued public regulation of industry: whether the regulatory agency is unduly oriented toward the interests of the industry it is designed to regulate, rather than the public interest it is designed to protect. Petitioners, some 32 congressmen, alleged that the Civil Aeronautics Board, in considering the lawfulness of increases in domestic passenger fares filed by all the major air lines, excluded the public from <em>ex parte </em>meetings with representatives of the air line industry and then held a <em>pro forma </em>hearing limited to oral argument, as a result of which changes in the fare structure resulting in a six per cent rise in domestic fares were unlawfully approved. The Board admits the <em>ex parte </em>meetings, denies that the hearing was <em>pro forma, </em>and admits that, without complying with the statutory procedural requirements and criteria for rate-making by the Board, it approved in advance the filing without suspension of air line tariffs providing for a six per cent increase in air line revenues from passenger fares.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold that the procedure used by the Board is contrary to the statutory rate-making plan in that it fences the public out of the rate-making process and tends to frustrate judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-23\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b953-24\">The statutory plan is relatively simple. Air line passenger rates can be made by the carrier or by the Board.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However made, the rates must be included in a tariff filed with the Board by the carrier.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is unlawful for the carrier to charge a rate other than the existing one on file.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On complaint or on its own initiative, the Board may change an existing rate after public notice and hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Board need not indicate a specific rate; it may simply fix a maximum or minimum or both.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In determining and prescribing a rate the Board must take into consideration, among other factors, five statutory criteria.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-25\">An air line carrier may change the existing rate by filing a new tariff with the Board indicating the new rate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under the statute, on complaint or on its own initiative the Board, by giving the carrier a statement of its reasons, may suspend the new rate for a period not to exceed 180 days while conducting an investigation as to its lawfulness.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>After investigation and hearing, the Board may determine and prescribe the lawful rate, in accordance, of course, with the rate-making provisions of Sections 1002(d) and 1002(e) of the Federal Aviation Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">Petitioners had complained to the Board on prior occasions both about the Board\u2019s practice of holding <em>ex parte,</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>informal meetings with the carriers concerning their need for increased fares, and about the Board\u2019s lack of standards for testing the reasonableness of fares. In spite of these complaints, the informal sessions between carriers and Board members continued into the summer of 1969. In early August of 1969, following the lead of United Air Lines, the carriers filed increased passenger tariffs with the Board. While these proposed rate increases were pending before the Board, another <em>ex parte </em>meeting between the air line officials and members of the Board was scheduled for August 14, 1969. Petitioner Moss requested and was refused permission to attend this meeting.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Following the <em>ex parte </em>meeting on August 14, the Board issued an order calling for oral argument on the advisability of exercising its power to investigate and suspend the new rates before they went into effect. There was no suggestion in the order that the Board might promulgate its own fare formula.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Petitioners renewed their complaints about the Board\u2019s continued <em>ex parte </em>meeting and rate practices and urged the Board to suspend the tariffs, to institute a general passenger fare investigation to define more clearly the statutory rate-making standards, and finally to set reasonable rates based on these more precise standards. Petitioners, however, refused to participate in the oral argument on the ground that the Board\u2019s decision on the rate increases had already been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">On September 12, 1969, eight days after the oral argument, the Board issued its order.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In that order the Board found that the proposed tariffs on file \u201cmay be unjust [or] unreasonable\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and ordered the tariffs suspended and investigated, as it is authorized to do by Section 1002(g) of the Federal Aviation Act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Still purporting to act in accordance with its suspension authority, however, the Board went further. It found that the carriers had demonstrated a need for \u201csome additional revenue\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> because of greatly increased costs, and decided that a limited fare increase was necessary in order to maintain the financial vitality of the carriers as a group.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Accordingly, in the same order which suspended the rates proposed by the carriers, the Board outlined its own fare formula and announced its decision to \u201cpermit tariff filings im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>plementing\u201d that formula to be filed without suspension,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> thus assuring almost immediate effectiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">The carriers promptly withdrew their previous filings and filed for new increases based on the Board\u2019s model. Petitioners, in an application for reconsideration of the September 12 order, opposed the new filings and requested their suspension and investigation. On September 30, 1969, the application was denied and the fares based upon the Board formula were allowed to stand without suspension or investigation.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The instant petition for review of both the September 12 and the September 30 orders followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">The question presented by this appeal is whether the Board should have followed the procedures and standards established by Sections 1002(d) and 1002 (e) of the Act before proposing the rate schedule it set forth in its September 12 order. Petitioners complain that the Board effectively \u201cdetermined\u201d rates, within the meaning of Sections 1002(d) and 1002(e), to be charged by the air carriers without proper notice and hearings as required by Section 1002(d) and without taking into account the rate-making factors enumerated in Section 1002(e).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Board admits that it would have been required to act in accordance with subsections (d) and (e) if its actions amounted to the making of rates. The Board, however, contends that it was not required to adhere to the standards of subsections (d) and (e) because, as the formal title of its September 12 order (\u201cOrder of Investigation and Suspension\u201d) indicates, it was not determining rates but only exercising its power under Section 1002(g) to suspend, pending a more complete investigation, the rates initially filed by the carriers in August.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-18\">The Board also admits that immediately after its September 12 order the air lines withdrew their August tariffs and filed new tariffs listing rates based directly on and in conformity with that order. But the Board disclaims any legal responsibility for the rates listed in the carriers\u2019 September tariffs. According to the Board, the detailed outline of the rate structure which it \u201cproposed to accept\u201d in its September 12 order was not an attempt to prescribe or determine rates for the future within the meaning of the statute, but merely served to explain to the carriers \u2014 as required by the statute <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u2014 the Board\u2019s reasons for suspending the August filings. The Board points out that the carriers were not legally bound by the September 12 order of the Board to file a new tariff and list rates based on its formula. Therefore, the Board argues, even though the carriers did precisely what the Board indicated in its September 12 order should be done, the resulting rates are carrier-made rates for which the Board is not to be held accountable.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-19\"> This legalistic reading of the statute is supposedly supported by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Arizona Grocery Co. v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and its progeny. We find no support in <em>Arizona Grocery </em>for the Board\u2019s position. For that case referred to agency-made rates as those which had been legislatively prescribed as \u201ca maximum reasonable rate for the future\u201d by the agency.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We think that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>these rates, like those involved in <em>Arizona, Grocery, </em>have been determined by the Board, with the cooperation of the carriers, to be \u201ca maximum reasonable rate for the future.\u201d The Board itself stated that it \u201cintend[ed] to consider fares produced by [its] formula as a \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 ceiling.\u201d Any analysis of the September 12 order can fairly lead to no other conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">After finding that the rates proposed by the carriers might be unjust or unreasonable and ordering an investigation, the Board went on in the September 12 order to point out that, because of the need for revenue which the carriers had shown, the Board would \u201cbe disposed to grant an increase computed in accordance with the criteria set out below.\u201d It then set forth a rate-making formula, variously described in the order as \u201cthe formula which we are proposing,\u201d the formula \u201cwe propose to accept,\u201d and the formula which \u201c[w]e * * * adopt * * * for our model.\u201d The formula detailed by the Board, which is set out in the margin,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> using coach fares as its base, attempts to cope with the increased per mile costs of short flights by establishing a fixed \u201cterminal\u201d charge ($9.00) for all markets, with an additional charge based on the airport-to-airport mileage. According to the formula, the per mile rate decreases in each successive 500-mile block. From this formula anyone could have filled in the figures and computed the acceptable coach fares.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">The Board also \u201cconcluded\u201d that it would be appropriate for all fares to be rounded off to the nearest whole dollar. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>It further \u201cpropose [d] that first class jet fares be set at 125 percent of the coach fare derived by the above formula.\u201d It \u201cwould accept night coach fares computed at 75 percent of the new coach fares.\u201d The order then listed each of the various promotional fares, such as Youth Fare and Discover America, and the discounts which \u201cthe Board would permit.\u201d <footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">The Board even claimed to be acting in accordance with some of the rate-making provisions of Section 1002(e). It explained that it had granted the increases because, \u201c[t]aking into consideration these cost pressures on the carriers, and the marked decline in earnings and profit margin since the February increase, the Board finds that a further increase in fares at this time is necessary from the standpoint of the rate-making standards of Section 1002 (e) of the Act and the need to maintain the financial vitality of the carriers as a group.\u201d Also, according to the Board, its formula \u201cproduces a reasonable increase in revenues and recognizes the economies inherent in long haul carriage * * * as well as the value of service limitations in short haul markets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">As a practical matter, the Board\u2019s order amounted to the prescription of rates because, as the Board admits, the pressures on the carriers to file rates conforming exactly with the Board\u2019s formula were great, if not actually irresistible.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> All the carriers had indicated an urgent need for an immediate increase in revenues; the Board had made it clear, by threatening to use its power to suspend proposed rates, that only rates conforming to its detailed model would be accepted and not suspended. It explicitly stated that it would \u201cconsider fares produced by the formula as a \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 ceiling, and any fare in excess of this ceiling would be viewed <em>Tarima facie </em>as outside the realm of justness and reasonableness and would ordinarily be suspended and ordered investigated.\u201d Any carrier wanting to file higher tariffs would be dissuaded, not only by the indications in the order that only those tariffs meeting the standards set down by the Board would be accepted, but also by the Board\u2019s explicit statement that increases would be considered only \u201cwhere strong justification was shown.\u201d Furthermore, while tariffs in conformity with the Board\u2019s model would go into effect and give the carriers some additional revenue almost immediately, the Board required all filings requesting increases above those provided in the September 12 order to have a proposed effective date 75 days after filing. It would seem that upon any realistic interpretation this order involved the legislative determination of rates by an agency for the future, as described in the <em>Arizona Grocery </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">It would be blinking reality to hold, as the Board argues, that the order of September 12 did no more than suspend and initiate an investigation<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> of the rates proposed by the carriers in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>August. The Board did all that it could, short of formally styling' its order as rate-making, to induce the carriers to adopt the proposed rates. The Board does not dispute these facts, but, in order to insulate itself from responsibility for these rates, relies upon the fact that it never in so many words \u201cordered\u201d the carriers to file the rates now being charged. According to the Board, as long as the Board only \u201csuggests\u201d and does not order the future rates, the rates remain carrier-made. In support of this proposition the Board cites a series of cases which followed <em>Arizona Grocery, </em>each of which holds that certain action does not amount to agency approval of the rates in question.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> It has been held, for example, that the agency\u2019s refusal to suspend proposed rates does not constitute agency approval of those rates. To the extent that the I.C.C. precedents are relevant to this case<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> we would agree with the Board that it takes more than a refusal to suspend proffered rates to transform them into agency-made rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">We do not need to decide, however, in the context of this case the exact extent of agency participation which will make an agency responsible for the rates being charged by carriers. For the eases which the Board cites simply are not apposite.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We are not dealing with rates filed by carriers which the Board has refused to suspend, or even with allowance of small percentage increases in revenue based on existing rates,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>with a complete and innovative scheme for setting all passenger rates for the continental United States.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The Board has pointed to no case in which the Board or Commission has set out such a com-p\u00edete and detailed scheme for making rates which it wanted filed and in which a court has held that the resulting rates were carrier-made rates. Even a cursory reading of the order makes it clear that the Board told the carriers what rates to file; it set forth a step-by-step formula requiring major changes in rate-making practices and in rates which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>it expected the carriers to adopt. And the Board concededly took this action after closed sessions with carrier representatives, without statutory public hearings and, according to petitioners, without reference to the rate-making standards of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">If, as the Board argues, the rates resulting from this procedure are carrier-made, rather than agency-made, the public would not only be fenced out of its role in rate-making, but judicial review of the Board\u2019s actions would be severely limited. On appeal agency-made rates are tested against the Act\u2019s explicit rate-making procedures. Thus a court must decide whether, in determining rates, the Board has properly observed the statutory procedures and taken into account the factors which Congress has said should be considered when rates are made. If the statutory plan has been complied with, the court can then determine whether substantial evidence in the record supports the Board\u2019s rates. Here the Board has in effect determined rates and the record made in so doing is inadequate for judicial review. By contrast, if the tariffs filed pursuant to the Board\u2019s order of September 12 are not Board-determined rates, judicial review is practically nonexistent. Aggrieved parties can object to carrier-made rates and ask the Board to investigate them, but the Board\u2019s refusal to investigate would be reviewable only for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> And, of course, it would be very difficult indeed to apply this limited standard of review to a record made in large part behind closed doors.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">Moreover, the Board\u2019s suspension authority, on which it relies for justification of its actions in this case, is totally insulated from judicial review.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> It is this power which the Board uses to work its will in rate-making rather than the judicially reviewable statutory rate-making plan designed by Congress to protect the public. In the absence of a compelling justification for the Board\u2019s admitted practice of making rates by use of it's\u2019 suspension power, we cannot help but conclude that the Board is only seeking to avoid the strict requirements of the rate-making portion of the statute and the resulting more stringent judicial review. No requirement of Board operation or policy of the Act seems to support the Board\u2019s blatant attempt to subvert the statute\u2019s scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-9\">The Board has argued that to hold it accountable for these rates would \u201chobble the administrative process,\u201d seemingly because it feels that the procedures required by Sections 1002(d) and 1002(e) of the Act do not permit the Board to respond quickly enough to met the immediate revenue needs of the carriers in times of rapidly rising costs.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> While we recognize that under the statute the Board has an obligation to afford the carriers sufficient revenues,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> that obligation cannot become a <em>carte blanche </em>allowing the Board to deal only with the carriers and disregard the other factors, such as the traveling public\u2019s interest in the lowest possible fares and high standards of service, which are also enumerated in the Act as rate-making criteria.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>Furthermore, we see no inconsistency between adhering to the statutory plan and awarding a speedy increase in carrier revenues. The statute does not require a complete, time-consuming, scholarly and theoretical review of <em>all </em>aspects of rate-making before the Board passes upon proposals which are submitted,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The Board is expected to use its experience gleaned from ongoing studies and investigations in its day-today activities, and it can act with reasonable speed as long as it affords public notice, holds a proper hearing, and takes the statutory factors into account when it determines rates. In any case, ignoring the general public\u2019s interests in order to better serve the carriers is not the proper response to the difficulties supposedly created by an outdated or unwieldy statutory procedure. After all, there is more to rate-making than providing carriers with sufficient revenue to meet their obligations to their creditors and to their stockholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-12\">In short, we simply do not agree with the Board that abdication from its proper supervisory role under the statute need be the result of today\u2019s holding requiring the Board to comply with the statute in rate-making. We would be sympathetic, for example, to instances in which the Board felt that compelling circumstances required it to act without complete information before an investigation is completed. Any approval of rates under such conditions would be subject to revision once more complete information is obtained. We would liken such emergency Board action to the interim approval which Judge Tamm recently remarked upon, in a somewhat different context. Speaking for the court, he said:<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>\u25a0 \u00ab * -\u00bb * [Our] assessment of the Board\u2019s findings should be bifurcated, with different standards applied to the findings relating to full and interim approval. That is, the fact that interim approval is useful primarily in situations in which the Board needs to act expeditiously * * * but lacks sufficient information to determine authoritatively whether the agreement as a whole will serve the public interest, indicates that our review of the findings supporting the interim approval should be relatively limited. Since the Board in electing to order an interim approval is essentially saying that * * * further data gleaned from practical experience is necessary to an enlightened determination of the public interest, a reviewing court can do little more than ask whether this conclusion is reasonable and based upon substantial evidence. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">We fully recognize that a carrier's exigent economic circumstances at times will make it necessary for the Board to act on the basis of incomplete data. But we emphatically reject any intimation by the Board that its responsibilities to the carriers are more important than its responsibilities to the public. Board action must always comply with the procedural requirements of the statute and must always be based on an assessment of the relevant available data, with due consideration given to all the factors enumerated in the statute, which factors taken together make up the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">It is true that the practice followed in this case does not fit neatly and precisely into the statutory concept of rate-making by the Board or by the carriers. Actually the practice produces rates arrived at through the cooperation of the carriers and the Board. The Board candidly admits that it devised the practice because the volatile economic conditions in the air line industry made use of the Section 1002(d) and (e) procedures impractical. But Congress requires public participation in making rates because it is the public who pays them. And under this Act, as distinguished from the Interstate Commerce and Motor Carriers Acts, there is no statutory provision for reparations to the public if the rates charged are unreasonable.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Hence observance of safeguards designed to protect the public <em>before </em>the rates are imposed is imperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">Since the record shows, as the Board admits, that the public notice and hearing requirements of Section 1002(d) were not observed in issuing the order of September 12, that order is invalid and the tariffs filed by the carriers based thereon are unlawful. Under the circumstances, this case is remanded to the Board for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b953-6\">.

We will permit exceptions to the rule over a particular routing where good cause is shown. Further, it is not our intent to discourage common faring of cities or of airports situated about a single city; we would expect to permit common faring under the proposed formula in much the same manner as we have heretofore, provided the mileage used bears a rational relationship to the points so common rated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-20\">Order, at 6-7.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b957-10\">. \u201cWith respect to the various promotional fares, the Board would permit the following reduced discounts based on the coach fares derived from the above described formula:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-11\">\u201cType of Fare Percent Discount 8</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-12\">Discover America 20%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-13\">Youth Standby 40</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-14\">Youth Reservation 20</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-15\">Family plan:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-16\">Children 2-11 50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-17\">Children 12-21 33%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-18\">\u201c8.

Mechling, 330 U.S. 567, 67 S.Ct. 894, 91 L.Ed. 1102 (1947) ; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Inland Waterways Corp., 319 U.S. 671, 63 S.Ct. 1296, 87 L.Ed. 1655 (1943) ; Algoma Coal &amp; Coke Co. v.

While the rate-making provisions of the Federal Aviation Act and the Interstate Commerce Act are similar, the practice under them is not necessarily the same because, unlike the Interstate Commerce Act, the Federal Aviation Act has no provision for reparations. <em>Cf. </em>T.I.M.E. Inc. v. United States, 359 U.S. 464, 79 S.Ct. 904, 3 L.Ed.2d 952 (1959) ; Tishman &amp; Lipp, Inc. v. Delta Air Lines, 2 Cir., 413 F.2d 1401, 1406 n. 8 (1969). Consequently, all of the cases interpreting the rate-making provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act are not necessarily relevant in determining whether the Board complied with the Federal Aviation Act in making rates. It was the reparation concern of the courts following <em>Arizona Grocery </em>which led them to distinguish that case by holding that a Commission order permitting a general increase in rates did not preclude a reconsideration of a particular commodity rate fixed by the carrier pursuant to the general order, so that if a particular commodity rate was found to be unreasonable reparations, as provided by the statute, could be ordered. In the absence of such a retrospective remedy for reparations for air line passengers, the procedural safeguards provided in the Federal Aviation Act become the public\u2019s sole defense against unreasonable rates permitted by the Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b958-10\">. The Board relies heavily on Interstate Commerce Commission v. Inland Waterways Corp., <em>supra </em>Note 29, in its argument. There the Commission found, in an order vacating an order suspending rates proposed by some carriers, that \u201cthe proposed schedules are shown to be just and reasonable.\u201d This, according to the Commission, did not amount to prescription of rates because it had explicitly stated that Arizona <em>Grocery </em>would not apply. The Supreme Court also \u201crefrain [ed] from approving or prescribing [the rates].\u201d 319 U.S. at 687, 63 S.Ct. 1296. We feel that the Board\u2019s reliance upon this case is misplaced. The Supreme Court construed the Commission\u2019s statements only as a refusal to suspend proposed rates on the grounds offered by the complainants. According to the Court, the true thrust of the Commission\u2019s action was that \u201cthe proposed schedules could not be struck down upon the erroneous view advanced by the protestante.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 686, 63 S.Ct. at 1305. Furthermore, the rates in question were filed by the carriers of their own volition, and were not rates outlined by the agency. <em>See also </em>Note 30, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b958-12\">. <em>See </em>Emergency Freight Charges, 1935, 208 ICC 4 (1935). Two court cases cited by the Board grew out of these Commission proceedings. They were Birmingham Slag Co. v. United States, N.D.Ala., 11 F. Supp. 486 (1935), and Algoma Coal &amp; Coke Co. v. United States, <em>supra </em>Note 29. The Board, in arguing these cases, omits one very crucial fact. In these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>cases, involving a general rate order of the Commission which permitted an overall maximum percentage rate increase, the question presented to the court was whether individual shippers could challenge, in court, the validity of individual rates filed by carriers pursuant to the general rate order before asking the Commission to determine the reasonableness of the individual rates pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 15 of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 15 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">The cited cases do not involve an attempt to avoid judicial review of agency aetion or the fixing of rates without complying with the procedural requirements of the statute. In recent eases of the same genre as <em>Birmingham </em>and <em>Algoma, </em>such as Alabama Power Co. v. United States, <em>infra, </em>the Commission has explicitly stated that judicial review of its general rate order is available. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 15(a) (1964). The Commission admits that its finding in these proceedings, to the effect that a \u201cgeneral rate increase is warranted,\u201d <em>see </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 15a (1964), must be supported by substantial evidence, and that a claim to the contrary \u201cstates a claim warranting direct judicial review.\u201d Memorandum for the United States, the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Secretary of Agriculture, Alabama Power Co. v. United States, <em>probable jurisdiction noted,, </em>398 U.S. 903, 90 S.Ct. 1687, 26 L.Ed.2d 60 (1970). <em>See also </em>Alabama Power Co. v. United States, D.D.C., Civil Action No. 2970-68, December 4, 1969 (Wright, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">In the 1935 rate proceedings discussed above, before allowing certain percentage increases in rates \u201c[a]s a temporary measure, for the immediate alleviation of the more acute financial distress of the railroads,\u201d Emergency Freight Charges, 1935, <em>supra, </em>208 ICC at 48, the Commission conducted nearly three months of public hearings at sites scattered throughout the country so the general public could easily attend and offer comments, <em>see id. </em>at 9, and invited written comments and briefs from all interested parties. In like manner the Commission held extensive hearings, before four examiners concurrently, from September 9 to October 8, 1968, in the proceedings which were challenged in the <em>Alabama Power </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">Thus the Commission, unlike the Board, seems to recognize its responsibility to follow the procedural requirements of the statute and to allow its action permitting the general rate increase to be tested against the statute. The Commission only asks that court review of particularized, individual rates be withheld under these circumstances until the Commission itself has had an opportunity to judge the reasonableness of the particular rate in question and award reparations if warranted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b959-10\">. In addition to the cases cited above, the Board also relies on Public Utilities Commission of California v. United States, 9 Cir., 356 F.2d 236, cert. denied, 385 U.S. 816, 87 S.Ct. 35, 17 L.Ed.2d 54 (1966). That case involved a \u201cPublic Notice\u201d issued by the Federal Communications Commission, after a series of informal meetings between the Commission and the Bell System. In that notice the Commission informed the public that Bell was planning to file lowered tariffs for long distance telephone service. Petitioners asked the Commission to reconsider this public notice, contending that by issuing an announcement about future rate filings the Commission had made rates within the meaning of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 205 (1964). Reconsideration was denied by the Commission because its action \u201cwas [not] a ruling on the proposed tariff filing,\u201d and the Commission's action was affirmed on appeal to the Ninth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">While we have no occasion to pass upon the wisdom of that decision, which involves a somewhat different statute and a different industry, we note that the case is distinguishable from the one at bar. There is no indication in the court\u2019s opinion that the Commission determined the new rates by use of its suspension power, <em>see </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 204 (1964), as was done in this case. Nor is there any indication that the Commission advised the Bell System about the rate filings which would be acceptable to the Commission and which would, in the Commission\u2019s opinion, constitute a \u201c \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 ceiling,\u201d as the Board advised the carriers in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b960-5\">.
