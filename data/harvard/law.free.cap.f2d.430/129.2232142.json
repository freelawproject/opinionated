On appeal they contend: (1) The district court erred in failing to suppress the liquor which they allege to have been seized following an unconstitutional search. (2) The court erred in admitting a conversation between the agents and appellants after appellants were effectively in custody but before they had been advised of their rights. (3) Requesting the appellants to produce a customs receipt violated their privilege against self-incrimination. We affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-29\">In May of 1968 a United States customs agent received a report that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>vessel \u201cBlack Cloud\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had been observed in Bimini taking on a cargo of liquor. Subsequently, the vessel was observed by several customs agents in or about the Coral Ridge Marina in Pampano Beach, Florida. On at least two occasions a truck was seen leaving the moored vessel. On 31 July 1968, customs \u00e1gents received a report that the \u201cBlack Cloud\u201d had left the marina prior to 9:30 that morning. About 3:15 a. m. on 1 August 1968, some eighteen hours later, a group of agents saw the vessel re-enter the Intracoastal Waterway through the Hillsboro Inlet. It tied up at a seawall away from its usual moorings at the edge of the marina. A white Chevrolet panel truck backed up to the vessel and the agents observed boxes being unloaded from the boat and loaded into the truck. When the truck was loaded the \u201cBlack Cloud\u201d returned to its normal docking place and the truck departed.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">A group of customs agents in four vehicles followed the white panel truck as it left the marina and turned south on North Federal Highway (U.S. 1). About two miles from the marina the agents caused it to stop by using a siren. Approaching the truck from the front, some of the agents could see into the cargo area of the van where numerous boxes were stacked.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The agents placed appellants, the only occupants of the vehicle,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> under arrest for smuggling. A thorough examination of the contents of the van revealed some 81 cases of various liquors, none of which bore the appropriate tax stamps.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">Appellants moved the district court to suppress as evidence the seized liquor, on the ground that it was the fruit of an unconstitutional search. The search in question was conducted without a warrant and without the consent of appellant Hill, the owner of the truck. Following a hearing, the district court concluded that there was not sufficient probable cause for the search, but that it was nonetheless a valid \u201cborder search\u201d. It consequently denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">Under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 482, customs agents are authorized to search any vehicle or person they reasonably suspect to be carrying merchandise illegally introduced into the United States.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These \u201cborder searches\u201d, though subject to the constitutional standard of reasonableness, have been uniformly upheld by the courts absent the normal requirements of a search warrant or the existence of probable cause.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The reasonable sus-</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>picion of a customs agent is sufficient to authorize a \u201cborder search\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">In the present case appellants contend that the search of the truck cannot qualify as a \u201cborder search\u201d inasmuch as there is no evidence that the \u201cBlack Cloud\u201d crossed an international boundary on the dates in question. They point out that the agents first viewed the vessel as it entered the Intracoastal Waterway, and that no one had actually seen it cross the international boundary lying three miles out at sea. Appellants argue that a showing of a border crossing is an indispensable, primary element of a \u201cborder search\u201d. We cannot agree. The extraordinary deference accorded this unique category of searches is based on a recognition of the difficulty in volved in effectively policing our national boundaries.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The facts of the present case dramatically illustrate the burden we would be placing on the officers charged with this responsibility, were we to accept appellant\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">In United States v. Glaziou,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Second Circuit upheld the search of two French seamen as they were leaving the pier where their vessel was docked. In considering the seamen\u2019s argument that they were not subject to a \u201cborder search\u201d since the customs officers had no grounds to believe that they were entering, or had recently entered, this country, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-11\">The class of persons who may be subjected to a border search is not limited to those suspected persons who are searched for contraband upon first entering the United States. Also included in the class are persons who work in a border area when leaving the area; <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> persons engaged in suspicious activity near border areas;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and, in some situations, persons and vehicles after they have cleared an initial customs checkpoint and have entered the United States.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, we hold that when ah individual has direct contact with a border area,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or an individual\u2019s movements are reasonably related to the border area,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that individual is a member of the class of persons that a customs officer may, if his suspicions are aroused, stop and search while the individual is still within the border area.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">We believe that <em>Glaziou </em>states the proper rule. The facts of the present case demonstrate that appellants were within the class of individuals subject to a \u201cborder search\u201d, that the customs agents had a reasonable suspicion that they were in possession of unlawfully imported merchandise, and that the search was conducted within a border area. Consequently, the district court properly de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>nied the motion to suppress the use of the seized liquor as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Immediately after the customs agents stopped the truck but before they had administered <em>Miranda, </em>rites to the appellants, one of the agents asked appellant Hill what he had in the truck. Hill replied, \u201cYou know what it is. It\u2019s liquor.\u201d Appellants were also asked if they had a customs receipt, to which there was no reply. Appellants contend that the court erred in finding that these exchanges were not the sort of custodial interrogation envisioned by Miranda v. Arizona,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and admitting them into evidence. However, even if the court committed error in this regard, it was, beyond a reasonable doubt, harmless error.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> These statements could have some bearing on the case in two ways: as providing a basis for suspicion which would authorize a \u201cborder search\u201d, or as they might relate to the issue of guilt. The district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">I think, however, that even if these statements are not properly admitted, that there is sufficient evidence before the Court under which the Government agents would be justified in having a suspicion that merchandise in violation of Customs laws was in the truck.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">We agree that the statements were not necessary to the validity of the search. Accepting the validity of the search, and remembering that this was a non-jury trial, it may not be seriously maintained that the statements affected the district court\u2019s finding of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-15\">Finally, appellants contend that the inquiry regarding the customs receipt, or the requirement that they obtain a customs receipt, in some way violated their privilege against self-incrimination. This argument is plainly merit-less. We are unable to perceive the analogy to Marchetti v. United States,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Grosso v. United States,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and Haynes v. United States,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> suggested by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-16\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-5\">.
