We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1411-26\">By his first motion Tarlton sought to obtain access to his prison file to learn the source of a derogatory statement which was allegedly made concerning him. As the District Court held, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>prison records of inmates are confidential and are not subject to inspection by the public nor the inmate concerned. Cook v. Willingham, 10 Cir. 1968, 400 F.2d 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-4\">Tarlton\u2019s second motion was for a medical examination by a physician from outside the prison. This motion, however, was based on Rule 35, F.R. Civ.P. which authorizes a party to an action to require another party to submit to a physical or mental examination, and as such, is clearly inapposite because no related civil action was pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-5\">Finding no error in the denial of the motions we Affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1411-27\">. Pursuant to our Rule 18 this case is decided without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
