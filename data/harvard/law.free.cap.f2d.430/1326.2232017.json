The issue was whether the Lawtonian Club was a \u201csocial\u201d club within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241 and the related regulations as they then provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-12\">We have examined the record and find it to clearly support the judgment of the trial court. The court prepared an opinion which thoroughly covers the issues, and with which we agree. See Lawtonian Club, Inc. v. United States, 307 F.Supp. 1081 (U.S.D.C., W.D.Okl.). We can add nothing to what the trial court has said and has held.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
