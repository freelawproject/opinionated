BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b492-14\">When Claudine Hall came home on the night of September 24, 1969, and found that her General Electric portable television set had been taken out of her apartment by Sylvia Garson, it is not likely that she realized that basic issues of Federal Court jurisdiction and the jurisdiction of that unfortunate step child of Federal procedure, the three-Judge Court, would be raised by her dispute with her landlady. But such has been the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-15\">Sylvia seized Claudine\u2019s television under the authority of Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat. Ann. Art. 5238a,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which gives the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>landlord a lien on the personal goods of the tenants that are in the rented premises and in addition gives the landlord authority to enforce that lien by the peremptory seizure of the property. The lien is given to the extent of past-due rents and the property may be seized without any prior judicial procedure to determine the validity of the claim for the past-due debts or the accuracy of the amount claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The constitutionality of this statutory authority is here challenged by Claudine as individual plaintiff for herself and as a representative of the class of tenants affected by Art. 5238a. See F.R.Civ.P. 23(a). Injunctive relief is sought against defendants, Sylvia Garson, Max M. Kaplan, the owner of the apartments Sylvia managed, and all other persons similarly situated. This constitutional challenge was brought in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Texas. It is urged that the Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and it is urged that a claim for which relief can be granted is stated under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because of the request for injunctive relief in the constitutional attack upon a state statute, a three-judge Court was requested pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2281.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-21\">After a hearing, the District Court refused to notify the Chief Judge of the Circuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2284 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>of the request for a three-Judge Court. The District Court also - dismissed the underlying claim on the grounds that there was no jurisdiction under 28 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1343 nor a claim for which relief could be granted under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 since there were adequate state judicial remedies available.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Plaintiffs sought relief in this Court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We reverse the District Court. That Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343 and a claim for which relief can be granted has been stated under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983. But, although there is a substantial question presented, the District Court was correct in refusing to notify the Chief Judge of the request for a three-Judge Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-16\">I. Jurisdiction of the District Court</p>\n<p id=\"b494-17\">A. Exhaustion of State Remedies</p>\n<p id=\"AiqW\">Whether this is a one-Judge case or a three-Judge case cannot be determined until it is decided whether it is a Federal case. The District Court's articulated justification for its holding that it lacks jurisdiction was the failure of the tenants either to exhaust their state remedies, whatever they may be, or to show that these remedies were inade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>quate. Support for this jurisdictional requirement was found in the recent opinion in Schwartz v. Galveston Independent School District, S.D.Tex.1970, 309 F. Supp. 1034,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> by another Judge of the District. Court for the Southern District of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">In <em>Schwartz </em>the Court held that in order for there to be jurisdiction in a Federal District Court under the 28 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1343 or a cause of action stated under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 it was necessary for the plaintiff to show that remedies available under state administrative and judicial procedures either had been exhausted or were inadequate to provide relief. The conclusion reached in <em>Schwartz </em>that Federal Courts lack jurisdiction to adjudicate claims of deprivation of Federal rights is based upon a rereading of the legislative history of 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">But the reading of that legislative history by a Federal District Court or even by a Court of Appeals has largely been estopped by one hundred years of litigation under \u00a7 1983. During this one hundred years of experience the cry that it was necessary for state judicial remedies to be exhausted or shown to be inadequate before Federal Court action to restrain state conduct could be taken has been heard repeatedly. It has, however, consistently fallen on unresponsive ears and been muffled by the Supreme Court. See C. Wright, Federal Courts, \u00a7 49 (2d ed. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The cry was made by local government when local regulations of business were under constitutional attack. But the response to these cries was limited. In Bacon v. Rutland R. R. Co., 1914, 232 U.S. 134, 34 S.Ct. 283, 58 L.Ed. 538, an equity bill to restrain the state public service commission from requiring the railroad to locate a passenger station in a particular place, Mr. Justice Holmes said that the state remedy available to the railroad to make its challenge was judicial and \u201cthis being so * * * the railroad company was free to assert its rights in the district court of the United S.tates.\u201d 232 U.S. at 138, 34 S. Ct. at 284, 58 L.Ed. at 539. Mr. Chief Justice Taft took the same position in Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Co. v. Kuykendall, 1924, 265 U.S. 196, 44 S.Ct. 553, 68 L.Ed. 975. The only positive response came in the guise of the abstention doctrine (see IB, infra) where controlling questions of state law, which were unresolved by state courts, were presented. See e. g., Gilchrist v. Interborough Rapid Transit Co., 1924, 279 U.S. 159, 49 S.Ct. 282, 73 L.Ed. 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">The same cry was also heard when the actions of local government were under attack because they allegedly deprived persons of personal civil rights. And it was again muffled. In Lane v. Wilson, 1939, 307 U.S. 268, 59 S.Ct. 872, 83 L.Ed. 1281, a suit challenging an Oklahoma restriction on voting, Mr. Justice Frankfurter said that to \u201cvindicate his present grievance the plaintiff did not have to pursue whatever remedy may have been open to him in the state courts. * * * Barring only exceptional circumstances * * * or explicit statutory, requirements * * * resort to a federal court may be had without first exhausting the judicial remedies of the state.\u201d 307 U.S. at 274, 59 S.Ct. at 875, 83 L.Ed. at 1287 (Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">The same cry was again heard after Mr. Justice Douglas set out the purposes <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 in Monroe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>v. Pape, 1961, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492. It was argued that <em>Monroe </em>held that the only purpose of \u00a7 1983 was to provide relief where state remedies were inadequate or only available in theory, not in practice. But the Supreme Court soon quieted this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">In McNeese v. Board of Ed., 1963, 373 U.S. 668, 671, 83 S.Ct. 1433, 1435, 10 L.Ed.2d 622, 624-625 the Court pointed out that in Monroe, <em>supra, </em>365 U.S. at 183, 81 S.Ct. at 482, 5 L.Ed.2d at 503 it had said that the \u201cfederal remedy is supplementary to the state remedy, and the latter need not be sought and refused before the federal one is invoked.\u201d This has routinely been repeated by that Court, Damico v. California, 1967, 389 U.S. 416, 88 S.Ct. 526, 19 L.Ed. 2d 647; Houghton v. Shafer, 1968, 392 U.S. 639, 88 S.Ct. 2119, 20 L.Ed.2d 1319; and we do not believe that the pronouncements <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> made by the Court in those cases were meant to be limited to any particular type of \u00a7 1983<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> case. See Note, Exhaustion of State Remedies under the Civil Rights Act, 68 Colum. L.Rev. 1201 (1968). We believe they were to have general application.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In a like manner, this Court routinely, rejects the cry that it is necessary to exhaust state remedies. See Orr v. Thorpe, 5 Cir., 1970, 427 F.2d 1129. And we here again reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">B. The Abstention Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"AHU\">In its order dismissing this case the District Court\u2019s citation of <em>Schwartz </em>could also be construed as invoking the mutation of the abstention doctrine that was there given birth. The <em>Schwartz </em>version of the abstention doctrine is that since the state has a vital interest in education and has a procedure through which a federal claim may be presented any federal interests are \u201camply protected by the opportunity for direct review in the United States Supreme Court of all State judicial decisions.\u201d Schwartz, <em>supra, </em>309 F.Supp. at 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">But this mutation is inconsistent with the prior evolution of the law. It, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>like the exhaustion requirement, cannot survive. First, the abstention doctrine in federal constitutional claims is generally grounded on uncertainty<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> created by the \u201cstrands of local law woven into the case\u201d McNeese, <em>supra, </em>373 U.S. at 673, 83 S.Ct. at 1436, 10 L.Ed.2d at 626. See Reetz v. Bozanich, 1970, 397 U.S. 82, 90 S.Ct. 788, 25 L.Ed.2d 68. When, however, the cloth of state law is, as here,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> off the loom and there can be no doubt as to what the state law provides, there is no place for abstention.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moreover, this doctrine was not changed by Reetz v. Bozanich, 1970, 397 U.S. 82, 90 S.Ct. 788, 25 L.Ed.2d 68. There the Court directed the District Court to abstain from passing on an Alaska fishing license statute. There was great uncertainty whether the statute violated the Alaska Constitution and because of this uncertainty the abstention doctrine was invoked.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> There was thus no departure from the traditional rule.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">C. Requirement Of A Jurisdictional Amount</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Although the District Court did not include reference to them in its or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>ders dismissing the case, the defendants raised at that level and also press here other attacks on the jurisdiction of the District Court. The first claim is that there is no jurisdiction because the requisite jurisdictional amount<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> is not present. But 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343 provides a clear exception (see 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1331 (a) note 17, <em>swpra) </em>from the jurisdictional amount requirement. Although there may be some dispute about the applicability of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343(3), there can be no doubt that \u00a7 1343(4) is applicable and the complaints were encompassed in \u00a7 1343(4) whether cited specifically or not. Certainly \u00a7 1983 is an \u201cAct of Congress providing for the protection of civil rights, including the right to vote.\u201d Gomez v. Florida State Employment Service, 5 Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 569, 580 n. 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">D. Property Rights Exemption</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Closely akin to defendants\u2019 assertion that the District Court lacks jurisdiction because a jurisdictional amount has not been stated is their claim that there is no jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343 because only \u201cproperty rights\u201d are involved.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The argument is based on statements in several cases that \u00a7 1343 does not protect property rights. See e. g. Hague v. C.I.O., 1939, 307 U.S. 496, 59 S.Ct. 954, 83 L.Ed. 1423; Holt v. Indiana Mfg. Co., 1899, 176 U.S. 68, 20 S.Ct. 272, 44 L.Ed. 374. We have expressed doubts, see e. g. Bussie v. Long, 5 Cir., 1967, 383 F.2d 766; Atlanta Bowling Center, Inc. v. Allen, 5 Cir., 1968, 389 F.2d 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">These eases are not, however, applicable here.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The act that gave rise to this controversy was the seizure by Sylvia Garson of Claudine Hall\u2019s General Electric television. But the rights that the petition seeks to protect are not the rights to the television. They are, instead, the right of the individual to be secure in his home and free from the invasion of that home without any prior procedure to protect his interest. They are then the most personal constitutional liberties of privacy and the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures by private persons with the blessings of this state. Plaintiffs seek the opportunity to protect those rights through the due procedures of the law. See Gomez, <em>supra, </em>417 F.2d at 579 n. 37. These rights that this petition seeks to protect are truly the fundamentals of liberty, the essence of human dignity. Such fundamental, human, highly personalized rights are \u201cjust the stuff from which \u00a7 1983 claims are to be made.\u201d Gomez, <em>supra, </em>417 F.2d at 579; See Monroe v. Pape, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">II. Claim For Which Relief May Be Granted Under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983</p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">A. State Action</p>\n<p id=\"b498-13\">In addition to the defendants\u2019 jurisdictional claims, they argue that plaintiffs have not stated a claim for which relief can be granted under \u00a7 1983. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>defendants\u2019 first contention is that the requisite state action is not present since the television set was not seized by a state official but by the landlady.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">There can be no doubt that the defendants are correct in their claim that \u201cstate action\u201d is required for there to be a claim under \u00a7 1983. Moreover, there must be state action for there to be a deprivation of the rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment. See e. g. Pierson v. Ray, 1967, 386 U.S. 547, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 18 L.Ed.2d 288, Shelley v. Kraemer, 1948, 334 U.S. 1, 68 S.Ct. 836, 92 L.Ed. 1161. See generally, Horan, Law and Social Change; The Dynamics of the \u2018State Action\u2019 Doctrine, 17 J.Pub.L. 258 (1968). But it is equally without doubt that the actions of a private citizen can, and in some circumstances do, become the actions of the state both for purposes of \u00a7 1983 and for the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Adickes v. S. H. Kress and Co., 1970, 398 U.S. 144, 162-173, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1611-1616, 26 L.Ed.2d 142, 157-162; Baldwin v. Morgan, 5 Cir. 1961, 287 F.2d 750, 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">. In this case the alleged wrongful conduct was admittedly perpetrated by a person who was not an officer of the state or an official of any state agency. But the action taken, the entry into another\u2019s home and the seizure of another\u2019s property, was an act that possesses many, if not all, of the characteristics of an act of the State. The execution of a lien, whether a traditional security interest or a quasi writ of attachment or judgment lien has in Texas traditionally been the function of the Sheriff or constable.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus Article 5238a vests in the landlord and his agents authority that is normally exercised by the state and historically has been a state function.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Since United States v. Classic, 1941, 313 U.S. 299, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 85 L.Ed. 1368, a case involving irregularities in the conduct of a state Democratic party primary,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the question of state action has been whether the alleged wrongdoer was dressed with state authority. As Mr. Justice Stone said in <em>Classic, </em>the misuse of power \u201cpossessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with authority of state law, is state action taken \u2018under color of state law\u2019.\u201d 313 U.S. at 326, 61 S.Ct. at 1043, 85 L.Ed. at 1383. And here Sylvia\u2019s action, which was traditionally a state function, was draped with such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Moreover, although originally a state Court action and not a \u00a7 1983 case, Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp., 1969, 395 U.S. 337, 89 S.Ct. 1820, 23 L.Ed.2d 349, the case upon which plaintiffs base their claim that they have been deprived of a right secured by the Constitution, necessarily involved a finding of state action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>for purposes of the 14th Amendment. See Adickes v. S. H. Kress and Co., <em>supra. </em>And in <em>Sniadach </em>the ministerial act of issuance of a writ of garnishment and the service of that writ by the creditor\u2019s attorney upon the garnishee, the debtor\u2019s employer, satisfied the state action requirement. The functional role of the creditor\u2019s attorney and debtor\u2019s employer in <em>Sniadach, </em>even when coupled with the formal role of the clerk who issued the writ, is not significantly different from the role of the landlady here. And here the state action requirement is also met.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">B. Substance Of The Cause Of Action</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">In addition to their challenge to the existence of the requisite state action, defendants argue that the other element of a cause of action under \u00a7 1983 \u2014 the deprivation of \u201crights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws\u201d of the United States \u2014 was not alleged here. The plaintiff\u2019s claim is, however, that investing the landlord with power to take unilateral action Art. 5238a deprives her, and the class she represents, of the protection of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This claim springs from Snia-dach v. Family Finance Corp., 1969, 395 U.S. 337, 89 S.Ct. 1820, 23 L.Ed.2d 349 in which the Supreme Court held a Wisconsin garnishment statute unconstitutional. The defect in the statute was its failure to provide the debtor with any procedural protection against the loss of wages \u2014 \u201cthe interim freezing of wages without a chance to be heard violated procedural due process.\u201d 395 U.S. at 340, 89 S.Ct. at 1822, 23 L.Ed.2d at 353. See Note, Attachment and Garnishment \u2014Constitutional Law-Due Process of Law \u2014 Garnishment of Wages Prior to Judgment is a Denial of Due Process: The <em>Sniadach </em>Case and Its Implications for Related Areas of the Law, 68 Mich. L.Rev. 986 (1970). See also Goldberg v. Kelly, 1970, 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Before determining whether <em>Sniadach </em>requires a conclusion that plaintiffs have stated a claim, we must sound a caveat. In determining whether a claim for which relief can be granted has been stated we do not pass on the merits of that claim. That is for the trial Court to determine. See Public Affairs Associates, Inc. v. Rickover, 1962, 369 U.S. 111, 82 S.Ct. 580, 7 L.Ed.2d 604. In making that determination we do, however, indicate some of the considerations and factors that may be important.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Among these is the fact that 5238a has the same characteristic that the Supreme Court found objectionable in the Wisconsin statute: Property may be seized by the landlord without \u201ca chance to be heard.\u201d But Art. 5238a is not a garnishment statute and all prehearing summary procedures are clearly not unconstitutional. The requirements for due procedure must be balanced against the competing interest of society served by quick and decisive action.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> And in extra-ordinary situations the prehearing seizure of property is permissible, Ewing v. Mytinger &amp; Casselberry, Inc., 1950, 339 U.S. 594, 598-600, 70 S.Ct. 870, 872-873, 94 L.Ed. 1088, 1092-1094; Fahey v. Mallonee, 1947, 332 U.S. 245, 253-254, 67 S.Ct. 1552, 1554-1556, 91 L.Ed. 2030, 2039.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Thus the constitutionality 5238a will depend on this type of balof Art. ancing in order to determine whether there exists an extraordinary circumstance that would justify the summary seizure which Art. 5238a authorizes.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> At this stage we cannot say that such an extraordinary circumstance exists. Art. 5238a seems only to protect the landlord\u2019s interest, and not any broader public interest. Moreover, there is no requirement in Art. 5238a that there be any showing of the likelihood or the threat of the debtor-tenant\u2019s absconding, leaving the creditor-landlord with no effective way to collect a just debt.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In addition, the same kind of deep personal hardship can result from the seizure of personal and household goods as resulted from the garnishment of wages under the Wisconsin statute in <em>Sniadach. </em>See Note, <em>supra, </em>68 Mich.L.Rev. at 999-1005.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">But, as we indicated before, it is not for us here to determine the ultimate merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge. We can, however, determine at this stage that a Rule 12(b) dismissal was error. Issues of such public importance<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> turn on facts and not academic suppositions. Public Affairs Associates, Inc. v. Rickover, <em>supra. </em>It may be that in the \u201cnormal process of development of the facts and the determination of the real merits of the case,\u201d Merlite Land, Sea &amp; Sky, Inc., v. Palm Beach Investment Properties, Inc., 5 Cir., 1970, 426 F.2d 495, a compelling interest served by Art. 5238a, or more properly, its peremptory seizure procedure, will appear. See Local Union No. 300, Amalgamated Meat Cutters &amp; Butcher Workmen of North America, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>AFL-CIO v. McCulloch, 5 Cir., 1970, 428 F.2d 396. We do not, however, attempt to forecast or indicate what the final result will be.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">III. The Three-Judge Court Questions</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">A. The Substantiality Of The Question In addition to the questions of the existence of the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction and the presence of a claim under \u00a7 1983 for which relief can be granted, we are also obligated to pass on the District Court\u2019s refusal to request a three-Judge Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2284 (see note, 5 <em>supra.) </em>Schackman v. Arnebergh, 1967, 387 U.S. 427, 87 S.t. 1622, 18 L.Ed.2d 865. See Mayhue\u2019s Super Liquor Store, Inc. v. Meiklejohn, 5 Cir., 1970, 426 F.2d 142; Currie, Appellate Review of the Decision Whether or Not to Empanel a Three-Judge Federal Court, 37 U.Chi.L.Rev. 159 (1969). The first question to answer in fulfilling that obligation is whether the two-pronged substantiality requirement of Ex Parte Poresky, 1933, 290 U.S. 30, 54 S.Ct. 3, 78 L.Ed. 152, has been met. See Local 300, Amalgamated Meat Cutters, <em>supra; </em>Hargrave v. McKinney, 5 Cir., 1969, 413 F.2d 320. Here, of course, there can be no question that the challenge to the constitutionality of Art. 5238a presents substantial federal questions. (See II B, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">B. The Technical Requirements Of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2281</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Before a three-Judge Court is required or authorized, more than <em>Poresky </em>sub-stantiality is required. Under 28 U.S. C. A. \u00a7 2281 (see note 4 <em>supra) </em>a three-Judge Court has jurisdiction only if the state statute, the operation of which plaintiffs seek to enjoin, has statewide application<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and the injunctive relief sought will run against a state officer.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> See C. Wright, Federal Courts \u00a7 50 (2d ed. 1970). Here there is no question that Art. 5238a has statewide applicability. There is, however, a serious question whether injunctive relief is sought against a \u201cstate officer\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2281.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-18\"> Here the injunction is sought against the landlord. And, although he may be performing state functions for purpose of any state action requirement, this does not mean that he becomes a state officer for purpose of \u00a7 2281 \u2014 \u201can enactment technical in the strict sense of the word and to be applied as such.\u201d Phillips v. United States, 1941, 312 U.S. 246, 251, 61 S.Ct. 480, 483, 85 L.Ed. 800 805; Mitchell v. Donovan, 1970, 398 U.S. 427, 90 S.Ct. 1763, 26 L.Ed.2d 378. The three-Judge statutes were first enacted in reaction to Ex parte Young, 1908, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714. Congress believed federal court interference with state policy and state officials would be better accepted if it was the action of a three-Judge rather than one-Judge Court. C. Wright, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 50. The idea was to extend to the states as a matter of comity the protection of the considered judgment of three Federal Judges instead of just one.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> It has been held that the policy of the act does not extend to local officials unless they really are the means whereby the statewide policy is carried out. Rorick v. Board of Comm., 1939, 307 U.S. 208, 59 S.Ct. 808, 83 L.Ed. 1242. It seems apparent that the policy was also never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>intended to apply to situations, as here, where a private person, although performing a function traditionally performed by the state and \u201cclothed with state authority\u201d, who is acting essentially for his own benefit is to be restrained. And the fact that the person may perform a role normally that of the state surely does not create a need for comity.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Thus since all the requirements for a three-Judge Court are not present, the District Court was correct in refusing to notify the Chief Judge of the Circuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2284. We thus send this case back to a one-Judge and not a three-Judge Court. But in so doing we do not deprive the plaintiffs of an opportunity for an effective remedy. The one-Judge Court can certainly give this the expeditious treatment that is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Affirmed in part, reversed and remanded in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-8\">. \u201cSection 1.

The reference to a tliree-Judge Court in King, <em>supra, </em>goes to the substantiality of the constitutional attack not the nature of the Court to pass on it. Here, of course, the challenge to Tex.Civ.Stat.Ann. Art. 5238a is sufficiently substantial to meet the requirements of Ex Parte Poresky, 1933, 290 U.S. 30, 54 S.Ct. 3, 78 L.Ed. 152, see Mayhue\u2019s Super Liquor Store, Inc. v.

There can be no doubt that until <em>Monroe, McNeese, Damico </em>and <em>Houghton </em>the conventional wisdom was that the exhaustion of state administrative remedies was required while there was no need to exhaust judicial remedies. C. Wright, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 49 (2d ed. 1970). Here, of course, only judicial remedies are involved. It may be that exhaustion of administrative remedies is still required at least to the extent that it is necessary to have an authoritative institutional decision or pronouncement. Thus it might be necessary to require a school student to seek school board review of a principal\u2019s action. Stevenson v.

Pullman Co., 1941, 312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971, (ii) it has been argued that federal Courts may avoid decision in order to prevent needless conflicts with state activity, (iii) to leave to the states the resolution of unsettled questions of state law, and (iv) to ease the congestion of federal court dockets. C. Wright, Federal Courts \u00a7 52 (2d ed. 1970). But the scope of these different doctrines, if indeed they are different, is illusive. See Zwick-ler v. Koota, 1967, 389 U.S. 241, 88 S.Ct. 391, 19 L.Ed.2d 444. It is certain, however, that none authorizes abstention when state law is clear simply because the state has a general interest in the subject matter of the controversy, whether it is schools or debt collection.
