In a carefully considered opinion, now published as Heavy Contractors Association, Inc. v. International Hod Car., L. No. 1140, D.C.Neb., 1969, 312 F.Supp. 1345, Chief Judge Robinson held that the District Court had jurisdiction to use declaratory judgment procedure, that a valid and enforceable contract existed between the parties which had neither been modified nor terminated by mutual consent. After careful consideration of the record and the contentions of the parties, we are in complete agreement with Chief Judge Robinson\u2019s opinion and find that substantial evidence in the record supports his conclusion. We affirm on the basis of his opinion as published.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
