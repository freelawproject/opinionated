He now attacks the judgment of conviction entered on that plea. There is no merit in his contentions either that Rule 11, F.R.Cr.P. was not complied with or that Leary v. United States, 1969, 395 U.S. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57 entitles him to relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1334-19\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-20\">DR-69-CA-8</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-21\">United States District Court Western District of Texas Del Rio Division</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-22\">Ruben Torres Mejia, versus United States of America</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-24\">ORDER DENYING MOTION TO VACATE PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-25\">On December 8, 1965, petitioner pled guilty to Count One of a four-count indictment charging a violation of 21 U.S. C. \u00a7 176a. On December 13, 1965, sentence was imposed at 15 years imprisonment. United States v. Mejia, No. 12390 Cr., W.D.Tex., Dec. 13, 1965. Petitioner here moves for vacation of that sentence on the grounds that (a) the trial court failed to comply with the requirements of Rule 11, F.R.Cr.P., in that \u201cthe trial court did not establish a factual basis for the plea,\u201d and (b) 21 U.S. C. \u00a7 176a was found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>As to ground (a), the Court finds that that portion of Rule 11 requiring that \u201c[t]he court shall not enter a judgment upon a plea of guilty unless it is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the plea\u201d was added by amendment of February 28, 1966, effective July 1, 1966, and was hence inapplicable to this petitioner\u2019s plea. The files and records herein conclusively show that prior to acceptance of petitioner\u2019s plea of guilty the Court addressed the petitioner personally and determined that the plea was made freely and voluntarily with an intelligent understanding of the nature of the offense charged and the consequences of the plea and with the advice of competent counsel. See Chandler v. United States, 413 F.2d 1018 (5th Cir. 1969); Hunter v. United States, 409 F. 2d 1203 (5th Cir. 1969); Tittle v. United States, 407 F.2d 843 (5th Cir. 1969); Grant v. United States, 406 F.2d 1295 (5th Cir. 1969); Johns v. United States, 401 F.2d 895 (5th Cir. 1968); Streator v. United States, 395 F.2d 661 (5th Cir. 1968); Berlanga v. United States, 394 F.2d 615 (5th Cir. 1968); and cases cited therein. It further conclusively appears from the files and records, including the trial of petitioner\u2019s co-defendant Michael L. Archibald and petitioner\u2019s testimony thereat, that there was more than adequate factual basis to support his plea. The Court was so satisfied at the time judgment was entered thereon and is so satisfied now. No more was or is required. See McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969); cf., Halliday v. United States, 394 U.S. 831, 89 S.Ct. 1498, 23 L.Ed.2d 16 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-4\">As to ground (b), the Court finds that Leary v. United States, <em>swpra, </em>did not hold \u00a7 176a unconstitutional, but only that application of that portion of \u00a7 176a which allows a jury to \u201cinfer\u201d certain knowledge from the fact of possession violated due process. Since petitioner\u2019s cases did not go to a jury, the holding in <em>Leary </em>is patently inapplicable to his conviction. Moreover, his voluntary and understanding plea was an admission of all facts alleged in Count One, including illegal importation and guilty knowledge, and a waiver of all non-jurisdictional defects. Rice v. United States, 420 F.2d 863 (5th Cir. 1969); Todd v. United States, 418 F.2d 134 (5th Cir. 1969); Chandler v. United States, <em>supra; </em>Frye v. United States, 411 F.2d 562 (5th Cir. 1969); Henderson v. United States, 395 F.2d 209 (5th Cir. 1968); Cooper v. Holman, 356 F.2d 82 (5th Cir. 1966); Busby v. Holman, 356 F.2d 75 (5th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the Motion must be, and the same is hereby, in all things, denied, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-8\">Entered this 31st day of December, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-9\">(Signed) D.
