The district court found that the appellee had been unconstitutionally denied \u201cAid to the Blind\u201d welfare assistance pursuant to Florida\u2019s durational residency requirement, and ordered appellant to pay $825.00 representing the moneys illegally withheld. Appellant concedes the unconstitutionality of the requirement but insists that the lower court erred in awarding $825.00 in \u201cback payments\u201d or retroactive benefits.\u201d We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1329-16\">While the present case was pending in the district court, the Supreme Court in Shapiro v. Thompson<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> invalidated similar durational residence requirements in other states. <em>Shapiro </em>controlled the lower court's decision in the instant case. Appellant argues that such requirements were not unconstitutional prior to the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Shapiro </em>and that appellee is not entitled to welfare payments properly denied pursuant to a valid residence requirement in <em>pre-Shapiro </em>days.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1329-17\">Appellant states in its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1329-18\">To require back payments to a person who was ineligible under the then <em>constitutional </em>state welfare residency requirement statute is absurd, as <em>not until </em>the United States Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncement in Shapiro v. Thompson, supra, could Appellee have been declared or considered eligible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASg\">Although never stated in these terms, appellant is apparently arguing that <em>Shapiro </em>should be given prospective effect only. In support of this position, it states that the Florida Department of Public Welfare has relied on the state durational residence requirement. We find this argument singularly unpersuasive. Presumably, all state statutes which have ever been invalidated as unconstitutional were relied on by state employees until invalidated. Appellant has launched its argument, effectively unsupported, directly in the teeth of the general rule, which has persisted for centuries, that judicial precedents in cases of this nature normally have retroactive as well as prospective effect.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We have been offered no justifiable reason for departing from this venerable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>and well established principle in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\">Appellant advances another somewhat unusual argument which we also find unacceptable. It explains that the assistance sought by appellee under Florida\u2019s \u201cAid to the Blind\u201d program is a \u201ccurrent subsistence grant\u201d and that since appellee has obviously subsisted without it \u2014 probably, we are told, by \u201creceiving some form of public or private aid and assistance\u201d \u2014 awarding back payments would constitute a \u201cgratuitous windfall.\u201d There is no support in the record for this contention. There is no showing of a lack of diligence on the part of appellee. In the circumstances we are unable to conclude that the district court was in error in making the award involved here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">Our decision to affirm the award is strongly influenced by the fact that the district court in <em>Shapiro </em><footnotemark>6</footnotemark> made precisely the same award and this decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court. Appellant argues that the Court did not mention the award of retroactive benefits but only considered the constitutionality of the residency requirement. This argument is overbalanced, in our view, by the fact that the Court affirmed the decision of the district court without mentioning that the award of \u201cback pay\u201d was erroneous. Such an award is apparently not as uncommon as appellant would have us believe. The Court, in Sherbert v. Verner,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> awarded unemployment benefits which had been unconstitutionally withheld. And, a three-judge court in Machado v. Hackney <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> awarded welfare benefits illegally withheld pursuant to the Texas \u201csubstitute father\u201d rule. In our opinion these decisions justify the district court\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-6\">The decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1329-11\">. Pursuant to our Rule 18 this case is decided without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1329-12\">. <em>394 U.S. 618, 89 </em>S.Ct. 1322, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 -(1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1329-13\">. This argument seems to concede that a portion of the $825.00 was properly awarded. The award represents payments denied from the time of appellee\u2019s original application for assistance until the date of the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Shapiro </em>was decided several months before the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1329-20\">.
