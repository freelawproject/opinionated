The court further found that appellant\u2019s contributory negligence was a proximate cause of his injury and reduced the award by fifty per-cent. Judgment was entered in favor of appellant in the sum of $37,132.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-26\"> Appellant now alleges that the court erred in finding that he was negligent. This is a factual finding which may be disturbed on appeal only if clear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>ly erroneous. Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P.; Rederi A/B Soya v. SS Grand Grace, 369 F.2d 159, 162-163 (9th Cir. 1966). We hold that the trial court\u2019s finding on the record including the depositions was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"> The court\u2019s finding that appellant had a reduced work life expectancy was likewise supported by substantial evidence and was not clearly erroneous. Nor did the court err in failing to prepare special findings on damages. The court substantially adopted the proposed findings of fact submitted to it by appellant. Appellant made no motion for a more detailed computation of damages. Although the findings on damages were somewhat vague, there is no doubt as to the propriety of the total amount awarded. <em>See </em>Dwyer v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 276 F.2d 653, 654 (2d Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
