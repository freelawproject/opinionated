The District Court found in taxpayer\u2019s favor and awarded him a judgment of $19,-299.60. The government appeals challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support the District Court\u2019s finding that Perez did not collect the excise tax from his customers by including the tax in his prices for \u201cpickup coaches.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6416(a) (1) (A) (1954). The government emphasizes the very heavy burden of proof that must be met by the taxpayer in such cases as this. See Norris Dispensers, Inc. v. United States, 8 Cir., 1963, 325 F.2d 140; Commerce-Pacific Inc. v. United States, S.D.Cal.1959, 175 F.Supp. 227, aff\u2019d. 9 Cir., 1960, 278 F.2d 651. It urges that the taxpayer did not meet that burden. After reviewing the evidence presented at trial, we hold that the taxpayer met the burden and that the District Court\u2019s findings are not \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
