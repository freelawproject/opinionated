Dudley v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 3d Cir. 1958, 258 F.2d 182, 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>The Virgin Islands has jurisdiction to tax corporations of mainland domicile on income from sources within the Virgin Islands. At the same time the United States has jurisdiction to tax the income of such corporations regardless of source, and does so. Double taxation is avoided by granting a foreign tax credit to such corporations for taxes paid to the Virgin Islands. <em>See </em>I.T. 2946, XIV-2 Cum.Bull. 109, 110 (1935).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">Section 922 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 provides a special deduction for \u201cWestern Hemisphere trade corporations\u201d in computing taxable income, and section 921 defines corporations entitled to the special deduction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK6I\">\u201cFor purposes of this subtitle, the term \u2018Western Hemisphere trade corporation\u2019 means a domestic corporation all of whose business (other than incidental purchases) is done in any country or countries in North, Central, or South America, or in the West Indies, and which satisfies the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-5\">(1) if 95 percent or more of the gross income of such domestic corporation for the 3-year period immediately preceding the close of the taxable year (or for such part of such period during which the corporation was in existence) was derived from sources without the United States; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-6\">(2) if 90 percent or more of its gross income for such period or such part thereof was derived from the active conduct of a trade or business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-7\">* * * <em>&gt;t</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1034-8\">The Virgin Islands are considered to be a \u201ccountry * * * in the West Indies\u201d and a source of income \u201cwithout the united States\u201d in the administration of this special provision. Rev.Rul. 55-105, 1955-1 Cum.Bull. 94; I.T. 4067, 1951-2 Cum.Bull. 55-56. In addition, section 7701(a) (4) of the 1954 Code defines a \u201cdomestic\u201d corporation as one \u201ccreated or organized in the United States or under the law of the United States or of any State or Territory.\u201d But Virgin Islands corporations are not \u201cdomestic\u201d under the definition in section 7701(a) (4) because the term \u201cTerritory\u201d in that section includes only incorporated territories, such as Alaska and Hawaii before they were admitted to the Union. <em>See </em>Treas.Reg. \u00a7 301.7701-5 (1960). The Virgin Islands are an unincorporated territory, 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1541(a) (1964), and a Virgin Islands corporation is treated as \u201cforeign\u201d for purposes of the United States income tax. <em>See </em>Rev.Rul. 56-616, 1956-2 Cum.Bull. 589-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-12\">It is undisputed, therefore, that the taxpayer would be entitled to the special deduction of section 922 on its United States income tax return, since the taxpayer is a domestic corporation of the United States and satisfies the conditions of clauses (1) and (2) of section 921 for the taxable year at issue. However, the Commissioner of Finance disallowed the Western Hemisphere trade corporation deduction claimed in the taxpayer\u2019s Virgin Islands income tax return and determined a deficiency on the ground that the deduction is not allowable in a Virgin Islands return to corporations that are not \u201cdomestic\u201d in relation to that taxing authority. On the taxpayer\u2019s suit for redetermination, the district court reached the same result as the Commissioner by reading a definition of \u201cdomestic\u201d found in the Virgin Islands Code, 33 V.I.C. \u00a7 1931(2) (1967), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>into the Internal Revenue Code\u2019s definition of a Western Hemisphere trade corporation. The local statute defines \u201cdomestic\u201d when applied to a corporation to mean \u201ccreated or organized in the Virgin Islands.\u201d Relying upon this definition, the district court ruled that only Virgin Islands corporations, and not mainland corporations like the taxpayer, are entitled to the special deduction allowed by section 922 when computing their income tax liability to the Virgin Islands. Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Co. v. Wheatley, D.V.I.1969, 295 F.Supp. 240, 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-4\">We think that the district court erred in relying on the definition of \u201cdomestic\u201d in section 1931 of the Virgin Islands Code. Congress has not empowered the Virgin Islands Legislature to redefine terms in the Internal Revenue Code, and in section 1931 that legislature has not purported to do so. Indeed, the definitions in that section apply by their own terms only \u201c[w]hen used in this subtitle,\u201d namely, Subtitle 1 of Title 33. Of course, the substantive provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 are not incorporated into Subtitle 1 of Title 33 or any other part of the Virgin Islands Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the pertinent inquiry is whether, absent any authoritative local legislation, the Commissioner\u2019s construction of \u201cdomestic\u201d in section 921 of the Internal Revenue Code as meaning only Virgin Islands corporations is required to give proper effect to the Western Hemisphere trade corporation deduction as part of the Virgin Islands income tax law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-9\">Both the federal tax administrators and the Congress have recognized that implementation of the Internal Revenue Code as a separate taxing statute in the Virgin Islands requires some substitution of language. In a ruling published in 1935, the Bureau of Internal Revenue noted that in construing the taxing statute applicable in the Virgin Islands, \u201cit will, of course, be necessary in some sections of the law to substitute the words \u2018Virgin Islands\u2019 for the words \u2018United States,\u2019 in order to give the law proper effect in those islands.\u201d I.T. 2946, XIV-2 Cum.Bull. 109, 110 (1935).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1035-10\">The Internal Revenue Code was enacted as the income tax law of Guam by section 31 of the Organic Act of Guam in language identical in all relevant respects to the statute that had established what has come to be called the \u201cmirror system\u201d of taxation in the Virgin Islands.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The equivalent mirror system of taxation in Guam has been the subject of congressional and judicial interpretations that indicate the extent to which the Internal Revenue Code should be modified in its application as a separate territorial income tax. The decisions construing the original Guamanian tax statute agreed that \u201c[t]he tax to be paid ordinarily is measured by the amount of income tax the taxpayer would be required to pay to the United States of America if the taxpayer were residing in the continental United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>States,\u201d and that the literal terms of the Internal Revenue Code should be modified only by \u201cthose nonsubstantive changes in nomenclature as are necessary to avoid confusion as to the taxing jurisdiction involved.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">In 1958 Congress amended section 31 of the Organic Act of Guam to clarify the separate territorial income tax structure. In an explanatory note accompanying its recommendation that the amendments to section 31 be approved, the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs recognized the similarity of the income tax structures of Guam and the Virgin Islands and indicated that the amendments would be in accordance with a number of authoritative pronouncements, among them the ruling of the Bureau of Internal Revenue that the same principles of substitution were applicable to the revenue laws of both possessions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The amendments limited incorporation of the Internal Revenue Code in Guam to those provisions \u201cnot manifestly inapplicable or incompatible\u201d with a separate territorial income tax, and provided for the substitution of \u201cGuam\u201d for \u201cUnited States\u201d and \u201cother changes in nomenclature and other language, including the omission of inapplicable language, where necessary to effect the intent of this section.\u201d 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421i(d) (1) &amp; (e) (1964). However, the apparent latitude for interpretation allowed by the amended statute has not changed the basic conception that \u201cthe purpose of the amended statute was to give Guam a separate, integral tax system, which would duplicate the United States\u2019 tax system in all substantive particulars.\u201d Sayre &amp; Co. v. Riddell, 9th Cir. 1968, 395 F.2d 407, 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-8\">The principles by which the mirror system of taxation should be applied have received instructive exemplification in decisions interpreting the amended Guamanian tax statute. When the tax officials of Guam passed regulations purporting to disallow business losses in the United States as deductions on Guamanian income tax returns, and attempting to redefine gross income to include only income earned in Guam, the regulations were held invalid as modifying the substance of Internal Revenue Code provisions that were not \u201cmanifestly inapplicable or incompatible\u201d with a separate tax structure. Guam v. Foster, 9th Cir. 1966, 362 F.2d 248. On the other hand, in Sayre &amp; Co. v. Riddell, <em>supra, </em>it was held that Guam properly treated a United States corporation as foreign for the purpose of the withholding tax on payments to foreign corporations, just as the United States treats territorial corporations as \u201cforeign\u201d for the United States tax purposes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Substitutions and omissions were made in the withholding provisions of Int.Rev.Code of 1954, on the theory that \u201cGuam should apply the Internal Revenue Code * * * to persons and income within its territory just as the United States applies the Code to persons and income within <em>its </em>territory.\u201d 395 F.2d at 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-9\">We apply these concepts to the present problem. The Western Hemisphere trade corporation deduction is a supposedly equalizing economic benefit granted by the United States to Ameri-can corporations doing most of their business outside the United States in the Western Hemisphere. The stated purpose of the deduction was to alleviate the competitive disadvantage thought to be imposed by the surtax of the Rev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>enue Act of 1942 on American corporations trading in the Western Hemisphere.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the light of this purpose, the substitutions urged by the Virgin Islands government would substantially alter and distort the Western Hemisphere trade corporation deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">If the United States were the only jurisdiction taxing a mainland corporation deriving 95% of its income from Virgin Islands business, the corporation would be entitled to the Western Hemisphere trade corporation deduction. For, as we already have pointed out, under section 921 the corporation would be \u201cdomestic\u201d and its Virgin Islands income would be from \u201csources without the United States.\u201d Therefore, substantive equality of treatment in determining the deduction under the Virgin Islands mirror system requires that the quoted language be given the same meaning. Such identity of treatment imposes no unfairness and creates no distortion. The scheme of the statute is to impose a tax obligation to the Virgin Islands equivalent to what the United States would collect on the same income, but for the mirror system. <em>Cf. </em>Sayre &amp; Co. v. Riddell, <em>supra </em>at 410-411. To disallow the deduction as the Virgin Islands has done is to claim for the territory a larger tax than the United States would have collected in the absence of the mirror system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">Moreover, if the Virgin Islands can construe \u201cdomestic corporation\u201d as used in section 921 to mean a Virgin Islands corporation, but not a mainland corporation, an unwarranted distortion will result in the application of the Western Hemisphere trade corporation deduction. If the regulation treating the Virgin Islands as a source of income outside of the United States is applied, then a Virgin Islands corporation doing all of its business at home can claim the deduction in its Virgin Islands return, the only return it is required to make,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> while a mainland corporation similarly engaged in the Virgin Islands is denied that privilege. The appellee recognizes that such a distortion must be avoided, so it urges that in determining what local corporations will qualify for the Western Hemisphere trade corporation deduction, the Virgin Islands taxing authorities should substitute the phrase \u201csources outside of the Virgin Islands\u201d for the statutory phrase \u201csources without the United States.\u201d But that substitution would lead to something far worse. It would enable a Virgin Islands corporation doing most of its business on the mainland to qualify for a deduction intended solely to benefit business activities outside of the United States. Moreover, every business enterprise operating solely on the mainland could qualify for the Western Hemisphere trade corporation deduction merely by incorporating in the Virgin Islands.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-8\">Essentially, the Virgin Islands government offers only one contention of social policy to justify the substantive revision of the Western Hemisphere trade corporation deduction it would impose. In an argument accepted by the district court,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the local government contends that because the mirror system of taxation was designed to assist the Virgin Islands in becoming financially self-supporting,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a Western Hemisphere trade corporation should not receive a subsidy in the form of reduced income tax liability to the Virgin Islands. If valid, this argument would justify elimination of almost any provision of the Internal Revenue Code that enabled a taxpayer to reduce his territorial income tax. However, the Virgin Islands may not at its option effectively disallow the deductions provided in the Internal Revenue Code. <em>See </em>Guam v. Koster, <em>supra. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>More basically, Congress has aided the Virgin Islands by giving them the same tax, not more, than the United States would otherwise collect on Virgin Islands business. We find nothing in the favorable tax treatment granted to Western Hemisphere trade corporations under section 922 of the Internal Revenue Code that is so manifestly incompatible with the concept of an equivalent separate tax imposed by the Virgin Islands as to require modifications altering the substance of the provision.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">The judgment of the district court will be reversed, and the case will be remanded with directions to grant the appellant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1034-9\">. In 1954, Congress provided that permanent residents of the Virgin Islands (including Virgin Islands corporations) must return and pay taxes to the Virgin Islands on income from all sources. Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands \u00a7 28(a), 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1642 (1964). However, corporations domiciled on the mainland and United States citizens not residing permanently in the Virgin Islands must still file two tax returns, one reporting and paying taxes to the Virgin Islands on Virgin Islands income, and the other reporting and paying taxes to the United States on income from all sources, with a credit for taxes paid to the Virgin Islands.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">.
