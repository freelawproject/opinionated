It is undisputed that the acts of Carlow which premise the contention of malpractice were performed during the scope of Carlow\u2019s employment by an agency of the United States. The case was properly removed to federal court, Willingham v. Morgan, 395 U. S. 402, 89 S.Ct. 1813, 23 L.Ed.2d 396. The court below then dismissed the action on the ground that Carlow was im-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>mu\u00f1e from personal liability. The dismissal was specifically without prejudice to any claim Bates might have under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Both the judgment of dismissal and its qualifications were manifestly correct. Morgan v. Willingham, 10 Cir., 424 F.2d 200. The district court did not hold, as appellant would appear to argue, that the alleged acts of Carlow were of a discretionary nature as that term creates an exception to governmental liability under \u00a7 2680 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
