It also found Section 8(a) (1) to have been violated when the company discharged three employees who had engaged in concerted activities for the purpose of mutual aid or protection, and that the company had violated Section 8(a) (3)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by discharging eight employees because of their membership in or activities on behalf of the union. Finally, the Board concluded that the company\u2019s refusal to bargain when presented with authorization cards from a majority of the employees in the unit violated Section 8(a) (5).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We enforce the order of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b580-18\">In this court the company contends that the trial examiner erred in making his factual conclusions about anti-union statements and activities of William Tersinar, the plant superintendent. While the testimony of the parties was often in direct conflict, after a careful review of the trial examiner\u2019s opinion and the record we find that the examiner\u2019s conclusions, which were adopted by the Board without significant alteration, are supported by substantial evidence and, therefore, must be affirmed. We cannot on this record upset the examiner\u2019s determinations as to the relative credibility of the witnesses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-19\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b580-20\">The union\u2019s petition attacks the sufficiency of the remedy ordered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Board. The Board ordered the company to cease and desist from all the named violations, and to refrain from \u201cinterfering with, restraining, or coercing its employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed to them by Section 7 of the Act.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Board also ordered the company to bargain with the union upon request;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to reinstate the unlawfully discharged employees, with reimbursement for any loss of pay caused by the discharge; and to post appropriate notices in the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">The union requested the Board, and renews its requests in this court, (1) to order the employer to compensate employees for the benefits they would have received had the company not unlawfully refused to bargain \u2014 the so-called \u201cmake whole\u201d remedy; (2) to mail the remedial notice to all employees; (3) to allow the union an opportunity to reply to the employer\u2019s coercive actions on company premises; and (4) to allow an NLRB representative to explain to the employees their rights under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">We have often pointed out that we will ordinarily give deference to the expertise and experience of the Board in fashioning remedies,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and we see no abuse of the Board\u2019s discretion in this case. The union, however, points to a recent decision of this court, International Union of Electrical, Radio &amp; Machine Workers v. N.L.R.B. [Tiidee Products], 138 U.S.App.D.C. 249, 426 F.2d 1243 (1970), in which we remanded a refusal to bargain case to the Board in order that the Board might determine whether it ought to order the \u201cmake whole\u201d relief requested by the union.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, we do not think a remand is necessary under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-14\">There is no indication in the record presently before us that the company wished unnecessarily to delay the final outcome of this dispute. In <em>Tiidee Products, </em>on the other hand, the \u201cposition of the Company [was] palpably without merit with respect to its refusal to bargain.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In the instant case the legality of the company\u2019s refusal to bargain \u201crested on a [factually] debatable question,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that is, whether the dismissals, which took place before<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the union\u2019s demand for recognition, were for work-related reasons, or to discourage union activities. While we have no doubt that the trial examiner properly determined the facts, there admittedly were great discrepancies between the various accounts of the events leading up to the dismissals. On this record we cannot say that the employer engaged in this litigation in order to delay the final resolution of the dispute. Instead it desired only to obtain an authoritative determination of the validity of the Board\u2019s decision. At no time in this action did the company raise the kind of spurious, \u201cpatently frivolous\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> issues which were complained of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>in <em>Tiidee Products. </em>The Board\u2019s order in this case was issued before our decision in <em>Tiidee Products. </em>Under the circumstances, we accept the Board\u2019s explanation for refusing to order the further relief requested by the union. We would expect additional remedies or more complete explication in similar situations in cases decided after <em>Tiidee Products.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Since the Board\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, and since the Board did not abuse its discretion in determining the proper remedies, we enforce the Board\u2019s order and deny the union's petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-15\">. 176 NLRB No. 7 (1969).
