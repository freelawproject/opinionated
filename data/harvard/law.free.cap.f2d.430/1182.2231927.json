The escape occurred during the pendency of an appeal\" from a conviction for an earlier escape, which we affirmed. United States v. Greenwell, 4 Cir., 418 F.2d 846. Appointed counsel on this appeal has indicated that he is unable to discover any meritorious issue. In accordance with Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493, he has filed a brief raising several \u201carguable\u201d issues and has given Greenwell an opportunity to raise others. On review of the brief and the record we find further briefing or oral argument unnecessary and affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
