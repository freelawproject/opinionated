The Board cross-petitions for enforcement. We enforce the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The Company operates an oil refinery in Houston, Texas. Since 1945, Local 4-227 of the Oil, Chemical &amp; Atomic Workers International Union AFL-CIO has been the certified representative of the refinery employees. Their collective bargaining agreement establishes a workmen\u2019s committee to participate in the disposition of employee grievances. The two disciplined employees, George S. Harris and Jack R. Gilliam, had worked for the Company for over twenty years. At the time of the critical events both were members of the Workmen\u2019s Committee, and Gilliam was its chairman.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">On 29 March 1968, Fred Manly, Assistant Maintenance Superintendent, asked Harris why he had not been working overtime.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Harris replied that he did not want to work overtime, which he understood was his option under the collective bargaining agreement. Manly and Harris then went to the office of Harry A. Taylor, Assistant Employee Relations Manager, where Harris repeated his position. At Taylor\u2019s suggestion, Harris left the office and returned with Union Committeeman William Loree. In the meeting that followed it was the Company\u2019s position that, absent excuse, overtime was required by the contract, while the Union representatives maintained that it was optional with the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">According to the testimony of Harris and Loree, Taylor stated that Harris would be required to work the overtime. They also stated that Manly then \u201crequested\u201d Harris to work the overtime, to which Harris replied that, if he were given a choice, he would not work. According to Harris and Loree, Manly then \u201cordered\u201d Harris to work the overtime, and Harris replied that he would obey the order under protest. Manly testified in general agreement with the foregoing except that he denied having \u201cordered\u201d Harris to work overtime. Thereafter, Harris filed a grievance alleging that the Company had violated the collective bargaining agreement by requiring the overtime work.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">On 9 May 1968, the Workmen\u2019s Committee, chaired by Gilliam and including Harris and four other employees, held a grievance meeting with Company representatives. The Harris grievance was originally brought up during the morning session, but action was deferred until the afternoon so that Manly could be present. There is a wide variety of testimony as to the precise events during the afternoon session.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is clear, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>ever, that under questioning from Gilliam, Manly denied having \u201cordered\u201d Harris to work overtime. Harris then stated or implied that Manly\u2019s denial was a lie. Several witnesses testified that the allegation against Manly was accompanied by profanity. It also appears that Gilliam reminded Manly and the Company\u2019s representatives that they would be called upon after death and in the hereafter \u2014 -in a bargaining session yet to come \u2014 to answer for their earthly prevarications. After Gilliam\u2019s remark the meeting was adjourned.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">On 10 May 1968, Harris received a reprimand letter for \u201cabusive and insubordinate language directed at supervisors\u201d warning that any repetition would be dealt with more severely. Gilliam received a similar letter and a one day suspension for having tolerated and joined in Harris\u2019s conduct. This disciplinary action gave rise to the subject unfair labor practice charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-17\">The Trial Examiner held a hearing on the charges that the Company\u2019s action violated both \u00a7\u00a7 8(a) (1) and 8(a) (3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He found the facts to be substantially as we have set them out above. The Trial Examiner recognized that under a line of prior Board decisions<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the present conduct would normally be held to be protected and beyond the reach of employer discipline. However, he observed that the balance in these cases must be made according to their particular facts, and found that there were special circumstances in the present case which required a different conclusion: (1) The Trial Examiner saw no distinction between an employee being \u201cordered\u201d to do something and his being \u201crequested\u201d to do it, and concluded that this case was \u201cillborn.\u201d (2) He found no justification for the remarks made by Harris and Gilliam especially in light of Manly\u2019s mild-mannered nature. (3) He found no evidence of union animus in this case or in the Company\u2019s labor history.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>On review the Board found the Trial Examiner\u2019s distinctions unpersuasive. First, it felt the merits of the underlying grievance impertinent to the question of whether the employees were unlawfully disciplined. Next, the Board concluded that the Trial Examiner\u2019s finding that the remarks were not justified, even if correct, was not controlling. It stated, \u201cThe issue is not whether the statements by Harris and Gilliam were justified by either the Trial Examiner\u2019s standards or ours, but rather whether these statements were so opprobrious as to remove them from the otherwise protected nature of a grievance meeting.\u201d Finally, the Board observed that a finding of union animus was not a necessary element of an 8(a) (1) violation. It did not feel it was necessary to determine whether the conduct was inherently discriminatory, which would have permitted a finding of an 8(a) (3) violation absent evidence of union animus; but held that the conduct violated 8(a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-13\">The Company initially contends that, inasmuch as the Board did not disturb the Trial Examiner\u2019s conclusion that the Company had no unlawful motive in disciplining Harris and Gilliam, its finding of an 8(a) (1) violation was unwarranted. The Company places its principle reliance on three eases decided by the Supreme Court in 1965. Textile Workers Union v. Darlington Manufacturing Co.; <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> N.L.R.B. v. Brown;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> American Ship Building Co. v. N.L.R.B.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, these cases, as well as later Court decisions involving unlawful employer motive,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> dealt with alleged violations of \u00a7 8(a) (3) as well as 8(a) (1). Unlike \u00a7 8(a) (1), 8(a) (3) <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> has been construed as requiring that the prohibited conduct must be for the purpose of encouraging or discouraging membership in a labor organization.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>In <em>Darlington, </em>the Court stated:<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-4\">A violation of \u00a7 8(a) (1) alone * * * presupposes an act which is unlawful even absent a discriminatory motive. Whatever may be the limits of \u00a7 8(a) (1), some employer decisions are so peculiarly matters of management prerogative that they would never constitute violations of \u00a7 8(a) (1), whether or not they involved sound business judgment, unless they also violated \u00a78(a) (3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-14\">It would thus appear that the exercise of such \u201cmanagement prerogatives\u201d as going out of business <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or engaging in a lock-out of employees<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> may not be judged initially by \u00a7 8(a) (1) and may only be held to violate that Section derivatively through a violation of 8(a) (3).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The discussions of employer motive cited by the Company from these cases would then relate to the requirements of \u00a7 8(a) (1) only insofar as such a violation must be derived from an 8 (a) (3) violation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number> In the present case the Board did not sustain the charge under \u00a7 8(a) (3); it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-5\">Affirmative evidence of union animus might be necessary to support a violation of Section 8(a) (3) but it is not necessary to support a violation of Section 8(a) (1). Accordingly, while Respondent\u2019s disciplining of Harris and Gilliam for engaging in the collective-bargaining process itself may have been inherently discriminatory, we find it unnecessary to resolve that issue, for we find that in any event such disciplining constituted interference, restraint, and coercion with respect to Section 7 rights, and thus violated Section 8(a) (1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">In our opinion, the disciplining of employees for insubordination, while certainly the right of management, is not such an inherent management prerogative as to be immune from challenge as a primary violation of \u00a7 8(a) (1). When thus considered, the motive behind an employer\u2019s conduct is not an element of the unfair labor practice charged.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In Welch Scientific Co. v. N.L.R.B., the court stated:<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-8\">In essence, the company argues that as its actions were taken in good faith it committed no unfair labor practice. There is much in this record to indicate that [the company] acted in good faith * * *, but we conclude that, if the conduct complained of otherwise violated Section 8(a) (1), good faith is no defense. The cases clearly demonstrate that it is the tendency of an employer\u2019s conduct to interfere with the \u2022 rights of his employees protected by Section 8 (a) (1), rather than his motives, that is controlling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-15\">Under the facts and in the circumstances disclosed by the record before us the absence of a finding of unlawful motive is not fatal to the Board\u2019s conclusion that the Company violated 8(a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-16\">The question remaining is whether the Board properly concluded that the conduct of Harris and Gilliam was protected by the Act so as to make the imposition of disciplinary sanction violative of Section 8(a) (1). Initially, the filing and prosecution of employee grievances is a fundamental, day-to-day part of collective bargaining and is protected by Section 7.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In a general sense, both employees were engaged in protected activity at the time the objectionable statements were made, but this does not dispose of the case. An employee may not act with impunity even though he is engaged in protected activity. His rights, derived from Section 7, must be balanced against the employer\u2019s right to maintain order in his business by punishing acts of insubordination.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-17\">In Boaz Spinning Co. v. N.L.R.B.,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> this court refused to enforce an order of the board which found that the company violated Section 8(a) (1) in discharging an employee for insubordinate conduct. There, the plant manager made a lawful persuasion speech to his assembled em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>ployees prior to a Board election. An employee tried, at several points, to interrupt the speech with pro-union statements. After being twice advised that the meeting was closed and that union advocates would no be allowed the floor, the employee called the plant manager a \u201cCastro,\u201d stating that he ran his plant after the fashion of totalitarian dictators. In considering the finding that he was wrongfully discharged, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-4\">Undoubtedly \u201cflagrant conduct of an employee, even though occurring in the course of section 7 activity, may justify disciplinary action by the employer. On the other hand, not every impropriety committed during such activity places the employee beyond the protective shield of the act. The employee\u2019s right to engage in concerted activity may permit some leeway for impulsive behavior, which must be balanced against the employer\u2019s right to maintain order and respect.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-6\">Also see Hugh H.

We agree with the Board that whether the remarks were by some stand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>ard \u201cjustified\u201d is not controlling. Here the remarks were pertinent to a discussion of the grievance under consideration at the meeting. \u201c[A]s long as the activities engaged in are lawful and the character of the conduct is not <em>indefensible </em>in the context of the grievance involved, the employees are protected under \u00a7 7 of the act.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Neither do we think the language used by Harris and Gilliam was so opprobrious as to carry them \u201cbeyond the pale\u201d of the Act\u2019s protection. It has been repeatedly observed that passions run high in labor disputes and that epithets and- accusations are commonplace.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Grievance meetings arising out of disputes between employer and employee are not calculated to create an aura of total peace and tranquility where compliments are lavishly exchanged. Adding our disclaimer to that of the Board, we do not condone the conduct of Harris and Gilliam in the meeting, but we do not feel that the interests of collective bargaining will be served by the external imposition of a rigid standard of proper and civilized behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Of central importance to our view of the case, is the nature of the protected activity involved. Harris and Gilliam were participating in a grievance meeting, which by its very nature requires a free and frank exchange of views, and where bruised sensibilities may be the price exacted for industrial peace. As the Board noted, a grievance proceeding is not an audience, conditionally granted by a master to his servants, but a meeting of equals \u2014 advocates of their respective positions. Manly was not assailed with abuse on the floor of the plant where he stood as a symbol of the Company\u2019s authority; the eharacteri-zation of the untruth came while he was appearing as a Company advocate during a closed meeting with Union representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-11\">Quoting its decision in Bettcher Manufacturing,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> the Board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-12\">A frank, and not always complimentary, exchange of views must be expected and permitted the negotiators if collective bargaining is to be natural rather than stilted. The negotiators must be free not only to put forth demands and counterdemands, but also to debate and challenge the statements of one another without censorship, <em>even if, in the course of debate, the veracity of one of the participants occasionally is brought into question. </em>If an employer were free to discharge an individual employee because he resented a statement made by the employee during a bargaining conference, either one of two undesirable results would follow: collective bargaining would cease to be between equals (an employee having no parallel method of retaliation), or employees would hesitate ever to participate personally in bargaining negotiations, leaving such matters entirely to their representatives.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-14\">We seek neither to rank improprieties or epithets, nor to unnecessarily generalize for a class of cases peculiarly tied to their facts. However, within the confines of a grievance meeting, it would require severe conduct indeed to convince us that the interests of fair give and take between equal parties to bargaining could be justifiably submerged.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-15\">For the reasons set out above, the order of the Board is enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b785-10\">. 29 U.S.O. \u00a7 158(a) (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b785-11\">. Tlie refinery, at tlie time was engaged in a shut down of operations for major maintenance, called a \u201cturnaround.\u201d The refinery normally operates around-the-clock, and the maintenance personnel, including Harris, were scheduled to work a ten-liour, extended day during the \u201cturnaround\u201d period to get the refinery back in operation as soon as possible. It appears that the other maintenance personnel had been working the extended schedule for several weeks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b785-12\">. The range of impropriety disclosed by the different versions is not so great as to affect the disposition of the case.

Great Dane Trailers, Inc., 388 U.S. 26, 87 S.Ct. 1792, 18 L.Ed.2d 1027 (1967). <em>See </em>Christensen &amp; Svanoe, Motive and Intent in the Commission of Unfair Labor Practices: The Supreme Court and the Fictive Formality, 77 Yale L.J. 1269 (1968). In N.L.R.B. v. Great Dane Trailers, Inc., 388 U.S. 26, 34, 87 S.Ct. 1792, 1798 (1967), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-22\">First, if it can reasonably be concluded that the employer\u2019s discriminatory conduct was \u201cinherently destructive\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>important employee rights, no proof of an antiunion motivation is needed and the Board can find an unfair labor practice even if the employer introduces evidence that the conduct was motivated by business considerations. Second, if the adverse effect of the discriminatory conduct on employee rights is \u201ccomparatively slight,\u201d an antiunion motivation must be proved to sustain the charge <em>if </em>the employer has come forward with evidence of legitimate and substantial business justifications for the conduct. Thus, in either situation, once it has been proved that the employer engaged in discriminatory conduct which could have adversely affected employee rights to <em>some </em>extent, the burden is on the employer to establish that he was motivated by legitimate objectives since proof of motivation is most accessible to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">However, reliance by the Company on this principle to establish a need for proof of motive in an 8(a) (1) situation is misplaced. The <em>Great Dane </em>Court, while considering an alleged violation of both sections, expressly stated, \u201cThe unfair labor practice charged here is grounded primarily in \u00a7 8(a) (3) which requires specifically that the Board find a discrimination and a resulting discouragement of union membership. * * * [T]he finding of a violation normally turns on whether the discriminatory conduct was motivated by an antiunion purpose.\u201d 388 U.S. at 32, 33, 87 S.Ct. at 1796, 1797.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b788-9\">. 380 U.S. at 269, 85 S.Ct. at 999.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b788-10\">.

The relationship of Section 8(a) (3) to the broader mandate of Section 8(a) (1) is made dependent [by <em>Darlington, Brown </em>and <em>American Ship Bldg.] </em>upon the simplistic and highly subjective standard of those management and union actions which are \u201cpeculiarly\u201d essential to the running of the enterprise. If the Board \u2014 or eventually the Court \u2014 senses that a particular action involves the life of the enterprise deeply enough, motivation \u2014 together with the remaining requirements of Section 8(a) (3) \u2014 becomes a determinative factor as to the legality of that act. No guides are suggested for the approach taken to this enormously complex problem. * * <em>* </em>Christensen &amp; Svanoe, <em>supra </em>note 11, at 1307.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b788-18\">. From the Court\u2019s discussion of Section 8(a) (1) in <em>Brown </em>and <em>American Ship Bldg., </em>it does not appear that it considered an independent violation of 8(a) (1) to be possible in either case. In <em>Brown </em>the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-19\">Continued operations with the use of temporary replacements may result in the failure of the whipsaw strike, but this does not mean that the employer\u2019s conduct is demonstrably so destructive of employee rights and so devoid of significant service to any legitimate business end that it cannot be tolerated consistently with the Act. 380 U.S. at 286, 85 S.Ct. at 985.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-21\">In <em>American Ship Bldg., </em>the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-22\">[W]e cannot see that the employer\u2019s use of a lockout solely in support of a legitimate bargaining position is in any way inconsistent with either the right to bargain collectively or with the right to strike. 380 U.S. at 310, 85 S.Ct. at 963.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-23\">These decisions have been attributed to the Court\u2019s view that the Board, in determining available employer weapons, defeated the <em>free </em>collective bargaining envisioned by the Act.
