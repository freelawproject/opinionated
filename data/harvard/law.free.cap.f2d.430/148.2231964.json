The jury found appellants guilty of travelling from Chicago, Illinois, to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with intent to extort $2000 from Steve Latson in violation of Ch. 38 of the Illinois Revised Statutes, 16-1. The gist of the offense was that the appellants would refrain from having Latson\u2019s \u201cHollywood Restaurant\u201d in Chicago bombed and burned on payment of the money. On this appeal appellants raise various questions;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> however, we have concluded that none have merit and affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">We will first describe the parties involved. The principal witness and the victim of the extortionate conduct is Steve Latson who owns the Hollywood Restaurant in Chicago. Appellant Arthur Panagiotopoulos, also known as Panos, is the owner of the Forest Glen Restauarant in Chicago and was for 6 Vi\u00bb years a partner of Latson in the restaurant business. Appellant Christ Pana-giotopoulos is a brother of Arthur and owns the Medium Rare Steak House in Milwaukee. Appellant Peter Karigian-nis owns Pete\u2019s Snack Shop in Chicago.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-15\">The facts are bizarre. Christ Panos called Latson, who was in Chicago, by telephone from Milwaukee. He told him that he was Arthur Panos\u2019 brother and Latson\u2019s friend; that Latson\u2019s life was in danger; that his Hollywood Restaurant was going to be blown to pieces before ten o\u2019clock that night unless he came to his restaurant in Milwaukee by six p. m.; and that Latson had something to do with burning down a competing restaurant in Chicago, known as Mitchell\u2019s, some time previously. Latson told Christ that he could not come because he had no one to take care of his restaurant in his absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-16\">Upon completion of the call, however, Latson called Arthur Panos at his restaurant in Chicago. He told Arthur of his brother\u2019s call, adding: \u201cthey think, you know, that I had something to do with the bombing of Mitchell\u2019s place.\u201d Arthur then told Latson that he had heard something about it in Milwaukee the week previous but did not believe it. He said he would call his brother in Milwaukee and find out \u201cwhat it is all about.\u201d Later Arthur called Latson back and advised that he had called his brother, Christ, and \u201cyou had better get ready, we are going to go up there.\u201d Latson replied that \u201che was afraid, I can\u2019t go up there and I don\u2019t have anybody to leave here.\u201d Arthur then told Latson: \u201cIf you are not going to go that is your job. I am going to come over and if you desire to go there we will go together.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>About 4:30 on the same day, Arthur Panos came by Latson\u2019s restaurant and they drove to Christ Panos\u2019 restaurant in Milwaukee. Conversations then took place between Latson, the Panos brothers and Peter Karigiannis, during which Karigiannis accused Latson of having had Mitchell\u2019s restaurant bombed and burned; that Mitchell\u2019s owner had offered \u201cthem\u201d $7000 to bomb and burn Latson\u2019s place. The first demand of Peter was for $7000 which later was reduced to $5000 and finally the $2000 payment was agreed upon to prevent the destruction of the restaurant. The money was to be paid to Peter Karigiannis on the following Friday at Arthur Pan-os\u2019 restaurant in Chicago. Nine agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation carried on a surveillance of the restaurant and surroundings before, during and after this meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">After the meeting Arthur Panos and Latson returned to Chicago. On the following day Latson obtained the $2000 from a bank and took it to the FBI where it was identified, marked and placed in a white envelope for delivery by Latson to Peter on the next day. The payment was made on schedule and Peter was arrested by the agents, who were on hand at the time and seized the envelope before it was opened.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The Panos brothers are represented by separate counsel and raise different questions from those raised by Peter Karigiannis. However, we shall consider the questions as if raised together:</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">1. At the outset appellants contend that Illinois does not have a statute prohibiting extortion. It is true that Chapter 38, \u00a7 16-1<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is written in terms of \u201ctheft\u201d which is committed where one (c) obtains by threat control over property of the owner. But the Supreme Court, through Chief Justice Warren, has foreclosed appellants\u2019 claim. In United States v. Nardello, 393 U.S. 286, 89 S.Ct. 534, 21 L.Ed.2d 487 (1969), the Chief Justice laid down the test under \u00a7 1952 to be \u201cwhether the particular State involved prohibits the extortionate activity charged.\u201d At 295, 89 S.Ct. at 539. The Congress, the Court held, did not intend to restrict the coverage of the \u201cTravel Act\u201d by defining extortion with reference to state labels. It is sufficient if the act complained of is \u201cprohibited by state law which would be generically classified as extortion * * * \u201d, at 290, 89 S.Ct. at 536, and, therefore, encompassed in \u00a7 1952. We hold that Illinois Ch. 38, \u00a7 16-1 is such a law. Also see United States v. Hughes, 411 F.2d 461 (2d Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-13\">2. It is further claimed that the indictment is insufficient because it failed to distinguish the unlawful extortion as being either a felony or a misdemeanor. However, the gravamen of a charge under \u00a7 1952 is the violation of federal law and \u201c[rjeference to state law is necessary only to identify the type of unlawful activity in which the defendants intended to engage.\u201d United States v. Rizzo, 418 F.2d 71, 74 (7th Cir. 1969). The offense, as the court pointed out, \u201cis the use of an interstate facility, with intent to promote or further an unlawful activity in violation of state law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, the court held that proof that a state law had actually been violated was not a necessary element of the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 80. Appellants confuse the offense with those where the value of the property stolen is an essential element of the crime, a requirement not necessary here since the amount of money involved is irrelevant. Cf. United States v. Pearce, 275 F.2d 318, 324 (7th Cir. 1960), and United States v. Gordon, 253 F.2d 177 (7th Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-14\">3. Appellant Arthur Panos urges that the evidence against him was insufficient to support his conviction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>He did not testify at the trial; however, he made sworn statements to Special Agents of the FBI- which were before the jury. On careful review of all of the evidence considered in a light more favorable to the government, United States v. Pinna, 229 F.2d 216 (7th Cir. 1956), we have concluded that it was sufficient. The evidence against Arthur was largely circumstantial and created credibility problems for the jury to resolve. It believed the government\u2019s witnesses. Questions of credibility have no bearing on the insufficiency of the evidence as a whole. United States v. Wroblewski, 105 F.2d 444, 449 (7th Cir. 1939), and are not for the reviewing court\u2019s decision. Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); United States v. Miles, 401 F.2d 65 (7th Cir. 1968); United States v. Coduto, 284 F.2d 464, 466 (7th Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">In addition to the evidence heretofore related, other testimony involved Arthur Panos directly in the extortion plot. It was he to whom Christ Panos referred on his initial call to Latson that initiated the extortion conference; it was- he who suggested and arranged that Latson go with him to Milwaukee to the conference; once there and in the presence of his brother and Peter Karigiannis, it was he who heard threats made again and again to Latson; however, he never objected but on the contrary when Peter demanded $5000, Arthur said, \u201cI know Steve for a long time, he was my partner. He might not have <em>that </em>kind of money now. * * * \u201d; it was he who alarmed Latson while the conference was going on by saying to him privately, <em>\u201cIt they </em>ask you to go in any other room, don\u2019t go. Stay over here where I can see you because I don\u2019t know what is going to happen to you\u201d; it was he who suggested to Latson that if the latter was afraid to tell Peter Karigiannis whose business he (Latson) wanted blown up that Latson should give him, Arthur Panos, the name; and, on the return trip to Chicago after the conference it was he who told Latson he had better do what he was told [pay the $2000]. Finally, it was he who called long distance to his brother Christ in Milwaukee just 13 minutes after Peter Karigiannis was arrested at his premises. And we note also that he had no objection to the extortion money being paid over at his restaurant. It is for the jury, not for us, to weigh this testimony along with that of the Agents of the Bureau that Arthur Panos told them four different versions of the extortion plot. False exculpatory statements may, of course, be considered by the jury in determining guilt, Wilson v. United States, 162 U.S. 613, 620-621, 16 S.Ct. 895, 40 L.Ed. 1090 (1896); United States v. Riso, 405 F.2d 134 (7th Cir. 1968). He first stated that at no time was he informed by Lat-son of any threat; he could not recall any of the conversations between his brother Christ, Peter Karigiannis, Lat-son and himself at the Medium Eare Steak House in Milwaukee; however, he did recall that no threats were made to Latson; and, finally, though he was aware of the $2000 payment, he was unaware of why it was being paid. Again and again the record repeats exclamations by the Panos brothers that Latson is \u201cour friend * * * my brother\u2019s ex-partner * * * my partner * * * I know for a long time\u201d; still they failed him completely. Indeed, both contributed much to the effectuation of the plot. The record speaks out beyond a reasonable doubt to this effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">4. The remainder of the points raised go to alleged prejudicial remarks by the prosecutor or the judge and the admissibility of evidence. As to the former in some instances no objection was made at the time; in others the court struck out the statements and instructed the jury not to consider them. In any event we find no statements of such a prejudicial nature that would require a new trial. As to the evidence question, appellants claim error over the refusal of the court to admit into evidence a letter from the Commercial Bank of Chicago to Peter Karigiannis summarizing his loan record with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>bank. Obviously, the letter was not the best evidence to prove that Peter had at one-time borrowed $2100 from the bank. United States v. Ross, 321 F.2d 61, 70 (2d Cir. 1963). The original records should have been offered. Indeed, the judge told counsel that he was \u201cat liberty to bring in the books of record if you wish to do so.\u201d Strangely, counsel claimed this remark was an invitation to produce and, therefore, prejudicial. To us it merely indicated the proper approach the appellant might have taken. In any event the defense that the $2000 extortion payment was in fact the repayment of an earlier loan to Latson was before the jury in other evidence and was rejected by it. Nor do we find appellants\u2019 challenges of error to the admissibility of certain rebuttal evidence to have merit and they are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">The judgement is</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b209-10\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952 provides: (a) whoever travels in interstate commerce with intent to commit any crime of violence (2) to further any unlawful activity shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">(b) As used in this section \u201cunlawful activity\u201d means \u201c(2) extortion * * * in violation of the laws of the State in which committed or of the United States.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AzC\">.
