While obtaining his education, he was classified II-S (student deferment), and upon graduation and while serving as an intern, he was classified II-A (occupational deferment). In September 1967, while still II-A, he wrote to the local board stating his conscientious objection to war and requesting the appropriate forms. He filed an application for a IO (conscientious objector) classification and appeared before the local board. Finding that Fein did not qualify for a 1-0 \u201cat that time,\u201d the board retained him in his II-A status. In February 1968 he was classified I-A by the local board, but following a personal appearance on May 22, 1968, that board found that he qualified as a conscientious objector and classified him I-O.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-14\">About two weeks later, this classification was appealed to the state appeal board by the State Director of Selective Service. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1626.1 (1951). Appellant sought from both the local and appeal boards a statement of reasons for the appeal, notification of the standards to be applied on appeal, advice as to whether additional information outside his file was to be presented, and an opportunity to rebut findings by the appeal board as to the appropriateness of his classification. He received no pertinent response before the decision of the appeal board was rendered. On June 20, 1968, the appeal board, by a vote of 4-0, reversed the local board and reinstated appellant in class I-A. It gave no reason for that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-15\">On September 16, 1968, the National Selective Service Director, at Fein\u2019s request (no right of appeal by the registrant being available from an unanimous vote of the appeal board, 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1627.3 (1967)), appealed the decision to the Presidential Appeal Board. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1627.1(a) (1948). Meanwhile, on October 31, 1968, the state director wrote to Fein stating that in his opinion Fein did not qualify as a conscientious objector and that his decision to appeal the local board\u2019s 1-0 classification was based on information in Fein\u2019s selective service file. On November 26, 1968, the Presidential Board, without a statement of reasons, upheld the appeal board.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>The appellant then brought this action in the district court seeking an injunction against his induction into the armed forces and a judgment that his reclassification from 1-0 to I-A was null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Jurisdiction was predicated on 28 U. S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1343, 1361, 1391 and 2201, and on an allegation that the matter in controversy exceeded the value of $10,-000 exclusive of interest and costs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The plaintiff claimed that his reclassification from 1-0 to I-A violated his fifth amendment right to due process in that the regulations contained no provisions requiring notice to the registrant of the reasons for appeal by the State Selective Service Director, nor for a statement of the bases of decision by the respective appeal boards and did not provide for an opportunity to present evidence to rebut the state director\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Deciding that pre-induction judicial review of the plaintiff\u2019s classification was explicitly barred by 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 460(b) (3) (\u00a7 10(b) (3) of the Selective Service Act of 1967), Judge Tyler in a well-considered opinion denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Congress amended \u00a7 10(b) (3) in 1967 to add an explicit bar to judicial review</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">\u201cof the classification or processing of any registrant by local boards, appeal boards, or the President, except as a defense to a criminal prosecution * * * after the registrant has responded either affirmatively or negatively to an order to report for induction. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">in answer to Wolff v. Selective Serv. Bd., 372 F.2d 817 (2d Cir. 1967), which had permitted pre-induction judicial review of local board reclassifica-tions of two II-S registrants into class I-A because of their participation in a demonstration protesting American involvement in Vietnam. Within a year after the amendment, a challenge to its scope reached the Supreme Court in Oestereich v. Selective Serv. Bd., 393 U.S. 233, 89 S.Ct. 414, 21 L.Ed.2d 402 (1968). Oestereich was a divinity student admittedly entitled to a statutory exemption from military service under \u00a7 6(g) of the Act, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(g) (1967). His draft board declared that he was a delinquent and simultaneously reclassified him as I-A for having turned in his draft card in protest to American participation in the Vietnam war. Finding that the board had acted in a \u201cblatantly lawless manner\u201d by depriving him of his \u201cstatutory right\u201d to an exemption, <em>id. </em>at 238-39, 89 S.Ct. 414, the Court held that to read the amendment literally to deny pre-in-duction review in such a case would be \u201cto construe the Act with unnecessary harshness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238, 89 S.Ct. at 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-13\">Having departed to that extent from a literal reading of \u00a7 10(b) (3),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Court undertook to elaborate its Oester-eich holding through its opinion in Clark v. Gabriel, 393 U.S. 256, 89 S.Ct. 424, 21 L.Ed.2d 418 (1968), decided the same day. Clark v. Gabriel held that \u00a7 10(b) (3) of the Act barred prein-duction review of the denial of a claim to classification as a conscientious objector. The Court explained <em>Oestereich </em>as a case where the board action was \u201cwithout statutory basis and in conflict with petitioner\u2019s rights explicitly established by the statute and not dependent upon an act of judgment by the Board. Oestereich, as a divinity student, was by statute unconditionally entitled to exemption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258, 89 S.Ct. at 426. Sharply distinguishing that situation<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from the one before it, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">\u201cHere, by contrast, there is no doubt of the Board\u2019s statutory authority to take action which appellee challenges, and that action inescapably involves a determination of fact and an exercise of judgment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">And, to avoid any risk of being misunderstood, Mr. Justice Douglas, who wrote for the majority in <em>Oestereich, </em>concurred in <em>Gabriel, </em>and after noting some hypothetical examples of lawless board action, went on to say: \u201c[I]t takes the extreme case where the Board can be said to flout the law, as it did in Oestereich [393 U.S. at 233, 89 S.Ct. 414], to warrant pre-induction review of its actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 260, 89 S.Ct. at 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-13\">These two decisions by the Court convincingly dispel the notion that pre-in-duction review may be obtained simply by framing issues in terms of purely legal questions divorced from their factual context,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a tour de force attempted by the appellant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-14\">The limitation of pre-induction review to cases of \u201cblatantly lawless\u201d action by the board gained further confirmation in Boyd v. Clark, 393 U.S. 316, 89 S.Ct. 553, 21 L.Ed.2d 511 (1969), which affirmed a denial of pre-induction review to registrants classified I-A, in a one-sentence per curiam opinion: \u201cThe judgment is affirmed, Clark v. Gabriel [393 U.S. at 256, 89 S.Ct. 424], without reaching the jurisdictional question raised under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.\u201d In <em>Boyd, </em>the plaintiffs challenged their classification on several legal grounds without in any way contesting the discretionary or fact-finding aspects of the local board\u2019s decision to classify them I-A. <em>See </em>opinion below, Boyd v. Clark, 287 F.Supp. 561 (S.D.N.Y.1968). Indeed, among the constitutional claims asserted in <em>Boyd </em>were some which had a source in common with those asserted by the appellant here: the due process clause of the fifth amendment. See Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-16\">Although the law of new cases may never be open and shut,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>been furnished with sufficient guidance to hold that an appeal board does not flout the law in a blatantly lawless manner merely because the President has not provided certain procedural safeguards to govern the Selective Service System\u2019s administrative tribunals in determining whether a registrant is a genuine conscientious objector not \u201csubject\u201d to combatant training or service under \u00a7 6(j) of the Act, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(j) (1967). See Falbo v. United States, 320 U.S. 549, 554, 64 S.Ct. 346, 88 L.Ed. 305 (1944). Cf. Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 66 S.Ct. 423, 90 L.Ed. 567 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The appellant had no clear statutory right to a 1-0 classification. Allegations of constitutional infirmities in the classification procedures did not bring this case within any exception to the bar of \u00a7 10(b) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Accordingly, the order of Judge Tyler dismissing the complaint is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b438-9\">. The Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the jurisdictional basis for an action by a selective service registrant seeking pre-induction review of his classification, although it has entertained several such cases on the merits. Oestereich v. Selective Serv. Bd., 393 U.S. 233, 239, 89 S.Ct. 414, 21 L.Ed.2d 402 (1968) (where the remand stated in part: \u201cpetitioner must have the opportunity * * * to demonstrate that he meets the jurisdictional requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\u201d) ; Clark v. Gabriel, 393 U.S. 256, 259, 89 S.Ct. 424, 21 L.Ed.2d 418 (1968) (where the Court granted leave to proceed <em>in, forma pauperis) </em>; Boyd v. Clark, 393 U.S. 316, 89 S.Ct. 553, 21 L.Ed.2d 511 (1969) (affirming 287 Fd.Supp. 561 (S.D.N.Y.1968) \u201cwithout reaching the jurisdictional question raised under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\u201d). Peremptory dismissal is seldom ordered unless it appears to a legal certainty that the claim is for less than the jurisdictional amount. St. Paul Mercury Indemn. Co. v. Red Cab Co., 303 U.S. 283, 290, 59 S.Ct. 586, 82 L.Ed. 845 (1938). In this case, the court below did not reach the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b438-16\">. The Court in <em>Oestereich </em>also noted that while \u00a7 10(b) (3) on its face purports \u201cto suspend the writ of habeas corpus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>as a vehicle for reviewing a criminal conviction under the Act, everyone agrees that such was not its intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238, 89 S.Ct. at 416.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b439-9\">. Breen v. Selective Serv. Local Bd., 396 U.S. 460, 90 S.Ct. 661, 24 L.Ed.2d 653 (1970), was held indistinguishable from <em>Oestereich. </em>The Court found that because there was no lawful basis for the use of delinquency regulations in that case to warrant the revocation of a statutorily mandated student deferment, \u00a7 10(b) (3) did not preclude pre-induction review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b439-10\">. The government\u2019s Jurisdictional Statement in <em>Gabriel </em>shows that Gabriel raised several constitutional issues which could have been passed on without inquiry into findings of fact or exercise of discretion by the local board. See Breen v. Selective Serv. Local Bd., 406 F.2d 636, 639 (2d Cir. 1969), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 396 U.S. 460, 90 S.Ct. 661, 24 L.Ed.2d 653 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b439-18\">. The view that \u00a7 10(b) (3)\u2019s proscription against pre-induction review imposes such a risk of severe penalty as to \u201craise serious constitutional problems\u201d in challenges to the administrative procedure of classification itself without accompanying challenges to matters within the local board\u2019s discretion was suggested by Mr. Justice Harlan in his concurring opinion in <em>Oestereich, </em>393 U.S. at 243, 89 S.Ct. 414, as a basis for a broader holding than that adopted by the majority of the Court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>That view was implicitly rejected without discussion in Boyd v. Clark, 393 U.S. at 316, 89 S.Ct. 553.</p>\n<p id=\"aph-dedup-2\">Nor was the majority in <em>Breen </em>yet ready to adopt his view, again expressed by way of a concurring opinion in that case, that pre-induction review should not be limited to cases where there is a deprivation of a clear statutory right to a certain classification. Without reweighing all the values, the present rule does give some recognition to the purpose of Congress to limit pre-induction review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b440-6\">HAYS, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A_7\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"AR7\">I concur in Judge Blumenfeld\u2019s opinion in regard to \u00a7 10(b) (3) but would also rely upon failure to establish the jurisdictional amount under \u00a7 1331 as a ground for affirming the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the action. See Boyd v. Clark, 287 F.Supp. 561 (three judge court) (S.D.N.Y.1968), aff\u2019d on other grounds 393 U.S. 316, 89 S.Ct. 553, 21 L.Ed.2d 511 (1968).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b440-7\">LUMBARD, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A17\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"ArC\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">After lengthy correspondence, two personal interviews, and extensive personal testimonials, Dr. Fein was granted conscientious objector status by his local board. The State Director, without stating any grounds, appealed the classification, and the State Appeal Board reversed and reclassified Fein I-A. The State Appeal board gave no reasons for its decision, it did not permit Fein to submit a statement in support of his classification, and it may not even have relied solely on information in the file. In this suit to enjoin his induction Fein argues that such treatment does not meet minimum standards of due process, as developed by the federal courts over the last three decades. See, e. g., Morgan v. United States, 304 U.S. 1, 18, 58 S.Ct. 999, 82 L.Ed. 1129 (1938). I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">The majority, however, holds that, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, Section 10(b) (3) of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 460(b) (3), bars the preinduction review sought by Dr. Fein. I cannot accept my brothers\u2019 readings of the relevant Supreme Court decisions. To me, Fein\u2019s claim is not barred by the literal words of Section 10(b) (3), and I think the exception to that section recognized by the court in Oestereich v. Selective Service, 393 U.S. 233, 89 S.Ct. 414, 21 L.Ed.2d 402 (1968) reaches this case as both here and in <em>Oestereich </em>a presidential regulation must fall to a higher command. I would also hold that the $10,000 jurisdictional amount required by 28 U.S..C. \u00a7 1331 is satisfied by Fein\u2019s allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">I. <em>Section 10(b) (3)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-14\">The language of Section 10(b) (3) prescribes preinduction review \u201cof the classification or processing of any registrant.\u201d Concurring in <em>Oestereich, </em>Mr. Justice Harlan gave a gloss to those words which I accept. He read \u201cclassification or processing\u201d to encompass \u201cthe numerous discretionary, factual, and mixed law-fact determinations which a Selective Service Board must make prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>to issuing an order to report for induction.\u201d 393 U.S. at 240, 89 S.Ct. at 417. At issue in this case, however, are procedural rules governing appeals to the State and Presidential Appeal Boards, and I do not read Section 10(b) (3) as explicitly barring a claim that the procedures involved are invalid under the due process clause. At stake is not a board determination \u201cprocessing or classifying\u201d the registrant, but the procedures underlying the way such determinations are made.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">My brothers argue, however, that this interpretation of Section 10(b) (3) is foreclosed by the opinions of the Court in Oestereich, Breen v. Selective Service Local Board No. 16, 396 U.S. 460, 90 S.Ct. 661, 24 L.Ed.2d 653 (1970), and Clark v. Gabriel, 393 U.S. 256, 89 S.Ct. 424, 21 L.Ed.2d 418 (1968). A reading of these eases leads me to the opposite conclusion, as I find the claim of Board \u201clawlessness\u201d Fein raises to be substantially similar to the situations presented in <em>Oestereich </em>and <em>Breen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Oestereich was enrolled as a divinity student preparing for the ministry when he turned in his draft card to protest the United States\u2019 participation in the war in Vietnam. Shortly thereafter, his local board declared him delinquent for failure to have his registration certificate in his possession and to keep the board informed of his local status. The Board then reclassified him I-A and, after an unsuccessful appeal, he was ordered to report. At that point, he brought suit to restrain his induction. <em>Breen </em>is quite similar, save that the petitioner was a college student with a IIS deferment when he was declared delinquent and reclassified I-A.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">In <em>Oestereich, </em>the Court framed the question presented as whether Section 10(b) (3) barred a preinduetion challenge to a reclassification based on the delinquency regulation. The Court held, first, that as there was no statutory authorization for the Board to revoke the statutorily-based ministerial exemption, its action was \u201cbasically lawless\u201d; second, that Section 10(b) (3)\u2019s restriction on preinduction review cannot, if it be constitutional, be read literally as a literal reading would command that the writ of habeas corpus be suspended; and third, that an exception must be implied to permit review of board actions which revoke a statutory right on the basis of a power conferred only by Selective Service regulations. <em>Breen </em>follows <em>Oestereich </em>closely, the only difference being that <em>Breen </em>had a statutory deferment rather than an exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">Clark v. Gabriel, 393 U.S. 256, 89 S.Ct. 424, 21 L.Ed.2d 418 (1968), decided the same day as <em>Oestereich, </em>confirmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Mr. Justice Douglas\u2019 statement in <em>Oes-tereich </em>that \u201c[o]ur construction leaves \u00a7 10(b) (3) unimpaired in the normal operations of the Act.\u201d 393 U.S. at 238, 89 S.Ct. at 416. Gabriel sought preinduction review of the board\u2019s refusal to grant him conscientious objector status. In holding that Section 10(b) (3) barred the suit, the court per curiam in a unanimous opinion explained <em>Oester-eich :</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">\u201cIn <em>Oestereich </em>the delinquency procedure by which the registrant was reclassified was without statutory basis and in conflict with petitioner\u2019s rights explicitly established by the statute and not dependent upon an act of judgment by the Board. Oester-eich, as a divinity student, was by statute unconditionally entitled to exemption. Here, by contrast, there is no doubt of the Board\u2019s statutory authority to take action which appel-lee challenges, and that action inescapably involves a determination of fact and an exercise of judgment. By statute, classification as a conscientious objector is expressly conditioned on the registrant\u2019s claim being \u2018sustained by the local board.\u2019 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(j) (1964 ed., Supp. III).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ary-dedup-0\">393 U.S. at 258, 89 S.Ct. at 426. To me, Fein\u2019s claim falls squarely within the <em>Oestereich </em>exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">In <em>Oestereich, Breen </em>and this case, the registrant challenges a procedure unauthorized by statute, while claiming that the regulation deprives him of a right based on higher authority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The difference, which I do not deem significant, is that in <em>Oestereich </em>the conflict posed was between a board regulation \u2014 the delinquency provision \u2014 and a statutory command, the ministerial exemption. Here, the regulation establishing appellate procedures arguably conflicts with the due process clause of the Constitution, surely an a fortiori ease for preinduction review. In neither <em>Oestereich, Breen, </em>nor this case are there any discretionary determinations of the system involved, nor are there any factual inquiries required. See Bucher v. Selective Service System, 421 F.2d 24, 27 (3 Cir. 1970) (\u201cThe Section bars pre-induction judicial review only where there is a challenge to the System\u2019s resolution of factual questions in the classification or processing of a draft registrant\u201d). In all these cases, the System acted in reliance on a purportedly valid regulation, in such a way as to deny the registrant a firmly established right. Since I would find that the <em>Oestereich </em>exception reaches Fein\u2019s case, I would hold it not barred by Section 10(b) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">If the <em>Oestereich </em>exception is to be read narrowly, so as to turn \u201con the certainty with which the reviewing court can determine that the registrant would prevail on the merits if there were such judicial review of his classification,\u201d Breen v. Selective Service Local Bd., 396 U.S. 460, 468, 90 S.Ct. 661, 666, 24 L.Ed.2d 653 (1970) (Harlan, J\u201e concurring), I would recognize a third exception into the section. This exception would permit preinduction review of claims, such as Fein\u2019s, that \u201cthe very statutes or Regulations which the Board administers are facially invalid.\u201d Oestereich v. Selective Service System, 393 U.S. at 240, 89 S.Ct. at 418, 21 L.Ed.2d 402 (Harlan, J., concurring). In <em>Oestereich </em>the court showed itself willing creatively to construe Section 10(b) (3); I think that the facts of this case require another exercise of construction here.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">I do not believe that Congress, even if it so intended, could by a provision such as Section 10(b) (3) deprive the federal courts of their power to hear allegations that a governmental agency has denied a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>citizen procedural due process before the registrant is in custody. See 393 U.S. at 243 n. 6, 89 S.Ct. 414. My reading of the section and of its legislative history convinces me that Congress had no such intention. Of course, it is our duty to construe federal statutes, wherever possible, to sustain their constitutionality.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> So, faced with the alternatives of a difficult inquiry into the section\u2019s constitutionality or a saving construction consistent with Congress\u2019 intent and the statute\u2019s clear wording, I would recognize another exception to the section to permit claims that an authorizing statute or board regulation is invalid because it is contrary to the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">My brothers, however, would read the Supreme Court\u2019s one sentence, per curiam affirmance in Boyd v. Clark, 393 U.S. 316, 89 S.Ct. 553, 21 L.Ed.2d 511(1969), on the basis of Clark v. Gabriel, to foreclose this exception. In my view, <em>Boyd </em>is completely distinguishable. The petitioners in <em>Boyd, </em>four college-age youths who alleged they could not afford to attend college, sought to challenge the constitutionality of student deferments on equal protection and due process grounds. Without reaching the effects of Section 10(b) (3), the three-judge district court dismissed on the ground that the case was not ripe for adjudication since none of the petitioners had yet been called for induction. 287 F.Supp. 561 (S.D.N.Y.1968).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The reasons for the rule are sound. Since the registrant may never be called, the rule serves to protect the system \u201cfrom becoming entangled in litigation which may prove unnecessary.\u201d Boyd v. Clark, 287 F.Supp. at 564. Although this rule predates Section 10(b) (3), Congress obviously intended that it be codified therein. See Senate Rep. No. 209, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967), 1967 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1308; National Student Ass\u2019n v. Hershey, 134 U.S.App.D.C. 56, 412 F.2d 1103, 1107 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-14\">In terms of Clark v. Gabriel petitioners in <em>Boyd </em>stood vis-a-vis their local boards in an unsettled position, as their boards might have to make several discretionary decisions, involving \u201ca determination of fact and an exercise of judgment,\u201d Clark v. Gabriel, 393 U.S. at 258, 89 S.Ct. at 426, before issuing orders to report. For example, the Board might be asked to consider new requests for exemptions or deferments, which of course involve discretion. Even determining the order of call is heavily tinged with discretion, as the local board has extensive powers to alter the order as between registrants with I-A status. See 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1631.7, 1632.2; United States v. Weintraub, 429 F.2d 658 (2d Cir., June 23, 1970); Green v. Local Board No. 87, 419 F.2d 813 (8th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-15\">In affirming <em>Boyd </em>on the basis of Clark v. Gabriel, it seems to me that the court looked not to the nature of the issue presented \u2014 which, like Fein\u2019s claim, was solely a question of law based on a constitutional challenge \u2014 but to the fact that petitioners there had not reached a position of finality within the system. To allow suits before a notice of induction is received would create exactly the sort of \u201c \u2018litigious interruptions of procedures to provide necessary military manpower\u2019 which Congress sought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>prevent when it enacted \u00a7 10(b) (3),\u201d Clark v. Gabriel, 393 U.S. 256 at 258, 89 S.Ct. at 426 (quoting Sen. Russell). As Fein has been ordered to report, Boyd v. Clark has no relevance to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">II. <em>Jurisdictional Amount</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Having found that Fein\u2019s action was barred by Section 10(b) (3), neither Judge Blumenfeld nor the district court reached the question of whether Fein\u2019s allegation that more than $10,000 was in controversy in the present action satisfied the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (1964). My brother Hays, however, advances jurisdictional amount as a second ground for affirming the judgment below, and with this I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Judge Hays, arguing from the position he expressed in his opinion in Boyd v. Clark, 287 F.Supp. 561 (S.D.N.Y. 1968), begins with the proposition that the amount in controversy must be reasonably capable of monetary valuation. He then would find the jurisdictional amount here unsatisfied even though Fein was never allowed to prove his allegation, so his second proposition must be that because the value of the rights denied is inherently incapable of valuation, a registrant can never satisfy Section 1331. Any such per se rule, however, has recently been rejected by this court. In Berk v. Laird, 429 F.2d 302 (1970), we held that a soldier who alleges that he is being unconstitutionally ordered into a war zone has met the requirements of Section 1331, since the allegedly unconstitutional action of the government might lead directly to his suffering serious injury or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\"><em>Berk </em>demonstrates that when traversing a jurisdictional allegation, the defendant has a heavy burden. Moreover, the Supreme Court has made it clear that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">\u201cThe rule governing dismissal for want of jurisdiction in cases brought in the federal court is that, unless the law gives a different rule, the sum claimed by the plaintiff controls if the claim is apparently made in good faith. It must appear to a legal certainty that the claim is really for less than the jurisdictional amount to justify dismissal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co., 303 U.S. 283, 288, 58 S.Ct. 586, 82 L.Ed. 845 (1938). Although Fein seeks an injunction, not money damages, the same rule applies, with the inquiry looking to \u201cthe value of the right to be protected or the extent of the injury to be prevented.\u201d C. Wright, Federal Courts, \u00a7 34, at 116 (2d ed. 1970). For all that appears at this stage, Fein\u2019s allegation may rest on a good faith belief that service will result in monetary loss: he may be deprived of several years lucrative private practice or an opportunity for further, specialized training which will permit him to earn more later in his career. In the absence of bad faith or a legal certainty that the allegation is groundless, we must credit the claim. Fein certainly made his allegation in good faith, and in light of Berk v. Laird it cannot be said that as a \u201clegal certainty\u201d the dollar value of what he will lose if illegally drafted is not at least $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">Further, I think that we are required to give the most liberal possible readings to jurisdictional allegations in cases such as this. See Murray v. Vaughn, 300 F.Supp. 688, 694 (D.R.I.1969) ; Moy-lan v. Laird, 305 F.Supp. 551, 553 (D.R.I. 1969); Walsh v. Local Board No. 10, 305 F.Supp. 1274, 1276 (S.D.N.Y.1969). For if the $10,000 requirement of Section 1331 closes the doors of the federal courts, petitioners complaining of unconstitutional acts by the Selective Service System will have nowhere to go for relief. Mandamus under Section 1361 is rarely available,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Selective Service System itself has neither the competence nor the power to pass on the constitutionality of procedures mandated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>presidential regulations, and in this context, the concurrent jurisdiction of state courts is highly questionable. See Comment, Draft Reclassifications for Political Demonstrators \u2014 Jurisdictional Amounts in Suits Against Federal Officers, 53 Corn.L.Q. 916, 926-929 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Since Fein clearly can sustain his jurisdictional allegation, I need not consider the case of a poor man who stands to lose nothing but his most precious personal liberties if the unconstitutional actions of the federal government are beyond the reach of the courts. But if that case ever comes before us, I have grave doubts that the old rule requiring the claimed deprivation be capable of monetary valuation would long endure.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">III. <em>The Merits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Under the regulations, the State Director may appeal any classification of the local board at any time. Section 1626.1. He may attach to his appeal a statement specifying the grounds for his appeal. Section 1626.12.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In reviewing the appeal, the Appeal Board has the following warrant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">In reviewing the appeal and classifying the registrant, the appeal board shall not receive or consider any information other than the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">(1) Information contained in the record received from the local board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">(2) General information concerning economic, industrial, and social conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">Section 1626.24(b). Apparently, it also may consider the information contained in the appellant\u2019s statement. If he deems the matter to be \u201cin the national interest or necessary to avoid an injustice,\u201d the State Director may appeal any determination of the Appeal Board to the Presidential Appeal Board. Section 1627.1.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-12\">\u201cThe person appealing may attach to his appeal a statement specifying the matters in which he believes the board erred, may direct attention to any information in the registrant\u2019s file which he believes the local board has failed to consider or to give sufficient weight, and may set out in full any information which was offered to the local board and which the local board failed or refused to include in the registrant\u2019s file.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-16\">Fein claims these procedures violate due process in that (1) they do not require that the registrant be notified of the reasons for appeal advanced by the State Director; (2) no statement of the reasons for the Appeal Board\u2019s decision is required; and (3) the registrant-ap-pellee is given no chance to. submit evidence, information or arguments to the Appeals Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-17\">Fein\u2019s first claim \u2014 that when the State Director, as appellant, chooses to exercise his right under Section 1626.12 to submit a statement, the registrant must be given a copy and be provided an opportunity by the Appeals Board to offer a rebuttal \u2014 is unquestionably correct. See United States v. Cummins, 425 F.2d 646 (8 Cir. 1970); Wiener v. Local Board No. 4, 302 F.Supp. 266 (D. Del.1969). In Gonzales v. United States, 348 U.S. 407, 75 S.Ct. 409, 99 L.Ed. 467 (1965), the Supreme Court unequivocally stated that at least so much is required by minimum notions of due process. There, the registrant was not shown a Department of Justice recommendation on his request for conscientious objector status.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Reversing his conviction the Court noted: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>348 U.S. at 412, 75 S.Ct. at 412. The State Director's statement on appeal, which may refer to any information on the registrant\u2019s file \u201cwhich [the person appealing] believes the local board has failed to consider or to give sufficient weight,\u201d is indistinguishable from the Justice Department\u2019s recommendation under the formal procedure.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-18\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>[A] registrant [must] be given an opportunity to rebut this recommendation when it comes to the Appeal Board, the agency with the ultimate responsibility for classification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Here, however, the State Director by affidavit stated that he did not exercise his option to append a statement to his notice of appeal; rather his letter to the Appeal Board noted only that in his opinion Dr. Fein did not qualify for 1-0 status and that his opinion was based on information in Fein's file. In this posture, Fein\u2019s argument must be that due process compels the State Director to frame the issues on appeal or, in the alternative, that registrant-appellee be given an opportunity by the Appeal Board to support the local board\u2019s decision. As to the first, the government might convincingly argue that since the Appeal Board hears and decides each case <em>de novo, </em>if the appellant-Director does not choose to frame the issues, the registrant is not at any disadvantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Fein\u2019s alternative contention seems far stronger. Under the regulations, Fein, as appellee, has no right to submit anything in support of the classification below. Certainly, it would be helpful to the Board if the registrant could submit a short statement which marshals the evidence in support of his classification. Fein apparently sought permission to file such a statement with the Appeal Board, but received no response to his inquiry. If the State Director can submit a statement to support his appeal, I think fundamental fairness requires that similarly the registrant-appellee be permitted to be heard in support of the classification he has received.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Fein also argues that the Appeal Board\u2019s practice of refusing to give reasons when reversing a classification favorable to the registrant also violates due process. We have recently held that, at least when the registrant appeals, due process is not violated as long as \u201c[t]here was sufficient evidence in the file for appellant to determine the basis for the denial of his claim.\u201d United States v. Morico, 415 F.2d 138, 139, 143 (2 Cir. 1969), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 399 U.S. 526, 90 S.Ct. 2230, 26 L.Ed.2d 776 (1970). When, however, it is the State Director who appeals, several considerations lead me to conclude that a different standard must obtain.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">First, the Appeal Board is empowered by the regulations to take cognizance of \u201cgeneral information concerning economic, industrial, and social conditions.\u201d Section 1626.24(b). This is an unsual provision, going well beyond the confines of judicial notice. See Preliminary Draft, Proposed Rules of Evidence for the United States District Courts and Magistrates, Rule 2-01 (March 1969).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Further, the registrant is not informed that the Board is in any way depending upon outside information in reaching a decision nor is he given a chance to rebut its accuracy or relevance. Although our review of a draft classification is tightly proscribed to \u201cany basis in fact,\" the basis in fact must either be within the four corners of the file, see United States v. Abbott, 425 F.2d 910 (8 Cir., 1970) or the registrant must have been informed of any outside information which is to be considered before the Board decides and given a chance to rebut.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>To my mind, the use of such information should be tightly circumscribed. Not only may this information, gathered from well-neigh any source and unchecked by any sort of rebuttal, be simply wrong, see Nevarez Bengoecha v. Mieheli, 295 F.Supp. 257 (D.P.R.1969), but it might lead to wholly invalid inferences.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To prevent such misinformation, I would require the Appeal Board either to disclose in advance any \u201cgeneral information\u201d it thinks relevant and give the registrant a chance to rebut or else positively to disclaim any such reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Second, I note that several circuits have now adopted a rule requiring that when a registrant establishes a prima facie case for conscientious objector status, the local board and the Appeal Board must state their reasons for denying the request. In United States v. Haughton, 413 F.2d 736 (9 Cir. 1969), the Ninth Circuit in reversing a conviction of a conscientious .objector for failure to report, stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">\u201cInconsistent statements of actions or a finding of insincerity may support the denial of conscientious status. The local board, however, must state the reasons for the denial of a requested classification when a registrant has \u2018met the statutory criteria\u2019 for that classification or * * * has placed himself \u2018prima facie within the statutory exemption.\u2019 Otherwise a court cannot determine whether a board\u2019s denial of a requested classification was based on a belief that the registrant\u2019s statements, even if true, did not entitle him to the classifications, or on the reasonable disbelief of certain allegations necessary to the registrant\u2019s pri-ma facie case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">413 F.2d at 739 (citations omitted). Accord, United States v. Broyles, 423 F. 2d 1299 (4 Cir., March 19, 1970) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">Whether or not the local board must state reasons whenever a prima facie case is established, see Morico v. United States, <em>supra, </em>I think it clear that the Appeal Board must do so when the registrant has been granted 1-0 status below. If in defense to a criminal prosecution for refusal to submit to induction Fein obtain^.}'udicial review of this decision, thye court would be limited to the \u201cany basis in fact\u201d standard. This means that we would search his file to find any rationale which would support the Appeal Board\u2019s decision. In the usual ease, where both bodies have rejected the registrant\u2019s claim, perhaps this approach is adequate; in any case, it is settled law that our review is so limited. But when the local board has found that the registrant is sincere in his beliefs and that his beliefs meet the statutory criteria, I think a search through the file for any rationale to support the Appeal Board is impermissible. Although the Appeal Board is nominally superior to the local board, I cannot see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>that its judgment, without the benefit of an interview with the registrant, is to be preferred unless accompanied by an explanation. If it does not agree with the local board, it must state in what ways it disagrees. Otherwise, reviewing courts \u2014 as both the Fourth and Ninth Circuits have found \u2014 are blind to potential mistakes of law made by the Appeal Board in the difficult area of conscientious objector classifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Thus, when the State Director appeals, due process requires: first, that the registrant be given a copy of any statements the State Director submits on appeal and then be given a chance to respond; second, that the registrant be given the opportunity to submit a statement in support of his classification; third, that the Appeal Board positively disclaim any reliance on \u201cgeneral information\u201d or, if it has so relied, give the registrant ample notice of the information it thinks relevant and a chance to rebut; and fourth, the Appeal Board state the rationale for any decision which reverses the local board.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">I would reverse the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions that the injunction Fein seeks should issue.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b441-6\">. This interpretation of the section is reinforced by its legislative history. In his <em>Oestereich </em>concurrence, Mr. Justice Harlan isolated two major considerations behind Congress\u2019 decision to defer judicial review of decisions involving classification or processing. First, because these determinations are of a highly discretionary nature, judicial review \u2014 although narrow \u2014 still would take considerable time, as often the courts must examine board records, hear testimony, and resolve controversies on a sizeable record. Second, it can be presumed that, with the full opportunity to be heard afforded by the system, a registrant\u2019s board has classified him properly, in accordance with the applicable statutes and regulations. See 393 U.S. at 240-41, 89 S.Ct. 414.</p>\n<p id=\"APe\">These factors, as Mr. Justice Harlan points out, are significantly altered when the registrant challenges a procedure used by the system. This sort of claim does not require the court to review discretionary determinations, so there is no protracted delay; usually, the case can be tried on a stipulated set of facts. Further, there can be no presumption of regularity, since the issues raised are beyond the system\u2019s competence, perhaps even its jurisdiction. On my reading of the legislative history, Congress passed Section 10(b) (3) to meet a specific problem: the vexatious delays caused by preinduction review of certain kinds of claims. See Clark v. Gabriel, 393 U.S. 256, 258-59, 89 S.Ct. 424, 21 L.Ed.2d 418 (1968). Had Congress wanted to prevent all registrants from seeking the aid of the federal courts on any matter involving the Selective Service System before induction, it would have used general language, not a specific prohibition covering only two areas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b442-7\">.

The possibility of this latter sort of error is strong in this case. I note that Fein, in his Selective Service Form 150, stated that while an intern at a highly respected Cleveland hospital, he voluntarily chose to live in the Cleveland ghetto and contributed the very little free time he had to a neighborhood free clinic. The clinic was run by the Students for a Democratic Society. Can any court say with assurance that the Appeal Board may not have seized upon this fact and read it out of context against Fein, under its license to consider \u201cgeneral information about * * * social conditions?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Even if it be assumed that Fein belonged to SDS and that an inference going to the sincerity or content of a conscientious objector claim could be drawn from the fact of active membership, I am certain that the New York State Appeal Board has no knowledge whatsoever of the principles and ideology of an SDS chapter in Cleveland more than four years ago. It goes without saying that before any inferences may be drawn, there would have to be positive proof that these tenets disqualified a subscriber from conscientious objector status, that Fein knew these tenets, and that he affirmatively embraced them.
