In the briefing order, Dixon was warned that this court would not consider issues not specifically raised in his informal brief. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b). Nonetheless, Dixon failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>raise any challenges to the district court\u2019s order in his informal brief and thus has failed to preserve any issues for our review. Accordingly, we are constrained to affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Dixon v. Baltimore City Police Dep't, </em>No. CA-03-1984-AW (D.Md. Oct. 14, 2003). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
