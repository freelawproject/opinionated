Sadler\u2019s attorney filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he asserts there are no meritorious issues for appeal but examines the validity of the district court\u2019s revocation order nevertheless. Sadler has not filed a pro se supplemental brief though notified of his opportunity to do so. For the following reasons, we dismiss both appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-20\">Sadler\u2019s appeal from the magistrate judge\u2019s order directing his pre-revocation detention is moot following his stipulation to several violations of his supervised release and the district court\u2019s imposition of a post-revocation sentence. <em>See United States v. O\u2019Shaughnessy, </em>772 F.2d 112, 113 (5th Cir.1985) (citing <em>Murphy v. Hunt, </em>455 U.S. 478, 481-82, 102 S.Ct. 1181, 71 L.Ed.2d 353 (1982)). Likewise, because Sadler has been unconditionally discharged from custody and because there are no continuing collateral consequences from the district court\u2019s revocation order and sentence, Sadler\u2019s appeal from that order is also moot. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 10, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-21\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore dismiss Sadler\u2019s appeals as moot. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-22\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
