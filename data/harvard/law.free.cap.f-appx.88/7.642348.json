Brown, Sr., and Kenneth D. Stringham (\u201cAppellants\u201d) appeal from the district court\u2019s dismissal, with prejudice, of their action. The Appellants\u2019 motion to strike the appellees\u2019 briefs is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">The Appellants\u2019 complaint, filed in October 2002, asserted claims under federal civil rights statutes as well as supplemental state law claims. After several defendants moved to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the district court determined that the various claims arose no later than 1997 and dismissed the Appellants\u2019 claims as time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-15\">Because the district court determined that the Appellants\u2019 claims were time barred, it was not premature for the district court to dismiss the action without reaching the merits of the claims. <em>See F.D.I.C. v. Dawson, </em>4 F.3d 1303, 1311-12 (5th Cir.1993). The Appellants have not shown that they are entitled to invoke the fraudulent concealment defense to the statute of limitations. <em>See Rotella v. Pederson, </em>144 F.3d 892, 897 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Borderlon v. Peck, </em>661 S.W.2d 907, 908 (Tex.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-16\">Our examination of the record and the Appellants\u2019 brief convinces us that the Appellants pleaded their best case, and accordingly we have determined that the district court did not err in dismissing the action with prejudice. <em>See Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 327 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Bazrowx v. Scott, </em>136 F.3d 1053, 1054 (5th Cir.1998). The Appellants\u2019 argument that it was error for the district court to dismiss the action without requiring a response from all defendants, is, in effect, another attempt to force a consideration of claims that are time-barred, and does not entitle them to relief. <em>See Dawson, </em>4 F.3d at 1311-12. Finally, the Appellants have not shown that the denial of their motion for the appointment of counsel was an abuse of discretion. <em>See Cupit v. Jones, </em>835 F.2d 82, 86 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-17\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b52-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion .should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
