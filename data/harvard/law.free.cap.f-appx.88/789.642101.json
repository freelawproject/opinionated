Logan first argues that the district court improperly enhanced his offense level for possessing a dangerous weapon in connection with the drug trafficking offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-21\">The district court\u2019s decision to apply the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) adjustment is not clearly erroneous as it is not clearly improbable that the firearms were connected with Logan\u2019s drug offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.3); <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>31 F.3d 271, 277-78 (5th Cir. 1994). The testimony showed that at the time of Logan\u2019s arrest, the firearms were located in Logan\u2019s bedroom which was six to eight feet from where Logan was observed. Moreover, at the time of Logan\u2019s arrest, he was found in possession of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-22\">Logan also contends that the district court erred by concluding that his prior convictions for burglary of a motor vehicle were not related for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2). Although Logan asserts that his prior crimes were related for the purpose of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) because they were functionally consolidated, he has failed to make a sufficient showing to over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>come the deference afforded to the district court\u2019s ruling on that issue. <em>See Buford v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 59, 64, 121 S.Ct. 1276, 149 L.Ed.2d 197 (2001). The district court also correctly concluded that his pri- or crimes were not part of a \u201csingle common scheme or plan.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n.3); <em>see also United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 519 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b831-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
