Counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising two issues but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. Johnson was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-21\">Counsel first questions whether the district court erred in calculating the amount of drugs attributable to Johnson. At sentencing, Johnson withdrew his objections to the drug quantity calculation in the presentence report. We therefore review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Osborne, </em>345 F.3d 281, 284 (4th Cir.2003) (discussing standard of review). Because Johnson admitted that he was accountable for more than five but less than twenty grams of crack, without determining a specific amount within that range, we find no plain error in the district court\u2019s determination of the amount of drugs attributable to Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-22\">Counsel next questions whether the district court erred in refusing to reduce Johnson\u2019s base offense level based upon his minor role in the offense pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 (2001). A district court may grant a two-level adjustment to a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.5). Our review of the record convinces us that the district court did not clearly err in denying Johnson\u2019s request for a downward adjustment for his role in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>the offense. <em>See United States v. Lipford, </em>203 F.3d 259, 272 (4th Cir.2000) (stating standard of review); USSG \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (nn.3(A), 3(B)) (discussing role in the offense adjustment).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Johnson\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
