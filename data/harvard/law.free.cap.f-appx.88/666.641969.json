The district court dismissed the complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) for failure to immediately notify the court of his change in address. Because of that failure, correspondence from the court addressed to Smith was returned as undeliverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-20\">The district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice is not appealable. <em>See Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union 392, </em>10 F.3d 1064, 1066-67 (4th Cir.1993). A dismissal without prejudice is a final order only if \u201c \u2018no amendment [in the complaint] could cure the defects in the plaintiffs case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1067 (quoting <em>Coniston Corp. v. Village of Hoffman Estates, </em>844 F.2d 461, 463 (7th Cir.1988)). In ascertaining whether a dismissal without prejudice is reviewable in this court, we must determine \u201cwhether the plaintiff could save his action by merely amending his complaint.\u201d <em>Domino Sugar, </em>10 F.3d at 1066-67. In this case, Smith may move in the district court to reopen his case and to file a signed complaint giving his present address. Therefore, the dismissal order is not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-22\">Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
