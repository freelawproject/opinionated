Frias was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 18 months to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-28\">This court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction on its own motion if necessary. <em>See Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Although Frias\u2019 letter to the court indicated that he was seeking a reduction of his sentence, the other statements in his letter clearly evinced his intent to appeal his sentence. Therefore, the court has jurisdiction to address this appeal. <em>See Stevens v. Heard, </em>674 F.2d 320, 322-23 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-29\">Frias argues that the district court clearly erred in refusing his request to reduce his offense level for having a minor role in the offense. He argues that he was merely a courier transporting a relatively small amount of marijuana and that his consent to search his vehicle indicated that he was not a sophisticated drag smuggler.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>A defendant\u2019s offense level may be decreased by two levels if the defendant was a minor participant in an offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. A minor participant is one \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.5). The district court did not clearly err in determining that Frias failed to show that there were any other participants in the offense and thus, that Frias failed to show that he was substantially less culpable than other involved individuals involved in the offense. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>54 F.3d 234, 241 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b723-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
