A district court\u2019s determination of probable cause under the Fourth Amendment is an issue of law, and is therefore reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Wilhelm, </em>80 F.3d 116, 118 (4th Cir.1996). After careful review of the record, we conclude that the district court properly applied the good faith exception. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Rice also contends that his statement was admitted at trial in violation of his rights pursuant to <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Even if Rice\u2019s statement was admitted in error, based on the evidence presented at trial, we conclude that any error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Mobley, </em>40 F.3d 688, 694 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Finally, Rice seeks to assert the defense of estoppel by entrapment as to his conviction under \u00a7 922(g). However, as Rice recognizes, this argument is squarely foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Etheridge, </em>932 F.2d 318 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Accordingly, we affirm Rice\u2019s conviction. We deny Rice\u2019s motion for new counsel and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
