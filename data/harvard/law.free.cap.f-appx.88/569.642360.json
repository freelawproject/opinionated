The presentence investigation report recommended that Bell\u2019s base offense level be increased pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l). Section 2K2.1(c)(l) cross-referenced to USSG \u00a7 2X1.1, which increased Bell\u2019s base offense level for his use of the firearm in connection with his intended distribution of five grams or more of cocaine base. The district court agreed with the PSR and adopted its findings. The court sentenced Bell to 130 months of imprisonment, to be followed by a five-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Bell\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious grounds for appeal but raising one issue: whether the district court erred in its application of the sentencing guidelines. Specifically, counsel questioned the propriety of cross-referencing to a charge for which Bell had not been convicted. Bell was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he has declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">We have reviewed the record and conclude that the district court properly applied the sentencing guidelines. Although this court has no published authority on the subject, it is generally accepted that district courts may refer to offenses of which the defendant has not been convicted when cross-referencing from USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(e)(l) to USSG \u00a7 2X1.1. <em>See, e.g., United States v. O\u2019Flanagan, </em>339 F.3d 1229, 1234 (10th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Drew, </em>200 F.3d 871, 879 (D.C.Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Bell\u2019s conviction and. sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
