We have reviewed the administrative record and the opinion of the Board and find that substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Kenlak failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution in a protected category, as necessary to qualify for relief from deportation. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) (1994);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b) (2003). Thus, the record supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that Kenlak failed to establish eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Additionally, we uphold the Board\u2019s denial of Kenlak\u2019s application for withholding of deportation. The standard for receiving withholding of deportation is \u201cmore stringent than that for asylum eligibility.\u201d <em>Chen v. U.S. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). An applicant for withholding must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution. <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). As Kenlak has failed to establish refugee status, he cannot satisfy the higher standard for withholding of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Kenlak seeks to appeal the Board\u2019s decision denying suspension of deportation under former INA \u00a7 244(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a) (1994). Section 309(c)(4)(E) of the transitional rules provides that \u201cthere shall be no appeal of any discretionary decision under section ... 244.\u201d This court \u201cmay review all aspects of the BIA\u2019s decision except those that are committed to its discretion by law.\u201d <em>Okpa v. U.S. INS, </em>266 F.3d 313, 317 (4th Cir.2001). Any \u201cdecision with respect to whether extreme hardship is established is a discretionary one [that the Court] may not review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the immigration judge denied the application for suspension of deportation based on his finding that Kenlak failed to demonstrate extreme hardship; the Board affirmed on that ground. Thus, the decision is not reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">Finally, Kenlak challenges the Board\u2019s denial of his motion to remand for consideration under the Convention Against Torture. This court reviews the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to remand for abuse of discretion. <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003). The Board abuses its discretion when it \u201cfails to offer a reasoned explanation for its decision, distorts or disregards important aspects of the alien\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted). We conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">Accordingly, Kenlak\u2019s petition for review is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction as to the suspension of deportation claim, and denied as to the denial of asylum, withholding, and motion to remand. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the materials before the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-8\">. The case of Kenlak's wife, Victorine M. Tange, was consolidated with his below. Kenlak applied for asylum or withholding of deportation with Tange listed as a dependant; both applied for suspension of deportation or voluntary departure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b606-9\">. Although 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) was repealed by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub.L. No. 104-128, 110 Stat. 3009, effective April 1, 1997, because this case was in transition at the time the IIRIRA was passed, \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) is applicable here under the terms of the transitional rules contained in \u00a7 309(c) of the IIRIRA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
