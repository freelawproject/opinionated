In an appeal filed pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Wright\u2019s counsel raises two issues, but states that, in his view, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Wright\u2019s counsel asserts Wright\u2019s guilty plea was involuntary and unknowing because he was not informed of the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of life when he entered his guilty plea before the magistrate judge, and the district court abused its discretion by denying Wright\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We agree with Wright that his plea was unknowing and involuntary, thus we vacate the plea. Accordingly, we vacate his conviction and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-15\">Wright was indicted for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of cocaine base. The Government filed an information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000) prior to the entry of Wright\u2019s guilty plea. Wright\u2019s plea of guilty to involvement with more than five hundred grams of cocaine base, coupled with two prior convictions for drug felonies, subjected him to a mandatory term of life imprisonment without release. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-16\">The adequacy of a guilty plea proceeding is reviewed de novo. <em>See United States v. Damon, </em>191 F.3d 561, 564 n. 2 (4th Cir.1999). It is not evident from the record that Wright knew he was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment when he entered his guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>plea. <em>See United States v. Goins, </em>51 F.3d 400, 403 (4th Cir.1995) (holding that trial court\u2019s failure to correctly inform defendant of mandatory minimum sentence was reversible error). At the Rule 11 hearing, the magistrate judge and the Government noted that Wright could receive a life sentence; but neither conclusively stated that Wright\u2019s term of imprisonment was a mandatory minimum of life. The magistrate judge stated that Wright\u2019s sentence would be determined by the quantity of drugs attributed to Wright in the presentence report and other factors. Likewise, the plea agreement noted a statutory sentence of mandatory minimum and maximum life, but then set forth provisions describing adjustments to the sentencing guidelines for acceptance of responsibility, and stated that the court had not yet determined the sentence and it was within the court\u2019s discretion to impose any sentence up to the statutory maximum. Wright\u2019s counsel assured him he would get a departure for acceptance of responsibility and, if he cooperated with the Government, he would get a departure that would result in a sentence between twelve and fifteen years. We find that Wright was not adequately informed at the Rule 11 hearing that he was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of life, and the record does not support a finding that he was aware from the plea agreement or counsel\u2019s advice that he was facing a mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Because Wright\u2019s plea was not knowing and voluntary, we vacate his conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We remand to the district court, so that Wright may have an opportunity to re-plead, or he may choose to proceed to trial. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b655-12\">. Wright was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but did not do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b656-5\">. In light of this conclusion, we need not address Wright\u2019s arguments that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw the guilty plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
