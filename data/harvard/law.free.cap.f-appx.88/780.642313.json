He asserts that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional on their face and as applied to him. He also argues that the prior conviction that resulted in his increased sentence is an element of the offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) that should have been alleged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-17\">Because a challenge under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) is not jurisdictional, Mendoza-Barcenas may not present these claims in an appeal following the revocation of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Longoria, </em>298 F.3d 367, 372 (5th Cir.2002) (en banc); <em>United States v. Moody, </em>277 F.3d 719, 720-21 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Teran, </em>98 F.3d 831, 833 n. 1 (5th Cir.1996). Regardless, Mendoza-Barcenas acknowledges that his arguments are foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 496. This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b822-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
