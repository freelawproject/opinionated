He was sentenced to thirty-seven months incarceration, three years of supervised release, and a $100 special assessment. Sanchez appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-24\">On appeal, Sanchez argues he had a minimal or minor role in the conspiracy, and at sentencing the district court should, therefore, have reduced his offense level under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 (2003). We review the district court\u2019s factual determinations for clear error and its legal determinations de novo. <em>United States v. Akinkoye, </em>185 F.3d 192, 201 (4th Cir.1999). Sanchez\u2019s claim is meritless. Sanchez fails to establish he was a minimal or minor participant in the conspiracy. USSG \u00a7 3B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-25\">Accordingly, we affirm Sanchez\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-26\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
