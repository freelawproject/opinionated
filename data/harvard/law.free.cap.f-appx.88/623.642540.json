After a jury trial, Michel was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. Michel alleges errors during both the guilt and sentencing phases of his trial. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-16\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, as we must in light of the verdict, <em>see United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 854 (4th Cir.1996), the evidence at Michel\u2019s trial established the following facts. Michel lived in Brooklyn, New York, and coordinated cocaine, crack cocaine, and heroin distribution in Virginia through associates in Richmond, Virginia. The conspiracy indictment against Michel arose out of a joint DEA and Richmond Police Department investigation that began in 1999, with the arrest of Charles Dandrich, who agreed to cooperate with law enforcement and to expose the conspiracy. The conspiracy involved, in addition to Michel, the following individuals who testified against Michel at his trial: Dandrich, Rasheed Williams, Kevin Levy, Gerarod Harvell, Alando Brown, Girrard Ampy and Jeffrey Titus. The conspiracy involved Michel using couriers to transport cocaine and heroin from New York to Kevin Levy in Richmond. Levy would then cook some of the cocaine into crack cocaine and sell the heroin, powder cocaine, and crack cocaine on the street through various street dealers. After the drugs were sold, Levy would arrange to transport the proceeds of the drug sales back to Michel in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-17\">On April 18, 2000, a grand jury returned an eighteen-count indictment against eight of the co-conspirators. Count I of the indictment, the only count relevant here, alleged that between 1997 and March 2000, the conspirators, including one named \u201cJOHN DOE, a/k/a \u2018Freon,\u2019 \u201d conspired to violate 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(a) (West 1999) by possessing with intent to distribute and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>distributing heroin, cocaine, and more than 50 grams of cocaine base (\u201ccrack\u201d). (J.A. at 47.) \u201cJOHN DOE, a/k/a \u2018Freon\u2019 \u201d was later identified as Michel. Michel pleaded not guilty and was tried before a jury. Following a three-day trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on Count I. At sentencing, the district court imposed a four-level enhancement for Michel\u2019s role as an organizer or leader of the conspiracy, pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3Bl.l(a) (2003). Michel timely filed an appeal. Michel alleges six different errors during his trial, and also argues that the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 sentencing enhancement was in error. We address each of Michel\u2019s arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Michel first argues that the district court erred in allowing Charles Dandrich and Girrard Ampy to testify regarding events that took place before 1997, the beginning date of the conspiracy as charged in the indictment. Michel argues that this testimony was evidence of \u201cother crimes, wrongs, or acts\u201d that is generally inadmissible under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) (West 2001). Before trial, the district court issued a discovery order that provided that \u201c[b]y the close of business three days prior to trial, (1) the United States shall provide notice to the defendant, in accordance with Rule 404(b), of the general nature of any evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts that it intends to introduce at trial.\u201d (J.A. at 59.) The Friday before the Monday that trial began <em>(i.e., </em>one business day before trial), the Government provided notice that it intended to introduce testimony from Dandrich and Ampy that they conspired with Michel to distribute drugs as far back as 1991. Michel argues that the Government\u2019s notice was late and that the district court erred in denying his motion to exclude this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to admit the evidence for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>327 F.3d 273, 298 (4th Cir.2003). The testimony of Ampy and Dandrich regarding drug deals between Ampy, Dandrich, Levy and Michel was not evidence of \u201cother crimes\u201d covered by Rule 404(b). Like the challenged testimony in <em>United States v. Kennedy, </em>32 F.3d 876 (4th Cir.1994), the testimony of Ampy and Dandrich \u201cprovid[ed] the jury with background information\u201d on Michel\u2019s \u201cactivities during the preparatory stages of the conspiracy\u201d and \u201cserved to complete the story of the crime on trial.\u201d <em>Kennedy, </em>32 F.3d at 886 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see id. </em>at 885-86 (\u201cKennedy\u2019s argument erroneously assumes that all evidence falling outside the charged conspiracy period necessarily involves a separate, unrelated offense subject to the strictures of [Rule 404(b)].\u201d). Accordingly, because Dandrich and Amp/s testimony was not Rule 404(b) evidence, the Government\u2019s Friday notice of its intent to offer the testimony did not violate the requirement in the discovery order that Rule 404(b) evidence be disclosed at least three days before the beginning of trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the testimony was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>relevant to Michel\u2019s participation in the conspiracy, the district court was well within its discretion in admitting the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Next, Michel contends that the Government used its peremptory strikes in a racially discriminatory manner in contravention of <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). During jury selection, the Government used two of its four peremptory strikes against African American venirepersons. After the jury was selected, Michel raised a <em>Batson </em>challenge. The district court then required the Government to offer a neutral explanation for the strikes. The Government explained that one venireperson was struck because she \u201cis presently married to a lawyer who does defense work ... [and] she\u2019s a retired teacher.\u201d (J.A. at 82.) The other venireperson was struck because \u201che\u2019s a custodian at the schools. And ... there are perhaps better Government jurors in the panel.\u201d (J.A. at 82.) The district court then found that \u201c[b]ased upon the current proportion of the jury, the pattern of the strikes exercised, and the race-neutral explanation given by the Government,\u201d the Government was not exercising its strikes in a racially discriminatory manner and denied Michel\u2019s motion. (J.A. at 83.)</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Generally, a <em>Batson </em>challenge consists of three steps: (1) the defendant makes a prima facie case; (2) the Government offers a race-neutral explanation; and (3) the trial court decides whether the defendant has carried his burden and proved purposeful discrimination. <em>United States v. Barnette, </em>211 F.3d 803, 812 (4th Cir.2000). \u201cOnce a prosecutor has offered a race-neutral explanation for the peremptory challenges and the trial court has ruled on the ultimate question of intentional discrimination, the preliminary issue of whether the defendant had made a prima facie showing becomes moot.\u201d <em>Hernandez v. New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 359, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991). Accordingly, we turn directly to the second step in the <em>Batson </em>inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">The second step requires the Government to proffer a race-neutral explanation for its strikes. \u201cAt this step of the inquiry, the issue is the facial validity of the prosecutor\u2019s explanation. Unless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the prosecutor\u2019s explanation, the reason offered will be deemed race neutral.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360. The Government\u2019s proffered explanations clearly satisfy this second step.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-13\">Turning to the third step in the inquiry, we review only for clear error the trial court\u2019s finding that Michel failed to carry his burden to prove purposeful discrimination. <em>Jones v. Plaster, </em>57 F.3d 417, 421 (4th Cir.1995). Michel offered no circumstantial evidence of racial motivation other than the raw statistics that the Government used two of its four strikes on African Americans and that the venire as a whole was approximately 20 percent African American. Based on the record in this case, the district court did not clearly err in denying Michel\u2019s <em>Batson </em>motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-14\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-15\">Third, Michel argues that the Government improperly referred to the guilty pleas of testifying co-defendants in its opening statement. After describing the evidence that the jury would hear, the prosecutor stated, \u201cAll of these individuals that I have mentioned, Kevin Levy, Rash<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>eed Williams, Ike Titus, Gerarod Harvell, and Alando Brown, they have all pled guilty as being a member of this organization.\u201d (J.A. at 110-11.) All of these individuals testified at Michel\u2019s trial. Michel did not raise this issue below,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> so we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Cherry, </em>330 F.3d 658, 665 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">We previously have held that, even assuming there is any error in discussing the guilty pleas of testifying co-defendants, such error is harmless if there is a limiting instruction. <em>United States v. Blevins, </em>960 F.2d 1252, 1260-61 n. 3 (4th Cir.1992). In this case, the district court gave the following limiting instruction: \u201cTestimony or reference to guilty pleas or convictions of other alleged co-conspirators should not be considered by the jury as substantive evidence of the guilt of the Defendant, Frantz Michel.\u201d (J.A. at 709.) Accordingly, even assuming that the reference to the guilty pleas of testifying co-defendants was error, the error was harmless, and thus, was not plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Fourth, Michel argues that the district court abused its discretion in admitting evidence of firearms and drugs seized during searches of residences of co-conspirators. This argument is wholly without merit. It is basic conspiracy law that a defendant \u201cis liable for the conduct of all co-conspirators that was in furtherance of the conspiracy and reasonably foreseeable to him.\u201d <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>322 F.3d 328, 338 (4th Cir.2003). Firearms, and certainly the drugs themselves, are reasonably foreseeable to a defendant involved in a drug conspiracy. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Cummings, </em>937 F.2d 941, 945 (4th Cir.1991) (adopting Seventh Circuit\u2019s observation in <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>864 F.2d 544, 549 (7th Cir.1988) that \u201c[wjhen an individual conspires to take part in a street transaction involving a kilogram of cocaine worth $39,000, it certainly is quite reasonable to assume that a weapon of some kind would be carried.\u201d). The evidence seized at the homes of co-conspirators was probative because it was part of the conspiracy for which Michel was charged, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">Michel next contends that the district court abused its discretion in allowing the Government to question witness Kevin Levy about his contacts with Mr. Wagner, Michel\u2019s trial counsel. On the morning of the second day of trial, the Government brought to the attention of the district court the fact that Michel\u2019s counsel had had personal contact with Levy, a witness for the United States who was represented by counsel, without first obtaining permission from Levy\u2019s attorney. Michel\u2019s trial counsel stated that Levy waived his right to counsel and agreed to speak to him. In light of this contact, the Government asked for \u201cconsiderable latitude\u201d in its direct examination of Levy. (J.A. at 368.) The district court held that it would \u201callow [the Government] to ask questions, whatever questions pertaining to that interview you feel are appropriate. I will entertain [Michel\u2019s] objection on a question-and-answer basis.... I don\u2019t find anything inappropriate\u201d in Michel\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s conduct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>(J.A. at 370.) During direct examination, the Government asked Levy the following questions regarding his contact with Michel\u2019s trial counsel: (1) \u201cNow, prior to testifying here today, did you get a visit from Mr. Wagner?\u201d; (2) \u201cAnd during that visit, did he speak with you about the law?\u201d; (3) \u201cDid he tell you\u2014did he ask you whether his\u2014or did he tell you whether he had been given permission by your lawyer to speak with you?\u201d; (4) \u201cDid you ask to speak with Mr. Wagner, or did Mr. Wagner come and visit you?\u201d; and (5) \u201cDid you request Mr. Wagner to come visit you?\u201d (J.A. at 407-09.) In addition to his overall objection, Michel specifically objected both to Question 2 and Levy\u2019s answer to Question 2. The district court overruled the objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Although the Government claims that these questions were asked solely to elicit Levy\u2019s potential bias in testifying, we doubt whether this line of questioning was appropriate to show Levy\u2019s bias, especially when the Government was not attempting to discredit Levy, and Levy\u2019s plea agreement sufficiently established any potential bias for or against Michel in Levy\u2019s testimony. Assuming that it was error to permit this line of questioning, however, we find that any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">\u201cThe proper test of harmlessness of non-constitutional error is whether we, in appellate review, can say \u2018with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Urbanik, </em>801 F.2d 692, 698 (4th Cir.1986) (quoting <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 765, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)). In applying this test, the error is harmless if it is \u201chighly probable that the error did not affect the judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 699 (quotation marks omitted). \u201cIn assessing whether it is \u2018highly probable\u2019 that the error did not \u2018affect\u2019 or \u2018substantially sway\u2019 a judgment of conviction, we must consider three factors: (1) the centrality of the issue affected by the error; (2) the steps taken to mitigate the effects of the error; and (3) the closeness of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Ince, </em>21 F.3d 576, 583 (4th Cir.1994). Here, the assumed error involved questions about the conduct of Michel\u2019s counsel, an issue far from central to the case. Moreover, this was not a close case as there was overwhelming evidence of Michel\u2019s guilt. Accordingly, it is highly probable that any error did not affect the judgment, and thus, the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">In the final assignment of error related to his conviction, Michel argues that there is insufficient evidence that he was a member of the conspiracy to support the jury\u2019s verdict. As to the quantum of evidence necessary to sustain a criminal conviction, we have held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad6\">a jury verdict <em>must be sustained </em>if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it. A reviewing court, therefore, may not overturn a substantially supported verdict merely because it finds the verdict unpalatable or determines that another, reasonable verdict would be preferable. Rather, we shall reverse a verdict if the record demonstrates a lack of evidence from which a jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-10\"><em>Burgos, </em>94 F.3d at 862 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). To prove a conspiracy to possess drugs with the intent to distribute, the Government must establish that: (1) an agreement to possess drugs with the intent to distribute existed between two or more persons; (2) the defendant knew of the conspiracy; and (3) the defendant knowingly and voluntarily became a part of this conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>at 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Michel argues that the evidence shows merely a buyer-seller relationship between himself and Levy. To the contrary, every co-conspirator that testified linked Michel to the plan to sell drugs in the Richmond area. The evidence shows that Michel collected money from the drug sellers and directed couriers to transport the drugs to Levy. Levy specifically testified that he \u201cnever bought drugs from [Michel]\u201d and denied that he was \u201cbringing drugs from New York\u201d or that he was \u201chaving drugs brought from New York.\u201d (J.A. at 376, 410-11.) Levy testified instead that Michel would supply him with drugs to sell and that Levy was \u201creceiving drugs in Richmond.\u201d (J.A. at 411.) Levy further testified that when a courier disappeared with $70,000 of drug proceeds, Michel split the loss with Levy instead of requiring Levy to absorb the entire loss himself. Given this testimony, there was substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s conspiracy verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Having rejected all of Michel\u2019s arguments related to his conviction, we affirm Michel\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and conspiracy to distribute heroin, cocaine, and more than 50 grams of cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">G.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Finally, we address Michel\u2019s argument that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 (2003). Section 3B1.1 provides for an enhancement to a sentence based on a defendant\u2019s role as an organizer or leader of the criminal activity. \u201cWe review role in the offense adjustments for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>108 F.3d 512, 518 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The Presentence Report recommended a four-level enhancement for Michel\u2019s role as an organizer in the offense. Michel objected to this recommendation, essentially reiterating his argument that the evidence showed that he was merely in a buyer-seller relationship with Levy. It is true, as Michel argues, that we have held that \u201cbeing a buyer and seller of illegal drugs ... does not establish that a defendant has functioned as an \u2018organizer, leader, manager or supervisor\u2019 of criminal activity\u201d as required by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. <em>United States v. Sayles, </em>296 F.3d 219, 225 (4th Cir.2002). The district court, however, rejected Michel\u2019s argument that he was merely a seller of drugs, finding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJC\">the evidence demonstrated that Mr. Michel ... stood at the apex of a major drug distribution syndicate, a syndicate which shipped substantial quantities of cocaine hydrochloride from the state of New York to the state of Virginia for street-level distribution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-9\">It was Mr. Michel that organized and supervised couriers. He was the one that determined when the drugs were going to be shipped down here. He was also the one that supervised the return of the money from Virginia back to New York. And in fact, he was personally present in Virginia at the time in which I think $35,000, somewhere around that amount of money, was being returned to the state of New York.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-10\">So I think the evidence demonstrates that Mr. Michel is more than just a supplier. He is someone who has an organizational role in leading an extensive drug distribution syndicate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-11\">The evidence indicated, as I mentioned, that he would send couriers to Virginia with shipments of drugs and that he would direct them to return with the money. By virtue of his pivotal role, he controlled the timing of drug distribution and the quantities of shipments, the profits, and the types of drugs that were on the street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-12\">The Court also finds there w[ere] at least five other participants in this conspiracy. ... So based upon the number of participants, the duration of the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>spiraey, the quantity of drugs involved, the revenue generated, the geographic span, and the control that Mr. Michel exerted by virtue of being the faucet, so to speak, that controlled the flow of drugs from New York to Virginia, and his control of the individuals on the street, the profits they made, all made him an organizer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">(J.A. at 797-98.) After reviewing all of the evidence, we conclude that the district court\u2019s finding that Michel stood at the apex of this conspiracy is not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s imposition of the four-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Michel\u2019s conviction and sentence for drug trafficking conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-7\">. The Government argues in the alternative that even if the testimony of Ampy and Dandrich was Rule 404(b) evidence, the discovery order required disclosure only \"three days\u201d before trial and that disclosure on Friday for a Monday tried satisfies this requirement. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 45 clearly provides that \"in computing any period of time specified in ... <em>any </em>court order ... [ejxclude intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays when the period is less than 11 days.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 45(a)(2) (West Supp.2003) (emphasis added). Because we conclude that the testimony was not Rule 404(b) evidence, it was not covered by the Rule 404(b) disclosure requirement in the discovery order. Accordingly, we assume with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>out deciding that disclosure of Rule 404(b) evidence on Friday for a Monday trial would have been late disclosure. At oral argument, the parties indicated that this language in the district court\u2019s routine discovery order has been subsequently clarified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b670-7\">. Before the district court, Michel raised a challenge to the Government\u2019s reference to <em>non-testifying </em>co-defendants. In his brief on appeal, however, Michel argues only that the statement about the <em>testifying </em>co-defendants was improper. (Appellant's Br. at 22 (\"Although these individuals testified in this case, the opening statement of the United States violated <em>[United States v. Blevins, </em>960 F.2d 1252 (4th Cir.1992)] and unfairly prejudiced the defendant.\u201d).)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
