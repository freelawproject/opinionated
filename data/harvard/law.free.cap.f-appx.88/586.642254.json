Counsel for Morton has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he states there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but presenting one issue for this court\u2019s review. Although notified of his right to file a supplemental brief, Morton has not done so. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">Counsel suggests that the district court erred in failing to depart downward from Morton\u2019s sentencing range for his substantial assistance to the Government. However, in the plea agreement, the Government retained discretion over whether to make a substantial assistance motion; it was not obligated to so move. <em>See United States v. Snow, </em>234 F.3d 187, 190 (4th Cir.2000). Moreover, the denial of a request for a downward departure is not renewable on appeal unless the district court mistakenly believed it lacked the authority to depart. <em>United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 30 (4th Cir.1990). The record indicates the district court understood its authority to depart, but that it chose not to depart. Therefore, Morton\u2019s claim is unreviewable on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Morton\u2019s conviction and sentence. The court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
