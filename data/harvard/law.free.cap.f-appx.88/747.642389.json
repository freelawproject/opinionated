The district court sentenced Delgado to 15 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Delgado argues, for the first time on appeal, that the sentencing provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He concedes that this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez</em>Torres. <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow the precedent set in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">Delgado also argues that a conflict exists between the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence and the written judgment because the written judgment contains a condition of supervised release prohibiting the possession of a dangerous weapon, but at the sentencing hearing, the court did not mention this prohibition. For the reasons outlined in <em>United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 937-38 (5th Cir.2003), we conclude that the district court\u2019s omission of the dangerous-weapon prohibition during the oral pronouncement of sentence did not create a conflict with the sentence set forth in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b790-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
