In her petition, Vargas Perez argues that: (1) the BIA violated her due process rights by issuing a summary affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial; (2) the IJ violated her due process rights by failing to rule on her asylum application; and (3) her various counsel during her proceedings before the IJ rendered ineffective assistance by failing to raise the asylum issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-21\">Respondent has filed a motion seeking dismissal of Vargas Perez\u2019s instant petition for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that Vargas Perez failed to exhaust all of her available administrative remedies. Our examination of the record confirms that Vargas Perez failed to raise these claims before the BIA on appeal or in a motion to reopen the proceedings. Her failure to exhaust her administrative remedies deprives us of jurisdiction to consider the instant petition. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2001); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (1999). Although Vargas Perez argues that the exhaustion requirement should be waived under the futility exception, she fails to allege facts warranting application of that exception. <em>See Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, </em>252 F.3d 383, 389 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-22\">Accordingly, we grant the respondent\u2019s motions to waive the requirement to file a brief and to dismiss the instant petition for lack of jurisdiction, and we dismiss Vargas Perez\u2019s petition and deny all outstanding motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-23\">Motion to waive requirement to file brief GRANTED; motion to dismiss GRANTED; petition DISMISSED for lack of ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>risdiction; all outstanding motions DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b842-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
