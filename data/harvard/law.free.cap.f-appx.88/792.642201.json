After adequate discovery which established that Plaintiff was actually terminated for legitimate non-discriminatory reasons related to her long history of poor work performance, Defendant moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Defendant holding that Plaintiff had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that she engaged in activity protected under Title VII or TCHRA and that Plaintiff failed to establish a causal link between the termination and any protected activity. Plaintiff timely appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-22\">We have carefully reviewed the briefs, the reply brief, the record excerpts and relevant portions of the record itself.

AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b834-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
