California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Cortez has not filed a response. Our independent review of the brief and the record discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-23\">The case is remanded for the purpose of correcting a clerical error in the judgment. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim. P. 36. The amended judgment should correct the term of supervised release to conform to the four-year term of supervised release imposed at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-24\">MOTION GRANTED; APPEAL DISMISSED; REMANDED FOR CORRECTION OF CLERICAL ERROR.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b814-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
