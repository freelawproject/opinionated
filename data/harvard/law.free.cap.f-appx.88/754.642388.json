California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Silva-Pena has filed a response expressing dissatisfaction with Chavez and requesting that the appeal filed by Chavez be dismissed and that he be allowed to withdraw. We construe the response as a motion to strike Chavez\u2019s brief and to appoint new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">Based upon our independent review of the record, Chavez\u2019s brief, and Silva-Pena\u2019s response, we conclude that there are no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, Chavez\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, he is excused from further responsibilities herein, Silva-Pena\u2019s motion is DENIED, and this appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b797-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
