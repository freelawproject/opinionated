Matsiona, a native and citizen of the Republic of Congo, petitions this Court for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order summarily affirming the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Matsiona\u2019s requests for asylum, withholding of removal, and voluntary de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>parture. Matsiona also alleges that the BIA erred in affirming the decision of the immigration judge without opinion, after review by a single BIA member, in accordance with the procedure set out in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7) (2003). For the following reasons, Matsiona\u2019s petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">As a threshold matter, we have reviewed Matsiona\u2019s challenges to the BIA\u2019s use of the procedure for streamlined review and find them to be without merit. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>335 F.3d 1009, 1011 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Georgis v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 962, 967 (7th Cir.2003); <em>Mendoza v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1288-89 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832-33 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1333-34 (11th Cir. 2003); <em>Albathani v. INS, </em>318 F.3d 365, 375-79 (1st Cir.2003). We further find that summary affirmance was appropriate in this case under the factors set forth in \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Turning to the substance of the immigration judge\u2019s decision, we find no error in the determination that Matsiona is ineligible for asylum. This court may not reverse a denial of asylum unless \u201cmanifestly contrary to law,\u201d and cannot revisit the underling factual determinations unless \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B), (C) (2000). Our review of the record presents no basis to overturn the immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989). Nor do we find error in the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that Matsiona\u2019s corroborating evidence failed to substantiate his allegations. <em>See Khan v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 1143, 1144 (9th Cir.2001). Hence, Matsiona fails to demonstrate error in the immigration judge\u2019s denial of asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">With respect to Matsiona\u2019s claims regarding the denial of withholding of removal and his request for voluntary departure, we find neither presents a basis for relief. The standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than that for granting asylum, <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); hence, Matsiona\u2019s challenge to the denial of his request for withholding of removal presents no independent error. Furthermore, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the discretionary decision to deny Matsiona\u2019s request for voluntary departure. <em>See Okpa v. INS, </em>266 F.3d 313, 317 (4th Cir.2001); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.25(c) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Accordingly, we deny Matsiona\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
