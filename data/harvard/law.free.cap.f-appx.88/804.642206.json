This court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction on its own motion if necessary. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>Cir.1987). A timely notice of appeal is a prerequisite for the exercise of jurisdiction by this court. <em>United States v. Carr, </em>979 F.2d 51, 55 (5th Cir.1992). Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(A) requires that the notice of appeal in a civil action be filed within 30 days of entry of the judgment or order from which appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Paulson did not file his notice of appeal within 30 days of the entry of the district court\u2019s July 17, 2003, dismissal order. Instead, his notice of appeal was filed in excess of four months later, on November 19, 2003, at the earliest. The November 19 notice of appeal was timely as to the district court\u2019s denial of Paulson\u2019s post-judgment \u201cMotion for a Full and Fair Hearing To Determine Facts in Dispute\u201d only. However, Paulson briefs no argument regarding the denial of that motion, devoting his brief instead to the merits of his case and to the propriety of the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition. By failing to brief any argument regarding the denial of his motion for a full and fair hearing, Paulson has abandoned the sole available ground for appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). The appeal is therefore DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b846-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
