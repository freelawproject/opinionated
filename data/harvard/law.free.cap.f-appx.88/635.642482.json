The district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice is not appeal-able. <em>See Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union 392, </em>10 F.3d 1064, 1066-67 (4th Cir.1993). A dismissal without prejudice is a final order only if \u201c \u2018no amendment [in the complaint] could cure the defects in the plaintiffs case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1067 (quoting <em>Coniston Corp. v. Village of Hoffman Estates, </em>844 F.2d 461, 463 (7th Cir.1988)). In ascertaining whether a dismissal without prejudice is reviewable in this court, we must determine \u201cwhether the plaintiff could save his action by merely amending his complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1066-67. In this case, Jackson may move in the district court to reopen his case and to file an amended complaint specifically alleging facts sufficient to state a \u00a7 1983 claim. Therefore, the dismissal order is not appealable. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
