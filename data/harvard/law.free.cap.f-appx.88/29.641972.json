California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that Rodgers\u2019s appeal does not present a nonfrivolous issue. <em>See Dinkins v. Alabama, </em>526 F.2d 1268, 1269 (5th Cir.1976). Rodgers has filed a response to counsel\u2019s motion, arguing that his appeal raises non-frivolous claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Our independent review of counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief, Rodgers\u2019s response and the record discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The request for a COA, requested implicitly by the notice of appeal, is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b74-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
