Garcia\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising one issue but stating that he finds no meritorious grounds for appeal. Although notified of his right to do so, Garcia has not filed a pro se supplemental brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-22\">In the <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel questions whether the district court erred in denying Garcia\u2019s request for a downward departure. A defendant may obtain review of a district court\u2019s decision not to depart downward only when the district court mistakenly believed it lacked authority to depart. <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>188 F.3d 230, 238-39 (4th Cir.1999). Garcia does not argue that the court failed to understand its authority to depart, nor does the record disclose any uncertainty on the court\u2019s part. Accordingly, Garcia\u2019s claim is not reviewable on appeal. <em>Edwards, </em>188 F.3d at 238-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-23\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Garcia\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
