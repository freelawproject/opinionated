Shepard appeals his sentence following a guilty plea to simple assault. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a)(5). Shepard argues that the district court\u2019s imposition of the $1000 fine violated his oral plea agreement for a \u201cspecific sentence.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C). Because Shepard did not object in the district court to the imposition of a fine on the ground that it violated his plea agreement, we review for \u201cplain error\u201d only. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>324 F.3d 375, 381 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 152, 157 L.Ed.2d 43 (2003); <em>see also United States v. Rhodes, </em>253 F.3d 800, 804 (5th Cir.2001). Under the plain error standard, the defendant bears the burden of showing that (1) there is an error, (2) the error is plain, and (3) the error affects substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">A plea agreement arising under Fed. R.Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C), \u201cbinds the court once the court accepts the plea agreement.\u201d Fed. R.Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C); <em>McClure v. Ashcroft, </em>335 F.3d 404, 413 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Rhodes, </em>253 F.3d at 804. \u201c \u2018Plea bargain agreements are contractual in nature, and are to be construed accordingly.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hentz v. Hargett, </em>71 F.3d 1169, 1173 (5th Cir.1996) (citation omitted). Although the parties reached a plea agreement as to a specific term of imprisonment, namely three months, the record does not suggest that the plea agreement involved any understanding regarding a fine. Thus, the district court\u2019s acceptance of the plea agreement did not preclude the imposition of a fine. Shepard has not demonstrated error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b89-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
