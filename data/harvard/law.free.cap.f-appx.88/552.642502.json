For the reasons explained below, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">Castorani pled guilty in August 2000 to being a felon in possession of a firearm, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000), and was sentenced to a thirty-seven month term of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. Castorani was released from confinement in April 2003 and began his term of supervised release. Castorani violated the terms of his supervised release and, in August 2003, the district court revoked Castorani\u2019s supervised release, sentenced him to an active prison term of twenty-four months, and imposed an additional twelve month term of supervised release to be served following his release from incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-16\">Castorani asserts the district court plainly erred by imposing an additional term of supervised release. Because Castorani did not object at sentencing to this aspect of the district court\u2019s judgment, review by this Court is for plain error. <em>United States v. Maxwell, </em>285 F.3d 336, 339 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-17\">Castorani was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), an offense punishable by imprisonment for no more than ten years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2) (2000). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(3) (2000), the offense is a Class C felony. A person who was originally convicted of a Class C felony cannot be imprisoned for more than twenty-four months upon revocation of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2000). At the date of Castorani\u2019s conviction in November 2000, the statutory provision allowing the imposition of supervised release after a term of incarceration was served upon revocation of supervised release stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-18\">When a term of supervised release is revoked and the defendant is required to serve a term of imprisonment that is less than the maximum term of imprisonment authorized under subsection (e)(3), the court may include a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release after imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-19\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h) (2000).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-20\">The penalties that can be imposed for revocation of supervised release relate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>back to the original offense. <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 699-701, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000). Because Castorani\u2019s offense predates the amendment to the statute, the prior version of \u00a7 3583(h) applies. Because Castorani received the statutory maximum term of imprisonment for violating his supervised release, the imposition of a new term of supervised release was plain error that affected Castorani\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See Maxwell, </em>285 F.3d at 342. Accordingly, we exercise our discretion to correct the error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">We vacate the district court\u2019s order imposing sentence and remand this case for resentencing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b595-14\"> Congress amended section 3583(h) to delete \"that is less than the maximum term of im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>prisonment authorized under subsection (e)(3)\" effective April 30, 2003.
