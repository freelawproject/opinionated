Hossain challenges the IJ\u2019s determination that his testimony was not credible, and he also takes issue with the IJ\u2019s alternative determination Hossain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>is not entitled to asylum even if his testimony is assumed to be truthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">On a petition for review of a BIA decision, this court reviews factual findings for substantial evidence and questions of law <em>de novo. See Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001). \u201cThe substantial evidence standard requires only that the BIA\u2019s decision be supported by record evidence and be substantially reasonable.\u201d <em>Omagah v. Ashcroft, </em>288 F.3d 254, 258 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">This court gives great deference to an IJ\u2019s decision concerning an alien\u2019s credibility. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 905 (5th Cir.2002). The IJ\u2019s determination that Hossain was not credible is a reasonable interpretation of the administrative record and is therefore supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994). Absent credible evidence, the BIA has no basis upon which to grant asylum. <em>See id. </em>Because Hossain\u2019s lack of credibility is an adequate ground for affirming the BIA\u2019s denial of Hossain\u2019s asylum application, there is no need to address the alternative holding that even if Hossain were credible he would not be eligible for relief. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Hossain has waived any issues relating to the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal and its denial of relief under the CAT by failing to address them in his brief. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Hossain\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b750-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
