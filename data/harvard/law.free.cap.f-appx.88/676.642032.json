On appeal, he contends that the court erred in attributing a conviction to him in determining his crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>nal history score. Jimenez asserted that he was not convicted of the offense and therefore his criminal history score was erroneously increased by two points. We find that the court\u2019s determination that Jimenez was, in fact, convicted of a misdemeanor offense in New York is supported by a preponderance of the evidence and is not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217-18 (4th Cir.1989); <em>see also United States v. DiPina, </em>178 F.3d 68, 75-76 (1st Cir.1999). Accordingly, we affirm Jimenez\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
