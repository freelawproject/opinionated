R.Crim. P. 33. DeCarlo also appeals the enhancement of his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-24\">DeCarlo has failed to prove that the Government either withheld the newly-discovered impeachment material from him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>prior to his trial or knowingly used perjured testimony at his trial. <em>See East v. Scott, 55 </em>F.3d 996, 1003-05 (5th Cir.1995). Moreover, DeCarlo\u2019s own testimony before the jury was sufficient to establish that he constructively possessed the firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). <em>See United States v. Mergerson, 4 </em>F.3d 337, 348-49 (5th Cir.1993). Thus, DeCarlo has failed to show that the newly-discovered evidence is material. <em>See United States v. MMR Corp., </em>954 F.2d 1040, 1047 (5th Cir.1992). In addition, because the new evidence is cumulative and impeaching, its discovery does not warrant a new trial. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">The crime of burglary for which DeCarlo was convicted under Utah Criminal Code \u00a7 76-6-202 substantially corresponds to the definition of generic burglary as required by <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), for sentencing enhancement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). <em>See Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 599. Thus, the Government\u2019s submission of proof of the text of the Utah state statute is sufficient proof that DeCarlo\u2019s prior burglary offense meets the definition of the violent felony of burglary for enhancement purposes under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b749-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
