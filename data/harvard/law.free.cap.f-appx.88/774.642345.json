According to Garcia-Lopez, his removal proceeding was fundamentally unfair because the immigration judge did not inform him of his eligibility to apply for discretionary relief from deportation. In <em>United States v. Lopez-Ortiz, </em>313 F.3d 225, 231 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1135, 123 S.Ct. 922, 154 L.Ed.2d 827 (2003), this court held that an immigration judge\u2019s failure to inform an alien of his eligibility for discretionary relief from deportation does not rise to the level of fundamental unfairness necessary to successfully challenge a deportation order. As we held in a prior order issued in this case, Garcia-Lopez\u2019s argument that his deportation order cannot be used to support his conviction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 is foreclosed by our holding in <em>Lopez-Ortiz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b816-24\">The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b816-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
