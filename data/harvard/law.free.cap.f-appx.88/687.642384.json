Ansah argues that her false assertions on her written naturalization application do not preclude a showing of good moral character. Ansah is correct. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f)(6); <em>Kungys v. United States, </em>485 U.S. 759, 780, 108 S.Ct. 1537, 99 L.Ed.2d 839 (1988). However, by orally testifying under oath before an immigration officer that the answers contained in her naturalization application were true, Ansah prevented a showing of good moral character required for cancellation of removal. <em>See Kungys, </em>485 U.S. at 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">Ansah also argues that her false testimony was a mistake and made without the intent to deceive. The immigration judge found that Ansah lacked credibility regarding this assertion. This determination was based on the judge\u2019s finding that Ansah knew that had she disclosed her fraudulent marriage to the interviewing officer, her naturalization application would be denied. When Ansah was asked if the reason that she lied was to avoid the denial of the application, Ansah did not deny it; instead, she equivocated and admitted that she \u201cshould have told the truth\u201d at the hearing. The evidence thus supports the judge\u2019s finding that Ansah told the lie with an intent to obtain naturalization benefits. The record does not compel a conclusion contrary to that made by the immigration judge. <em>See Carbajal-Gonzalez v. I.N.S., </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Chun v. I.N.S., </em>40 F.3d 76, 78-79 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b730-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
