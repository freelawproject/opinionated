Dedow argues that 1) his 35-month prison sentence is unauthorized and excessive, 2) the district court erred by imposing a \u201cnew\u201d 13-month term of supervised release, and 3) his attorney rendered ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-20\">Based on his underlying drug conspiracy conviction, Dedow\u2019s 35-month sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) and was therefore legally imposed. <em>See United States v. Giddings, </em>37 F.3d 1091, 1093 (5th Cir.1994). Dedow\u2019s challenge to his 13-month term of supervised release, raised for the first time on appeal, is foreclosed by <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 702-03, 712-13, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000). Accordingly, Dedow\u2019s argument does not survive plain error review. <em>See United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162-64 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-25\">Dedow\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel arguments were not presented to the district court, and Dedow fails to identify portions of the record that provide substantial details about his attorney\u2019s conduct. We therefore decline to address those issues on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Bounds, </em>943 F.2d 541, 544 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b93-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
