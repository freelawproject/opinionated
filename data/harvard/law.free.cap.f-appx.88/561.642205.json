Sutton appeals his conviction on Count Two, alleging that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Sutton contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his \u00a7 924(c) conviction. He argues that the evidence did not show that the firearm seized by police was his or that there was a nexus between the drug trafficking and the gun. We review the district court\u2019s decision to deny a motion for judgment of acquittal de novo. <em>United States v. Gallimore, </em>247 F.3d 134, 136 (4th Cir.2001). Where, as here, the motion was based on sufficiency of the evidence, \u201c[t]he verdict of the jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). We \u201chave defined \u2018substantial evidence,\u2019 in the context of a criminal action, as that evidence which \u2018a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>322 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862-63 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc)). In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence, we do not review the credibility of the witnesses and assume that the jury resolved all contradictions in the testimony in favor of the government. <em>United States v. Romer, </em>148 F.3d 359, 364 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">To establish illegal possession of a firearm in violation of \u00a7 924(e), the government must prove that the defendant knowingly possessed a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and resolving all contradictions in the testimony in favor of the government, we find that the evidence showed that Sutton possessed the firearm in question. We have construed the \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 provision of \u00a7 924(c) to require \u201cthe government to present evidence indicating that the possession of a firearm furthered, advanced, or helped forward a drug trafficking crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Lomax, </em>293 F.3d 701, 705 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1031, 123 S.Ct. 555, 154 L.Ed.2d 448 (2002). Our review of the record convinces us that the jury heard sufficient evidence to find Sutton guilty of this offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Sutton\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b603-17\"> Sutton does not challenge his possession with intent to distribute cocaine base conviction. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999) (noting that issues not briefed or argued are deemed abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
