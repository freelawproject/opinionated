The order denied her motion to reconsider the Board\u2019s previous order affirming the immigration judge\u2019s denial of her applications for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-22\">We note that Abdulkadir dedicated her entire brief to rearguing the merits of her asylum and withholding of removal claims and failed to raise any arguments regarding the validity of the Board\u2019s denial of her motion to reconsider. Thus, we find that none of her claims are properly before this court because she failed to file a timely petition for review from the Board\u2019s initial order of February 21, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-23\">Accordingly, we are constrained to deny the petition for review on the reasoning of the Board. <em>See In re: Abdulkadir, </em>No. A75-350-004 (B.I.A. June 18, 2003). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-24\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
