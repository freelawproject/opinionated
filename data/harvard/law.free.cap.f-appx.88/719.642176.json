Because Adkins\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenged the validity of his conviction and sentence, Adkins had to show that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 provided him with an inadequate or ineffective remedy. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.2000). \u201c[T]he savings clause of [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2255 applies to a claim (i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-24\">Adkins argues that the indictment was defective and in violation of the fair warning, <em>Accardi v. Shaughnessy,</em><footnotemark><em>**</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and no evidence doctrines because it failed to allege all elements of the offenses charged. Thus, he pleaded guilty to non-existent offenses and was actually innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Adkins\u2019 claims are not based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that he may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. To the extent that his claims are based upon the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review and an <em>Apprendi </em>claim does not satisfy the test for filing a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause. <em>See Wesson v. U.S. Penitentiary, Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 347-48 (5th Cir.2002). Accordingly, Adkins fails to qualify for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause provisions. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Adkins\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition is therefore AFFIRMED. Adkins\u2019 motion for leave to file a reply brief out of time is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b761-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
