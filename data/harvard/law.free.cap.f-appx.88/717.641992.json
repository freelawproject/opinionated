Joyce alleged that the Travis County jail failed to provide notice of his rights under the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) on bulletin boards, in the handbook, and throughout the jail facility. Joyce argues that the district court erred in construing his complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and in determining that he failed to state a claim for relief under the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-13\">A dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is reviewed under the <em>de novo </em>standard of review. <em>See Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1999). The district court did not err in treating his complaint as a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action because Joyce challenged the conditions of his confinement. <em>See Cook v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice Transitional Planning Dep\u2019t, </em>37 F.3d 166, 168 (5th Cir.1994). Further, the district court did not err in dismissing Joyce\u2019s complaint because he failed to establish the requirements for filing a cognizable claim under the ADA. <em>See Lightbourn v. County of El Paso, Texas, </em>118 F.3d 421, 428 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-14\">Because Joyce\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit, it is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. This dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal of Joyce\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-88 (5th Cir.1996). Joyce is warned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be able to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(IFP) in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-15\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b760-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
