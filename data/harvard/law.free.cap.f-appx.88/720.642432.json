He challenges the district court\u2019s certification that in forma pauperis (IFP) status should not be granted on appeal because the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number><em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Glover\u2019s claims involve various policies and procedures of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles that have resulted in his repeated reincarcerations. A favorable ruling on Glover\u2019s claims would call into question the validity of his parole revocations. The district court\u2019s determination that Glover may not obtain relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 until his parole revocation is reversed or otherwise called into question was not erroneous. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994); <em>Littles v. Bd. of Pardons and Paroles Div., </em>68 F.3d 122, 123 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Glover has not shown that the district court erred in certifying that an appeal would not be taken in good faith. Accordingly, we uphold the district court\u2019s order certifying that the appeal presents no non-frivolous issues. We also DENY Glover\u2019s motions for <em>en banc </em>hearing and for an evidentiary hearing. Glover\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Therefore, his appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">The dismissal of this appeal and the district court\u2019s dismissal of Glover\u2019s complaint as frivolous each count as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Because Glover\u2019s prior 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint also was dismissed as frivolous by the district court, that dismissal also counts as a strike. <em>See id.; Glover v. Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, </em>No. H-01-51 (S.D.Tex. Jul. 25, 2001). Because he has accumulated three strikes, Glover may no longer proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) SANCTIONS IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b762-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
