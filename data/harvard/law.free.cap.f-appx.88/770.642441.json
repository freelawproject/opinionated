He argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), which was used to enhance his sentence based on his prior aggravated felony conviction, is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Gonzalez acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but asserts that the decision has been cast into doubt by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He seeks to preserve his argument for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>AlmendarezTorres. See Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Gonzalez further argues that a conflict exists between the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence and the written judgment because the written judgment contains a condition of supervised release prohibiting the possession of a dangerous weapon while the court did not mention this prohibition at the sentencing hearing. His argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 937-38 (5th Cir.2003). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b812-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
