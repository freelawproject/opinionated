Bratcher argues that a police officer\u2019s initial stop of his vehicle violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-26\">Suppression hearing testimony indicates that a police officer stopped Bratcher\u2019s vehicle because Bratcher failed to use a turn signal when pulling out of a parking lot onto a street. Texas Transportation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Code section 545.104 requires a driver to use a turn signal \u201cto indicate an intention to turn, change lanes, or start from a parked position.\u201d <em>Id.; see Krug v. State, </em>86 S.W.3d 764, 766 (Tex.App.2001) (\u201c[b]y its plain language, Section 545.104 applies whenever the driver has an \u2018intention to turn\u2019 \u201d). Because the officer had probable cause to believe that a traffic violation had occurred, the decision to stop the vehicle was reasonable and did not violate the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 810, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996). The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b751-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
