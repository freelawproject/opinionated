Salazar-Martinez contends that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional. He therefore argues that his conviction must be reduced to one under the lesser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>included offense found in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(a), his judgment must be reformed to reflect a conviction only under that provision, and his sentence must be vacated and the case remanded for resentencing to no more than two years\u2019 imprisonment and one year of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that the enhanced penalties in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are sentencing provisions, not elements of separate offenses. The Court further held that the sentencing provisions do not violate the Due Process Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 239-47. Salazar-Martinez acknowledges that his arguments are foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>but asserts that the decision has been cast into doubt by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He seeks to preserve his arguments for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>AlmendarezTorres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">The Government has moved for a summary affirmance in lieu of filing an appellee\u2019s brief. In its motion, the Government asks that an appellee\u2019s brief not be required. The motion is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">AFFIRMED; MOTION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b798-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
