Golden, </em>795 F.2d 19, 21 (3d Cir.1986). On remand, the district court amended the judgment to state that Lineberger was to \u201cbegin his sentence on October 23, 1998.\u201d The court also corrected a clerical mistake in the original judgment order and changed the order in which the counts were listed in several sections of the judgment. Lineberger now appeals from the amended judgment and from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to vacate the amended judgment.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Our review of the record and the district court\u2019s orders has disclosed no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm. Lineberger has raised numerous issues on appeal. However, because these issues are outside the scope of the remand, we decline to address them. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b697-17\"> Although Lineberger completed the service of his term of imprisonment, this appeal is not moot because he is still subject to a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
