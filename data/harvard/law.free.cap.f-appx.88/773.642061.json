He argues that the indictment should be dismissed under <em>United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, </em>481 U.S. 828, 107 S.Ct. 2148, 95 L.Ed.2d 772 (1987), and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d) because the immigration judge who ordered him deported ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>plied the wrong amendments to the immigration code and erroneously treated his felony conviction as an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d He concedes that his arguments are foreclosed by Fifth Circuit precedent as well as the law of the case doctrine, and he raises them solely to preserve the issues for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">The Government has moved for a summary affirmance in lieu of filing an appellee\u2019s brief.
