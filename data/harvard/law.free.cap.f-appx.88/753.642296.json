Emerson, </em>270 F.3d 203, 260-65 (5th Cir.2001), Lastrapes argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional in that it violates the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. He further argues that the provision is overbroad, it violates the Tenth Amendment by impinging on an area of law reserved to the States, and violates the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">This court has rejected the proposition that <em>Emerson </em>suggests that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) violates the Second Amendment. <em>United States v. Darrington, </em>351 F.3d 632, 634 (5th Cir.2003). In <em>Barring-ton, </em>the court held that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) does not violate the Second Amendment, the Tenth Amendment, the Commerce Clause, or principles of equal protection. <em>Id. </em>at 633-35. Thus, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is not unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">Lastrapes further argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause because it does not require a \u201csubstantial\u201d effect on interstate commerce. He alternatively argues that his indictment was defective for failing to charge that the offense had a substantial effect on interstate commerce and that the factual basis for his guilty plea was insufficient because the evidence established only that the firearm was manufactured out of state and had traveled across state lines at some unspecified time in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-14\">Lastrapes raised these arguments solely to preserve them for possible Supreme Court review. As he acknowledges, his arguments are foreclosed by existing Fifth Circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b796-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
