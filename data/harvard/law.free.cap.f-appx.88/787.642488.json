He first argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained from the search of his home. He specifically challenges the district court\u2019s finding that his consent was an act of independent free will. After close examination of the underlying facts, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>court holds that the district court did not err in finding that Maldonado\u2019s consent was an act of independent free will. <em>See United States v. Kelley, </em>981 F.2d 1464, 1471-72 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Maldonado argues that the district court erred by failing to decrease his sentence for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. As Maldonado has failed to show that the district court\u2019s denial of an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility was without foundation, that denial must be affirmed. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>174 F.3d 515, 525 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Maldonado also argues that the district court\u2019s application of an upward adjustment for obstruction of justice, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, to his sentence was erroneous because the district court\u2019s findings that the adjustment was warranted by Maldonado\u2019s perjured testimony at the suppression hearing were insufficiently specific. Close examination of the record shows that the district court made sufficiently specific findings regarding the adjustment for obstruction of justice. <em>See United States v. Storm, </em>36 F.3d 1289, 1295 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b829-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
