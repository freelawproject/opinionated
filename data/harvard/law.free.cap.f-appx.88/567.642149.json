We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s orders and find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-21\">Fuller\u2019s underlying complaint and motion for reconsideration make clear that he is challenging the validity of an allegedly unconstitutional conviction or sentence, either or both, and that he seeks release from incarceration. However, because Fuller did not make any showing that his conviction has been successfully challenged or overturned, his \u00a7 1983 complaint was subject to dismissal pursuant to <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 complaint on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-23\">In addition, we find that the district court\u2019s denial of Fuller\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion was not an abuse of discretion. <em>Temkin v. Frederick County Comm\u2019rs, </em>945 F.2d 716, 724 (4th Cir.1991). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
