Hodges filed a \u201chybrid\u201d complaint under \u00a7 301(a) of the Labor-Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a) (2000) against Phillip Morris USA, Inc. and the Bakery, Confectionary, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union, AFL-CIO-CLC. Hodges claimed she was discharged by Phillip Morris without just cause in violation of the collective bargaining agreement and the Union breached its duty of fair representation. She appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to the Defendants. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Higgins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>863 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir.1988). Summary judgment is appropriate only if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 324-25, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). We must view the factual evidence, and all justifiable inferences drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">As a hybrid complaint under \u00a7 301, a cause of action will lie against Phillip Morris only if the Union breached its duty of fair representation. <em>Thompson v. Aluminum Co. of America, </em>276 F.3d 651, 656 (4th Cir.2002). A union is found to have breached its duty of fair representation if it acted \u201carbitrarily, discriminatorily or in bad faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 657. \u201cThe union\u2019s conduct must be grossly deficient or in reckless disregard of the member\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>Ash v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>800 F.2d 409, 411 (4th Cir.1986) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">We find the Union did not breach its duty of fair representation. Its conduct was not arbitrary. Nor is there any evidence of discrimination or bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
