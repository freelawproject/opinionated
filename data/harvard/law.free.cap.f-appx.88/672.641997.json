We previously remanded this case to the district court for the limited purpose of determining when Burl delivered the motion to prison officials for mailing. <em>See Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988) (holding that prisoner\u2019s legal materials are deemed filed on the date they are deposited with prison officials for mailing). On remand, the district court found that Burl delivered his motion to prison officials pursuant to the \u201csystem designed for legal mail\u201d on June 17, 2003, one week after the expiration of the time limitation provided in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-22\">An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue for claims addressed by a district court absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find both that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Burl has not made the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-23\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
