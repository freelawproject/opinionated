New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Yanez concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-24\">Yanez also argues that the supervised release condition barring his possession of \u201cany other dangerous weapon\u201d must be stricken from the written judgment because it conflicts with the sentence as orally pronounced by the district court. The Sentencing Guidelines recommend that all defendants who have been convicted of a felony be prohibited from possessing any dangerous weapon during the term of supervised release. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.3(d)(l). \u201cIf the district court orally imposes a sentence without stating the conditions applicable to this period of supervision, the judgment\u2019s inclusion of conditions that are mandatory, standard, or recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines does not create a conflict with the oral pronouncement.\u201d <em>United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 938 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-25\">Therefore, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b800-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
