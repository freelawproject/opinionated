Under the applicable section of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, his base offense level was determined to be 40. The corresponding Guidelines range was 292 to 365 months. Douglas was sentenced to 300 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">In 1994, the Sentencing Commission adopted Amendment 505, which reduced the maximum base offense level for Douglas\u2019 offense from 42 to 38. The amendment was made retroactively applicable under USSG \u00a7 1B1.10. Based on this amendment, Douglas filed a motion to modify his sentence. The district court denied his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">The decision to reduce a sentence based on an amendment to the sentencing guidelines is discretionary. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (2000); <em>United States v. Legree, </em>205 F.3d 724, 727 (4th Cir.2000). Thus, the district court\u2019s decision not to reduce Douglas\u2019 sentence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Dorrough, </em>84 F.3d 1309, 1311 (10th Cir.1996). Douglas contends that in denying his motion for a reduced sentence, the district court impermissibly relied upon his unwillingness to cooperate with the Government and his refusal to testify at trial. However, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the district court relied on Douglas\u2019 uncooperativeness and his refusal to testify. Instead, the record indicates that the district court considered the relevant factors listed in section 3553, and declined to grant Douglas a modified sentence on the basis of those factors. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000) (providing a list of relevant factors the district court must consider in every sentencing). Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion. <em>Dorrough, </em>84 F.3d at 1311.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-13\">We affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
