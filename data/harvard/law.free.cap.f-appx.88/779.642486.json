He argues that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 952, and 960 were rendered facially unconstitutional by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He concedes that his argument is foreclosed by our opinion in <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 581-82 (5th Cir.2000), which rejected a broad <em>Appren</em>di-based attack on the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. He raises the issue only to preserve it for Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-23\"><em>Slaughter </em>applies directly to Gonzalez\u2019s drug-possession conviction and by analogy to his drug-importation conviction, given the similarities between 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) <em>&amp; </em>(b) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952 and \u00a7 960(a)(1) &amp; (b). His appeal is foreclosed by <em>Slaughter, </em>and the judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b821-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
