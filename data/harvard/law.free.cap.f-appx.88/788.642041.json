Morales petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision to deny his application for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act. He argues that the BIA erred in determining that he was not persecuted based upon his being in a particular social group.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-22\">This court will uphold the findings that an alien is not eligible for asylum or withholding if those findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). Under this standard, the BIA\u2019s determination will be affirmed unless the \u201cevidence compels a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The evidence presented to the BIA does not compel the conclusion that Morales was persecuted based on his association in a particular social group. <em>See Carbajal-Gonzalez, </em>78 F.3d at 197; <em>Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Adebisi v. INS, </em>952 F.2d 910, 912 (5th Cir.1992). To be eligible for withholding of deportation, an alien must demonstrate a \u201cclear probability\u201d of persecution upon return. <em>Faddoul, </em>37 F.3d at 188. Because Morales failed to show a well-founded fear of persecution on a protected ground as required for asylum, he also failed to show a clear probability of persecution as required by the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b830-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
