The Board adopted the opinion of the IJ that concluded Ketevi failed to present credible evidence establishing past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1158 (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2003); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000). We have reviewed the administrative record, the IJ\u2019s decision, and the Board\u2019s conclusion, and find that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s ruling that Ketevi failed to establish his refugee status. We have reviewed the IJ\u2019s credibility determinations and conclude that they are supported by specific, cogent reasoning, and therefore are entitled to substantial deference. <em>Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">We conclude as well that Ketevi is not entitled to withholding of removal under INA \u00a7 241 or the Convention Against Torture. Based on our review of the record and of the IJ\u2019s decision denying relief, we hold that the IJ did not err in finding that Ketevi failed to show a \u201cclear probability of persecution,\u201d or that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he would face torture if he returned to Togo. <em>See Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (\u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2003) (stating that to qualify for protection under the Convention Against Torture, an alien must show \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">We reject Ketevi\u2019s arguments that the Board did not properly apply the regulations governing affirmance without opinion, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2003). We deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
