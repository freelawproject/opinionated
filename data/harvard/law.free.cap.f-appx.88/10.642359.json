Affording his arguments de novo review, we affirm. <em>E.g., Skotak v. Tenneco Resins, Inc., </em>953 F.2d 909, 912 (5th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-17\">We reject Irvin\u2019s contention that summary judgment was improper because genuine issues of material fact exist regarding whether the grease was an \u201copen and obvious\u201d hazard and, therefore, whether the United States Military Sealift Command (\u201cUnited States\u201d) breached its \u201cturnover duty.\u201d In general, the defendant has not breached its turnover duty if the injury-causing defect was \u201copen and obvious and one that the longshoreman should have seen.\u201d <em>See Pimental v. LTD Canadian Pac. Bulk, </em>965 F.2d 13, 16 (5th Cir. 1992). It is indisputable from Irvin\u2019s own testimony that the grease was distinguishable from the hatch cover/ledge, despite the fact that both were varying shades of grey. Moreover, although Irvin testified that he did not see any grease on the hatch cover or ledge, he also conceded that when he stepped onto the ledge, he was not looking where he was going. Consequently, he has not shown that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether the defect was \u201copen and obvious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-18\">Irvin\u2019s argument that the United States breached its \u201cactive control duty\u201d fails to assign error to the district court\u2019s determination that even if the requisite area was under the requisite control of the vessel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>owner, as a matter of law the vessel owner did not breach its active control duty because it exercised due care by providing Irvin with a safe, alternate path via the portable steps. He therefore waived its review. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Finally, the United States had no duty to intervene. <em>See Scindia Steam Navigation Co. v. De Los Santos, </em>451 U.S. 156, 175-76, 101 S.Ct. 1614, 68 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981). Even if it is assumed <em>arguendo </em>that the vessel\u2019s crew had actual knowledge that grease was emanating from the vessel\u2019s crane, Handlin Marine, Inc.\u2019s, employees had routinely removed the grease themselves without incident; consequently, it cannot be said that the vessel owner had actual knowledge that the defect posed an unreasonable risk of harm or that it could not rely on Handlin Marine\u2019s employees to remedy the defect. <em>See Greenwood v. Societe Francaise De, </em>111 F.3d 1239, 1248 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b55-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
