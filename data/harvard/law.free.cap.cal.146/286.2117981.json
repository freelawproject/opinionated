Defendant made a motion for a new trial, which was denied, and now prosecutes this appeal from the order denying his motion. He claims that the evidence is insufficient to justify the judgment and decision, and that certain errors of law occurred during the trial to his prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The contract upon which the action depends is as follows:\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhQ\">\u201cLos Angeles, Cal., May 16, 1902.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">\u201cReceived of Samuel M. Bird five dollars as deposit and part of the purchase price of lot twenty-one, block \u2018D\u2019 of the Potter\u2019s Woodlawn Tract. Full purchase price to be $450.00. This deposit is taken subject to the approval of the owner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">\u201cW. I. Hollingsworth &amp; Co.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">\u201cThomas McD. Potter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">The name of the owner, Thomas McD. Potter, was signed to the contract after it had been first signed by his agent, W. I. Hollingsworth &amp; Co. The five dollars was paid by plaintiff at the time the writing was given to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">It is claimed by appellant that he never received an adequate consideration for the contract; that it was not binding upon plaintiff, because he did not agree to pay the $450 for the lot, and hence, the contract not being mutual, cannot be enforced in a court of equity. The claim is without merit. The contract is in writing, subscribed by the party to be charged, describes the land to be conveyed, and names the consideration for which defendant agreed to convey. Time is not made the essence of the contract. No demand was ever made by defendant for the balance of the purchase price, and the court finds that \u2018\u2018on the 10th day of December, 1902, plaintiff offered to said defendant, Thomas McDaniels Potter, the sum of $445, in U. S. gold coin,\u201d and demanded of said defendant a deed for said lot, and that defendant refused to accept the said $445, or to give plaintiff a deed for said lot. This finding is supported by the evidence, and not questioned. If the amount named as the purchase price was not adequate, the defendant should have so determined in his own mind before he signed the contract, but having signed it and stated the amount for which he would sell the lot, he must live up to it. Any other rule would make the contract worthless and mere waste paper. Defendant knew the meaning of it when he signed it, and the price for which he agreed to sell the lot. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>It is true that the contract was not mutual, as plaintiff did not agree to purchase, but the remedy became mutual upon the tender of the performance by plaintiff. It is not necessary to refer to the many decisions in support of the above principle, because it is the rule laid down in section 3388 of the Civil Code, which reads: \u201cA party who has signed a written contract may be compelled specifically to perform it, though the other party has not signed it, if the latter has performed, or offers to perform it on his part, and the case is otherwise proper for enforcing specific performance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">In this case the plaintiff has offered to perform it on his part, and the case is certainly a proper one for enforcing specific performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The rule is correctly stated in <em>Hay </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>141 Cal. 723, where it is said: \u201cIf the option, or offer to convey, by defendant had been for a price named, although unilateral and signed by defendant only, it would have been binding upon him, if subsequently, and prior to its withdrawal by defendant, plaintiffs acted upon it, and tendered the price to be paid. In such case the contract or offer, although not mutual when first signed by defendant, would have become so by the price <em>being </em>paid or tendered.\u201d That ease was cited with approval and the same rule recognized in <em>Nason </em>v. <em>Lingle, </em>143 Cal. 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Appellant also claims that there was an independent verbal agreement made at the time of the writing to the effect that defendant was to construct a house for plaintiff upon the lot, and that the house and lot were, to be sold together.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">If it be conceded that such evidence of an oral contract was admissible, it is sufficient that the court found that no agreement was made by plaintiff and defendant \u201cconcerning the building of a house for plaintiff; and that there was no definite \u201cor certain promise made by plaintiff to said defendant or to any one for him concerning the building of said house.\u201d This finding is supported by the evidence. Other findings are questioned, and we have examined them and find that so far as material they are supported by the evidence. The court found upon all the material issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">The appellant in his brief, under the heading \u201cErrors of law occurring at the trial and excepted to by defendant,\u201d says: \u201cThe errors here designated (fols. 189-194) we will submit to the court for consideration upon the argument and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>citations heretofore made. The questions of the defendant to which objections were sustained were each, under the pleadings, competent, relevant, and material, which were the grounds of the objections made to them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The questions and rulings are in no other way pointed out, nor discussed. By turning to the transcript (fols. 189-194) we find four questions and rulings specified as error, with a reference to the folio and page where each can be found. We have looked at the folio and page referred to in each case and do not find any one of the questions. We have not the time nor the inclination to make an independent search of the record in order to find such questions and rulings. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McLean, </em>135 Cal. 309; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cebulla, </em>137 Cal. 318.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Appellant claims \u201cthat no finding is made upon the issue that defendant never received any adequate consideration for the alleged agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The court found \u201cthat at that time, namely the 16th day of May, 1902, the said sum of $450 was the reasonable value of said lot; and that the said contract was and now is fair and just.\u201d It is admitted that plaintiff paid defendant five dollars and tendered him $445, which he declined. It is thus shown that defendant declined to receive \u201cthe adequate consideration\u201d for which he agreed to sell the lot. The judgment protects defendant\u2019s rights, as it directs a deed to be executed and delivered to plaintiff, upon payment \u201cof said sum of four hundred and forty-five dollars and interest thereon at the rate of seven per cent per annum from the 10th day of December, 1902.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">It follows that the order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Gray, C., and Harrison, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">Van Dyke, J., Shaw, J., Angellotti, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
