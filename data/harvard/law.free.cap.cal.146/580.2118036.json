B. Plumb, the owner thereof. Six of the parties, including the plaintiff, agreed to and did subscribe five hundred dollars each, and a seventh party to the contract, named J. R. Burnham, subscribed fifteen hundred, making an entire fund of forty-five hundred dollars, \u201cfor the purpose of securing said lease and prospecting said land.\u201d It was agreed that \u201ceach subscriber shall own and be entitled to an interest in said lease and mining privilege in proportion as the amount he subscribes is to the whole amount subscribed, when the whole amount of said subscription shall have been paid up.\u201d It was also agreed that \u201csaid sums so subscribed shall be paid into the hands of said A. T..Eastland in payments of equal proportion to the sum subscribed at such time or times and in such sums as shall be designated and fixed by said A. T. Eastland. And if any subscriber shall fail or refuse or neglect to make such payments at the time so designated by said A. T. Eastland and the same shall remain unpaid for the period of ten (10) days after the date set for such payment, and after the same should have been paid, then, and in that case, such delinquent subscriber or subscribers immediately forfeit all interest and rights in said lease and mining privileges and shall forfeit all moneys that he or they shall have paid under this agreement. \u2019 \u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">On the day following the execution of the above agreement, May 18, 1901, said W. B. Plumb, one of the defendants herein, entered into an agreement Avith the plaintiff and other defendants for the purpose of carrying out the purposes of the first agreement. It was agreed on the part of Plumb that he \u201chereby grants to said parties of the second part the exclusive right to enter upon the lands hereinafter described, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>prospect and mine the' same for the term of six years from and after the 18th day of May, 1901.\u201d The right to use the land for agricultural and grazing purposes was reserved to the owner, Plumb. The second parties agreed to pay to the first party fifteen per cent \u201cof the gross amount of all gold so extracted,\u201d or at their option in lieu of the above-named consideration they could within six months pay ten thousand dollars as the full consideration for said \u201cexclusive right and privilege to mine as aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">It appears from the evidence and findings that soon after the execution of these instruments, and in that same month of May, the said Eastland designated and fixed the sum of one hundred dollars to be paid by plaintiff and each of the other parties interested with him on account of their several subscriptions. One of the subscribing parties, James Wing, it appears, had already paid the entire amount of his five-hundred-dollar subscription. The plaintiff and the other subscribing defendants, except Wing, were duly notified of the fixing of this hundred-dollar sum as due from each of them, and all of them paid up within the ten days given them, except the plaintiff. The plaintiff refused and neglected to pay anything, and \u201cpersistently and willfully declined and refused to participate in, or to have anything to do with the work, enterprise or undertaking referred to in said agreements.\u201d Time and again he declared that he was out of it and was glad of it; that defendants were \u201ca bad lot\u201d; that he had \u201cnot paid in,\u201d and was not going to pay anything or have anything at all to do with the matter. The court finds that \u201cever since the twenty-first day of May, 1901, the plaintiff has repudiated, disavowed, withdrawn from, deserted and abandoned said work, enterprise, undertaking, agreements and all the duties, obligations, options and benefits thereof.\u201d In the mean time the other parties to the agreement, recognizing that plaintiff was \u201cout of it,\u201d proceeded to prospect the ground at an expense to them of much more than the original amounts subscribed, and finally, as appears, in about October, 1901, struck a rich mine, and have since worked the same with considerable profit. Plaintiff has done nothing at any time and contributed nothing toward the discovery, development, or working of this mine.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">On the foregoing facts we are Of opinion that plaintiff was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>not entitled to the relief prayed for. The plaintiff is or was a party to both the contracts above referred to, and as they were both intended for the accomplishment of one purpose, so far as plaintiff is concerned, th\u00bfy should be construed together as one contract. The plaintiff, after having neglected and refused to perform any part of his agreement, after standing by for five months watching the other parties spending their money in search of this gold that no one knew existed, all the time declaring that he was \u201cout of it\u201d and would have nothing to do with it, doing what he could to discourage the enterprise, now seeks in this equitable action to compel the defendants to share with him the profits of their industry and expenditure of moneys. This he cannot do in a court of equity. He who asks equity must do equity. He who seeks to enforce a contract must show that he has complied with the conditions and agreements of the contract on his part to be performed. (Civ. Code, sec. 1439.) Plaintiff failed and refused to pay any part of the amounts he agreed to pay, and thereby by the very terms of the contract forfeited any right that he may ever have had in the property in dispute. It makes no difference whether we call the agreement executed by Plumb a lease or a mere \u201cmining privilege,\u201d and the statute of frauds has nothing to do with the case. Plaintiff could have no rights in equity and no right to be heard in a court of equity until he did the equitable thing by his associates and performed his part of the agreement. To give him an interest in this mine and the proceeds thereof now would be the grossest injustice to his co-e\u00a1ontractors. A court of equity will not countenance such an injustice. On the most familiar principles of equity it is clear that the trial court sitting as a court of equity was fully warranted in denying the plaintiff all relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">We advise that the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Chipman, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Shaw, J., Angellotti, J., Van Dyke, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
