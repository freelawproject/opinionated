The plaintiff had judgment; and the appeal is by the defendant from an order denying his motion for a new trial. From the findings it appears that all the proceedings before the board of supervisors were regular. But the finding as to the bond to accompany the petition required by sections 2682 and 2683 of the Political Code is attacked as not justified by the evidence; as is also the finding as to the deposit in the treasury of the twenty-five dollars allowed as damages by the viewers\u2014 as required by the proviso in section 2689 of the same code.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">As to the bond, the objections are: \u201cThat the bond is joint, and no liability is fixed on the principal,\u201d and, consequently, none on the sureties; and that in the recitals of the bond the petition is inaccurately referred to as praying for a road \u201cover the land of\u201d defendant. But as to the latter point, the description given is none the less accurate, because the road was also over the land of Helm\u2014who was one of the petitioners; nor\u2014provided the identity of the petition referred to remain sufficiently clear\u2014would a mistake in the recitals in the bond affect its validity. Nor\u2014assuming for the purpose of the decision that, under the provisions of section 2690 of the Political Code, objections to the bond can be considered\u2014is the other objection more tenable. By the terms of the bond the principal and each of the sureties are bound in the sum of one hundred dollars, and the bond is therefore both joint and several for that amount. Nor would the effect of the bond have been altered had the words erased from the penal clause\u2014which purport to bind the parties \u201cjointly and severally\u201d\u2014been suffered to remain.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The objection to the finding as to the deposit of the twenty-five dollars damages is also untenable. It is not disputed that this amount was deposited in the treasury by Helm, as a party interested in the road, under the proviso in section 2689 of the Political Code cited, or that it was kept separate from the county moneys; which was all that was required. The provisions of the section requiring the damages \u201cto be set apart in the treasury out of the proper fund\u201d applies only to the county moneys, and not to moneys paid by a private party under the proviso. Nor; have the provisions of section 4145 of the Political Code, relating to auditor\u2019s certificate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>any application to such moneys. <em>(Heppe </em>v. <em>Johnson, 73 </em>Cal. 265.)</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">I advise that the order appealed from be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Gray, C., and Cooper, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">McFarland, J., Lorigan, J., Henshaw, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
