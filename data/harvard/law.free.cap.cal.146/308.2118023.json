Prohibition lies only when the threatened proceedings are without or in excess of the jurisdiction of\u201d the tribunal .sought to be prohibited. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1102.)</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">\u2022 The defendant was charged by the indictment with having, in the city and county of San Francisco, committed a public offense, triable by the superior court of that city and county. Such an indictment having been presented, it was the duty of the court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction, to proceed thereunder in the usual mode, with a view to a determination of the issues \u2022 proposed thereby, and it was and is open to the defendant to show to the court having such jurisdiction, in response to any showing that may be made by the prosecution, any reason why, if originally guilty of the offense charged, he could not be convicted thereof. He says to this court in this independent proceeding, in effect, that although he may have committed the offense charged he cannot be found guilty thereof, for the reason that he testified concerning the same for the prosecution before the grand jury that found the indictment. His claim in this regard may be well founded, in view of the provisions of section 64 of the Penal Code, but his position, so far as the jurisdiction of the court in which the indictment is pending is concerned, is precisely the same as if he here alleged that the statute of limitations had run against the offense prior to the finding of the indictment, or that he had heretofore been acquitted of the offense, or had once been in jeopardy for such offense. His claim, if well founded in fact, is a full and complete defense to the charge .against him, but it is, like the other defenses just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>enumerated, nothing more than a defense, and, like all other defenses, including that of a denial of the truth of the allegations of the indictment, must be presented for determination as to its sufficiency to the tribunal having jurisdiction of the proceeding, which, in the exercise of its jurisdiction, will determine as to the sufficiency of the defense, and any error committed by such court in the exercise of its jurisdiction in regard thereto can be corrected on an appeal. It must necessarily be for the court in which a charge against a person for a public offense within its jurisdiction is pending to determine as to any and all defenses offered thereto, and in so determining it cannot be held to be acting in excess of its jurisdiction. It may act erroneously, but the remedy for its error in this regard is not to be found in a writ which lies only to prohibit acts in excess of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Section 1020 of the Penal Code provides that \u201cAll matters of fact tending to establish a defense, other than that specified in the third and fourth subdivisions of section one thousand and sixteen\u201d (former conviction or acquittal and once in jeopardy), \u201cmay be given in evidence under a plea of not guilty.\u201d Under his plea of not guilty defendant may therefore show the facts here alleged, just as he could show a defense under the statute of limitations, and if improperly denied his rights in this regard may have the error corrected on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">It probably would not be contended that there was any doubt as to the correctness of what has been said, as applied to the defense of limitations. Reliance is placed here upon the language of section 64, that \u201cno prosecution can afterwards be had against such witness,\u2019\u2019 as placing any such prosecution beyond and outside of the jurisdiction of any court. We cannot construe this language as taking from the court in which a criminal proceeding is pending the jurisdiction to determine whether or not such proceeding is barred by reason of facts bringing the case within the provisions of said section 64. The precise question here presented has not been decided in any case that has come to our attention, but in the cases involving the question as to whether statutory provisions substantially similar to those of section 64 furnish all The protection guaranteed by the constitutional provisions to the effect that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>to be a witness against himself, and a witness consequently be compelled to testify thereunder, it has been recognized wherever the matter was suggested that the exemption given by the statute is purely a master of defense. \u2019 Thus, in the case of <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>161 U. S. 591, where the statute provided that no person so testifying \u201cshall be prosecuted or subjected to any p\u00e9nalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing, concerning which he may testify,\u201d it was decided by the United States supreme court by a bare majority that the statute did furnish all the protection guaranteed by the constitution, but it -was recognized by both the majority and minority opinions that a person so-testifying, if afterwards prosecuted, must, under such statute, prove his immunity by way of confession and avoidance. In the majority opinion (p. 608) it was said: \u201cThe same answer may be made to the suggestion that the witness is imperfectly protected by reason of the fact that he may still be prosecuted and put to the annoyance and expense of pleading his immunity by way of confession and avoidance. This is a detriment which the law does not recognize. There is a possibility that any citizen, however innocent, may be subjected to a civil or criminal prosecution, and put to the expense of defending himself, but unless such prosecution be malicious, he is remediless, except so far as a recovery of costs may partially indemnify him.\u201d In the minority opinion it was said (p. 621), speaking of the clause \u201cno person shall be prosecuted\u201d: \u201cHow possibly can effect be given to this provision if taken literally. . . . When an indictment has been found, and the accused has been called upon to plead to it, he assuredly has been <em>prosecuted. </em>So that all that can be said is. that the witness is <em>not </em>protected by the provision in question from being <em>prosecuted, </em>but thai he has been furnished a good plea to the indictment, which will secure his acquittal. But is that true? Not unless the plea is sustained by competent evidence. His condition, then, is that he has been prosecuted, been compelled, presumably, to furnish bail, and put to the trouble and expense of employing counsel and furnishing the evidence to make good his plea.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">' In <em>State </em>v. <em>Nowell, </em>58 N. H. 314, the statute discussed provided \u201cnor shall he\u2019 be thereafter prosecuted for any offense \u2019 so disclosed\u2019 by himj\u201d The court, speaking of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>the objection that the witness might be called on to defend against a subsequent prosecution, said: \u201cIt is true that a witness who discloses may afterwards be wrongfully prosecuted for the offense disclosed, notwithstanding the statutory exemptiofi. But the witness has, under the statute, all the protection which the common-law right, adopted by the bill of rights in the common-law sense, gives him. . . . The legal protection of the witness against prosecution for crime disclosed by him is, in law, equivalent to his legal innocence of the crime disclosed. So far as his constitutional right is concerned, the case is as if the express provision of the statute were that a clerk, servant, or agent testifying against his principal is not guilty of such violations of chapter 99 as he discloses. The witness, regarded in law as innocent if prosecuted for a crime which he has been compelled by the statute to disclose, will stand as well as other innocent persons; and it was not the design of the common-law maxim, affirmed by the bill of rights, that he should stand any better. Were the case put by the respondent to occur, improbable as it may seem, he could plead and show that he had disclosed the same offense upon a lawful accusation against his principal, and thus make a perfect answer in bar or abatement of the prosecution against himself. Having testified, there would be as to him no statute authorizing a prosecution. . . . The indictment would be dismissed, or a verdict ordered in his favor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">It has been held in many cases that a witness is not exempted under the constitutional provision, in the absence of any statutory provision exempting him from prosecution for offenses concerning which he is asked to testify, from testifying concerning any offense which is, as to him, barred by the statute of limitations. (See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>161 U. S. 598, and cases there cited.) The reason for such ruling is, that he is immune from legal punishment for any such offense because of the running of the statute. He may be prosecuted for such offense, but the statute of limitations affords him a legal defense therefor, which is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the constitutional provision. Such, doubtless, would also be the rule where the witness had been pardoned as to the offense, or had been finally convicted or acquitted thereof, or had once been in jeopardy thereon. The effect of the decisions is that a statute exempting a witness from all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>liability to punishment for any offense in reference to which he may testify, affords protection equal to that given by the constitutional provision, and that under such a statute he may be compelled to testify. Such is the ruling of the supreme court of the United States upon a constitutional provision which is practically the same as ours <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>161 U. S. 591), and the ruling of this court in <em>Ex parte Cohen, </em>104 Cal. 524,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in considering section 32 of the Purity of Election Law of 1893 (Stats. 1893, p. 26). That section not only provided that the person testifying \u201cshall not thereafter be liable to indictment or presentment by information, nor to prosecution or punishment for the offense with reference to which his testimony was given,\u201d but also that he \u201cmay plead or prove the giving of testimony accordingly in bar of such indictment, -information, or prosecution.\u201d The section was fully as strong regarding exemption from prosecution as is section 64 of the Penal Code<em> </em>of it this court said: \u201cThe statute purports to compel him to testify\u201d in the same manner as any other person, and as the equivalent for his constitutional protection gives him a legislative protection of equal scope and effect by <em>exempting him from all liability to punishment </em>for the offense with reference to which he testifies. The exemption is as broad as the compulsion, and the protection is equal to that given by the constitution. ... If, in giving such testimony, the testimony has reference to another offense committed by himself, he is within the protection of the statute, and upon any prosecution for such offense is authorized to plead or prove in bar thereof that under the compulsion of this section he gave testimony with reference to such offense.\u201d It is true that the statute there expressly provided that the witness might plead or prove the giving of testimony in bar of the indictment or information, but such provision was entirely unnecessary, in view of the express provision of section 1020 of the Penal Code, heretofore cited. It also provided that the witness \u201cshall not thereafter be liable to indictment . . . nor t&lt;j prosecution, \u2019 \u2019 making it practically the same in this regard as section 64 of the Penal Code. If the court in which the indictment is pending is, under said section 64, without jurisdiction to hear and determine as to the sufficiency of such a defense, so also it must have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>been without jurisdiction so to do in a case arising under the section considered in <em>Ex parte Cohen, </em>104 Cal. 524.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">The language of section 64 of the Penal Code is certainly no stronger than that used by our law relative to jeopardy and former conviction or acquittal. The constitution provides, in terms, that no person shall be twice put in jeopardy for the same offense (art. I, sec. 13), and it is provided by section 687 of the Penal Code that \u201cNo person can be subjected to a second prosecution for a public offense for which he has once been prosecuted and convicted or acquitted.\u201d Yet, in the face of this language, it is thoroughly settled that jeopardy, former conviction, and former acquittal are available to a defendant only <em>by way of defense, </em>and under the provisions of sections 1017 and 1020 of the Penal Code matters of fact tending to establish such defenses can be given in evidence only under the special pleas provided for in subdivisions 3 and 4 of said section 1017. If such defenses are not tendered by such special pleas, they are waived, and despite the peremptory language of section 13 of article I of the constitution, and section 687 of the Penal Code, cannot operate to save the defendant from conviction and punishment. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lee Yune Chong, </em>94 Cal. 379, 387; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stoll, </em>143 Cal. 689, 696.) Under the provisions of section 1020 of the Penal Code, the defense here invoked is available under the plea of \u201cnot guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The object of all such provisions as those contained in section 64 of the Penal Code is simply to provide one coming within its terms with an absolute legal defense to any prosecution that may thereafter be instituted against him for any offense concerning which he may have testified. The section simply means that the showing of the facts therein stated, when made to the court having jurisdiction of the case, shall be a full and complete defense to any prosecution thereafter instituted. So construed, it, under the decisions, satisfies the constitutional guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">It is unnecessary to here determine whether the indictment should have been dismissed by the superior court, upon the motion for dismissal made by petitioner upon the grounds here urged in support of the application for a writ of prohibition. If the court erred in denying the motion, its error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>can be rectified upon an appeal from any judgment that may hereafter be pronounced.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\">It is suggested that the indictment fails to state a public offense, for the reason that the oath which the defendant omitted and refused to administer, is in violation of section 5 of article II of the constitution of California, which provides as follows: \u201cAll elections by the people shall be by ballot or by such other method as may be prescribed by law; provided, <em>that secrecy in voting be preserved.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">The oath mentioned, to be taken by avoter challenged on the ground that he has not a <em>bona fide </em>present intention of supporting the nominees of the party in whose nominating convention he seeks to participate by voting for delegates thereto, is one to the effect that he has a present <em>bona fide </em>intention to support the nominees of such convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Assuming that the question thus raised is one that may properly be determined in this proceeding, it is manifest that there is nothing in the point thus made. By section 2 of the same article of the constitution, adopted in the year 1900, the legislature is expressly empowered to determine the tests and conditions upon which electors may participate in any primary election, and there is nothing in a provision enacted by the legislature in pursuance of this authority, requiring one seeking to participate in isueh an election as a member of any particular party, to openly declare his allegiance to such party, which in any degree violates the constitutional provision invoked. Such a declaration is absolutely essential to the proper working of any primary law. By his mere offer to vote for delegates to a convention of any party, the elector does, in effect, declare his intention to support the nominees of such convention, and the oath is provided for as a guaranty of the truth of the declaration already made by such offer to vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The alternative writ of prohibition heretofore issued is discharged, and the petition for a writ of prohibition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Shaw, J., Van Dyke, J., Beatty, C.
