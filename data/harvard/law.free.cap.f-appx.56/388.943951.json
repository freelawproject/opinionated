We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997). We review for substantial evidence factual determinations concerning a petitioner\u2019s eligibility for asylum, and must uphold them unless the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 &amp; n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">We conclude that the BIA\u2019s determination that Sonko did not demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of any enumerated ground is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Pra-sad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 338 (9th Cir.1995). Sonko testified that in Gambia he was a member of Fulan Kafo, a charitable organization. After he left Gambia, several members of the Fulan Kafo were arrested for their participation in a mass strike. We agree that this is insufficient evidence to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-13\">Sonko, in failing to qualify for asylum, necessarily failed to satisfy the more stringent standard required to establish eligibility for withholding of deportation. <em>See Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-14\">We do not consider Sonko\u2019s contention that the IJ failed to provide cogent reasons for finding Sonko not credible because the BIA conducted a de novo review and our review is therefore limited to the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Molina-Morales v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 1048,1050 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b425-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
