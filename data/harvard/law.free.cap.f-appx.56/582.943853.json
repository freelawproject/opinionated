We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">For years, Herman Sizemore was employed by Consolidated Rail Corporation (\u201cConrail\u201d) as a \u201cyardmaster,\u201d a job essentially requiring him to manage the day-today operations of a train yard. In addition to performing his regular duties, Sizemore also frequently served as the acting \u201ctrain-master\u201d \u2014 a position of substantially higher responsibility \u2014 during periods in which the actual trainmaster was on leave. Between 1992 and 1998, Sizemore actively sought a permanent position as a Conrail trainmas-ter, applying through Conrail\u2019s voluntary internal placement system for approximately fifty vacant trainmaster positions throughout Conrail\u2019s network. During that period, Sizemore was interviewed for only two of those positions, and was never hired. In 1999, Sizemore accepted a train-master position offered to him by Conrail\u2019s successor, Norfolk Southern, and he continues to hold that position today.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-14\">Sizemore brought suit against Conrail under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et. seq. </em>(\u201cADA\u201d), and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 <em>et seq., </em>claiming that Conrail discriminated against him because of his hearing condition. Sizemore suffers from a hearing impairment that is essentially corrected by his continual use of visible hearing aids in both ears. Although Sizemore\u2019s condition is not actually disabling given his use of corrective aids, Sizemore alleged that Conrail refused to hire him for vacant trainmaster positions because it regarded him as disabled under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2). In early 2002, the District Court granted Conrail\u2019s motion for summary judgment, holding that Sizemore had failed to come forth with sufficient evidence that Conrail regarded him as disabled with regard to the major life activity of working. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-15\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1343, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is plenary, and we examine the record using the same standard as the District Court, considering whether the plaintiff has established a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See, e.g., Wit-kowski v. Welch, </em>173 F.3d 192, 198 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-16\">After reviewing the record and hearing oral argument, we are convinced that Conrail was entitled to judgment as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>matter of law. In order to establish a prima facie case under the ADA, Sizemore must be able to show that he (1) has a disability, (2) is a qualified individual, and (3) has suffered an adverse employment action because of that disability. <em>Deane v. Pocono Medical Center, </em>142 F.3d 138, 142 (3d Cir.1998) (en banc); <em>see also Gaul v. Lucent Techs. Inc., </em>134 F.3d 576, 580 (3d Cir.1998). Yet Sizemore has failed to produce any evidence indicating that Conrad\u2019s employment decisions were made as a result of discrimination based on his perceived disability. Sizemore\u2019s reliance on certain comments made about him by other Conrad employees is unconvincing; the comments in question were few and limited in nature, and were made by non-supervisory employees who had no real involvement in Conrad\u2019s employment decisions. Further, there is no evidence in the record that the trainmaster position is any different \u2014 for hearing purposes \u2014 than the yardmaster position Sizemore actually held at' Conrad. In sum, there are simply no established facts that could possibly raise an inference of a causal link between Size-more\u2019s hearing condition, or Conrad\u2019s perception of it, and the adverse employment decisions. Summary judgment in favor of Conrad was therefore plainly warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">We do agree with Sizemore, however, that the District Court appears to have based its ruling on an incorrect reading of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>527 U.S. 471, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999). The District Court found that Sizemore\u2019s claim was legady insufficient because he had provided no evidence that Conrail regarded him as disabled with regard to a \u201cbroad class of jobs,\u201d as required by <em>Sutton, Id. </em>at 491. Yet <em>Sutton </em>involved a plaintiff claiming that the employer regarded him as disabled with regard to the major life activity of working, <em>id. </em>at 490, and it is <em>that </em>type of claim that requires evidence about a class of positions. <em>Id. </em>at 491 (\u2018When the major life activity under consideration is that of <em>working, </em>the statutory phrase \u2018substantially limits\u2019 requires, at a minimum, that plaintiffs allege they are unable to work in a broad class of jobs.\u201d (emphasis added)). Sutton did not argue, as he could have, that the employer regarded him as disabled with regard to his sight. <em>Id. </em>at 490. Here, in contrast, Sizemore has not made a \u201cworking\u201d claim, but has instead framed his complaint as being that Conrail regarded him as disabled with regard to the major life activity of hearing, and nobody has disputed that characterization of his claim. As there was no authority for transposing Sizemore\u2019s claim to one involving the wholly separate major life activity of working, the basis for the District Court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment in Conrail\u2019s favor was defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Nonetheless, because Sizemore has failed to produce evidence sufficient to establish his prima facie case, the order of the District Court will be AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
