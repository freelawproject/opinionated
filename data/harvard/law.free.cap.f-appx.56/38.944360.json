The Appellate Division affirmed, and Johnson was denied leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals. Johnson then petitioned the district court, pro <em>se, </em>for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that the admission into evidence of facts underlying his prior assault crimes violated due process of law. The district court denied the petition in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">A panel of this Court granted a Certificate of Appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) \u201con the limited issue of whether the admission of evidence concerning prior convictions and the facts underlying those convictions, for purposes of proving appellant\u2019s intent in the charged offense, denied him of due process.\u201d The COA also may be fairly read to ask whether due process was violated if the evidence presented at Johnson\u2019s trial was in fact not offered to show intent, but simply to show his propensity to commit violent assaults.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">In any event, Johnson\u2019s petition was properly denied. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEPDA\u201d) requires that, where a petitioner\u2019s claim was adjudicated on the merits in state court, habeas relief will not be granted unless the state court decision was (1) \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or (2) \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">A state court decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly established federal law if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that the Supreme Court has reached on a set of materially indistinguishable facts. <em>See Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). A state court decision involves an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of a clearly established Supreme Court precedent if it \u201cidentifies the correct governing principle from [the Supreme Court\u2019s] decisions but unreasonably applies the principle to the facts of [a] prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This case involves only the \u201cunreasonable application\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">Even if evidence of the prior assaults was admitted for the sole purpose of proving Johnson\u2019s propensity to engage in similar misconduct again, Johnson points to no established Supreme Court precedent on whether, and in what circumstances (if any), evidence of propensity may violate due process. In <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991), the Supreme Court specifically expressed \u201cno opinion on whether a state law would violate the Due Process Clause if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>permitted the use of 'prior crimes\u2019 evidence to show propensity to commit a charged crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75 n. 5, 112 S.Ct. 475. In the absence of a governing principle derived from clearly established Supreme Court precedent, we cannot say that the state court\u2019s resolution of this issue was \u201cunreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
