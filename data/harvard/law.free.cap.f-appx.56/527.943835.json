Bigger, </em>192 F.Supp.2d 160 (S.D.N.Y.2002). The plaintiffs, who are deputy sheriffs in the Orange County Police Department (\u201cthe Department\u201d), brought suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against the defendants, who are the Department\u2019s sheriff and other senior employees of the Department. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated their First Amendment rights of intimate association and petition by retaliating against them for their extramarital sexual relationship and for their complaints of discrimination because of that relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-18\">The district court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 intimate association claim against defendant Denehy on the basis of qualified immunity. <em>Id. </em>at 170-71. Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>district court asserted that qualified immunity would also protect the defendants other than Denehy (\u201cthe Department defendants\u201d), <em>id. </em>at 171 n. 21, the district court dismissed the intimate association claim against the Department defendants on another ground: that the plaintiffs failed to offer evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to conclude that any actions by the defendants were taken in retaliation for the plaintiffs\u2019 relationship. <em>Id. </em>at 168-69. In dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 right to petition claim, the district court concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 grievances were not protected under the First Amendment because they did not involve matters of \u201cpublic concern.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">After reviewing the record <em>de novo, see Schnabel v. Abramson, </em>232 F.3d 83, 86 (2d Cir.2000), we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">On the intimate association claim, the defendants are protected by qualified immunity. Qualified immunity \u201ccome[s] into play if, at the time of the alleged misconduct, defendants were not acting in violation of clearly established law.\u201d <em>Patel v. Searles, </em>305 F.3d 130, 138 (2d Cir.2002). Typically, this analysis involves two steps: \u201cFirst, we address the threshold question of whether the ... complaint alleges the deprivation of an actual constitutional right. If it does, we then decide whether the right was clearly established at the time of the officers\u2019 alleged misdeeds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135 (citation omitted). \u201c[Wjhere we are convinced that the purported constitutional right violated is not \u2018clearly established,\u2019 \u201d however, \u201cwe retain the discretion to refrain from determining whether, under the first step of the test, a constitutional right was violated at all.\u201d <em>Koch v. Town of Brattleboro, </em>287 F.3d 162, 166 (2d Cir. 2002) (citing <em>Horne v. Coughlin, </em>191 F.3d 244 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1052, 120 S.Ct. 594, 145 L.Ed.2d 493 (1999)). We may exercise that discretion where, as here, we have no reason to believe that \u201c\u2018the question will escape federal court review over a lengthy period.\u2019 \u201d <em>See id. </em>(quoting <em>Horne, </em>191 F.3d at 249).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">The purported constitutional right in this case is not \u201cclearly established.\u201d For a right to be \u201cclearly established\u201d for purposes of qualified immunity analysis, \u201c \u2018[tjhe contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.\u2019\u201d <em>Patel, </em>305 F.3d at 139 (citation omitted). Although we have recognized a right to intimate association under the First Amendment, <em>see, e.g., id. </em>(citing <em>Roberts v. United States Jaycees, </em>468 U.S. 609, 617-18, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984)), we have not decided whether this right applies to persons whose intimate relationship is adulterous. Nor has the Supreme Court ruled on the question. <em>Cf. City of N. Muskegon v. Briggs, </em>473 U.S. 909, 910, 105 S.Ct. 3535, 87 L.Ed.2d 659 (1985) (White, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (observing that courts have been divided over whether adulterous sexual relations were constitutionally protected in a way that would forbid public employers from disciplining their employees for such relations). The contours of such a right, if it exists, are therefore not \u201csufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.\u201d <em>Patel, </em>305 F.3d at 135 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">Qualified immunity is not a defense to claims for equitable relief. <em>Adler v. Pa-taki, </em>185 F.3d 35, 48 (2d Cir.1999). Although the complaint includes a request that the court \u201cenjoin defendants from continuing to engage in retaliation against plaintiffs as set forth above\u201d (Compl. at 6), the plaintiffs have not pressed that request either in the district court or on appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>We see nothing that would preclude plaintiffs from seeking such relief hereafter should it become appropriate for them to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">We need not and do not reach the district court\u2019s other ground for dismissal of the intimate association claim against the Department defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The district court rightly dismissed the right to petition claim because the plaintiffs\u2019 grievances do not implicate matters of public concern. As we have noted, \u201cThe First Amendment right to petition the government for a redress of grievances, which is \u2018an assurance of a particular freedom of expression,\u2019 is \u2018generally subject to the same constitutional analysis\u2019 as the right to free speech.\u201d <em>White Plains Towing Corp. v. Patterson, </em>991 F.2d 1049, 1059 (2d Cir.1993) (quoting <em>McDonald v. Smith, </em>472 U.S. 479, 482, 105 S.Ct. 2787, 86 L.Ed.2d 384 (1985); <em>Wayte v. United States, </em>470 U.S. 598, 610 n. 11, 105 S.Ct. 1524, 84 L.Ed.2d 547 (1985)). \u201cThe determination whether a public employer has properly [disciplined] an employee for engaging in speech requires a balance between the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1058 (quoting <em>Rankin v. McPherson, </em>483 U.S. 378, 384, 107 S.Ct. 2891, 97 L.Ed.2d 315 (1987) (quoting <em>Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., </em>391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968))) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see Knight v. Connecticut Dept. of Public Health, </em>275 F.3d 156, 163 (2d Cir.2001). When asserting a violation of the right to petition, a plaintiff bears the burden of showing that his or her \u201cspeech can be fairly characterized as constituting speech on a matter of public concern.\u201d <em>Piesco v. Koch, </em>12 F.3d 332, 342 (2d Cir. 1993) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Individual complaints of discrimination, which do not allege system-wide discrimination, do not involve matters of public concern. <em>See Pappas v. Giuliani </em>290 F.3d 143, 152 (2d Cir.2002) (McMahon, J., concurring); <em>Saulpaugh v. Monroe Cmty. Hosp., </em>4 F.3d 134, 143 (2d Cir.1993). The plaintiffs have failed to produce evidence that their grievances involved more than individual complaints of discrimination. Their grievances therefore do not involve matters of public concern, and their claim of a violation of their right to petition fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
