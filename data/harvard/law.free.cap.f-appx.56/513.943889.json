It is</p>\n<p id=\"b549-15\">ORDERED that the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Secretary of the Interior be affirmed. Upon considering the regulations implementing the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act under the standards of <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), we conclude that the August 31 deadline for the filing of the small miner waiver certification is reasonable.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We thus further conclude that the forfeiture of Harlow\u2019s unpatented mining claims for failure to pay the $100 per claim maintenance fee did not deprive Harlow of its property without due process of law. <em>See United States v. Locke, </em>471 U.S. 84, 108, 105 S.Ct. 1785, 85 L.Ed.2d 64 (1985). Harlow\u2019s equitable estoppel contention is without merit and, accordingly, we reject it. <em>See ATC Petroleum, Inc. v. Sanders, </em>860 F.2d 1104,1111 (D.C.Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-18\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b549-16\">The Bureau of Land Management has since changed the filing deadline from August 31 to September 1 to coincide with the beginning of the assessment year.
