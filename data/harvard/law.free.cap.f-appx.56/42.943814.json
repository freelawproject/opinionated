Richard M.

RJE brought a single claim for breach of contract, alleging that Northville had failed to pay it $1,653,739.53 in insurance proceeds to which RJE was entitled under the parties\u2019 Amendatory Agreement. Both parties moved for summary judgment; the District Court denied Northville\u2019s motion and granted RJE\u2019s. <em>See RJE Corp. v. Northville Indus. Corp., </em>No. 01-CV-2749 (FB), 2002 WL 1396991 (E.D.N.Y. June 25, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-21\">Substantially for the reasons stated by the District Court, we affirm. Northville\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>principal argument on appeal \u2014 that RJE\u2019s right to recover the $1,653,739.53 must be offset against a payment obligation that RJE incurred under the parties\u2019 earlier Purchase Price Adjustment Agreement (\u201cPPAA\u201d) \u2014 is belied by the plain language of the Amendatory Agreement. The latter agreement states, \u201cAccordingly, the parties agree that, anything in the [PPAA] to the contrary notwithstanding, ... RJE shall receive the first $1,653,739.53 of Net Insurance Proceeds received by North-ville.\u201d As the District Court concluded, \u201cthe parties could not have employed language any clearer or more express ... to override any provision of the PPAA that might have otherwise created a payment obligation.\u201d <em>RJE, </em>2002 WL 1396991, at *4. Northville acknowledges that it has received more than $1,653,739.53 in insurance proceeds. We agree with the District Court that \u201c[t]he language employed in the Amendatory Agreement is clear and unequivocal,\u201d <em>id., </em>and that RJE is entitled to recover $1,653,739.53 plus interest and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
