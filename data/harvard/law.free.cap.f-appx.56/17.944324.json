Under-hill, Judge), granting summary judgment to defendants-appellees on Capitol\u2019s claim that the Keeper of the National Register of Historic Places erred when she denied its petition to remove the Register listing of the High Street Historic District (\u201cthe District\u201d) which includes the Capitol Building, located at 402-418 Asylum Street, Hartford Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">This court reviews grants of summary judgment de novo. See <em>Weinstock v. Columbia Univ., </em>224 F.3d 33, 40 (2d Cir. 2000). Summary judgment is appropriate only when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56\u00a9). Additionally, this case is brought under the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 et seq., (\u201cAPA\u201d) and \u201c[u]nder the APA, a federal court may set aside an agency\u2019s findings, conclusions or actions only if they are \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, ... otherwise not in accordance with the law,\u2019 or \u2018unsupported by substantial evidence.\u2019 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 706(2)(A) and (E).\u201d <em>Supreme Oil Co. v. Metropolitan Transp. Auth., </em>157 F.3d 148, 151 (2d Cir.1998) (per curiam). This court reviews the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, giving the same deference to the agency decision that the district court owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">On appeal, Capitol argues that its petition to remove the District from the Register of Historic Places should have been granted by the Keeper because the District does not meet the necessary criteria, that the procedure by which the District was listed was fatally flawed because of a second building owner\u2019s untimely objection, that the Keeper\u2019s decision was inadequate to permit judicial review and that the district court erred in its denial of Capitol\u2019s request for discovery. We affirm for substantially the same reasons as were set forth by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
