He was sentenced to sixty months in prison for the drug offenses, a consecutive eighty-four month term for the firearms conviction, and five years of supervised release. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Garcia\u2019s counsel filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). In the <em>Anders </em>brief, Garcia\u2019s counsel briefed two issues, both of which counsel ultimately concluded were not meritorious: whether the district court fully complied with the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, and whether the district court erred in applying the sentencing guidelines. Garcia was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">We review violations of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 524-27 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u25a0 \u2014 \u25a0 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 200, 154 L.Ed.2d 169 (2002). Under this standard, we exercise our discretion only to correct errors that are plain, material, or affecting substantial rights, and which seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 524 (citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). We have reviewed the record and find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines for clear error as to factual findings; we review legal determinations de novo. <em>United States v. Blake, </em>81 F.3d 498, 503 (4th Cir.1996). We have reviewed the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines and find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Garcia\u2019s conviction and sentence. We require that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
