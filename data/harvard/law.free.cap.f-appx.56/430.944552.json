Sedwick, Chief United States District Judge for the District of Alaska, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b466-14\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-15\">Appellant Timothy Shawn O\u2019Neal, II, appeals his conviction and sentence for the possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-16\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we will not recount them in detail except as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-17\">O\u2019Neal first contends the evidence obtained pursuant to the search warrant should have been suppressed because, he says, there was not probable cause for the issuance of the warrant. This court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>205 F.3d 1182, 1186 (9th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 856, 121 S.Ct. 138, 148 L.Ed.2d 90 (2000). The issuing magistrate\u2019s assessment of the sufficiency of probable cause is entitled to great deference. <em>United States v. Patterson, </em>292 F.3d 615, 625 (9th Cir.2002). In our opinion, the application for the search warrant set forth sufficient facts to establish probable cause to believe that items of child pornography would be found at O\u2019Neal\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-22\">Defendant also argues that the fruits of the search should have been suppressed because the city police officers who obtained the warrant from the state judge failed to comply with Rule 41(d), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. We reject this argument because Rule 41(d) applies only to federal search warrants, not to those issued by state officials to local police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-23\">O\u2019Neal next argues that Officer Tyler\u2019s testimony concerning the correlation between possessing child pornography and collecting child erotica exceeded the scope of his expertise. The district court\u2019s decision whether to admit or to exclude expert testimony is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Hanna, </em>293 F.3d 1080, 1085 (9th Cir.2002). There was no abuse of discretion here. However, even assuming, for the sake of discussion, that Tyler was not sufficiently qualified to testify about the characteristics of collectors of child pornography, the testimony clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>was harmless. Other evidence overwhelmingly established that the vast amount of child pornography found in plain view in O\u2019Neal\u2019s apartment, where he lived alone, was under his knowing dominion and control. <em>See United States v. Lui, </em>941 F.2d 844, 848 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">O\u2019Neal contends that the district court erred in allowing approximately twenty-three images of child pornography to be published to the jury when he had offered to stipulate to the possession of three such items. We disagree, because O\u2019Neal claimed to have had no knowledge of the presence of child pornography in his apartment. The quantity of items found at O\u2019Neal\u2019s home was thus relevant to prove knowledge and possession. The district court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See Old Chief v. United States, </em>519 U.S. 172, 187, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Finally, O\u2019Neal argues that the district court erred in applying a two-level sentencing enhancement for obstruction of justice. A district court\u2019s finding that the defendant obstructed justice is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Shannon, </em>137 F.3d 1112, 1119 (9th Cir.1998). The district court found that O\u2019Neal offered testimony on a material issue, and that the testimony was false. The district court\u2019s finding is supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b466-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
