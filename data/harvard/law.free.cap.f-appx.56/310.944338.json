We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for plain error the district court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Steffen, </em>251 F.3d 1273, 1275 (9th Cir.2001). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-21\">Michel contends that the district court properly applied the 1993 version of the sentencing guidelines to his case, but contends that his fraud and money laundering offenses should have been grouped for the calculation of his base offense level in accordance with the 2001 amendment to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.1. We disagree, as an amendment to the sentencing guidelines should only be applied retroactively if it clarifies rather than changes the applicable law. <em>See United States v. Johns, </em>5 F.3d 1267, 1269-70 (9th Cir.1993). Under Ninth Circuit caselaw, the 1993 guidelines did not permit grouping of fraud and money laundering offenses. <em>See United States v. Martin, </em>278 F.3d 988, 1003 (9th Cir. 2002). In 2001, the sentencing commission \u201ccompletely revamped\u201d the guideline governing money laundering and fraud by allowing grouping of the offenses. <em>See id. </em>The district court properly declined to apply the 2001 amendment in calculating Michel\u2019s base offense level because the 2001 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>amendment was substantive rather than clarifying. <em>See Johns, </em>5 F.3d at 1270.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b346-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
