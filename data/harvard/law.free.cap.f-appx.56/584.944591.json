We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-17\">As we write solely for the parties, we will repeat the facts only very briefly. In early 1991, S&amp;S principal Siewdath Sook-ram agreed to sell to Laurenceteen Rogers a parcel of land that S&amp;S was developing in St. Thomas. A written contract was executed, and Rogers made a down payment for the property in the amount of $100,000, but soon thereafter a dispute broke out between the parties. In July of 1991, S&amp;S filed suit against Rogers essentially claiming that she had taken wrongful possession of the parcel, and Rogers, in turn, filed a number of counterclaims relating to alleged defects in S&amp;S\u2019s construction on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-18\">The case proceeded to trial ten years later, and in August of 2001 a Virgin Islands jury found that Rogers was not liable to S&amp;S but that S&amp;S had breached its contract with Rogers, and ultimately returned a verdict in Rogers\u2019s favor in the amount of $200,000. On September 12, 2001, S&amp;S filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b), with regard to both its claims and Rogers\u2019s counterclaims, as well as an alternative motion seeking a new trial pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59. In January of 2002, the District Court denied those motions, holding that they were both untimely filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>and moreover that the Rule 50(b) motion was waived because S&amp;S had not provided any evidence that it had previously made a motion pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a). This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">S&amp;S presents three issues on appeal: (1) whether the District Court erred in dismissing S&amp;S\u2019s post-trial motions as untimely and waived; (2) whether it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50; and (3) if it is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law, whether it is entitled to a new trial pursuant to Rule 59.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">We note initially that the District Court was mistaken in refusing to reach the merits of S&amp;S\u2019s post-trial motions because it viewed them as untimely. Even Rogers concedes that S&amp;S\u2019s motions were in fact timely filed. The District Court\u2019s order of judgment was filed August 31, 2001. Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(a), S&amp;S had until September 17, 2001 to file its post-judgment motions, and timely filed them on September 12, 2001.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The District Court\u2019s determination that S&amp;S\u2019s Rule 50(b) motion was waived was similarly in error, as S&amp;S in fact properly made a Rule 50(a) motion both in favor of its claims and against Rogers\u2019s counterclaims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">Notwithstanding the District Court\u2019s procedural errors, the record before us is such that we can address the merits and we see no reason to disturb the jury\u2019s verdict. We consider first S&amp;S\u2019s claim for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b), over which our review is plenary. <em>See, e.g., Warren v. Reading School District, </em>278 F.3d 163, 168 (3d Cir.2002); <em>Tra-bal v. Wells Fargo Armored Service Corp., </em>269 F.3d 243, 249 (3d Cir.2001). Accordingly, we apply the same standard as the District Court, examining whether when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>\u201cviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and giving it the advantage of every fair and reasonable inference, there is insufficient evidence from which a jury reasonably could find liability.\u201d <em>Warren, </em>278 F.3d at 168 (quoting <em>Fultz v. Dunn, </em>165 F.3d 215, 218 (3d Cir.1998)). Reversal is only appropriate where \u201cthe record is critically deficient of that minimum quantity of evidence from which a jury might reasonably afford relief.\u201d <em>Trabal, </em>269 F.3d at 249 (quoting <em>Powell v. J.T. Posey Co., </em>766 F.2d 131, 133-34 (3d Cir.1985)); <em>see also Hopp v. City of Pittsburgh, </em>194 F.3d 434, 439 (3d Cir.1999) (same). Because sufficiency of the evidence is a purely legal question and our review, accordingly, is de novo, it is appropriate to reach the merits even though we are without the benefit of a district court opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">S&amp;S argues that there was insufficient evidence to support either the jury\u2019s verdict against S&amp;S on their claim of intentional deprivation or the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of Rogers on her breach of contract counterclaim. We do not agree. With regard to S&amp;S\u2019s claim, the evidence introduced at trial could support the conclusion that Rogers\u2019s actions, while certainly self-interested, did not constitute an <em>intentional deprivation </em>of S&amp;S\u2019s property interest under Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 871. We reach a similar conclusion with regard to the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of Rogers on her counterclaim. The actual existence of a contract was well supported by the evidence presented at trial, and, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Rogers, the jury could reasonably have found that S&amp;S\u2019s inadequate performance was in breach of that contract. Finally, there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding of damages; S&amp;S essentially admitted that it was obligated to return Rogers\u2019s substantial down payment, and at trial Rogers introduced evidence as to expenses incurred and lost earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">We are also unpersuaded by S&amp;S\u2019s arguments that a new trial is warranted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> S&amp;S alleges three separate trial errors. First, it argues that the District Court erred in taking judicial notice of Rogers\u2019s equitable interest in the property. We can find no error; it is hornbook law that a valid, enforceable contract for the purchase of land does in fact give the purchaser an equitable interest. <em>See, e.g., </em>4 Richard R. Powell, <em>Powell on Real Property </em>\u00a7 37 \u2014 137[l][d] (1997) (stating that the purchaser is \u201crecognized as holding equitable (as contrasted to legal) title to the property\u201d). Second, S&amp;S complains that the jury instructions were critically defective in failing to instruct the jury adequately with regard to certain stipulated, judicially noticed, and otherwise settled facts. Taken as a whole, however, it is clear that the jury instructions \u201cproperly apprised the jury of the issues and the applicable law.\u201d <em>Hurley v. Atlantic City Police Dept., </em>174 F.3d 95, 115 (3d Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Dressler v. Busch Entertainment Corp., </em>143 F.3d 778, 780 (3d Cir.1998)). Finally, S&amp;S argues that the District Court erred in responding to certain questions posed by the jury during deliberation. We conclude that any error was harmless as a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>law. Although S&amp;S asserts that the District Court\u2019s response to the jury \u201chad a direct bearing on the critical fact issue of whether S&amp;S Services, Inc. had sufficiently mitigated damages,\u201d that issue was wholly irrelevant \u2014 the jury determined that S&amp;S was simply not entitled to relief and thus never reached the question of S&amp;S\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Accordingly, the orders of the District Court will be AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-6\">. S&amp;S also argues that the District Court should have granted its motion for summary judgment on certain of Rogers's counterclaims. Because the case proceeded to trial, however, our review is relevantly limited to the District Court\u2019s denial of S&amp;S\u2019s Rule 50 motion. <em>See Hopp v. City of Pittsburgh, </em>194 F.3d 434, 439 n. 3 (3d Cir.1999); <em>see also, e.g., Baughman v. Cooper-Jarrett, Inc., </em>530 F.2d 529, 532-33 (3d Cir.1976) (holding that a motion denying summary judgment will not be reviewed on appeal from a jury verdict where sufficient evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict), overruled on other grounds by <em>Croker v. Boeing Cc., </em>662 F.2d 975 (3d Cir.1981); 15B Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 3914.28 (\"If an erroneous denial of summary judgment is followed by trial ... the denial should not be reversed if sufficient evidence was introduced at trial.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b622-7\">. Neither party addresses the jurisdiction of the trial court. In its decision dated January 14, 1999, the District Court suggested that it was exercising federal diversity jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. We note, however, that there is no conclusive indication in the record that these parties are in fact diverse. Nevertheless, it appears that the District Court had original jurisdiction over this action as essentially a territorial court of the Virgin Islands, because the suit was filed in June of 1991, before the October 1, 1991, amendment to the Virgin Islands Code that divested the court of that jurisdiction. <em>See 4 </em>V.I.Code Ann. \u00a7 76; <em>Newfound Mgt. Corp. v. Lewis, </em>131 F.3d 108, 119 n. 9 (3d Cir.1997) (stating that the District Court of the Virgin Islands generally retains original jurisdiction over actions filed before October 1, 1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b622-13\">. Had the District Court been correct that S&amp;S\u2019s motions were not timely filed, we would have been without jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4 (requiring the filing of a Notice of Appeal within thirty days of the entry of judgment, but tolling requirement for the timely filing of certain post-judgment motions).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b622-14\">. S&amp;S apparently did, however, waive its argument with regard to Rogers's generalized breach of contract counterclaim seeking general damages \u2014 including, as S&amp;S conceded, the $100,000 Rogers paid as a down payment on the parcel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b623-6\">. Typically we would not reach the merits of a Rule 59 motion where the District Court has not previously considered them. <em>See Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n v. Carpenter, </em>648 F.2d 919, 921 (3d Cir. 1981) (per curiam); <em>see also Olefins Trading, Inc. v. Han Yang Chem Corp., 9 </em>F.3d 282, 290 (3d Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Contents of Accounts Nos. 3034504504 and 144-07143 at Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith, Inc., </em>971 F.2d 974, 988 (3d Cir. 1992). We do so here only because S&amp;S\u2019s claims are wholly without legal merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
