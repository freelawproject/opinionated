The Kots challenge all three of these rulings for essentially the same reason: they argue that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ward v. Cross Sound Ferry, </em>273 F.3d 520 (2d Cir. 2001), decided four days after the district court\u2019s December 6, 2001 judgment but not discovered by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel until 55 days after the judgment (and 25 days after the time to file a Notice of Appeal expired), changed the applicable law, thus converting an untenable appeal (the Kots did not appeal the district court\u2019s December 6, 2001 judgment) into a potentially meritorious one.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-12\">As an initial matter, the district court concluded, and we agree, that the Kots\u2019 motion seeking an extension of time to file a Notice of Appeal is dispositive, because if that motion is not granted the remaining motions are moot. The district court then determined that the rule set forth in <em>Ward </em>\u2014 that a ticket must reasonably communicate the existence of important terms and the passenger must have the opportunity to become meaningfully informed of those terms \u2014 was satisfied in this ease. The district court then declined to grant the Kots\u2019 motion seeking an extension of time to file a notice of appeal pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure (\u201cFRAP\u201d) 4(a)(5).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-13\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to extend the time to file a Notice of Appeal for abuse of discretion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number><em>Goode v. Winkler, </em>252 F.3d 242, 245 (2d Cir.2001). The district court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to grant an extension because it determined that, even after <em>Ward, </em>any appeal would be to no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b50-9\">. The complaint alleged that while Marina and Alex Kot were passengers on a Carnival cruise ship, Marina was injured when she tripped over a water hose negligently left on the deck and broke her ankle. The district court dismissed the claim as barred by the one-year statute of limitations contained in the Passenger Ticket Contract under which the Kots traveled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b50-14\">. At the time of the district court\u2019s order, Rule 4(a)(5) provided: \"The district court <em>may </em>extend the time to file a notice of appeal if: (i) a party so moves no later than 30 days after the time prescribed by this Rule 4(a) expires; and (ii) that party shows excusable neglect or good cause.\u201d FRAP 4(a)(5)(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
