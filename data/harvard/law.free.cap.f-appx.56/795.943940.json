We have jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1), review for an abuse of discretion, <em>Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>121 F.3d 1372, 1377 (9th Cir.1997), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-24\">The All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, authorizes federal courts to \u201cissue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201d 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1651. However, the Anti-Injunction Act provides that state proceedings may not be enjoined \u201cexcept as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283. The statutory exceptions are strictly construed. <em>See Bennett v. Medtronic, Inc., </em>285 F.3d 801, 805-06 (9th Cir.2002). Any doubts \u201cshould be resolved in favor of permitting the state courts to proceed in an orderly fashion to finally determine the controversy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 805 (quoting <em>Atlantic Coast Line R.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Eng\u2019rs, </em>398 U.S. 281, 297, 90 S.Ct. 1739, 26 L.Ed.2d 234 (1970)). \u201cThe Act creates a presumption in favor of permitting parallel actions in state and federal court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 806 (citing <em>Atlantic Coast, </em>398 U.S. at 295).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">\u201cA district court abuses its discretion when it rests its conclusion on clearly erroneous factual findings or on incorrect legal standards.\u201d <em>Quackenbush, </em>121 F.3d at 1377 (citing <em>Blalock Eddy Ranch v. MCI Telecomm. Corp., </em>982 F.2d 371, 375 (9th Cir.1992)). We \u201cmay not simply substitute\u201d our judgment for the district court\u2019s. <em>United States v. McMullen, </em>98 F.3d 1155, 1159 (9th Cir.1996) (citing <em>Silber v. Mabon, </em>18 F.3d 1449, 1455 (9th Cir.1994)). We reverse only if \u201cconvinced firmly that the reviewed decision lies beyond the pale of reasonable justification under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Harman v. Apfel, </em>211 F.3d 1172, 1174 (9th Cir.2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">VCR\u2019s Notice of Appeal and Statement of Jurisdiction in its opening brief establish that it is only seeking review of the district court\u2019s July 25, 2002 order. VCR argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying its motion to stay state proceedings because, during state court proceedings on July 24, 2002, the presiding state judge declared, \u201cIf the jury comes in with a verdict before the independent arbitrator decides it, so much for the independent arbitrator. It\u2019s moot.\u201d However, at the time the district court issued its order on July 25, 2002, the July 24th transcript had not yet been brought to its attention. The district court cannot have abused its discretion when it issued its July 25, 2002 order by failing to consider subsequently developed evidence that was not before it when it issued the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">Finally, even if we were inclined to evaluate the district court\u2019s order in light of the subsequently developed evidence, the record before this court-including the parties\u2019 respective supplemental appendices\u2014 is not sufficiently developed for us to determine whether issues subject to arbitration are, in fact, being improperly litigated in state court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">AFFIRMED.

We grant VCR's December 9, 2002 motion to file supplemental appendices, and grant appellee Lehrer McGovern Bovis' (\"LMB\u201d) January 6, 2003 motion to consider its supplemental appendix. We deny LMB\u2019s December 23, 2002 counter-motion to strike VCR\u2019s supplemental appendices, and LMB's January 17, 2003 amended counter-motion to strike.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
