RApp. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-18\">This is a <em>pro se </em>state prisoner 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights appeal. Ms. Henry-Fields filed her complaint seeking redress for numerous alleged violations of her constitutional rights. Among other things, she alleged deliberate indifference to her medical needs and that the conditions of confinement at Central Oklahoma Correctional Facility pose a substantial risk to the inmate population. The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation detailing each of Ms. Henry-Fields\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-22\">After consideration of Ms. Henry-Fields\u2019 objections, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. The district court denied Ms. Henry-Fields\u2019 request for class certification, granted Dominion Defendants\u2019<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Motion for Summary Judgment because Appellant failed to exhaust administrative remedies, and dismissed the claims against Defendants Correctional Medical Services, Inc., and Karen Costa pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim. Ms. Henry-Fields appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-23\">After a thorough review of the briefs and the record, and for substantially the same reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s well-reasoned July 26, 2002, Order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, we hold that no relief is available to Ms. Henry-Fields pursuant to \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-24\">The decision of the trial court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b953-19\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b953-20\">.
