Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">Hernandez-Roman pled guilty to illegal reentry. The district court sentenced him to forty-eight months imprisonment, followed by three years supervised release. In accordance with \u00a7 1326(b) and <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) (2000), Hernandez-Roman\u2019s sentence was enhanced because of his prior conviction of an aggravated felony. Hernandez-Roman asserts that, under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the aggravated felony was an element of the offense that had to be charged and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The Supreme Court held to the contrary in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219,140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and the <em>Apprendi </em>Court did not overrule that holding. 530 U.S. at 489-90. <em>See United States v. Sterling, </em>283 F.3d 216, 220 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>536 U.S. 931, 122 S.Ct. 2606, 153 L.Ed.2d 792 (2002) (holding that <em>Al-mendarez-Torres </em>was not overruled by Apprendi).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-12\">We also reject Hernandez-Roman\u2019s argument that his felony was not serious enough to be an aggravated felony under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). He acknowledges that he was convicted of a felony for which he received a two-year sentence, and that he was an active participant in the sale of three grams of cocaine base to a confidential informant. The guideline refers to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43) (2000), which defines aggravated felony as \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance.\u201d Thus, Hernandez-Roman\u2019s prior conviction requires a sixteen-level enhancement of his base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">Finally, Hernandez-Roman asserts that the district court abused its discretion in failing to grant a downward departure. We can review a district court\u2019s decision whether to depart downward only if the district court mistakenly believed itself without authority to depart. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>313 F.3d 219, 222 (4th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 30-31 (4th Cir.1990). There is nothing in this record to suggest that the court was unaware of its authority to grant a downward departure; therefore we conclude that this claim is not subject to appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-14\">Accordingly, we affirm Hernandez-Roman\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
