R.Civ.P. 56(b), on the grounds that no material issues of fact requiring a trial exist and defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Myrick v. N.Y.C. Employees\u2019 Ret. Sys., </em>No. 99 Civ. 4308(GEL), 2002 WL 868469 (S.D.N.Y. May 8, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-14\">Plaintiff claimed that he suffered years of harassment, discrimination, and eventually, retaliatory discrimination, for complaining about race discrimination by his employer, the New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement System (\u201cNYCERS\u201d). He brought this cause of action pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e, <em>et seq., </em>charging NY-CERS with discrimination and retaliatory discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-15\">The District Court held that \u201cMyrick has not presented sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable fact-finder to conclude that these reasons were pretextual, [and] the motion for summary judgment\u201d was therefore proper, especially where defendant was able to demonstrate twenty-nine specific instances of Myrick\u2019s incompetence and insubordination. <em>See, Myrick v. N.Y.C. Employees\u2019 Ret. Sys., </em>No. 99 Civ. 4308(GEL) at 8-9 (S.D.N.Y. May 6, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-16\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. See Fujitsu Ltd. v. Fed. Express Corp., </em>247 F.3d 423, 428 (2d Cir. 2001). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to Myriek, drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor, and determine whether there is indeed no issue of material fact in dispute. <em>Id. </em>We agree with the District Court that NYCERS was able to show legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for Myrick\u2019s termination. <em>See, e.g., Raniola v. Bratton, </em>243 F.3d 610, 625 (2d Cir.2001) (holding that when a prima face case of retaliation is proven, the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that legitimate, non-retaliatory grounds supported the decision to terminate).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-17\">Plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the legitimate, non-retaliatory grounds defendant provided were pretextual. <em>See La-Fond v. Gen. Physics Servs. Corp., </em>50 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>F.3d 165, 174 (2d Cir.1995) (holding that for a retaliatory discharge claim to survive the defendant\u2019s proffer of legitimate, non-retaliatory grounds, plaintiff must show that the reasons given were pretextual; pretext may be shown \u201ceither by the presentation of additional evidence showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence, or by reliance on the evidence comprising the prima facie case.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). We find no error in the District Court\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">We have considered all of plaintiffs claims on appeal and, substantially for the reasons stated by the District Court, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
