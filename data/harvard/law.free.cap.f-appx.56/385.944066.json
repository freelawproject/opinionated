Pacheco-Zapeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 413-14 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The parties agree that the written judgment was inconsistent with the oral imposition of a two-year period of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Hicks, </em>997 F.2d 594, 597 (9th Cir.1993). Accordingly, we remand so that the district court can make the written judgment consistent with the oral pronouncement. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">DISMISSED in part, AFFIRMED in part, and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b421-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
