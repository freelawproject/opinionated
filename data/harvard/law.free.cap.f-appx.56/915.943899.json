R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, or collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-20\">Plaintiff Marcos Lucero, a New Mexico state inmate appearing <em>pro se, </em>brought this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights action against prison officials Tim LeMaster, Tom Ham-mertree, and James Lopez, and against the New Mexico Department of Corrections. The district court considered Plaintiffs complaint <em>sua sponte </em>under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) and Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), and dismissed all claims. We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm. Plaintiffs complaint alleges that the prison officials denied his requests for furloughs to visit his gravely ill mother before she died and to attend her funeral. He claims that these denials violated (1) his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, (2) his right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment, and (3) his right to due pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>cess under the Fourteenth Amendment. As explained in the district court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion and Order, however, the allegations in his complaint do not support these claims. Although a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s pleadings are to be construed liberally, <em>Whitney v. New Mexico, </em>113 F.3d 1170, 1172 (10th Cir.1997), this court \u201cwill not supply additional factual allegations ... or construct a legal theory on [the litigant\u2019s] behalf.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1173-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Plaintiff also asserts that the district court (1) abused its discretion by refusing to appoint him counsel and (2) improperly denied him an evidentiary hearing. The magistrate rejected Plaintiffs request for appointment of counsel, concluding that Plaintiff was able to represent himself in an intelligent and capable manner. <em>See Lucero v. LeMaster, </em>Civ. No. 02-430 (magistrate\u2019s order, May 14, 2002) (citing <em>Rucks v. Boergermann, </em>57 F.3d 978, 979 (10th Cir.1995)). Plaintiff has provided nothing here to indicate otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Plaintiffs claim that he was improperly denied an evidentiary hearing is similarly without merit. By its very nature, Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) contemplates a dismissal on the pleadings. <em>See also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in considering a prisoner\u2019s <em>in forma pauperis </em>action, \u201cthe court shall dismiss the case at any time if the court determines that ... the action ... fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted\u201d). Thus, if a plaintiff fails to allege sufficient facts to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, he has no right to present his claims at an evidentia-ry hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">We have carefully reviewed Plaintiffs brief, the district court\u2019s order, the magistrate\u2019s order, and the record on appeal. For the reasons stated above, and for substantially the same reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s June 11, 2002, order, and the magistrate\u2019s May 14, 2002, order, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court. Plaintiffs motion for leave to proceed without prepayment of fees is granted. Plaintiff is reminded that he is obligated to continue making payments on this appeal until the filing fee is paid in full.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
