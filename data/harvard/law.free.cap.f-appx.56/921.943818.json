Because the board lacks jurisdiction to review the Department of Labor\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits decisions, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b957-15\">A board decision must be affirmed unless it is found to be: \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-16\">An award or denial of an award of workers\u2019 compensation benefits by the Secretary of Labor is \u201c(1) final and conclusive for all purposes and with respect to all questions of law and fact; and (2) not subject to review by another official of the United States or by a court by mandamus or otherwise.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8128(b)(1), (2) (2000). Bolls asserts that his denial of workers\u2019 compensation benefits is reviewable by the board under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.3(a)(7). Section 1201.3(a), however, provides board jurisdiction over appeals that are \u201cauthorized by law, rule, or regulation,\u201d and it is not an independent source of jurisdiction. Accordingly, board review of his claim is precluded by section 8128.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
