R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-23\">This is a <em>pro se </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 prisoner appeal. Mr. Cooley was charged with attempt to cause bodily injury to a peace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>officer. He was found not guilty by reason of mental illness and placed on supervision. Subsequently, he was found to have violated the terms and conditions of his supervision and was ordered confined at the Wyoming State Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">In his \u00a7 2254 petition, Mr. Cooley sought release from the State Hospital. The district court dismissed the petition, without prejudice, for failure to exhaust administrative state remedies. Mr. Cooley then applied to this court for a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">In order for this court to grant a certificate of appealability, Petitioner must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To do so, Petitioner must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">We have carefully reviewed Mr. Cooley\u2019s brief, the district court\u2019s disposition, and the record on appeal. Nothing in the facts, the record on appeal, or Petitioner\u2019s brief raises an issue which meets our standards for the grant of a certificate of ap-pealability. We agree with the district court that Mr. Cooley has failed to exhaust his state court remedies pursuant to Wyoming Statute \u00a7 7-11-306. Therefore, for substantially the same reasons as set forth by the district court in its Order of August 29, 2002, we cannot say \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">We DENY Petitioner\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability and DISMISS the appeal. Appellant\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pawperis </em>on appeal is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b955-24\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
