Jones did not object to the sentence imposed by the district court,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> namely, a sentence of 36 months imprisonment, three years supervised release, and restitution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>On appeal, Jones contends the district court improperly ordered restitution in the amount of $116,779.50 for legal fees and expenses Rolex incurred while obtaining a civil judgment against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">In our view, the district court correctly ordered restitution for attorney fees. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(a)(1)(A) (authorizing restitution); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>155 F.3d 942, 949 (8th Cir.) (Standard of review), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1059, 119 S.Ct. 627, 142 L.Ed.2d 565 (1998). The record amply supports the district court\u2019s determination that the attorney fees were triggered by the specific conduct that was the basis for the offense of conviction. Indeed, Jones testified Rolex had brought multiple actions against him relating to his sales of watches, and an unobjected-to portion of the presentence report (PSR) asserted Rolex had accrued $116,779.50 in legal fees and expenses in pursuing him. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(b)(6)(D) (district court may accept unobjected-to portions of PSR); <em>United States v. Akbani, </em>151 F.3d 774, 779-80 (8th Cir.1998). The district court properly considered Jones\u2019s financial resources and ability to meet the restitution obligation inasmuch as it recognized his negative net worth, stated its desire that he be able to have at least a little money while incarcerated, and ordered him to pay only a fraction of his earnings while in prison and $50 per month following his release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(a)(l)(B)(i)(II) (court shall consider financial resources of defendant); <em>United States v. Manzer, </em>69 F.3d 222, 229 (8th Cir.1995). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-29\">The Honorable Joseph F.
