(LEAA), appeals the district court\u2019s award of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, USA Direct, Inc., in LEAA\u2019s action for damages arising from USA Direct\u2019s provision of database management services. We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Higgins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>863 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir.1988). Summary judgment is appropriate only if there are no material facts in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). All reasonable inferences are \u201cviewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\u201d <em>Matsushita Elec. Ind. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">Although the moving party must provide more than a conclusory statement that there are no genuine issues of material fact to support a motion for summary judgment, it \u201c \u2018need not produce evidence, but simply can argue that there is an</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">absence of evidence by which the nonmov-ant can prove his case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cray Communications, Inc. v. Novatel Comp. Sys., Inc., </em>33 F.3d 390, 393-94 (4th Cir.1994) (quoting 10A Charles Alan Wright, et al., <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 2720, at 10 (2d ed. Supp. 1994)); <em>see also Celotex, </em>477 U.S. at 325 (\u201c[T]he burden on the moving party may be discharged by \u2018showing\u2019 \u2014 that is, pointing out to the district court \u2014 that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party\u2019s case.\u201d). Once the moving party has met its burden, \u201cthe nonmoving party must come forward with \u2018specific facts showing that there is a <em>genuine issue for trial.\u2019 \u201d Matsushita, </em>475 U.S. at 587 (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e)). The nonmoving party\u2019s evidence must be probative, not merely colorable, <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 256, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986), cannot be \u201cconclusory statements ... without specific evidentiary support,\u201d <em>Cau-sey v. Balog, </em>162 F.3d 795, 801-02 (4th Cir.1998), cannot be hearsay, <em>Evans v. Techs. Applications &amp; Serv. Co., </em>80 F.3d 954, 962 (4th Cir.1996), and must \u201ccontain admissible evidence and be based on personal knowledge.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">Having had the benefit of oral argument and having carefully considered the parties\u2019 briefs, the record from the court below, and the relevant legal authority, we conclude that the district court correctly resolved the issues before it. <em>See Law Enforcement Alliance of Am. v. USA Direct, Inc., </em>Civ. No. 01-929-A (E.D. Va. April 10, 2002). Finding no error, we affirm the district court\u2019s award of summary judgment in favor of USA Direct.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
