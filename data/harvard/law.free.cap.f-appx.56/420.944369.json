Ramirez-Jiminez, </em>967 F.2d 1321, 1326 (9th Cir.1992) (\u201cWhen offered to prove knowledge ... the prior act need not be similar to the charged act as long as the prior act was one which would tend to make the existence of the defendant\u2019s knowledge more probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d) (citation omitted). There was no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s determination that the evidence\u2019s probative value outweighed its prejudicial effect, and the district court properly exercised its discretion in reconsidering its initial ruling on the defense motion <em>in limine </em>in view of the government\u2019s more limited proffer of evidence. <em>See United States v. Bensimon, </em>172 F.3d 1121, 1127 (9th Cir.1999). The filing of a second superseding indictment did not prejudice Clay unfairly because there was no unfair surprise in the charges contained therein. <em>See United States v. Chenaur, </em>552 F.2d 294, 302 (9th Cir.1977). The representation provided by Clay\u2019s trial counsel did not fall \u201cbelow an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d because counsel sought vigorously, albeit unsuccessfully, to exclude the challenged evidence. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b456-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
