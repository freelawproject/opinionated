The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 60 months imprisonment and 4 years supervised release. On appeal, his counsel has moved to withdraw and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-20\">Having carefully reviewed counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief, and having conducted our own independent review of the record, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we agree with counsel that there are no nonfrivolous issues in this direct criminal appeal. Among other things, we note that at the plea hearing, Polyansky affirmed he understood the plea agreement, agreed with the factual basis for the conspiracy charge, and admitted the charged conduct; that there were no sentencing objections other than Polyansky\u2019s motion for a downward departure based on an overrepresented criminal history; and that the district court granted Polyansky\u2019s departure motion, and also imposed the lowest sentence possible, given the statutory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-21\">Accordingly, we affirm, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-22\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b328-18\">. The Honorable Richard G. Kopf, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
