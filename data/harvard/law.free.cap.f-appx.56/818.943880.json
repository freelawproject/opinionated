Because the facts are familiar to the parties involved, we recount them only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">1. The ALJ improperly discounted the opinion of the examining psychiatrist, Dr. Freinhar. Generally, \u201cthe opinion of an examining physician is ... entitled to greater weight than the opinion of a nonexamining physician.\u201d <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830 (9th Cir. 1995). Therefore, \u201c[a]n ALJ may reject the testimony of an examining, but non-treating physician, in favor of a nonex-amining, nontreating physician when he gives <em>specific, legitimate reasons for doing so, </em>and those reasons are supported by <em>substantial </em>record of evidence.\u201d <em>Roberts v. Shalala, </em>66 F.3d 179, 184 (9th Cir.1995) (emphasis added) (citing <em>Andrews v. Shalala, </em>53 F.3d 1035, 1043 (9th Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-16\">In rejecting Dr. Freinhar\u2019s opinion, the ALJ did not meet this standard. Dr. Freinhar is the only psychiatrist who examined Ms. Jones. Dr. Freinhar diagnosed her with major depressive disorder, atypical bipolar disorder, and psychosis not otherwise specified. He found that Ms. Jones had impaired recent memory and poor concentration. As a result, he concluded that she \u201cwould have difficulty working due to the fact that she is unable to focus on tasks at hand and becomes distracted from these as noted by her tan-gentiality in the interview. Additionally, she is unable to exhibit adequate recognition which would prevent her from performing even simple tasks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-17\">In rejecting Dr. Freinhar\u2019s opinion, the ALJ relied primarily on the testimony of Dr. Drucker, a psychiatrist, who \u201csuspected\u201d that a lesser diagnosis than Dr. Frein-har\u2019s was appropriate, and thought that Ms. Jones could \u201cprobably\u201d complete simple tasks. Dr. Drucker repeatedly suggested, however, that the record was not \u201cadequate\u201d and that an additional evaluation was warranted. Given Dr. Drucker\u2019s failure to express any firm conclusion that Dr. Freinhar\u2019s opinion was wrong and his requests for further examination, Dr. Drucker\u2019s testimony was not a sufficient basis on which to discount Dr. Freinhar\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">The government argues that Dr. Frein-har\u2019s ultimate diagnosis is not consistent with his assessment that Ms. Jones had a GAF of 68. Even though a GAF of 68 suggests only minor impairment of functionality on this scale, there is nothing in the record that suggests that a person with a GAF of 68 cannot have mental impairments that rise to the level of disability. Dr. Freinhar, a psychiatric expert chosen by the state agency, is no doubt knowledgeable about the relationship between the GAF scale and an individual\u2019s ability to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The situation here is similar to that in <em>Tonapetyan v. Halter, </em>242 F.3d 1144 (9th Cir.2001), in which the testifying medical expert repeatedly stated that a more detailed record was necessary. The <em>Tonapetyan </em>court concluded, in reversing and remanding, that \u201cthe ALJ was not free to ignore [the testifying doctor\u2019s] equivocations and his concern over the lack of a complete record upon which to assess [the claimant\u2019s] mental impairment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1150-51. So here, the ALJ should have either accepted Freinhar\u2019s report, ordered further evaluation, or recontacted Dr. Freinhar for clarification of his conclusions and the basis for them. <em>See Reed v. Massanari, </em>270 F.3d 838, 842 (9th Cir.2001); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1519a(b)(1), (4), 416.912(e), 416.919a(b)(1), (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">The ALJ discounted Dr. Freinhar\u2019s assessment for three reasons in addition to his reliance on Dr. Drucker\u2019s testimony, none of them proper. First, Ms. Jones failed to seek psychiatric treatment. Provided there is a reasonable explanation for failing to do so, a failure to seek treatment cannot be used as a basis for rejecting Dr. Freinhar\u2019s diagnosis. <em>See Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 604 (9th Cir.1989). In particular, in <em>Nguyen v. Chater, </em>100 F.3d 1462, 1465 (9th Cir.1996), this court held that claimants are not required to seek psychiatric treatment in order to establish a mental illness. After all, \u201cit is a questionable practice to chastise one with a mental impairment for the exercise of poor judgment in seeking rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Blankenship v. Bowen, </em>874 F.2d 1116, 1124 (6th Cir.1989)). Dr. Freinhar in fact suggested that Ms. Jones failed to obtain treatment because she did not \u201ccomprehend the nature of her psychiatric illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">Second, the ALJ found that Dr. Freinhar\u2019s observations were \u201cinconsistent with the observations of the consulting orthopedist, or of any of the treating sources documented in the record.\u201d The ALJ did not specify any particular inconsistency, however, as required by this court\u2019s precedents, and we could not find any. Furthermore, an orthopedist\u2019s view of a patient\u2019s mental state cannot trump that of an examining psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">Finally, the ALJ suggested that one possible basis for rejecting Dr. Freinhar\u2019s assessment was that it was based on Ms. Jones\u2019s subjective self-history. This consideration can be a legitimate basis for discounting a doctor\u2019s evaluation, provided the claimant\u2019s credibility is questioned. But Dr. Freinhar\u2019s ultimate conclusion\u2014 that Ms. Jones could not work \u2014 was based on Dr. Freinhar\u2019s actual, in-person exami<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>nation of Ms. Jones, not only on the self-reporting of her ailments.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Because the ALJ erred in discounting Dr. Freinhar\u2019s evaluation of Ms. Jones, we remand. The ALJ must then choose from the following courses of action: ordering an additional consultative examination as Dr. Drucker suggested, recontacting Dr. Freinhar for clarification, or finding Ms. Jones disabled pursuant to Dr. Freinhar\u2019s original evaluation. We note that on remand the ALJ need not order a consultative examination of Jones for her physical ailments, because the record is sufficiently developed in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">2. The ALJ also erred when he rejected Ms. Jones\u2019s subjective account of her pain and dismissed the severity of both her mental and physical impairments because she failed to seek treatment. An ALJ \u201cmay not discredit a claimant\u2019s testimony of pain and deny disability benefits solely because the degree of pain alleged by the claimant is not supported by objective medical evidence.\u201d <em>Bunnell v. Sullivan, </em>947 F.2d 341, 346-47 (9th Cir.1991) (en banc); <em>see also Fair, </em>885 F.2d at 602. To find a claimant lacks credibility, an ALJ must make specific findings supported by the record and cannot \u201carbitrarily discredit a claimant\u2019s testimony regarding pain.\u201d <em>Bunnell, </em>947 F.2d at 345-46 (quoting <em>Elam v. Railroad Retirement Bd., </em>921 F.2d 1210, 1215 (9th Cir.1991)). The ALJ\u2019s reasons for rejecting a claimant\u2019s testimony must be \u201cclear and convincing,\u201d <em>Lester, </em>81 F.3d at 834, and must provide \u201cspecific, cogent reasons for the disbelief.\u201d <em>Rashad v. Sullivan, </em>903 F.2d 1229, 1231 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">In finding that Ms. Jones was not credible, the ALJ pointed to inconsistencies between the level of pain Ms. Jones claimed she experienced and the objective medical evidence of her condition. As noted, such disparities cannot be the sole basis for questioning the honesty of the claimant. <em>Bunnell, </em>947 F.2d at 346-47. Our precedents specifically account for the possibility that an individual\u2019s pain may exceed that usually associated with the objective medical condition. <em>Id. </em>The ALJ here presented no \u201cspecific, cogent reasons for disbelief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">Nor can the ALJ reject Ms. Jones\u2019s testimony simply because she did not get treatment. Even though a failure to follow a treatment plan or to seek treatment is evidence that weighs against a finding of disability, if there is a legitimate explanation for failure to treat a disorder, that failure cannot be held against a claimant. <em>Fair, </em>885 F.2d at 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">As an initial matter, it is difficult to see how Jones failed to seek treatment. She repeatedly sought out medical care for her back pain. The record shows that Ms. Jones saw numerous physicians, was hospitalized several times, did some physical therapy, and regularly took painkillers that had been prescribed to her. It is therefore not clear exactly what treatment the ALJ had in mind when he indicated that Ms. Jones failed to pursue medical care or a recommended course of treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">Moreover, one treating physician stated that surgery was not warranted and might make things worse for her. To receive disability benefits Ms. Jones should not have to seek treatment which is ineffective or counterproductive simply to establish adequate treatment efforts on her part.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">The ALJ points to no specific discrepancy in the record between what Ms. Jones told physicians and the activities she in fact does. Further, a claimant need not be completely incapacitated to be eligible for benefits. <em>Fair, </em>885 F.2d at 603. On remand the ALJ must either credit Ms. Jones\u2019s subjective evaluation of her pain or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>give specific and cogent reasons for questioning her credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b855-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b856-7\">. A state psychiatrist, who did not testify, also reviewed Dr. Freinhar's evaluation of Jones. That psychiatrist, like Dr. Drucker, questioned Dr. Freinhar\u2019s ultimate diagnosis. The state psychiatrist, however, did not examine Jones and relied solely on Dr. Freinhar\u2019s evaluation. This evaluation therefore does not provide any greater basis on which to discount Dr. Freinhar\u2019s opinion than does Dr. Drucker\u2019s evaluation. Indeed, the state psychiatrist's opinion is entitled to less weight than Dr. Drucker\u2019s because he did not testify.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
