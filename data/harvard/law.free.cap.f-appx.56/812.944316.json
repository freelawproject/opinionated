The BRB reversed an administrative law judge\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees related to claims Woods filed pursuant to the Long-shore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cLHWCA\u201d). 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 <em>et seq. </em>We have jurisdiction under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c), and we review <em>de novo </em>the denial of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Container Stevedoring Co. v. Director, OWCP, </em>935 F.2d 1544, 1546 (9th Cir.1991). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-21\">Section 928(b) of the LHWCA authorizes an award of attorney\u2019s fees to the employee \u201cin cases where the existence or extent of liability is controverted and the employee-claimant succeeds in establishing liability or obtaining increased compensation in formal proceedings in which he or she is represented by counsel.\u201d <em>National Steel and Shipbuilding Co. v. United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, OWCP, </em>606 F.2d 875, 882 (9th Cir.1979). This is not a case like <em>E.P. Paup Co. v. Director, OWCP, </em>999 F.2d 1341, 1354 (9th Cir.1993), where the claimant \u201csucceeded in the administrative proceedings in establishing ... further liability,\u201d or like <em>Savannah Machine and Shipyard Company v. Director, OWCP, </em>642 F.2d 887, 890 (5th Cir.1981), where the claimant \u201cwas ultimately awarded compensation exceeding that which the Shipyard admitted was due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b848-22\">The record contains no evidence that the employer\u2019s advance payment made before Woods filed her claim was conditional or contingent in nature. Because the administrative law judge\u2019s award did not exceed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>the amount of the advance payment, Woods is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under the LHWCA. <em>See Matulic v. Director, OWCP, </em>154 F.3d 1052, 1060 (9th Cir.1998). The order of the BRB is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b848-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
