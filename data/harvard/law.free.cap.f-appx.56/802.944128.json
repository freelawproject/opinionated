We have jurisdiction pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482. We review de novo the grant of summary judgment, <em>Talley Indus. Inc. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>116 F.3d 382, 385 (9th Cir.1997), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">The tax court properly granted summary judgment because Form 4340 submitted by the Commissioner is an official document which establishes that tax assessments were made and petitioners have failed to present contrary evidence. <em>See Hughes v. United States, </em>953 F.2d 531, 535-36 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">Contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention, the tax court properly exercised jurisdiction over petitioners\u2019 case because it has jurisdiction over tax liabilities that originate from unpaid income taxes, regardless of whether the underlying tax liability is in dispute. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">Finally, we find unpersuasive petitioners\u2019 contention that the tax court erred by permitting the Commissioner to supplement his motion for summary judgment with additional forms not supplied during the collection due process hearing. <em>See Connick v. Teachers Ins. &amp; Annuity Ass\u2019n, </em>784 F.2d 1018, 1020 (9th Cir.1986) (holding that a court shall consider supplemental documents on a motion for summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b839-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
