R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-22\">On August 16, 1999, Petitioner <em>pro se </em>Andrew Mavrovich filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court considered the merits of Petitioner\u2019s claims in determining that he was not entitled to habeas relief. Petitioner now appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his application. We hold that Petitioner\u2019s application does not satisfy the jurisdictional requirements for \u00a7 2254 actions. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand this case to the district court with instructions to dismiss the application for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-23\">Section 2254 grants federal court jurisdiction over an application for a writ of habeas corpus only when the applicant is <em>\u201cin custody </em>pursuant to the judgment of a State court.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)(3). \u201c[Wjhile the concept of \u2018in custody\u2019 does not require that the petitioner be physically confined and extends beyond incarceration to parole on an unexpired sentence, it does not extend to the \u2018situation where a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>habeas petitioner suffers no present restraint from a challenged conviction\u2019 at the time of the filing of the habeas petition.\u201d <em>Harvey v. Shillinger, </em>76 F.3d 1528, 1537 (10th Cir.1996), <em>quoting Maleng v. Cook, </em>490 U.S. 488, 491-92, 109 S.Ct. 1923, 104 L.Ed.2d 540 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">\u201c[E]very federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction, but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review....\u201d <em>Bender v. Williamsport Area School Dist., </em>475 U.S. 534, 541, 106 S.Ct. 1326, 89 L.Ed.2d 501 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). In an effort to determine whether the district court had jurisdiction over Petitioner\u2019s application, we entered an order on January 28, 2003, observing that Petitioner did not appear to have been \u201cin custody on the conviction being challenged in this case when he filed his petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in the district court.\u201d We directed Petitioner to explain \u201cwhether he was incarcerated, on parole, on probation, or had his liberty restrained in any way by the state as a result of this conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">In response, Petitioner filed a document stating that he was on parole until November 11, 1998. Petitioner seems to assume that all he needs to establish is that he was \u201cin custody\u201d at the time he initiated challenges to his sentence in state court. For example, he points out that he filed a challenge in state court in March 1997. The relevant jurisdictional inquiry, however, is not whether Petitioner began proceedings in state court while his liberty was restrained. Rather, the question is whether he filed his <em>federal </em>habeas application while his liberty was restrained. Because Petitioner\u2019s parole ended in November 1998, he was not \u201cin custody\u201d when he filed his \u00a7 2254 application in August 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand this case to the district court with instructions to dismiss the application for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
