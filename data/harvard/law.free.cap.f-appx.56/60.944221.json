Greiner, </em>No. 01 Civ. 4669, 2001 WL 1000688 (S.D.N.Y Aug. 30, 2001); <em>People v. Ramirez, </em>270 A.D.2d 185, 707 N.Y.S.2d 6 (1st Dept.), <em>leave to appeal denied, </em>95 N.Y.2d 802, 711 N.Y.S.2d 170, 733 N.E.2d 242 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-20\">The District Court held that under <em>Sel-lan v. Kuhlman, </em>261 F.3d 303, 314-15 (2d Cir.2001), deference to the state court ruling, as mandated by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, was required when the state court determined the constitutional issues on the merits, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>even if no explicit discussion of the constitutional merits occurred. We agree. Petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the rulings of the state trial court and the Appellate Division regarding the physical evidence were contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application, of clearly established Supreme Court precedent. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">We have considered all of defendant\u2019s claims on appeal and, substantially for the reasons stated by the District Court, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
