She was sentenced to a term of fifty-seven months imprisonment. Hunt appeals her sentence, contending that the district court\u2019s application of a two-level weapon enhancement, <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) (2001), together with the safety valve provisions, USSG \u00a7\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(6), 5C1.2, violated the rule of lenity. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-22\">Hunt and two co-defendants were arrested as they attempted to buy three kilograms of cocaine for $40,000 from an undercover officer. One of Hunt\u2019s co-defendants was carrying two concealed firearms. In connection with her sentencing, Hunt stated that she had not known that the firearms were present. Nevertheless, she received a weapon enhancement on the ground that it was reasonably foreseeable that her co-defendant might have a weapon. <em>See United States v. Kimberlin, </em>18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>F.3d 1156, 1160-61 (4th Cir.1994) (applying USSG \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2)). Hunt also received a two-level reduction in her offense level under the safety valve provision, USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(6), which is available to a defendant who meets the five criteria set out in USSG \u00a7 5C1.2. The second \u00a7 5C1.2 criterion is that the defendant not have possessed a firearm or other dangerous weapon in connection with the offense, or induced any participant to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Hunt contends that \u00a7 2D1.1 is ambiguous in permitting the weapon enhancement for a defendant who qualifies for the safety valve reduction. The rule of lenity requires courts to construe ambiguous criminal statutes against the government and in favor of the defendant. <em>United States v. Photogrammetric Servs., Inc., </em>259 F.3d 229, 249 (4th Cir.2001), <em>cert, denied, </em>535 U.S. 926, 122 S.Ct. 1295, 152 L.Ed.2d 208 (2002). Because the issue raised is one of legal interpretation of the guidelines, the standard of review is de novo. <em>United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 195 (4th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 937, 121 S.Ct. 1393,149 L.Ed.2d 316 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) weapon enhancement is determined by relevant conduct as defined by \u00a7 1B1.3, which includes \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts ... of others in furtherance of [a] jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). The enhancement may be applied when the defendant did not know about or participate in a co-defendant\u2019s weapon possession, as long as the possession was foreseeable. By contrast, we have held that a defendant may qualify for the safety valve reduction even if a co-defendant possessed a firearm, unless the defendant was personally involved in the co-defendant\u2019s action. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>114 F.3d 429, 432 (4th Cir.1997) (holding that \u201cfor purposes of \u00a7 5C1.2(2), the term \u2018defendant\u2019 \u2018limits the accountability of the de-</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">fendant to his own conduct and conduct that he aided or abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused\u2019 \u201d); <em>accord United States v. Pena-Sarabia, </em>297 F.3d 983, 987-89 (10th Cir. 2002); <em>United States v. Clavijo, </em>165 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>105 F.3d 219, 222 (5th Cir.1997); <em>In re Sealed Case, </em>105 F.3d 1460, 1461-65 (D.C.Cir.1997). Thus, the safety valve reduction is allowed when a co-defendant\u2019s firearm possession was foreseeable by the defendant, but the foreseeability factor may nevertheless bring about the enhancement. Section 2D1.1 is not ambiguous. We conclude that the district court did not err in determining that the rule of lenity did not apply, and interpreted \u00a7 2D1.1 and \u00a7 5C1.2 correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
