We have reviewed the record and conclude for the reasons stated by the district court that Helms has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See Helms v. Conroy, </em>No. CA-02-68-PJM (D. Md. June 20 and July 24, 2002). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-24\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
