The Lancasters had moved for reconsideration on the basis that <em>Johnston v. Sweany, </em>68 S.W.3d 398 (Mo.2002) (en <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>banc) (per curiam) specifically limited fee awards to expenses directly related to the garnishment, and excluded fees resulting from litigation of coverage issues. The court denied reconsideration, concluding that <em>Johnston </em>directed courts to separate fees related to coverage and fees related to garnishment to the extent practicable, but that in this case division was not practicable because the fees related to coverage issues were deeply intertwined with fees related to garnishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s award was not a clear abuse of discretion. <em>See Computrol, Inc. v. Newtrend, L.P., </em>203 F.3d 1064, 1072 (8th Cir.2000). <em>Johnston </em>requires only that the fees be limited to the extent practicable, <em>see Johnston, </em>68 S.W.3d at 405, and the court found that division was not practicable. Thus, we reject the Lancasters\u2019 argument that the district court failed to heed the majority opinion in <em>Johnston.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court and the denial of the motion ro reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-25\">.
