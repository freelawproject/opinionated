The district court sentenced her to 121 months in prison and ordered her to pay more than five and one half million dollars in restitution. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-23\">Sylianteng argues that the District Court abused its discretion by increasing her offense level to reflect that her fraud was \u201ccommitted through mass-marketing.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(3) (1998). A district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines to the facts of a particular case is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>287 F.3d 811, 818 (9th Cir. 2002). As the application notes to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1 explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-24\">\u201cMass-marketing,\u201d as used in subsection (b)(3), means a plan, program, promotion, or campaign that is conducted through solicitation by telephone, mail, the Internet, or other means to induce a large number of persons to (A) purchase goods or services; (B) participate in a contest or sweepstakes; or (C) invest for financial profit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-25\"><em>Id., </em>cmt. n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-26\">Sylianteng admits that she \u201cdid send postcards to her investors informing them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>of upcoming investment \u2018projects,\u2019 \u201d specifically the golden Buddha project. Appellant\u2019s Opening Brief at 6. It was not an abuse of discretion for the District Court to conclude that sending those postcards transformed Sylianteng\u2019s scheme into the sort of \u201cplan, program, promotion, or campaign ... conducted through solicitation by ... mail ... or other means to induce a large number of persons to ... invest for financial profit\u201d contemplated by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(3). It is irrelevant that the only persons to whom Sylianteng sent the postcards were persons she had previously contacted through word-of-mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Sylianteng also objects to the amount of restitution the district court ordered her to pay. In ordering restitution, the district court followed the recommendations of the PSR. A defendant waives objections to the factual conclusions of a PSR by affirmatively confirming those conclusions before the district court. <em>See United States v. Flores, </em>172 F.3d 695, 701 (9th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Bauer, </em>84 F.3d 1549,1563 (9th Cir.1996). Counsel for Sylianteng affirmatively confirmed the conclusions of the PSR at sentencing, and therefore Syl-ianteng\u2019s objection is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b371-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
