In determining whether Prudential properly denied Qidwai disability benefits under her ERISA plan, the district court concluded that Qidwai failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact, yet it declined to consider vocational expert Freeman Leeth\u2019s report which Qidwai had submitted to Prudential. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-23\">Leeth\u2019s report, in light of all of the other evidence of Qidwai\u2019s physical restrictions and failed attempts at work, created a genuine issue of material fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>sufficient to defeat summary judgment in Prudential\u2019s favor. <em>Cf. Nord v. Black &amp; Decker, </em>296 F.3d 823, 832 (9th Cir.2002) (considering lone plan doctor\u2019s opinion that claimant was not disabled, but determining that this opinion did not create triable issue of fact in light of all other evidence to contrary). The district court was not free simply to refuse to consider the report because it found that the administrative record supported a conclusion that plaintiff does not have an impairment that would prevent her from performing her own occupation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At summary judgment, the district court \u201cmust decide whether there are genuine issues of material fact, not whether there was substantial or ample evidence to support the plan administrator\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Mongeluzo v. Baxter Travenol Long Term Disability Benefit Plan, </em>46 F.3d 938, 942 (9th Cir.1995). We conclude that the district court improperly weighed the evidence on summary judgment, and we therefore reverse the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings. The district court must consider Leeth\u2019s report, although we recognize that on remand the district court will have the same record it had in ruling on summary judgment. Both parties agree that the administrative record is complete and that no additional evidence needs to be taken. Nonetheless, this remand is not an empty formality. When a genuine issue of material fact exists in a case such as this, we remand because \u201c[t]he district judge will be asking a different question as he reads the evidence!:] ... whether !Qidwai] is disabled within the terms of the policy.\u201d <em>See Kearney v. Standard Ins. Co., </em>175 F.3d 1084, 1095 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b461-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-18\">. We reject Prudential\u2019s argument that <em>McKenzie v. General Telephone Co., </em>41 F.3d 1310 (9th Cir.1994), supports the district court\u2019s actions. Unlike this case, the standard of review in <em>McKenzie </em>was abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 1314. In addition, the <em>McKenzie </em>court did not deal with a district court\u2019s duty, or lack thereof, to consider vocational evidence that the plan administrator did consider and which was already present in the administrative record. <em>Id. </em>at 1317-18.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
