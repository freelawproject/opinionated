On appeal, Cox argues that the district court erred in (1) dismissing Cox\u2019s Due Process claim on the ground that Cox waived it by failing to reiterate his request to have Simms testify when Hornbeck, the hearing officer, asked Cox if he had any procedural objections before she closed the hearing and Cox responded in the negative; (2) granting summary judgment before considering Cox\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel; and (3) holding that Cox had failed to show malicious intent on the part of Simms or anything more than <em>de minimis </em>physical injury in connection with his Eighth Amendment claim, as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. See Allstate Ins. Co. v. Mazzola, </em>175 F.3d 255, 258 (2d Cir.1999). We have carefully considered all of Cox\u2019s arguments and find them to lack merit for substantially the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned opinion, <em>see Cox v. Malone, </em>199 F.Supp.2d 135 (S.D.N.Y.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
