For the last 25 of those years, he was employed by respondent Consolidation Coal and worked underground as a roof bolter. After his sudden death in 1996 from a myocardial infarction, his widow applied for survivor\u2019s benefits under 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901 <em>et seq., </em>the Black Lung Benefits Act. In May 2000, however, an administrative law judge denied benefits, and the ruling was upheld by the Board. In order to reverse that decision, we would have to conclude that the ALJ\u2019s determination was not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Cornett v. Benham Coal, Inc., </em>227 F.3d 569, 575 (6th Cir.2000). Because we cannot say that this is the case here, we must sustain the Board\u2019s denial of surviv- or\u2019s benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-15\">\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b269-16\">On the day of his death, Stanley Ziemba awoke with severe chest pain and collapsed shortly thereafter. He was taken to the hospital, but attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful. On his death certificate, the cause of death was noted as \u201chypertensive cardiovascular disease.\u201d An autopsy was performed by Dr. Jaywant Parmar, who diagnosed the presence of coal-worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis, grade 3/4, but concluded that it had not contributed to Ziemba\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-17\">The medical records indicate that Ziem-ba had been treated for hypertension, that he was a long-time smoker and that, as early as 1980, he had experienced difficulty with his breathing. In 1990, an administrative law judge found that Ziemba had pneumoconiosis but held that he could not establish total disability. In 1994, an administrative law judge again denied benefits, finding that no material change in circumstances had occurred. In 1995, Ziemba was proscribed a bronehodilator for his breathing problems and, in 1996, he underwent surgery to remove nasal polyps and to correct a nasal septal deviation.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-18\">Some 18 months after Stanley Ziemba died, his wife applied for survivor\u2019s bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>fits. Initially, her claim was denied because there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that pneumoconiosis caused her husband\u2019s death. Subsequently, however, two physicians submitted letters at the claimant\u2019s request, asserting that pneumoconiosis did contribute to the miner\u2019s death, and a district director of the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs of the Department of Labor awarded benefits to his wife. When Consolidation Coal was notified of this decision, the company requested a review, and the matter was referred to an administrative law judge for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">At the hearing, held in March 2000, the issues were limited to (1) whether Ziemba had pneumoconiosis, (2) whether that pneumoconiosis arose out of his coal mine employment, and (3) whether his death was due to pneumoconiosis. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.205(a). At the hearing, the claimant objected to the admission of a report by Dr. Jerome Kleinerman, who died after writing the report but before he could be deposed. The administrative law judge determined that the report was admissible and included it in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The ALJ received evidence from two physicians, Dr. George Cholak and Dr. Attila Lenkey, who both indicated their belief that Stanley had pneumoconiosis and that the pneumoconiosis had contributed, if only slightly, to his death. However, the judge found that the opinions of these two physicians were not fully credible. Instead, he credited the reports and testimony of several pathologists, including Dr. Jerome Kleinerman, Dr. Joseph Tomashef-ski, and Dr. Richard Naeye, and those of two physicians who had prepared consultative reports on behalf of the company, Dr. Gregory Fino and Dr. Robert Altmeyer. From this evidence, the ALJ determined that Ziemba did not suffer from pneumoco-niosis. He also concluded, even assuming the presence of pneumoconiosis, that the disease did not cause or contribute to Ziemba\u2019s death. Based on these conclusions, the administrative law judge denied the claim for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">On appeal, the Benefits Review Board apparently did not review the AL J\u2019s determination that the miner did not suffer from pneumoconiosis, instead concluding that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that pneumoconiosis did not contribute to Ziemba\u2019s death. Because the Board upheld this finding by the administrative law judge, it found that the claimant had failed to establish an essential element of her claim and, therefore, affirmed the denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">On appeal to this court, the claimant objects to the ALJ\u2019s consideration of the report by Dr. Kleinerman, who died shortly after it was written and before he could be deposed. She also contends that the judge utilized the wrong standard in reaching his determination that her husband had not suffered from pneumoconio-sis and that his conclusion in this regard was not supported by sufficient evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Finally, the claimant asserts that the ALJ ignored the conclusions of his treating physician when the ALJ concluded that pneumoconiosis did not hasten Ziemba\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Based on the summary of the evidence that follows, we conclude that any error in connection with the admission of Dr. Kleinerman\u2019s report was, at most, harmless error. Moreover, whether or not the ALJ utilized the correct standard with regard to his finding that pneumoconiosis was not present at the time of Ziemba\u2019s death, the ALJ\u2019s conclusions that the miner\u2019s death was not caused by or hastened by pneumoconiosis is supported by substantial evidence in the record and must, accordingly, be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The burden was on the claimant to establish that pneumoconiosis caused or contributed to her husband\u2019s death. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.205(c). Under the regulations, this element is satisfied when pneu-moconiosis was a \u201csubstantially contributing cause or factor leading to the miner\u2019s death\u201d or if it hastened his death. <em>See id.; see also Brown v. Rock Creek Mining Co., </em>996 F.2d 812, 816 (6th Cir.1993) (employing \u201chastening\u201d standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The administrative law judge found that the claimant had failed to establish that pneumoconiosis caused or contributed to her husband\u2019s death. In reaching this conclusion, he noted that four of the pathologists found that pneumoconiosis was unrelated to Ziemba\u2019s death. He also discredited the testimony of the two physicians, Drs. Cholak and Lenkey, who found a connection between the death and pneu-moconiosis, noting that \u201c[tjheir reports [wejre conclusory and contain[ed] little or no reasoning as to how pneumoconiosis contributed to the miner\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">The record shows that even though the physicians credited by the ALJ found no pneumoconiosis to be present, several explicitly considered whether any lung disease contributed to Ziemba\u2019s death. For example, Dr. Tomashefski testified that \u201ceven if you made the assumption that [the lung disease] was due to coal dust exposure, it would not have contributed in any way, shape or form to his sudden death.\u201d Dr. Kleinerman stated that in his opinion and \u201cwith reasonable medical certainty Stanley [Ziemba]\u2019s exposure to coal mine dust did not cause, did not contribute to, and did not hasten his death. Stanley would have died as and when he did, even if he had never been exposed to coal mine dust.\u201d Dr. Fino wrote, \u201cEven if I assume pneumoconiosis was present, he would have died as and when he did had he never stepped foot in the mines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">In an attempt to establish that her husband\u2019s death was at least hastened by pneumoconiosis, the claimant presented a brief letter from Dr. Cholak to the claims examiner at the Department of Labor and the testimony of Dr. Lenkey. The letter from Dr. Cholak stated simply, \u201cThe cause of death was listed as Arteriosclerotic Heart Disease, but I feel that the Miner\u2019s Black Lung Disease was [ (1) ] caused by his coal mine work and [ (2) ] contributed significantly to the coal miner[\u2019]s death.\u201d As noted by the administrative law judge, Dr. Cholak provided no explanation for how pneumoconiosis contributed to Ziem-ba\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">Dr. Lenkey\u2019s deposition testimony, although further developed, was equivocal. He explained that the miner\u2019s lung function was impaired, which in turn meant that he had increased work in breathing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>It was his opinion that \u201c[t]his increased work of breathing in all likelihood contributed to the overall stress and inability to deal with an insult such as a myocardial infarction.\u201d When asked whether Ziemba would have survived the myocardial infarction absent the lung disease, Dr. Lenkey replied, \u201cOnly heaven knows.\u201d According to him, the lung disease \u201cm[ight] have been enough to just put him over the edge and, thus, helped contribute to his demise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The administrative law judge discounted the opinions of both physicians, finding that \u201c[tjheir reports are conclusory and contain [little or no] reasoning as to how pneumoconiosis contributed to the miner\u2019s death.\u201d He added:</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">I believe that it is also noteworthy that Dr. Cholak made no mention of pneumo-coniosis in the death certificate. Dr. Lenkey attempted to justify a causal connection between pneumoconiosis and the decedent\u2019s death in his deposition, but his attempt falls far short of establishing a causal relationship.... Dr. Lenhe/s deposition testimony is too speculative and vague to support a finding that the miner\u2019s pneumoconiosis caused, contributed to, or hastened his death. The opinions of Dr. Cholak and Dr. Lenkey are not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Instead, the ALJ credited the testimony of \u201c[t]he four pathologists in this case [who] have determined that the miner\u2019s death was unrelated to pneumoconiosis\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">They attributed his death to a sudden cardiac arrhythmia caused by coronary artery disease, which is consistent with claimant\u2019s testimony of the miner\u2019s chest pain in the middle of the night. As pathologists, they have more knowledge as to the cause of an individual\u2019s death than physicians who do not have training in pathology.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">It is within the discretion of the administrative law judge to assess the credibility of physicians; moreover, it is not for us to reassess their credibility. We conclude that the determination that pneumoconio-sis did not contribute to Stanley\u2019s death is supported by substantial evidence and was reached in conformance with applicable law. We therefore AFFIRM the ruling by the Benefits Review Board that sustained the decision of the administrative law judge denying survivor\u2019s benefits in this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-6\">. Specifically, claimant points out that the legal definition of pneumoconiosis is different from and broader than the standard medical definition of that term. <em>See, e.g., Cornett v. Benham Coal, Inc., </em>227 F.3d 569, 575 (6th Cir.2000) (\"This legal definition of pneumoco-niosis ... encompasses a wider range of afflictions that does the more restrictive medical definition of pneumoconiosis\"). The claimant asserts that the ALJ ignored this distinction and relied, instead, on medical professionals whose reports similarly ignored this distinction in concluding that Ziemba did not suffer from pneumoconiosis at the time of his death. The claimant is correct in her statement of the law in this area and may, indeed, be correct that the reports on which the ALJ relied did not adequately take into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>account the distinction between the medical and legal definitions of the disease Given our other conclusions, however, these points are irrelevant to the validity of the AO\u2019s ultimate decision to deny benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
