De Jesus challenged his conviction for violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 and subsequent sentence to fifty-seven months imprisonment. He argued that the sentence must be vacated because the fact of his prior conviction for an aggravated felony, which mandated a longer sentence pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), was not pleaded in the indictment. The district court found in relevant part that (1) De Jesus waived his right to appeal; (2) his challenge was procedurally barred by his failure to raise it on direct appeal; and (3) his challenge was barred by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). The court granted a certificate of appealability limited to the last two issues. Although De Jesus argues that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), cast doubt on <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>he concedes that this court must apply <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and bar his claim. We also have held that <em>Apprendi </em>cast no doubt on <em>Almendarez-Torres. United States v. Latorre-Benavides, </em>241 F.3d 262, 263-64 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 1045, 121 S.Ct. 2013, 149 L.Ed.2d 1014 (2001). Having found that De Jesus\u2019 claim lacks merit, we do not address the issue of the procedural bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">We also do not address whether Dejesus\u2019 petition was barred by the statute of limitations. It appears from the record before us that it may have been. The district court rejected this argument without explanation. However, the government has not urged that we affirm based on lack of timeliness or remand to the district court for a timeliness dismissal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
