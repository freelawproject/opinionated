Felix seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000). For the reasons set forth below, we vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-21\">The district court, acting sua sponte, determined from the face of Felix\u2019s petition that his claims were barred by the one-year limitations period set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d) (2000), and dismissed the action without giving Felix notice or an opportunity to respond. The district court did not have the benefit of our recent decision in <em>Hill v. Braxton, </em>277 F.3d 701 (4th Cir.2002). After <em>Hill, </em>the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>court is required to provide such notice and opportunity to respond \u201cunless it is indisputably clear from the materials presented to the district court that the petition is untimely and cannot be salvaged by equitable tolling principles or any of the circumstances enumerated in \u00a7 2244(d)(1).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Because it is not \u201cindisputably clear\u201d that Felix cannot salvage his petition, we grant his motion for a certificate of appeal-ability, vacate the district court\u2019s order, and remand to the district court to provide Felix with the notice and opportunity to respond to which he is now entitled pursuant to <em>Hill. </em>We deny Felix\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel and motion to amend petition and for emergency relief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
