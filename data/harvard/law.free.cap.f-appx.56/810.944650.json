Med. Consultants v. Johnson, </em>80 F.3d 1331, 1336 n. 6 (9th Cir.1996). \u201cUnless otherwise agreed, an agent is subject to a duty not to compete with the principal concerning the subject matter of his agency.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-20\">The district court found that former employee Diana Black (\u201cBlack\u201d) breached her duty of loyalty to Eagle Systems by: (1) soliciting the owner-operator drivers and other Eagle employees to switch to E.T. Schmid; (2) soliciting intermodal shipping companies, shippers, and consignees to switch to E.T. Schmid; and (3) actually dispatching for E.T. Schmid during the last week that she was on Eagle\u2019s payroll. These findings were not clearly erroneous. <em>See W. Med. Consultants, </em>80 F.3d at 1334.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-21\">Nor did the district court clearly err in holding E.T. Schmid Trucking liable for its knowing participation in Black\u2019s actions. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 312 (\u201cA person who, without being privileged to do so, intentionally causes or assists an agent to violate a duty to his principal is subject to liability to the principal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-22\">In light of our resolution of the issue concerning Black\u2019s breach of duty of loyalty to Eagle Systems, we need not address Appellants\u2019 remaining assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b846-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
