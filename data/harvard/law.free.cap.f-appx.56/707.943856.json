This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-16\">Hernandez pled guilty in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) &amp; (b)(1)(A), and 846. On August 21, 1998, Hernandez was sentenced to serve 151 months of imprisonment followed by five years of supervised release. Hernandez did not appeal his conviction or sentence. Hernandez subsequently filed a motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which was denied by the sentencing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-19\">In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Hernandez raised the following three grounds for relief: 1) the sentencing court lacked jurisdiction to sentence him \u201cthereon an uncharged offense or an element created via a variance;\u201d 2) the sentencing court erroneously \u201ccharged weapon enhancement where there was no aiding or abetting statute to validate departure;\u201d and 3) the sentencing court erroneously failed to consider \u201can additional one level departure for acceptance of responsibility\u201d based upon his timely plea of guilty. The district court summarily dismissed Hernandez\u2019s habeas corpus petition. Hernandez filed a timely appeal. He requests leave to proceed in forma pauperis.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-20\">We review de novo the dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>United States v. Peterman, </em>249 F.3d 458, 461 (6th Cir.2001); <em>Charles v. Chandler, </em>180 F.3d 753, 755 (6th Cir.1999). Such review indicates that the district court properly dismissed Hernandez\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-21\">Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 provides that a federal prisoner may bring a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district in which he is incarcerated. If a federal prisoner seeks to challenge the execution of his sentence, he must file a \u00a7 2241 petition in the district court having jurisdiction over his custodian. <em>Peterman, </em>249 F.3d at 461; <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 755-56. If a federal prisoner seeks to challenge the imposition of his sentence, he must file a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate the sentence in the district court in which he was sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>fenced. <em>Peterman, </em>249 F.3d at 461; <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 755-56. Hernandez\u2019s habeas corpus petition challenges the imposition of his sentence, not the execution or manner in which his sentence is being served, as he takes issue with the sentencing court\u2019s calculation of his sentence based upon an enhancement for possession of a weapon and a departure for acceptance of responsibility. Thus, \u00a7 2255, not \u00a7 2241, is the proper vehicle by which Hernandez should challenge his sentence. <em>See Peterman, </em>249 F.3d at 461; <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 755-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Nevertheless, Hernandez may be entitled to a review of his claims under \u00a7 2241 if he is able to establish that \u00a7 2255 \u201cis inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Hernandez has not shown that his remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. Thus, the district court properly dismissed Hernandez\u2019s \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition because Hernandez sought to challenge the imposition of his sentence, but failed to establish that the remedy afforded him under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>See Peterman, </em>249 F.3d at 461-62; <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 757-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Accordingly, the motion to proceed in forma pauperis is granted for the limited purpose of deciding this appeal and the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.
