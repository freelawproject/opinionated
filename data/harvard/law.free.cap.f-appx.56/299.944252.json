We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The district court clerk\u2019s office received a letter from Moore stating that errors in his PSR prevented him from participating in programs within the Bureau of Prisons. The district court construed the letter as a motion to correct the PSR under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32, and denied the motion, finding that it lacked jurisdiction to correct a PSR after sentencing. We agree with the district court that it lacked jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Angiulo, </em>57 F.3d 38, 41 (1st Cir.1995) (Rule 32, in and of itself, does not confer jurisdiction on district court to conduct postsentence review).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We deny Moore\u2019s request for reimbursement of his filing fee, as the record does not reflect that he paid the fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-10\">.
