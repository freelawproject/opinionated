We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we review for an abuse of discretion, <em>O\u2019Loughlin v. Doe, </em>920 F.2d 614, 616 (9th Cir.1990), and we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-22\">The district court denied Negrete\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on the ground that he made an \u201cinadequate showing of indigen-cy.\u201d On its face, Negrete\u2019s affidavit and declaration in support of his motion appear adequate to establish indigency. The court offered no explanation for its conclusion to the contrary. <em>See Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 34, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992) (holding that it is appropriate for an appellate court reviewing an IFP dismissal to consider \u201cwhether the [district] court has provided a statement explaining the dismissal that facilitates \u2018intelligent appellate review\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Couveau v. American Airlines, Inc., </em>218 F.3d 1078, 1081 (9th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (\u201cAppellate review is a particularly difficult process when there is nothing to review.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-23\">In addition, Negrete\u2019s complaint appears to state non-frivolous constitutional claims, so alternative grounds do not support the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Cf. O\u2019Loughlin, </em>920 F.2d at 617 (determining IFP status properly denied because complaint was frivolous); <em>see also Denton, </em>504 U.S. at 32-33 (stating that allegations are frivolous if they are \u201cclearly baseless\u201d but not if they are factually unlikely) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Accordingly, we vacate and remand for the district court to allow Negrete to proceed IFP unless it finds other reasons for denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">In light of our disposition, we deny Neg-rete\u2019s request for clarification of why his case was selected for submission without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b423-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
