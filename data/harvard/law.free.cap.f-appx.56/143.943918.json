We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion. We agree Greene\u2019s complaint did not state a claim for the reasons stated by the district court. Under the circumstances of this case, however, we believe the district court should have dismissed Greene\u2019s complaint without prejudice. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order for the reasons stated by the district court with the modification that the dismissal is without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-19\">In No. 02-7856, Greene seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying his motions for appointment of counsel and to recuse the district court judge. This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The order Greene seeks to appeal is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-20\">Accordingly, in No. 02-7313 we affirm as modified to reflect that the dismissal was without prejudice. We deny Greene\u2019s motion for abeyance. In No. 02-7856, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because it is interlocutory. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-21\">No. <em>02-7313-AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-22\">No. <em>02-78m-DISMISSED.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b180-17\">To the extent Greene may be attempting to appeal the district court\u2019s order concerning his motion for a preliminary injunction, Greene did not timely appeal that order. <em>See </em>Fed.
