While the issues presented occasion no need for a published opinion, they have been accorded full consideration by the Court. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 36; D.C. Cir. R. 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b553-19\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order be affirmed substantially for the reasons stated in its opinion. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 1317(a) provides a cause of action, Smith waived his argument regarding <em>Brown v. Brody, </em>199 F.3d 446 (D.C.Cir.1999), on Counts 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 by faffing to raise it in the district court. <em>Amax Land Co. v. Quarterman, </em>181 F.3d 1356,1369 (D.C.Cir. 1999). On Count 2 concerning the alleged denial of sick leave and worker\u2019s compensation after Smith investigated the second cafeteria incident, Smith\u2019s conclusory assertions never demonstrated that his actions constituted \u201cparticipation] ... in a hearing or other proceeding\u201d under the formal OSHA enforcement procedures established in 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341(c). <em>Cf. Smith v. Sec\u2019y of the Navy, </em>659 F.2d 1113, 1121-22 (D.C.Cir.1981) (involving an equal employment opportunity counselor whose job duties by definition involved assisting in investigating Title VII grievances). Nor did he show that his actions that day involved \u201cstepping outside\u201d his normal job duties to \u201coppose[ ] any practice made unlawful\u201d by the Congressional Accountability Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act. <em>Cf. EEOC v. HBE Corp., </em>135 F.3d 543, 554 (8th Cir.1998) (distinguishing the mere reporting of potential compliance problems when such a report is within the scope of an employee\u2019s duties from opposition activities such as refusing to carry out unlawful policies).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-20\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cm. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
