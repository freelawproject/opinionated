United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932); <em>United States v. Garlick, </em>240 F.3d 789, 793-94 (9th Cir.2001). Counts 1 and 2 are factually distinct in date and document. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Kennedy, </em>726 F.2d 546, 548 (9th Cir.1984) (holding that separate sentences may be imposed for each false document submitted to a bank in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>653 F.2d 384, 391 (9th Cir.l981)(stating that calls on different days to the same person are separate acts in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Counts 3 and 5 are not multiplicitous because, although they both charge Lai-meche with violating 18 U.S.C \u00a7 1001, each count requires proof of a different set of facts. The false statements alleged in each count were contained in different documents, <em>see United States v. Bennett, </em>702 F.2d 833, 835 (9th Cir.1983), and concerned different matters within the jurisdiction of the United States. <em>See United States v. Olsowy, </em>836 F.2d 439, 442 (9th Cir.1987) (noting that a false statement made to the Treasury Department and a false statement made to the Secret Service are separate offenses, even though they concern the same subject matter).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Counts 2 and 3 are not multiplicitous because \u00a7 408(a)(7)(B) and \u00a7 1001(a)(2) each require proof of a legal element that the other does not. <em>See Blockburger, </em>284 U.S. at 304; <em>United States v. Solomon, </em>753 F.2d 1522, 1527-28 (9th Cir.1985), <em>superseded on other grounds by Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., </em>43 F.3d 1311 (9th Cir.1995). Although both \u00a7 1001 and \u00a7 408 require proof of a false statement, \u00a7 1001(a)(2) requires the falsity to be material to a matter within the jurisdiction of the United States, while \u00a7 408 does not. Section 408(a)(7)(B) requires false representation of a social security number, while \u00a7 1001 does not. <em>See United States v. Carey, </em>475 F.2d 1019, 1022 (9th Cir.1973) (stating that \u00a7 408 is not a lesser included offense within \u00a7 1001).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b871-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir.
