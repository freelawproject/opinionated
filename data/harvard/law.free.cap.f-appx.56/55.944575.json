(\u201cMBW\u201d) appeals from the March 15, 2002 judgment of the district court affirming the decision of the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Stuart Bernstein, <em>Chief </em>Judge) expunging appellant\u2019s claims filed against the debtor-plaintiff-appellee Robbins International, Inc. (\u201cR-Intl\u201d). <em>See Robbins Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Robbins MBW Corp. (In re Robbins Int\u2019l, Inc.), </em>275 B.R. 456 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). On appeal to this court, MBW argues that (1) the bankruptcy court\u2019s failure to decide MBW\u2019s motion for joinder and its failure to join Izzy Ashkenazy (\u201cIzzy\u201d) and Robbins Stores, Inc. (\u201cR-Stores\u201d) as necessary parties deprived the bankruptcy court of subject matter jurisdiction over the ease; (2) the purchase agreement was not ambiguous, and thus the bankruptcy court\u2019s resort to parol evidence to interpret the agreement was erroneous; (3) the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding that the parties intended to shield R-Intl from liability under the purchase agreement was clearly erroneous and constituted an impermissi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>ble reformation of the contract; (4) the bankruptcy court erred in concluding that R-Intl could not be bound to a pre-incor-poration contract absent ratification, and was clearly erroneous in finding that there was no evidence of ratification; (5) R-Intl could be held liable under a theory of conversion based on Izzy\u2019s fraud; (6) the bankruptcy court erred in concluding that MBW was not a subrogee to R-Intl\u2019s liability for rents to the landlords; and (7) the bankruptcy court erred in denying MBW\u2019s motion to bring a derivative suit against Izzy.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s action <em>de novo, </em>giving the same deference to the bankruptcy court decision as the district court owed. \u201cBecause the district court acted as an appellate court in a bankruptcy case, its decision is subject to plenary review.\u201d <em>Schneiderman v. Bogdanovich (In re Bogdanovich), </em>292 F.3d 104, 109 (2d Cir.2002). As a result, \u201c[w]e accept [the bankruptcy court\u2019s] factual findings unless clearly erroneous, but review [the court\u2019s] conclusions of law <em>de novo.\u201d Bell v. Bell (In re Bell), </em>225 F.3d 203, 209 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">We have reviewed all of the Appellant\u2019s contentions on this appeal and find them to lack merit for substantially the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s thorough opinion. <em>See Robbins Int\u2019l, </em>275 B.R. 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Two of MBW\u2019s arguments are raised for the first time on this appeal: (1) MBW\u2019s claim that R-Int\u2019l could be held liable for conversion, which claim is waived, <em>see Baker v. Dorfman, </em>239 F.3d 415, 423 (2d Cir. 2000) (holding that an argument raised for the first time on appeal is ordinarily waived); and (2) MBW\u2019s claim that the bankruptcy court\u2019s failure to join Izzy and R-Stores deprived it of subject matter jurisdiction over the case. Although a claim that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived, <em>see In re Stock Exchs. Options Trading Antitrust Litig., </em>317 F.3d 134 (2d Cir.2003), we reject this claim as meritless. As MBW acknowledges, the only claims as to which Izzy and R-Stores were necessary parties were the contract claims raised by R-Intl in the alternative to its claim for expungement. The only claim decided on the merits by the bankruptcy court, however, was the expungement claim, which the bankruptcy court had severed for trial and for which joinder was unnecessary. Upon ruling in favor R-Intl on that claim, the bankruptcy court dismissed the contract claims as moot. Because the contract claims were dismissed as moot, joinder was never necessary and the bankruptcy court plainly had subject matter jurisdiction. As for the bankruptcy court\u2019s failure to explicitly decide MBW\u2019s motion for joinder, we would ordinarily remand to the bankruptcy court to resolve the matter in the first instance. In this case, however, it is unnecessary for us to do so because all the claims as to which MBW\u2019s joinder motion expressly pertained were dismissed by the bankruptcy court as moot, and, thus, MBW\u2019s motion for joinder is also moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court affirming the decision of the bankruptcy court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
