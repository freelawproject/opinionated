We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997). We review for sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>stantial evidence, <em>Reyes-Guerrero v. INS, </em>192 F.3d 1241, 1244 (9th Cir.1999), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The BIA correctly dismissed Contreras-Pabon\u2019s appeal because his vague testimony regarding threats he received failed to demonstrate he was at risk of harm. <em>See Sebastian-Sebastian v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 504, 507 (9th Cir.1999). Accordingly, Contreras-Pabon failed to establish eligibility for asylum and therefore failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See de Leon-Barrios v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 391, 394 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Contreras-Pabon\u2019s contention that his due process rights were violated lacks merit because Contreras-Pabon was represented by counsel and was afforded a full and fair opportunity to present testimony and evidence. <em>See Cuadras v. INS, </em>910 F.2d 567, 573 (9th Cir.1990) (holding that an alien is entitled to the Fifth Amendment guarantee of due process, which is satisfied by a full and fair hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b427-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
