Upon entering the bank, Ward spoke to two employees about the weather, and then handed a teller a note that read, \u201cDon\u2019t say a word. I have a gun. No joke.\u201d On appeal, he challenges the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> imposition of a 2-level threat-of-death enhancement, arguing that he conveyed only a threat of a gun, not a threat of death; and that he in fact had no gun and had specifically decided not to have a weapon, so as to reduce the risk of harm to anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-21\">We conclude that Ward\u2019s note indicating he had a gun amounted to a threat of death. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F); <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>253 F.3d 1131, 1137 (8th Cir.2001) (defendant\u2019s threat to bank teller that he had gun at most supported 2-level threat-of-death enhancement, as opposed to 5-level actual-possession enhancement, where gun was in car with co-defendant and was not taken into bank); <em>United States v. Cadotte, </em>57 F.3d 661, 661-62 (8th Cir.1995) (per curiam) (construing statement that robber had .357 magnum in his pocket and \u201cno one will get hurt\u201d if teller put money in bag as express threat of death), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 1076, 116 S.Ct. 783, 133 L.Ed.2d 733 (1996). Nothing in the record suggests that a reasonable teller would not have taken the note seriously and feared being shot. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1, comment. (n.6) (intent of \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) is to increase offense level where offender \u201cengaged in conduct that would instill in a reasonable person, who is a victim of the offense, a fear of death\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b795-23\">. The Honorable William R.
