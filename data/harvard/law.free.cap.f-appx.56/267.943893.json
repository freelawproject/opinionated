Jackson (\u201cJackson\u201d) sued his employer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Go-Tane Services, Inc. (\u201cGo-Tane\u201d), under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cFLSA\u201d), for failure to compensate him with overtime pay. Go-Tane argued that Jackson, who worked for Go-Tane as a Car Wash \u201cmanager,\u201d from 1996 to 1999, qualified as a bona fide \u201cexecutive\u201d under FLSA, and that Jackson was thus exempt from the applicable overtime requirements. After a bench trial, the district court found that Jackson did not meet FLSA\u2019s requirements for \u201cexecutive\u201d status because: (1) management was not his primary duty and (2) he did not regularly and customarily supervise the equivalent of two full-time employees. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(1); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.1(f). Accordingly, the district court entered judgment against Go-Tane, in the amount of $9,960, which included both actual and liquidated damages. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\n<em>I. Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">During the relevant time period, from August 30, 1997 to July 8, 1998,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Go-Tane owned and operated 20 gasoline stations and one car wash facility (the \u201cCar Wash\u201d) in the Chicago area.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Each of Go-Tane\u2019s service stations had an on-site manager, and Plaintiff Everett Jackson was the \u201cmanager\u201d at the Car Wash. Jackson was paid on a \u201csalary\u201d basis, earning $345 for each 48-hour week, and $360 for each 54-hour week. Jackson also received benefits, such as medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">Although Jackson was the \u201cmanager\u201d of the Car Wash, in title, Don Adamcyk, the General Manager of all of Go-Tane\u2019s facilities, testified that he (Adamcyk) actually \u201covers[aw] <em>everything\u201d </em>at the Car Wash. Tr.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> at 37 (emphasis added). Therefore, while Jackson took care of customer complaints and performed basic administrative responsibilities with respect to the Car Wash attendants, including scheduling matters as well as training and discipline, when it came to making hiring and firing decisions, and setting the pay rates for new hirees, Jackson had little independent authority. Jackson testified that he made \u201crecommendations\u201d regarding employment matters, but that he had to seek Adam-cyk\u2019s authorization before setting an employee\u2019s rate of pay, or hiring or firing an employee. <em>Id. </em>at 148-50. Adamcyk confirmed, testifying that, in setting pay rates, Jackson \u201chad to run [his decisions] by me.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Adamcyk further admitted that in <em>\u201cany </em>instance when Jackson wanted to terminate someone,\u201d Jackson would first approach Adamcyk. <em>Id. </em>at 94 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">Jackson testified that, in spite of the fact that he held the title of \u201cmanager,\u201d he nonetheless performed a significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>amount of <em>non-managerial </em>tasks. According to the trial record, an estimated <em>95% </em>of Jackson\u2019s work time was spent doing tasks identical to those performed by the Car Wash attendants. <em>Id. </em>at 150. Jackson\u2019s non-managerial duties included sweeping, window cleaning, gardening, emptying the garbage, cleaning the car wash tunnels, and booth cleaning. <em>Id. </em>at 148. Jackson\u2019s testimony regarding his non-managerial responsibilities was corroborated by the testimony of Edward Paige, another Car Wash attendant. Paige stated, on direct examination, that Jackson frequently swept the premises, emptied garbage cans, did window washing, planting, shoveling, worked the cashier register, and guided cars through the wash tunnel. <em>Id. </em>at 138-40. Paige further explained that \u201c[he and Jackson] worked [car wash attendant-type tasks] together ... [w]e worked together, whatever we had to do, you know, me and him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141^42.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Paige was one of a number of attendants hired by Go-Tane to assist Jackson at the Car Wash. At any one time, there were around three to five attendants on the work schedule. <em>Id. </em>at 130. The attendants were assigned a total of 138 hours per week in the off-season and 200 hours per week during peak season; however, they did not always work a full schedule.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to the time sheets, the <em>total weekly work hours of all of the other employees </em>under Jackson\u2019s supervision exceeded 80 hours per week only 67% of the time during the relevant time period. Go-Tane Ex. 4, Tr. at 5. And, while Adamcyk maintained that Jackson had been directed to staff the Car Wash with at least two other full-time employees at all times, Tr. at 41-43, Jackson testified that Adamcyk had in fact told him keep the Car Wash attendants\u2019 hours down. Tr. at 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">\n<em>II. Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">On August 30, 1999, Jackson filed this action in the district court, seeking money damages in connection with Go-Tane\u2019s alleged violation of FLSA\u2019s overtime requirements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After conducting a bench trial, the trial judge, on December 12, 2001, ruled that based upon the totality of the evidence presented, including testimony, documents and other exhibits, Jackson did not qualify as an \u201cexempt\u201d employee under FLSA, and thus Go-Tane was guilty of violating the applicable overtime requirements by failing to compensate Jackson for overtime work as required under FLSA. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a). Go-Tane\u2019s Ex. A, Tr. at 6. Jackson, however, failed to establish that this alleged violation was \u201cwillful,\u201d so the district court applied a two-year (as opposed to three-year) statute of limitations to Jackson\u2019s claim. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255(a). Go-Tane\u2019s Ex. B, Tr. at 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">In light of the evidence presented at the hearing on the damages phase, on February 20, 2000, the trial court ruled that Jackson was entitled to liquidated damages, based on its finding that Go-Tane had not met the burden of demonstrating that its violation was done in \u201cgood faith.\u201d Go-Tane\u2019s Ex. C, Tr. at 2. Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>trial court entered judgment in favor of Jackson in the amount of $9,960 ($4,980 actual damages plus $4,980 liquidated damages). <em>Id. </em>at 3. Go-Tane appeals from the court\u2019s finding of liability, as well as its decision to grant liquidated damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\n<em>III. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\n<em>A. \u201cBona fide executive\u201d determination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">FLSA\u2019s overtime regulations require employers to compensate an employee who works more than forty hours per week \u201cat a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a). Such \u201ctime and a half\u201d compensation requirement does not apply, however, to \u201cany employee in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(1). In claiming the \u201cbona fide executive\u201d exemption as an affirmative defense, an employer bears the burden of establishing that the employee in question is properly classified under such exception. <em>Coming Glass Works v. Brennan, </em>417 U.S. 188, 196-97, 94 S.Ct. 2223, 2229, 41 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974). Such exemptions are narrowly construed by the courts, <em>Mitchell v. Lublin, McGaughy &amp; Assoc., </em>358 U.S. 207, 211, 79 S.Ct. 260, 264, 3 L.Ed.2d 243 (1959), and are applied only where it \u201cplainly and unmistakably comes within the statute\u2019s terms and spirit\u201d to deny the employee overtime. <em>Arnold v. Ben Kanowsky Inc., </em>361 U.S. 388, 390, 80 S.Ct. 453, 4 L.Ed.2d 393 (1960). Following a bench trial, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>Donais v. United States, </em>232 F.3d 595, 598 (7th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Under FLSA, an employer may demonstrate that the \u201cexecutive\u201d exemption applies by satisfying either a six-part test (\u201clong test\u201d) specified in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.1, or a three-part test (\u201cshort test\u201d) detailed in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.1(f). Where, as here, it is undisputed that the employee in question earns more than $250 per week, the short test applies. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.1(f). Under the short test, Go-Tane must prove that: (1) plaintiff is paid on a salary basis, (2) plaintiffs <em>primary duty </em>consists of the management of the employer\u2019s enterprise, and (3) plaintiffs job duties require him to customarily and regularly direct the work of two or more other full-time employees. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-13\">After considering the evidence presented during the trial, the court found that Go-Tane had failed to prove that Jackson was a \u201cbona fide executive\u201d under FLSA, because it had not demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that Jackson\u2019s \u201cprimary duties\u201d also consisted of the management of the Car Wash. <em>See </em>GoTane\u2019s Ex. A, Tr. at 4.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On appeal, GoTane argues that, considering Adamcyk\u2019s testimony that Jackson was responsible for \u201chiring any employees, terminating any employees, coming up with the rate of pay per the employees ... [and generally] running and operating th[e Car Wash] ... \u201d, Tr. at 35, the district court erroneously held that Jackson was not a bona fide executive. Go-Tane also credits the testimony of one of the Car Wash attendants, that Jackson was \u201cin charge\u201d of the Car Wash, as establishing that Jackson qualified as a \u201cmanager\u201d under FLSA\u2019s exemption. Tr. at 125 (Paige\u2019s testimony that Jackson gave the attendants direction as to \u201cwhat to do\u201d at the Car Wash).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>When determining whether any employee qualifies as a bona fide \u201cexecutive\u201d under the FLSA, a court must review whether an employee\u2019s \u201cprimary duty\u201d is management. The \u201cprimary duty\u201d determination must be made on a case-by-case basis, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.103, but \u201cit may be taken as a good rule of thumb that primary duty means the major part, or <em>over 50 percent </em>of the employee\u2019s time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Other factors that may be considered in the \u201cprimary duty\u201d analysis include: (1) the relative importance of the managerial duties as compared to other types of duties, (2) the frequency with which the employee exercises discretionary powers, (3) the employee\u2019s relative freedom from supervision, and (4) the relationship between the employee\u2019s salary and the wages paid other employees for the kind of nonexempt work performed by the supervisor. <em>Id.; see also Vela et al. v. City of Houston et al, </em>276 F.3d 659, 677 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">In this case, there was a wealth of evidence presented at trial that, although Go-Tane conferred upon Jackson the title of Car Wash \u201cmanager,\u201d Go-Tane, in practice, entrusted Jackson with very few responsibilities and had him operate as a glorified Car Wash attendant. As a Car Wash attendant, Edward Paige, testified at trial, aside from time spent doing scheduling and handling money at the end of the day, Jackson \u201cdid basically the same duties [as a Car Wash attendant].\u201d Tr. at 143. Paige noted that Jackson regularly: (1) swept the Car Wash premises, (2) emptied garbage cans, (3) cleaned the Car Wash booth\u2019s windows, (4) did landscaping work, (5) shoveled snow, (6) worked the cashier register, and (7) guided cars into the car wash. Tr. at 138-40. Paige further testified that he and Jackson \u201cworked ... together\u201d doing these Car Wash attendant-type tasks. Tr. at 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Moreover, there was unrefuted evidence that such mundane janitorial duties and non-managerial tasks comprised <em>well over 50% </em>of Jackson\u2019s work hours. Jackson himself testified that he spent <em>95% of his time at work </em>performing the <em>same tasks </em>as the Car Wash attendants. <em>See </em>Tr. at 150. Adamcyk, for his part, was unable to estimate the amount of time that Jackson spent doing attendant-type tasks versus the time spent doing managerial work, Tr. at 91, and further testified that he knew of no documents that would help determine such time allocation. Tr. at 92. Thus, according to Jackson\u2019s unrefuted testimony at trial, the amount of time that Jackson generally spent on managerial duties fell well below the 50% benchmark set forth under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.103.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">To the extent that Jackson performed <em>any </em>managerial responsibilities, no evidence was presented establishing that such duties were overwhelmingly important as compared to the regular Car Wash attendant tasks that Jackson performed 95% of the time. Jackson was not <em>compensated </em>for such \u201cmanagerial\u201d tasks over and above what the regular Car Wash attendants were paid, given that, as the trial judge found, Jackson\u2019s \u201csalary work[ed] out to $6.66 per hour,\u201d and was thus \u201conly slightly higher than Paige\u2019s wage rate of $6.00 an hour, as a[ Car Wash] attendant.\u201d Go-Tane\u2019s Ex. A, Tr. at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">And, as far as the extent of Jackson\u2019s discretionary power was concerned, the district court expressly found that, \u201c[w]hile Adamcyk <em>tried to give the impression </em>that Jackson had great independent authority,\u201d the documents and other testimony \u201cconcerning hiring and firing, and granting raises clearly show[] that Jackson had to clear any such action with Adamcyk.\u201d Go-Tane\u2019s Ex. A, Tr. at 5 (emphasis added). Given that we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>frequently stated in our opinions that the \u201ctrial judge is in the best position to judge the credibility of witnesses who offer conflicting testimony,\u201d <em>United States v. Woods, </em>233 F.3d 482, 484 (7th Cir.2000), such a credibility determination \u201ccan virtually never be clear error.\u201d <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer, </em>470 U.S. 564, 575, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985). Moreover, in this case, the district court\u2019s ruling and decision to discredit Adamcyk\u2019s testimony that Jackson had broad independent authority was well supported by the evidence presented at trial. Jackson\u2019s testimony, and even certain other testimony of Adamcyk, clearly established that Jackson had <em>very little </em>independent discretion in executing any management decisions related to the operation of the Car Wash. Jackson testified that, with regards to hiring and firing decisions, he always made <em>recommendations </em>to Adamcyk about who to hire or terminate, and had no authority to make such decisions on his own. Tr. at 149. He further testified that he was without authority to set other employees\u2019 rates of pay. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, as Adam-cyk himself admitted, when setting employees\u2019 pay rates, Jackson \u201chad to run it by me.\u201d Tr. at 37. Adamcyk also testified that \u201cJackson ... approached me <em>in any instance </em>when he wanted to terminate someone.\u201d Tr. at 94 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the record supports the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that Jackson was in fact vested with very little meaningful, independent authority, if any, in particular with respect to employment decisions at the Car Wash.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Because the record supports the court\u2019s conclusion that Jackson\u2019s primary duty at the Car Wash was <em>not </em>management, and that Go-Tane thus failed to establish a necessary requirement under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.1(f),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> this Court hereby affirms its conclusion that Jackson did not meet the requirements of the \u201cbona fide executive.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>\n<em>B. Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Under FLSA, liquidated damages are mandatory, unless the trial court determines that the employer, while acting in good faith, reasonably believed that its conduct was consistent with the law. <em>See 29 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 260. An employer seeking to avoid imposition of liquidated damages under FLSA \u201cbears a <em>substantial burden </em>in showing that it acted reasonably and with good faith.\u201d <em>Bankston v. State of Ill., </em>60 F.3d 1249, 1254 (7th Cir.1995) (emphasis added). We review the district court\u2019s factual determinations regarding the liquidated damages issue for clear error, and its application of the law <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">In this case, the district court noted that plaintiff was an \u201cunskilled worker whose main dut[y] was washing cars.\u201d Go-Tane\u2019s Ex. C, Tr. at 2. As the trial judge went on to state, Jackson had only \u201cminor clerical duties that did not approach that of a manager.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On the basis of such facts, the trial judge concluded that \u201cdefendant ... failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it acted in good faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">In urging us to reverse the district court\u2019s award of liquidated damages, Go-Tane argues that \u201c[a]t no time did the district court find, nor did Jackson even attempt to prove, that Go-Tane\u2019s action in this case was a deliberate violation of the FLSA.\u201d Go-Tane\u2019s Br. at 24. In so arguing, Go-Tane fails to recognize that the burden in this instance was on Defendant-Appellant <em>Go-Tane </em>to convince the Court that its actions were reasonable and in good faith \u2014 not on Jackson. And, as the trial court correctly found, Go-Tane failed to meet its burden in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">Given that the record establishes that Jackson spent the <em>overwhelming majority </em>of his time \u2014 95% of his workday \u2014 performing the duties of a Car Wash attendant, and that he was vested with <em>little to no independent authority </em>in the performance of his limited managerial duties, it is difficult to ascertain how Go-Tane could have believed that Jackson qualified as a \u201cbona fide executive\u201d under FLSA. Moreover, in light of the extremely limited nature of Jackson\u2019s management responsibilities, even if Go-Tane <em>did </em>believe that Jackson was exempt from FLSA\u2019s overtime requirements, such belief was unreasonable under the ruling case law and the circumstances set forth in this record. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s award of liquidated damages.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-6\">. The instant suit was filed on August 30, 1999. Because the district court found that Go-Tane\u2019s violation of FLSA was not \"willful,\u201d Jackson\u2019s FLSA claim was subject to a two-year statute of limitations. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255(a). Therefore, the relevant time period begins on August 30, 1997, and ends on July 8, 1998, when Jackson ceased to be a Car Wash \u201cmanager\u201d for Go-Tane.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b304-7\">.

Because Go-Tane made a Rule 68 Offer of Judgment to the party-plaintiffs, and because they accepted this offer, the district court entered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, and thus their claims did not proceed to trial. <em>See Jackson v. Go-Tane Services, Inc., </em>No. 99-C-5686 (N.D. 111. Sept. 24, 2001) (entry of judgment in favor of the party-plaintiffs). Their claims are therefore not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b306-8\">. The district court also found that Go-Tane had <em>not </em>met its burden of demonstrating the exemption on the additional basis that Go-Tane had \u201cfailed to establish that Jackson customarily managed two or more full time equivalent employees.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Exhibit A, Tr. at 4-5. For this Court\u2019s discussion of such holding, see <em>infra </em>note 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b308-4\">. According to the trial court, Go-Tane also failed to demonstrate that Jackson regularly and customarily directed the work of two or more full-time employees, as required under the second prong of the \"short test.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 241.1(f). We need not reach this issue, because, as we have previously stated, Go-Tane failed to establish the first necessary requisite under the short test. Nonetheless, if we were to reach the issue, we would affirm the district court's finding on the basis that, as established by Go-Tane's own work records, Go-Tane Ex. 4, the Car Wash attendants that Jackson supervised worked the requisite \"full-time\u201d schedule (i.e., a total of 80 hours a week) only 67% of the time that they were under Jackson\u2019s supervision. <em>See </em>Go-Tane's Ex. A, Tr. at 5. Moreover, according to Jackson\u2019s testimony, Adamcyk instructed him to keep the attendants\u2019 hours down, Tr. at 156, presumably to minimize labor costs. We agree with the reasoning in <em>Secretary of Labor v. Daylight Dairy Products, Inc., </em>779 F.2d 784, 788 (7th Cir.1985), that, where the supervised employees work \u201cfull time\u201d only 67% of the time over the relevant time period, such amount of supervision falls short of the \"regular and customary\u201d supervision of two full-time employees that is required under Section 241.1(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b308-9\">. Jackson also argues that the \"sole charge\u201d exception, set forth under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.113, does not apply in the instant case, on the basis that Go-Tane has \"waived\u201d the sole charge \"defense\u201d under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.113. Jackson\u2019s Br. at 14-15. The trial judge ruled that Go-Tane could not avail itself of Section 541.113's sole charge exemption, because it never raised the exemption in its pre-trial order.

Martinez, </em>295 F.3d 809, 815 (8th Cir.2002) (\" 'a party may be barred from advancing theories that are not identified in the pretrial order.\u2019 \u201d). But we also note that Go-Tane could not have benefitted from the \"sole charge\u201d exemption in any case, because the \"sole charge\u201d exemption, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.113, merely provides an exception to one of the requirements set forth under the so-called \"long test,\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.1(e), which, as discussed above, does not apply in the instant case. Moreover, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>failing the \"primary duty\u201d requirement of the short test, Go-Tane also fails a necessary requirement of the long test. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.1(a). Therefore, this Court need not consider whether Jackson meets any of the other requirements of the long test, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.1(e), or, for that matter, whether Jackson is exempted from one of the \"long test\u201d requirements by virtue of the \u201csole charge\u201d exemption. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.113.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b309-13\">. Jackson claims that, if we were to reverse the liquidated damages award, he would be entitled to pre-judgment interest. <em>See </em>Jackson\u2019s Br. at 22. Because we affirm the district court's decision to award liquidated damages, we need not consider Jackson\u2019s argument regarding pre-judgment interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
