So holding would be contrary to our well-settled case law, as set forth by the District Court in its extensive and thoroughly-supported opinion, <em>Das v. Our Lady of Mercy Medical Center, </em>No. 00 Civ. 2574, slip, op., 2002 WL 826877 (Apr. 30, 2002 S.D.N.Y.), and we decline to do so. The extensive history of poor performance reviews, which commences prior to the hiring of the supervisor, Renee Cortez, whom Das alleges discriminated against him, and which includes a record of gross breaches of his employer\u2019s sanitation and safety standards, fully meets the employer\u2019s burden of proffering a non-discriminatory motive for terminating Das. Das\u2019s rebuttal that the underlying motivation was racial animus for each and every negative review does not, absent any meaningful factual support, overcome the presumption that the employer acted legitimately. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
