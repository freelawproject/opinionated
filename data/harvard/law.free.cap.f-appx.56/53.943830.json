The district court sentenced Siler to 24 months of imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently. Siler is currently serving his sentence. On appeal, Siler argues that the district court erroneously: 1) applied a two-level enhancement under United States Sentencing Guideline (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 2Dl.1(b)(1) for possession of a weapon during the commission of the drug possession and distribution count; and 2) denied his motion for a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Siler makes two arguments with respect to the district court\u2019s application of the weapon possession enhancement. First, he contends that the district court erroneously applied this enhancement (which is applicable only to drug counts) to the extortion count. There is no merit to this argument. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, all four counts were grouped and the sentence was calculated based on the offense with the highest offense level (in this case, the crack possession and distribution count). <em>See </em>Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) at 10-11; Tr. of Sentencing Hr\u2019g, at 6-7. Therefore, the district court could not have applied this enhancement to the extortion count.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Next Siler argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the district court\u2019s factual findings with respect to the enhancement because the district court \u201cmerely relied upon the language in ... the Indictment, and the virtually identical language in the plea and cooperation agreement.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 15. However, at the sentencing hearing the district court specifically adopted (and Siler made no objection to) \u201cthe factual statements contained in the presentence report.\u201d The PSR contains enough facts about Siler\u2019s criminal conduct to support the district court\u2019s conclusion that Siler had a firearm and that firearm was sufficiently connected to his criminal conduct to justify the enhancement. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. 3 (\u201cThe adjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d); <em>United States v. Zichettello, </em>208 F.3d 72,107 (2d Cir.2000) (\u201cthe district court adopted the factual findings of the Presentence Report, which provided an ample basis to support the enhancements\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Finally, we review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a downward departure only where \u201cthe guidelines were misapplied\u201d or \u201cthe court misapprehended its authority or imposed an illegal sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Haynes, </em>985 F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir.1993). Because Siler has not argued that the district court\u2019s refusal to grant a downward departure was based on a legal error or a misapprehension of its authority, we dismiss Siler\u2019s appeal with respect to this issue. <em>See United States v. Stephenson, </em>183 F.3d 110, 120 (2d Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">For the reasons set forth above, the appeal is DISMISSED in part, with respect to the claim that the district court abused its discretion in declining to grant a downward departure, and the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>of the District Court is otherwise hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
