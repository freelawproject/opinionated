Thompson was charged with four counts of distributing or possessing with intent to distribute cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 812, 841(a)(1), and 841(b)(1)(C). Following his conviction, Thompson was sentenced to a term of 71 months\u2019 imprisonment, five years\u2019 supervised release and a special assessment of $400. On appeal, Thompson makes two claims: (1) violation of the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161 <em>et seq, </em>based on six continuances occurring between his arrest and his preliminary hearing, while plea negotiations with the government were ongoing; (2) ineffective assistance of counsel by his two prior counsel, who represented him during the pre-indictment plea negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\u201c[A] defendant who knowingly and voluntarily enters a guilty plea waives all nonjurisdictional defects in the prior proceedings.\u201d <em>Lebowitz v. United States, </em>877 F.2d 207, 209 (2d Cir.1989). \u201cBecause a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial is nonju-risdictional, a knowing and voluntary guilty plea waives a speedy trial claim unless the defendant specifically reserves the right to appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Coffin, </em>76 F.3d 494, 496 (2d Cir.1996). In order to enter a conditional plea, \u201ca defendant must obtain the approval of the court and the consent of the government, and he must reserve the right to appeal in writing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497; <em>see also </em>F.R.Cr.P. 11(a)(2). Thompson made no attempt to condition his plea on the right to appeal, as authorized by Rule 11(a)(2). Accordingly, Thompson\u2019s guilty plea was unconditional and waived all nonjurisdictional defects, including the alleged violation of the Speedy Trial Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Thompson\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is that his two prior counsel-who represented Thompson during the pre-indictment plea negotiations, but not during his plea-failed adequately to consult with him before requesting continuances during the pre-indictment plea negotiations with the government. This claim is not available to Thompson. Ineffective assistance claims challenging the assistance of counsel prior to the entry of an unconditional guilty plea, and unrelated to that plea, may not be raised on appeal. <em>See Coffin, </em>76 F.3d at 497-98; <em>see also Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">The judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
