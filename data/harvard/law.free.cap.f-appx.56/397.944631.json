We review the BIA\u2019s denial of Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1187 (9th Cir.2001)(en banc). Because the BIA did not abuse its discretion in this case, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-21\">In <em>Martinez-Zelaya v. INS, </em>we explained that our review on appeal is \u201cconfined to the BIA\u2019s decision and the bases on which the BIA relied.\u201d 841 F.2d 294, 296 (9th Cir.1988). The BIA denied Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen on the sole ground that it was untimely filed under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(c)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petitioners\u2019 sole argument contesting this determination is that the BIA lacked jurisdiction to institute removal proceedings against one of the petitioners, Garcia-Rodrigues, because of his pending Special Agricultural Worker (\u201cSAW\u201d) application. We rejected this argument in <em>Yao v. INS, </em>and held that \u201c[w]hile an applicant may not be deported [while an SAW application is pending], no statutory or regulatory provision bars the initiation of deportation proceedings or precludes the entry of a deportation order. The order simply may not be executed unless and until an adverse legalization determination is made and is final.\u201d 2 F.3d 317, 319 (9th Cir.1993) We conclude that the BIA had jurisdiction over Petitioners to commence deportation proceedings against the Petitioners. Because Petitioners have not presented any other arguments demonstrating that the BIA abused its discretion in denying the Petitioners\u2019 untimely motion to reopen, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-22\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b433-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b433-25\">.
