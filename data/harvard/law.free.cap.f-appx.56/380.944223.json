We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-17\">At sentencing, the district court applied a two-level increase of the offense level for possession of a firearm under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). Lemar contends the two-level increase was not warranted because there was no evidence indicating he or any of his co-conspirators possessed a firearm during the commission of their offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-20\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s finding that the defendant possessed a firearm during the commission of a narcotics offense. <em>See United States v. Willis, </em>899 F.2d 873, 874 (9th Cir.1990). A criminal defendant can be held accountable for a firearm possessed by a co-conspirator, if the possession was reasonably foreseeable to the defendant as part of the criminal activity. <em>See id. </em>at 875 (holding that actual knowledge of a co-conspirator possessing a firearm qualifies as foreseeability). Lemar testified at sentencing that during narcotics transactions he knew that one of his co-conspirators carried a firearm. Accordingly, the district court appropriately granted the two-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b416-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
