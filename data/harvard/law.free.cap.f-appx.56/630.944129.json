These cases have been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>In 1997, a Michigan state court jury found Leonard O\u2019Neil Turner guilty of felony-firearm and second degree murder for the shooting death of Turner\u2019s estranged wife. A Michigan appellate court affirmed Turner\u2019s conviction and respective sentences of two years plus twenty-five to fifty years. Turner filed a petition for a writ of federal habeas corpus relief in 2000 in which he raised three constitutional challenges to his conviction. The district court denied the relief sought and granted Turner a certificate of appealability on one compound issue only. Turner thereafter took two successive notices of appeal from the same judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The issue on appeal is whether the district court properly decided that Turner was not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus based on his two-part ground for relief raising related issues based on the holding in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). This court\u2019s review of the judgment on appeal is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (the \u201cAED-PA\u201d). <em>Lindh v. Murphy, </em>521 U.S. 320, 326-27, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997). The AEDPA provides that a federal court may grant a writ of habeas corpus to a person in custody pursuant to a state court judgment only if the state court adjudication of the claim: 1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or 2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). \u201c[A] federal habeas court making the \u2018unreasonable application\u2019 inquiry should ask whether the state court\u2019s application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 409, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). An application is not \u201cobjectively unreasonable\u201d merely because the federal court believes it to be erroneous or incorrect. \u201cRather, that application must also be unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411. A district court\u2019s decision to deny a \u00a7 2254 petition is subject to de novo review. <em>Rogers v. Howes, </em>144 F.3d 990, 992 (6th Cir.1998), although the findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <em>Cone v. Bell, </em>243 F.3d 961, 967 (6th Cir.2001). An examination of the record and law under these standards supports the district court\u2019s judgment on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">On February 19, 1996, at approximately 7:40 p.m., a Detroit, Michigan, emergency \u201c911\u201d operator received a call from Turner in which Turner said that he had just shot his wife. Detroit police Officers Chalou and Brooks, the latter of whom actually heard the 911 call, responded to the address thirty minutes later. The two officers proceeded to the address where they were met by Turner. The officers asked Turner what had happened and Turner replied that he had shot his wife. The officers entered the residence, saw the victim on the floor with a gunshot wound, and the officers then \u201ctried to find out more information from Mr. Turner what had happened.\u201d Turner told the officers that two African-American men had forced their way into the residence to buy drugs and Turner told them he didn\u2019t sell drugs. Turner then said that one of the intruders pulled a gun, the victim jumped in between the men and the gun went off. The police officers, when confronted with a story of two perpetrators, attempted to get a description of them from Turner. At this point, Turner became enraged and denied knowing any further details. Turner eventually threw a chair against a wall, causing the officers to place Turner in restraints and took him to the police station. It appears without contradiction that, at no time, did either of the officers formally advise Turner of his <em>Miranda </em>rights at the crime scene. Trial counsel for Turner ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>jected to the jury hearing this testimony, on the grounds that Turner made these statements without having received his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, but the district summarily overruled this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">The jury also heard evidence of two later statements made by Turner after he had been taken into custody and given <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The first, offered on February 19, 1996, was a statement by Turner essentially fleshing out his claim that the shooting was the result of an argument between Turner and two armed men who came to the residence looking for drugs. The second statement was taken from Turner the following day. Turner was again advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and gave a radically different account of the shooting. Turner said that he and the victim were sitting at the dining room table and were discussing the possibility of the victim returning to live with Turner. Turner stated that he was \u201cfiddling\u201d around with a loaded handgun during the discussion and the described the shooting as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-5\">I had squeezed the trigger so the hammer would go back. I was trying to pull it back and cock it. I had had two empty spaces, cylinders, and four bullets in the gun. I was looking right at the empty holes and I was pulling the hammer back trying to ease it down when it fired. Rolanda [the victim] was sitting in the chair in front of me at the table when she got up and the gun went off.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Turner went on to describe how he had attempted to make the scene look as if the shooting had been the product of an aborted robbery attempt, even going so far as to shoot into the floor before driving around the block and throwing the gun from the window. The officer who took the statement subsequently retrieved the gun based on Turner\u2019s description of the area where he discarded it. The trial court also overruled defense counsel\u2019s objection to the introduction into evidence of the foregoing statements. The jury found Turner guilty of the felon/firearm count and of second degree murder and Turner took a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">The Michigan appellate court considered Turner\u2019s claim of trial error with regard to the admission of the crime scene statements as well as his later incriminating statements at the station house. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in admitting the crime scene statements, and the court also concluded that there was no reversible error in the admission of the inculpatory statement Turner made in custody. The Michigan Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">Turner made the same arguments to the district court concerning these two statements in his \u00a7 2254 petition and the court rejected them on the same legal grounds (citing federal law instead of essentially identical Michigan law) as did the state court. Turner was given permission to raise these claims again in the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">The district court did not err in declining to grant the writ on the grounds in issue. <em>Miranda </em>warnings deal only with \u201cthe admissibility of statements obtained from an individual who is subjected to custodial police interrogation.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 439 (1966). There is no requirement for police officers to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings to everyone whom they question. <em>Oregon v. Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 495, 97 S.Ct. 711, 50 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977). Police must administer the warnings only \u201cwhere there has been such a restriction on a person\u2019s freedom as to render him in custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Whether one is in custody depends upon \u201chow a reasonable man in the suspect\u2019s position would have understood his situation.\u201d <em>Berkemer v. McCarty, </em>468 U.S. 420, 442, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1984). Of particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>relevance to the appeal at bar is the notion that general on-the-scene questioning by police officers as to facts surrounding a crime or other general questioning of persons at the scene is not affected by the holding in <em>Miranda. Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">An examination of Turner\u2019s on-the-scene statements under the foregoing standard shows that he was plainly not entitled to any <em>Miranda </em>warnings where he immediately blurted out, to the arriving officers, that he had shot his wife and then proceeded to give the officers a reason to question him further in an effort to apprehend the two alleged perpetrators. The officers\u2019 focus was plainly on the capture of these two other suspects and Turner himself is responsible for any additional questioning in this vein. The district court was correct in concluding that the Michigan state court\u2019s findings to this effect were neither contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, controlling federal law. The claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The second aspect of Turner\u2019s <em>Miranda-based </em>claim, that is, that his initial coerced statements caused him to make the second, more damaging statements, has even less merit. Although the Supreme Court has recognized the hypothetical psychological effect of the \u201ccat out of the bag\u201d theory to the extent that the later confession may always be partially the result of the first, <em>United States v. Bayer, </em>331 U.S. 532, 540, 67 S.Ct. 1394, 91 L.Ed. 1654 (1947), the Court held that a coerced confession does not \u201cperpetually disable[ ] the confessor from making a usable one\u201d in new circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 541. In <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985), the Court relied on <em>Bayer </em>for the proposition that \u201cthis Court has never gone so far as to hold that making a confession under circumstances which preclude its use, perpetually disables the confessor from making a usable one after those conditions have been removed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311 (quoting <em>Bayer, </em>331 U.S. at 540-41). Ultimately, the question is not whether the first confession caused the second confession but whether the second confession was voluntary. <em>United States v. Daniel, </em>932 F.2d 517, 519-521 (6th Cir.1991). In the case at bar, the uncontradicted testimony of the officer who took the final, damaging statement was that Turner had received, and acknowledged, his full panoply of <em>Miranda </em>warnings before making the statement. In the absence of any other possible indicia of coercion, the district court properly concluded that the Michigan state court again correctly cited and interpreted relevant, controlling federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.
