We deny the stay and affirm the dismissal of his civil rights suit for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-22\">Plaintiff filed his federal civil rights suit, arguing that the defendant state court judges interfered with his constitutional rights as a parent. In a thorough order, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>the district court dismissed plaintiffs suit for lack of jurisdiction under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>See Dist. of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923). As the district court repeated, <em>\u201cRooker-Feldman </em>precludes \u2018a party losing in state court ... from seeking what in substance would be appellate review of [a] state judgment in a United States district court, based on the losing party\u2019s claim that the state judgment itself violates the loser\u2019s federal rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kenmen Eng\u2019g v. City of Union, </em>314 F.3d 468, 473 (10th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Johnson v. De Grandy, </em>512 U.S. 997, 1005-06, 114 S.Ct. 2647, 129 L.Ed.2d 775 (1994)). The district court correctly noted that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine applies to all state court judgments. <em>See id. </em>We are convinced that plaintiffs suit is barred by <em>Rocker-Feldman. </em>Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The motion for stay is denied and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b496-7\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
