Garcia alleges that his deportation was defective because the Immigration Judge (IJ) incorrectly concluded that Garcia had a prior aggravated felony conviction which made him ineligible for discretionary relief under former \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). We affirm the judgment of the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Because Garcia had a previous conviction for an aggravated felony, he was ineligible for discretionary relief. <em>See </em>Antiter-rorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), \u00a7 440(d), Pub.L. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (Apr. 24, 1996) (making aggravated felons ineligible for discretionary relief). Garcia\u2019s past conviction for indecent contact with a minor is considered an aggravated felony according to \u00a7 321 of the Illegal Immigration Responsibility and Reform Act (IIRIRA). <em>See </em>IIR-IRA, \u00a7 321(a) (codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A)) (defining \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d as an aggravated felony).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Although Garcia\u2019s conviction occurred prior to IIRIRA\u2019s enactment, \u00a7 321 still applies to his case because Congress expressly directed that \u00a7 321 operate retroactively. <em>See, e.g., INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 316, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (holding that statutes shall be applied retroactively when explicitly directed by Congress). Section 321(b) states that \u201c[njotwithstanding any other provision of law (including any effective date), the term [aggravated felony] applies regardless of whether the conviction was entered before, on, or after the date of enactment of this paragraph.\u201d IIRIRA, \u00a7 321(b) (codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)). Section 321(c) of the statute further states that \u201c[t]he amendments made by this section shall apply to actions taken on or after the date of the enactment of this Act, <em>regardless of when the conviction occurred </em>.... \u201d IIRIRA, \u00a7 321(c) (emphasis added). We have held consistently that Congress expressly directed a retroactive application of \u00a7 321. <em>See Aragon-Ayon v. INS, </em>206 F.3d 847, 851-53 (9th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Mendoza-Iribe, </em>198 F.3d 742, 744 (9th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">Garcia\u2019s reliance on <em>St. Cyr </em>hurts rather than helps his case. Although the Supreme Court in that case found that Congress did not expressly direct a retroactive application of \u00a7 304 of IIRIRA, the Court identified \u00a7 321 as a section containing a clear congressional instruction favoring retroac-tivity. <em>See St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. at 319 <em>&amp; </em>n. 43, 121 S.Ct. 2271.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because \u00a7 321 applies to Garcia\u2019s previous conviction, there was no defect in his deportation proceeding. The district court correctly denied Garcia\u2019s motion to dismiss his indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b458-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir.

Several other circuits have found, in decisions post-dating <em>St. Cyr, </em>that the plain language of \u00a7 321 dictates a retroactive application. <em>See Chambers v. Reno, </em>307 F.3d 284, 292 (4th Cir.2002); <em>Kuhali v. Reno, </em>266 F.3d 93, 110-11 (2d Cir.2001); <em>Mohammed v.
