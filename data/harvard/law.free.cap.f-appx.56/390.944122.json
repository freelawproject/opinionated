We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-24\">We review the BIA\u2019s factual determinations for substantial evidence, and we must uphold its decision unless Munoz shows that the evidence not only supports reversal, but compels it. <em>See Pedro-Mateo v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.2000) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>(quoting <em>INS v.
