The district court erred in concluding that Molina\u2019s speech was not constitutionally protected. Molina\u2019s statements were not mere \u201cemployee grievanee[s]\u201d related to \u201cpersonnel and internal affairs.\u201d <em>Cf. Connick v. Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 151, 154, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). Rather, they raised the possibility that some council members engineered a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d with favored contractors at taxpayers\u2019 expense. The statements addressed \u201cmatters of public concern\u201d and were thus entitled to \u201cspecial protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145; <em>Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., </em>391 U.S. 563, 568, 574-75, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.3d 811 (1968). That Molina might have been speaking at times as an at-will employee during closed council meetings, and not as a citizen in a public forum, does not alter our conclusion. <em>See Givhan v. W. Line Consol. Sch. Dist., </em>439 U.S. 410, 414, 99 S.Ct. 693, 58 L.Ed.2d 619 (1979); <em>Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 283-84, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-13\">2. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party on a motion for summary judgment, we cannot agree that the government\u2019s interest in \u201cpromoting the efficiency of the public services\u201d outweighs Molina\u2019s free expression interests. <em>Pickering, </em>391 U.S. at 568. Molina presented contradictory evidence, most notably the testimony of other employees, that his financial opinions were well-supported and that his speech did not interfere with the operation of the department. City manager Sotelo\u2019s subjective beliefs alone are not enough to prove disruption. <em>See Waters v. Churchill, </em>511 U.S. 661, 677, 114 S.Ct. 1878, 128 L.Ed.2d 686 (1994); <em>Allen v. Scribner, </em>812 F.2d 426, 432 (9th Cir.1987). If the jury believes Molina\u2019s claims, the speech is constitutionally protected. <em>Pickering, </em>391 U.S. at 568. The district court impermissibly weighed the evidence and resolved genuine issues of material fact against Molina. <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-14\">3. The district court also erred in granting summary judgment against Molina on the ground that he would have been terminated even without the statements about the golf course contract. Molina has produced enough evidence to create a material issue of disputed fact about the real reasons for his termination, including comments by Sotelo and council member Holden that Molina should keep quiet, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>\u201cnone of what [Molina] said was what the [c]ouncihnember wanted to hear,\u201d and that powerful people were going \u201cafter [him] with big guns\u201d for the views he had expressed. <em>See Mt. Healthy, </em>429 U.S. at 285-87. Big or not, these are definitely smoking guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">4. Because Molina marshaled sufficient evidence for a jury to find that his speech was not disruptive but defendants fired him nonetheless, summary judgment on the ground of federal qualified immunity is improper. <em>Allen, </em>812 F.2d at 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Nor is Sotelo entitled to state immunity for the state causes of action. Under California law, immunity may be granted only for \u201cbasic policy decisions,\u201d not routine duties \u201cincident to the normal operations of [the] office.\u201d <em>Sanborn v. Chronicle Publ\u2019g Co., </em>18 Cal.3d 406, 415, 134 Cal.Rptr. 402, 556 P.2d 764 (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted). Defendants themselves characterize the termination as a \u201ctypical employment action[].\u201d State immunity is therefore inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">5. If defendants terminated Molina in \u201creckless or callous indifference\u201d to his constitutional rights, Molina may recover punitive damages. <em>Smith v. Wade, </em>461 U.S. 30, 56, 103 S.Ct. 1625, 75 L.Ed.2d 632 (1983); <em>Commodore Home Sys., Inc. v. Superior Court, </em>32 Cal.3d 211, 220, 185 Cal.Rptr. 270, 649 P.2d 912 (1982). Furthermore, Molina\u2019s emotional distress claims will not be preempted by California\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act if a jury finds that defendants\u2019 actions fell outside the scope of normal employment relationships or were in violation of public policy. <em>Kovatch v. Cal. Cas. Mgmt. Co., </em>65 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1277, 77 Cal.Rptr.2d 217 (1998), <em>overruled on other grounds by Aguilar v. Atl. Richfield Co., 25 </em>Cal.4th 826, 107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493 (2001). The district court erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b801-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
