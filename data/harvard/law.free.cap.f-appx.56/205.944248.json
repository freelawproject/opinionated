We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm substantially on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Madison v. Virginia, </em>No. CA-02-1232-7 (W.D.Va. Nov. 27 <em>&amp; </em>Dec. 17, 2002). On appeal, Madison asserts that the district court misconstrued a portion of his complaint. We find that his claims \u2014 even as clarified \u2014 were subject to dismissal. <em>See Dist. of Columbia Ct. of App. v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 482-86,103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>see also McMahan v. International Ass\u2019n of Bridge, Structural &amp; Ornamental Iron Workers, </em>964 F.2d 1462, 1467 (4th Cir. 1992) (holding that appellate courts may \u201caffirm a judgment for any reason appearing on the record\u201d). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
