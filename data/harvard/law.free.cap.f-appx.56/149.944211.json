We reviewed this same injunction in <em>SEC v. </em>Dunlap, 253 F.3d 768 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-21\">We have carefully reviewed Dunlap\u2019s arguments on appeal and find them unavailing. Dunlap has failed to demonstrate that the doctrine of judicial estoppel should have applied in this case. Similarly, he has failed to show that the district court acted inappropriately at all, much less on account of a specific personal bias arising from an extra-judicial source. <em>See People Helpers Found, v. City of Richmond, </em>12 F.3d 1321, 1325 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-22\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Dunlap\u2019s motion to set aside the injunction. We decline to direct that further proceedings be assigned to a different district judge. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions have been adequately presented before the court and oral argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
