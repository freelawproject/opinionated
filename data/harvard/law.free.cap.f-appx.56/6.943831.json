Moronta pled guilty to conspiring to distribute, possessing with intent to distribute and distribution of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 812, 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), (B) &amp; 846, and was sentenced in the Southern District of New York by Judge Martin. On appeal, Moronta challenges the district court\u2019s (1) upward departure for obstruction of justice under \u00a7 3C1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d or \u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d); and (2) refusal to permit cross-examination of an undercover officer at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-19\">1. We review the sentencing court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to established facts <em>de novo </em>and findings of fact for clear error, giving due deference to its application of the Guidelines to the facts. <em>United States v. Lincecum, </em>220 F.3d 77, 80 (2d Cir.2000). For Guidelines purposes perjury need only be proved by a preponderance of evidence. <em>United States v. Ben-Shimon, </em>249 F.3d 98, 102 (2d Cir.2001). Separate findings of fact are not required as long as \u201ca general finding of obstruction ... tracks those factual predicates necessary to support a finding of perjury.\u201d <em>United States v. Fan, </em>36 F.3d 240, 247 (2d Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-20\">Judge Martin found that Moronta\u2019s in-court statements were not credible. Mo-ronta claimed during the sentencing hearing that several inculpatory statements caught on tape were not true, and that he had spontaneously made them just to \u201csay something.\u201d Among these were claims that he [i] had previously sold two kilo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>grams of heroin on credit, and [ii] could obtain cocaine through a supplier in Puer-to Rico. However, testimony by a co-conspirator showed that Moronta had discussed the two-kilogram sale before the meeting caught on tape; and the tapes themselves established that the same co-conspirator prompted Moronta\u2019s statement concerning his Puerto Rico contact. This evidence flatly contradicted Moronta\u2019s testimony that these statements were made spontaneously for conversational purposes. The district court record indicates these false statements with sufficient specificity. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>79 F.3d 334, 337-38 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">2. \u201c[A] district court [is] not required under the due process clause or the Guidelines to hold a full-blown evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>United States v. Olvera, </em>954 F.2d 788, 792 (2d Cir.1992). We review a sentencing court\u2019s procedural determinations for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Slevin, </em>106 F.3d 1086, 1091 (2d Cir.1996). Here, Moronta\u2019s agreement with his suppliers to furnish a kilogram of heroin was established by his own admissions caught on tape, and we see no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s refusal to permit cross-examination of the undercover officer. <em>See Olvera, </em>954 F.2d at 792 (district court did not abuse its discretion in not requiring testimony of confidential informant where quantity established in part by defendant\u2019s statements caught on tape).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
