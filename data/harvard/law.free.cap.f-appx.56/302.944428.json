Appellants argue that the district court, in adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, did not apply the correct qualified immunity test as announced in <em>Saucier v. Katz.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-17\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we do not recite them here. In adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, which was issued before <em>Katz, </em>the district court could not have applied the newly refined test. However, the error in this case was harmless; Appellants were not entitled to qualified immunity even under <em>Katz </em>because they could not have believed it was reasonable for them to deny Thomas Hagen the right to attend religious services.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-18\">I. <em>The </em>Katz <em>Two-Prong Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-19\">In <em>Katz, </em>the Supreme Court announced a refined, two-part, qualified immunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>test.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A court faced with a qualified immunity claim must first ask: \u201cTaken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officer\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right?\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If so, the court should then move to the second prong, which asks whether the constitutional right was \u201cclearly established.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Supreme Court said a \u201cclearly established\u201d right is one where a \u201creasonable officer\u201d clearly would be aware that \u201chis conduct was unlawful.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">II. <em>Hagen\u2019s Constitutional Right to Free Exercise of Religion is Clearly established</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Taking the facts as Hagen alleges them, Appellants violated his First Amendment constitutional right when they denied Hagen the opportunity to attend religious services.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the interests of safety or to further their penological interests,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellants could have limited Hagen to Jewish services, his proffered \u201csincere religious belief.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, they were not entitled to deny him the right to attend Jewish services until he made an affirmative choice of one religion over the other. Therefore, taking the facts as Hagen alleges, he satisfied the first prong of <em>Katz: </em>Appellants violated his constitutional right to free exercise of religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">III. <em>Denying Hagen the right to attend Jewish services was not reasonable</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">Moving on to the second prong, we do not find that it was reasonable for Appellants to believe they could deny Ha-gen\u2019s clearly established right of attending the Jewish services. Hagen claims that he informed Appellants of his Jewish faith and that he attended Muslim services for only \u201cacademic purposes.\u201d Because we view the facts in a light most favorable to Hagen, we hold that denying Hagen the right to attend Jewish services was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-13\">Hagen had a right to attend Jewish services because he held a sincere religious belief in the Jewish faith.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Even if Appellants attempted to assist Hagen in selecting one religion, it was not necessary to deny him access to both religious services.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-14\">For safety or valid penological interests, Appellants may deny access to religious services for academic purposes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Again, Appellants could perhaps have protected those interests by revoking only Hagen\u2019s attendance at Muslim services. No valid penological interest justified Appellants in denying Hagen the right to attend both Jewish and Muslim services. Because we hold that their conduct was not reasonable, Appellants fail the second prong of <em>Katz. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Thus, Appellants are not entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b339-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-20\">.
