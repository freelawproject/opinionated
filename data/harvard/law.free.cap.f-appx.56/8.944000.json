The District Court found that defendant\u2019s counterclaims for goods sold and delivered to Premier are separate and distinct from Premier\u2019s claim of the violation of the distributorship agreement. In <em>Cullen v. Margiotta, </em>811 F.2d 698, 711 (2d Cir.1987), we held that claims are separable if they involve different questions of fact and law, even if they arose out of the same transaction and occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-19\">We review a District Court\u2019s decision to enter partial final judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) for an abuse of discretion. <em>Cullen, </em>811 F.2d at 711. However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7\">[i]n deciding whether the district court correctly determined that more than one claim exists for purposes of Rule 54(b), our scope of review is broad.... [W]e must examine <em>de novo </em>the relationship between plaintiffs\u2019 claims to determine whether they are sufficiently separate and distinct as to lend themselves to review as single units.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number><em>Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Navy, </em>891 F.2d 414, 417-18 (2d Cir.1989). The District Court found that the invoices each represented discrete agreements to purchase goods, which were separate and distinct from the underlying contractual obligation, under the distributorship agreement. Its finding was reasonable when neither party challenges plaintiffs obligation under the invoices and there is no logical nexus between Premier\u2019s obligation to pay for wine that it undisputedly ordered and received and Premier\u2019s claim that it was entitled to more advance notice prior to the termination of the distributorship agreement. <em>See Schieffelin &amp; Co. v. Valley Liquors, Inc., </em>823 F.2d 1064, 1067 (7th Cir.1987) (holding that accepted purchase orders are the contracts for sale and not the underlying distributorship agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Plaintiff may not withhold payment pursuant to U.C.C. \u00a7 2-717 for goods sold and delivered because the money Premier owes for the invoices for goods sold and delivered are separate from any damages that Niebaum-Coppola may owe for the alleged wrongful termination of the distributorship agreement. <em>See, e.g., Sunbeam Corp. v. Morris Distrib. Co., </em>55 A.D.2d 722, 724, 389 N.Y.S.2d 173, 175 (3d Dep\u2019t 1976) (finding that the seller must breach the same contract under which buyer\u2019s payment is due and not a separate distributorship agreement in order to withhold payment under U.C.C. \u00a7 2-217); <em>see also Sharp Elecs. Corp. v. Arkin-Medo Inc., </em>86 A.D.2d 817, 452 N.Y.S.2d 589, 590 (1st Dep\u2019t 1982) (holding that when a distributorship agreement exists, each shipment was a separate agreement to purchase goods).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">We have considered all of plaintiffs arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, we hereby AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
