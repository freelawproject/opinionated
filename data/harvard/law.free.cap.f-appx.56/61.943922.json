Kaplan, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b97-23\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b97-24\">UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the decision of said district court be and it hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-25\">Petitioner-appellant Johnny Hincapi\u00e9 appeals the district court\u2019s August 21, 2001 judgment denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Hincapi\u00e9 seeks to set aside the January 3, 1992 judgment of the New York State Supreme Court (affirmed by the Appellate Division on July 6, 1995) convicting him, after a jury trial, of Murder in the Second Degree and two counts each of Robbery in the First and Second Degrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-26\">Hincapie\u2019s appeal to this Court is limited to the question of whether his Sixth Amendment right to present a defense was violated when the state trial court excluded, as hearsay, portions of a taped confession by Ricardo Lopez, one of the other alleged participants in the charged crimes. Hincapi\u00e9 argues that portions of Lopez\u2019s statement were exculpatory to Hincapi\u00e9, and thus that their exclusion denied Hinca-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>pie his right to present a defense. In support of this argument, Hincapie cites <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973), where the Supreme Court held that state evidentiary rules \u201cmay not be applied mechanistically\u201d to exclude evidence that: 1) bears \u201cpersuasive assurances of trustworthiness\u201d; and 2) is critical to a defendant\u2019s defense. <em>Id. </em>at 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Hineapie\u2019s argument fails the <em>Chambers </em>test. The portions of Lopez\u2019s statement that Hincapi\u00e9 sought to introduce were hearsay and did not bear \u201cassurances of trustworthiness.\u201d Lopez\u2019s assertion that Hincapi\u00e9 was not present at the scene was not against Lopez\u2019s criminal interest, it was not subject to cross-examination, and it carried no indicia of reliability. <em>See Williamson v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 594, 600-01, 114 S.Ct. 2431, 129 L.Ed.2d 476 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
