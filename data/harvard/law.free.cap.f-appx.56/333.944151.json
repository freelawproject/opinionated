We review BIA findings under the deferential \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard and will uphold BIA findings \u201cunless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>See Hernandez-Montiel v. INS, 225 </em>F.3d 1084, 1090 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">We held in <em>Cheo v. INS, </em>162 F.3d 1227, 1229 (9th Cir.1998), that \u201c[a] duration of residence in a third country sufficient to support an inference of permanent resettlement in the absence of evidence to the contrary shifts the burden of proving absence of resettlement to the applicant.\u201d Here, the BIA did not err in finding that Petitioners had firmly resettled, because they had obtained some form of \u201cpermanent residence\u201d or \u201csome type of permanent resettlement.\u201d <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.15. Significantly, Petitioners do not make a showing sufficient to establish that the conditions were \u201cso substantially and consciously restricted\u201d by the authorities in Germany that they were not in fact resettled. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.15(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The record supports the finding of the BIA, that Petitioners firmly resettled in Germany. Because substantial evidence supports the findings of the BIA, the petition should be denied. <em>INS v.
