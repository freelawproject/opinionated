Potential problems with the DNA extraction process go to the weight of the DNA evidence, not its admissibility. <em>See United States v. Chischilly, </em>30 F.3d 1144,1153 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-23\">The district court did not err in denying Grey Bear\u2019s motion for acquittal pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29. The evidence submitted at trial was of such sufficiency that a \u201crational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Alarcon-Simi, </em>300 F.3d 1172, 1176 (9th Cir.2002) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The district court\u2019s determination that Grey Bear used force as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(a)(1) and its application of the cross reference in U.S.S.C. \u00a7 2A3.2(c)(1) when sentencing Grey Bear was not erroneous. Grey Bear used physical force sufficient to restrain his victim such that she could not escape the sexual contact. <em>See United States v. Archdale, </em>229 F.3d 861, 868 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
