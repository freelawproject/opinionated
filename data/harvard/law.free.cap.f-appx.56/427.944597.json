Barnhart is substituted for her predecessor, Kenneth S. Apfel, as Commissioner of Social Security Administration. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 43(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AkW\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">Teresa Luna appeals the district court\u2019s affirmance of the Social Security Commissioner\u2019s decision denying her application for Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits and Supplemental Security Income payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). We review de novo the district court\u2019s affirmance of the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits. <em>Tackett v. Apfel, </em>180 F.3d 1094, 1097 (9th Cir.1999). We reverse and remand for the payment of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-14\">The vocational expert testified that Luna\u2019s physical limitations prohibited her from performing all occupations except bakery worker conveyor line and surveillance system monitor. The Dictionary of Occupational Titles classifies the bakery worker position as light work and the surveillance system monitor as sedentary work. The DOT\u2019s classifications constitute rebuttable presumptions that were rebutted in this case by the testimony of the vocational expert. The vocational expert\u2019s substantive testimony revealed the bakery worker occupation exhibits none of the criteria for light work. Rote reliance on the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, even by the vocational expert herself, is inappropriate where the vocational expert\u2019s practical experience with the job market reveals a contrary classification. <em>See Johnson v. Shalala, </em>60 F.3d 1428, 1435-36 (9th Cir. 1995). Because the Commissioner failed to produce evidence that Luna could perform any job categorized as light work, the use of grid rule 202.11 as a framework is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Distasio v. Shalala, </em>47 F.3d 348, 349-50 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-19\">There are no unresolved issues in the record and it is clear that the ALJ would be required to award benefits if the substance of the vocational expert\u2019s testimony was credited and the appropriate grid rule was used as a framework. Therefore, remand for further proceedings is unnecessary. <em>Reddick v. Chater, </em>157 F.3d 715, 728-30 (9th Cir.1998). We reverse the judgment of the district court and remand to the district court with instructions to remand to the ALJ for an award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-20\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b464-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
