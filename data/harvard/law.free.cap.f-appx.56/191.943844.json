An appeal may not be taken to this court from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certif\u00edcate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). When a district court dismisses a habeas petition solely on procedural grounds, a certif\u00edcate of appealability will not issue unless the petitioner can demonstrate both \u201c(1) that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude for the reasons stated by the district court that Carter has not satisfied this standard. <em>See Carter v. Virginia Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>No. CA-02-98-7 (W.D.Va. Oct. 31, 2002). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
