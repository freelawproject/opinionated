Smith, </em>15 F.3d 1519, 1525-26 (9th Cir.1994), we rejected the contention that a school district can escape its obligations to make a FAPE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>available because parents express an unwillingness to accept the FAPE. We held that offering a FAPE requires a written, formal offer, and that this requirement \u201cshould be enforced rigorously.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1526.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Neither the Hearing Officer nor the district court analyzed whether any offer of a FAPE was made to Tessa P.\u2019s parents. Under <em>Union, </em>this issue must first be considered before Tessa P. can be labeled as a unilaterally placed private-school student. We decline to conduct this analysis for the first time on appeal, and therefore reverse the judgment of the district court granting summary judgment for the Defendants and remand. Each party to bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b467-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
