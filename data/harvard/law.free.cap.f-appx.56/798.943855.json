We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>see Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Abney alleged that defendants Trevino and Richardson illegally searched and seized property beyond the scope of a search warrant, and that none of the seized property was introduced into evidence at trial. The district court erred by dismissing this claim because on the record before us a judgment in Abney\u2019s favor on this claim would not necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364,129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Contrary to Abney\u2019s contention, the existence of an adequate, state post-deprivation procedure may satisfy due process where the deprivations are alleged against government officials who are not prison officials. <em>See, e.g., King v. Massarweh, </em>782 F.2d 825, 826-27 (9th Cir.1986) (post-deprivation remedy applicable where police officers allegedly deprived tenants of their property).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">Abney contends that the state post-deprivation procedure is insufficient to satisfy due process because the alleged actions causing the deprivation were a predictable abuse of defendants\u2019 positions. <em>See Ziner-mon v. Burch, </em>494 U.S. 113, 136-38, 110 S.Ct. 975, 108 L.Ed.2d 100 (1990). This contention lacks merit because Abney\u2019s complaint alleged random and unauthorized conduct. <em>See Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 520, 532-33, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">Abney\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">Accordingly, we reverse the dismissal of Abney\u2019s illegal search and seizure claim against Trevino and Richardson and remand for further proceedings as to those claims. We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-11\">We deny Abney\u2019s motion for oral argument filed September 23, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">Each party to bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-13\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b834-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
