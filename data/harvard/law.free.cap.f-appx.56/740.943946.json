Durley was discharged from his employment with Anheuser-Busch, Inc. (Anheuser-Busch), after he incurred three unexcused absences following a history of discipline for unexcused absences. Durley brought this action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621, <em>et seq., </em>and Missouri law, claiming that he had been retaliated against for filing a prior race-discrimination lawsuit and discriminated against and harassed because of his age. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted summary judgment to Anheuser-Busch, and Durley appealed. After careful de novo review of the record, <em>see Mathews v. Trilogy Communications, Inc., </em>143 F.3d 1160, 1163 (8th Cir.1998), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-15\">Durley abandoned his age-discrimination claims by failing to raise them in his appellate brief. <em>See Burke v. N.D. Dep\u2019t of Corr. &amp; Rehab., </em>294 F.3d 1043, 1044 (8th Cir.2002) (per curiam). Further, even assuming Durley established a prima facie case of retaliation, he failed to create a jury issue on whether Anheuser-Busch\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for his discharge was merely a pretext. <em>See Buettner v. Arch Coal Sales Co., </em>216 F.3d 707, 714 (8th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1077, 121 S.Ct. 773, 148 L.Ed.2d 672 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-18\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-16\">. The HONORABLE CAROL E.
