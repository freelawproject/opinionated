We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm. Because the facts are known to the parties, we do not recite them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The Oregon Circuit Court denied Fredlund\u2019s post-conviction relief petition concluding that the improper use of the burglary conviction at trial \u201cwas too inconsequential to have had any tendency to affect the outcome of the case, and did not undermine the reliability of the verdict.\u201d The court also found that \u201c[t]he evidence of petitioner\u2019s attack on the victim, including petitioner\u2019s own admissions that he had choked the victim and put duct tape over her mouth, was substantial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">The state court\u2019s \u201cdetermination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding\u201d was reasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The state court correctly concluded that the evidence against Fredlund, including his own testimony, was overwhelming. Additionally, the state court properly applied \u201cclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In light of the overwhelming evidence, there is no \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, Fredlund has neither established that the state court erred nor satisfied AEDPA\u2019s standard for granting the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-10\">. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b407-11\">. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b407-12\">. <em>Strickland v.
