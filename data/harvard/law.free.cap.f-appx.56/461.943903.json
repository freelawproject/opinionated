The district court sentenced him to 70 months\u2019 imprisonment, the minimum sentence within the applicable range under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Mr. Gale now appeals the district court\u2019s refusal to grant him a downward departure for cultural assimilation. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-22\">On appeal, Mr. Gale\u2019s counsel filed an <em>Anders </em>brief and moved to withdraw as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>appellate counsel. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). In the <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel argues that Mr. Gale\u2019s sentence was not imposed contrary to the law, as a result of an incorrect application of the Sentencing Guidelines, or in excess of the applicable Guideline range, and that Mr. Gale\u2019s appeal is therefore wholly without merit. We have fully examined the proceedings as required by <em>Anders </em>and concluded that Mr. Gale\u2019s appeal is indeed without merit. Moreover, we lack jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s failure to depart downward in sentencing absent a claim that the court misunderstood its authority to depart. <em>United States v. Cod-dington, </em>118 F.3d 1439, 1441 (10th Cir. 1997). We find no such misunderstanding on the part of the district court in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">For the foregoing reasons, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED and Gale\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b497-7\"> After examining appellant\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
