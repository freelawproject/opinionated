We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, <em>Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-22\">The district court properly dismissed Frutos\u2019 claims challenging the state court judgment in his divorce proceedings because such claims are barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>See Doe v. Napolitano, </em>252 F.3d 1026, 1030 (9th Cir.2001) (explaining that <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine bars federal courts from exercising jurisdiction \u201cwhenever they are in essence being called upon to review the state court decision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-23\">The district court properly dismissed the action against defendant Gonzalez because court clerks are immune from suit for acts performed in their quasi-judicial capacity. <em>See Moore v. Brewster, </em>96 F.3d 1240,1244-45 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-24\">The district court did not err by dismissing as time-barred Frutos\u2019 section 1983 action against the prison official defendants because Frutos filed suit almost four years after his claims accrued, and more than one year after the tolling period expired. <em>See </em>Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 352.1(a); <em>Johnson v. California, </em>207 F.3d 650, 654 (9th Cir.2000) (applying California\u2019s personal injury one-year statute of limitation and \u00a7 352.1(a) to section 1983 claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>The district court correctly determined that Frutos\u2019 allegations did not state an actionable claim under the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, Clayton Act or Sherman Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Frutos a second opportunity to amend his complaint. <em>See Lopez v. Smith, </em>203 F.3d 1122, 1130-31 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Frutos\u2019 motion to alter or amend the judgment because the motion did not demonstrate grounds for reconsideration. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e); <em>McDowell v. Calderon, </em>197 F.3d 1253,1255 &amp; n. 1 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc) (per cu-riam).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Frutos\u2019 other contentions also lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b441-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
