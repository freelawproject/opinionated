We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b). <em>See Castro-Espinosa v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1130, 1131 n. 1 (9th Cir.2001) (order). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">We review the BIA\u2019s factual findings, including whether a petitioner has demonstrated past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, for substantial evidence, and we uphold the BIA ruling unless the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>Pedro-Mateo v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 1147,1150 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-17\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the guerillas\u2019 harassment of Berganza, if any, was on account of his family\u2019s wealth or their recruitment efforts, neither one of which constitutes a protected ground. <em>See Li v. INS, </em>92 F.3d 985, 987 (9th Cir.1996) (low economic status does not constitute a social group for asylum purposes); <em>Pedro-Mateo, </em>224 F.3d at 1151 (guerillas\u2019 recruitment attempts alone do not constitute persecution on account of political belief).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-18\">Further, to the extent that Berganza\u2019s asylum application is based upon his status as a former low-ranking member of the military, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Berganza failed to demonstrate why the guerillas would target him should he return to Guatemala now. <em>See Chanco v. INS, </em>82 F.3d 298, 303 (9th Cir.1996) (although \u201creprisals against former military officers can provide a basis for granting asylum,\u201d applicant \u201cfailed to meet his burden of proof, which requires evidence that he is likely to be singled out for rebel attacks\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-19\">Accordingly, Berganza failed to establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See Pedro-Mateo, </em>224 F.3d at 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-20\">Berganza is not entitled to relief under the Convention because he did not demonstrate that it was more likely than not that he would be subjected to an \u201cextreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment\u201d if returned to Guatemala. <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>312 F.3d 1094, 1103 (9th Cir.2002); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Berganza\u2019s contentions that he was denied due process and equal protection are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b376-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
