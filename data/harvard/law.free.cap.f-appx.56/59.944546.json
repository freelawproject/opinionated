She was sentenced to concurrent terms of six months\u2019 imprisonment, three years\u2019 supervised release, and a $500 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-20\">Appellant argues that the District Court erred by denying her request for a downward adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b) as a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the crime. Appellant did not know the full scope of the criminal scheme in which she was involved. However, she was not charged with a crime involving the entire scheme, but rather was only charged with making false statements and conspiring to make false statements. In regards to those crimes, she played a primary role. She personally went to the Social Security office, filled out applications with information she knew to be false, and handed in documentation that she knew to be false. She engaged in this behavior on four separate occasions, and was paid for each. Therefore, the district court acted reasonably within the scope of its discretion in denying a minor participant adjustment. <em>See United, States v. Lewis, </em>93 F.3d 1075, 1085 (2d Cir.1996) (rejecting a defendant\u2019s request for a minor participant adjustment because his base offense level was calculated on the basis of his limited role in a conspiracy, and not on the entire conspiracy).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Appellant argues that this court should nevertheless remand because it is unclear from the record whether the District Court applied the correct legal principles when it denied her request. While there was some confusion during the sentencing hearing about the difference between a \u201cdownward departure\u201d and a \u201cdownward adjustment\u201d, the District Court appeared to fully understand the factual predicate that had to be met to grant a minor participant adjustment and determined that it was not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
