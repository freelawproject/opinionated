R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">William Punchard, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his action for lack of federal jurisdiction. In his filings before the district court, Punch-ard alleged that he is the head-of-state of a non-existent country and that two diplomats employed by his \u201ccountry\u201d are being illegally incarcerated in New Mexico state prison; Punchard requested habeas relief on behalf of these two individuals. Punch-ard further alleged that he was being harassed by the Deming, New Mexico \u201cCity Magistrate Court,\u201d which is allegedly mailing \u201cHarassing Court Summons\u201d to his \u201cRoyal Embassy.\u201d In dismissing this action, the district court concluded that Punchard\u2019s allegations were so fanciful and delusional that they failed to invoke the court\u2019s federal question jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">This court has thoroughly reviewed all of the numerous documents filed by Punchard in this appeal and has reviewed <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s order of dismissal and the entire record on appeal. That review demonstrates that the district court\u2019s resolution of the case was substantially correct. Accordingly, this court AFFIRMS for substantially those reasons set out in the district court\u2019s order of dismissal dated September 3, 2002. All pending motions are hereby DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b479-19\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
