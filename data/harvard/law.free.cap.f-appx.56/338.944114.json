INS, 222 </em>F.3d 1208, 1209 n. 2 (9th Cir. 2000) (per curiam). We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion and review issues of law de novo. <em>Id. </em>We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-21\">The Immigration and Naturalization Service sent notice of Chacon\u2019s deportation hearing by certified mail to her last known address in compliance with \u00a7 242B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b (repealed 1996). <em>See Dobrota v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 1206, 1210 n. 3 (9th Cir. 2002) (applying statutes that governed at the time deportation proceedings were initiated). Accordingly, when Chacon failed to appear, the IJ properly ordered her deported <em>in absentia. See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(c)(l) (repealed 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-22\">Chacon contends that she was deprived of due process because the evidence establishing her last known address was deficient. Because Chacon failed to make this argument before the BIA, we lack jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See Vargas v. INS, </em>831 F.2d 906, 907-08 (9th Cir.1987) (requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>administrative exhaustion of due process claim based on procedural error).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b374-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
