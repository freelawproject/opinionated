The court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for a published opinion. <em>See </em>D.C. Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b556-15\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s decision rejecting Dawson\u2019s Jencks Act claim be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-16\">Defendant has failed to demonstrate that the district court\u2019s balancing of the <em>Bryant </em>factors, which required it to \u201cweigh the degree of negligence or bad faith involved, the importance of the evidence lost, and the evidence of guilt adduced at trial in order to come to a determination that will serve the ends of justice,\u201d represented an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Bryant, </em>439 F.2d 642, 653 (D.C.Cir. 1971); <em>see also United States v. Perry, </em>471 F.2d 1057 (D.C.Cir.1972). Even assuming the district court\u2019s use of the bad faith standard represented a misunderstanding of one element of the <em>Bryant </em>and <em>Perry </em>tests for determining whether to sanction the government by excluding Officer Parsons\u2019 testimony, in view of the fact that (a) <em>Bryant </em>and <em>Perry </em>are balancing tests and neither case requires sanctions for violation of the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500, and (b) the district court emphasized the existence of Officer Parsons\u2019 notes, the essay\u2019s brevity, and the likely absence of additional information in the essay, we believe the result would have been the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-18\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
