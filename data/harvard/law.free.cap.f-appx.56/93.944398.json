(\u201cLP\u201d) appeals the District Court\u2019s grant of judgment to plaintiffs-appellees Scopia Mortgage Cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>poration and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (collectively, \u201cSeopia\u201d) on LP\u2019s breach of contract claim. LP also appeals the District Court\u2019s order in favor of Seopia \u2014 which order denied LP\u2019s claim for attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in connection with Scopia\u2019s claim for $939,696.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">LP asserted that it had established its breach of contract claim and that it had proved that it suffered damage of $1,543,923.45. LP also alleged that Seopia owed it attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to the \u201cSeller\u2019s Indemnity\u201d in the contract because it was obliged to defend against Scopia\u2019s original suit for the $939,696.16 erroneously paid at closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Because we write solely for the benefit of the parties who are well acquainted with the facts, we recount the facts and procedural history of the case only as they are relevant to the following discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">This case arose from a dispute over the purchase of Scopia\u2019s assets by LP in which LP was to assume only certain liabilities. After the closing on November 17, 1992, Seopia filed a suit against LP alleging that LP improperly received $939,696.16 more in cash than it was due at the closing. In an order entered on September 27, 1994, the District Court dismissed Scopia\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">LP had counterclaimed for attorneys\u2019 fees, provided by the contract\u2019s \u201cSeller\u2019s Indemnity,\u201d because it was compelled to defend Scopia\u2019s suit for the $939,696.16. LP also counterclaimed that Seopia misrepresented the status of Scopia\u2019s state tax liability in the amount of $1,543,923.45.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, LP also asserted claims of fraud, fraudulent concealment, misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation, with respect to the $1,543,923.45.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-15\">The District Court entered an opinion and order on June 26, 1998, granting Sco-pia summary judgment on LP\u2019s claim for attorneys\u2019 fees with respect to the $939,696.16. It ruled that because Scopia\u2019s claim for the mistake in payment<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> did not arise from any \u201cinaccuracy\u201d or \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d in any \u201cOperative Document,\u201d such that it would be covered under the \u201cSeller\u2019s Indemnity\u201d in the contract, that LP was not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In that opinion and order, the District Court also granted partial summary judgment to LP on its breach of contract claim, ruling that Scopia\u2019s misrepresentation about its tax liability of $1,543,923.45 as being \u201cdeferred,\u201d when in fact it was \u201cpast due,\u201d was a material misrepresentation. Thus, the District Court had concluded at that time that the characterization of Scopia\u2019s tax liability constituted a technical breach of the contract\u2019s express warranty that the contract contained \u201cno untrue statement of material fact.\u201d The District Court, however, finding a material dispute of fact as to the element of damages, required a trial to determine whether LP had in fact suffered damage by reason of this mischaracterization.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-16\">After a four day bench trial in 1998 held to determine whether LP had suffered damage, and thus could support its breach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>of contract claim, the District Court granted judgment to Scopia. In its opinion filed on August 23, 2000, the District Court found from the evidence at trial, that: (1) LP did not have to pay the $1,543,923.45 tax liability with its own monies; (2) it did not so pay the tax liability, and (3) even if it had paid the $1,543,923.45, which it did not, it had received what it had contracted for under the plain terms of the contract \u2014 to be free of tax liability. Thus, LP had not paid the claimed $1,543,923.45 and accordingly, suffered no damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In an order entered on December 26, 2000, the District Court dismissed LP\u2019s remaining counterclaims for fraud, fraudulent concealment, negligent misrepresentation, misrepresentation and attorneys\u2019 fees, all with respect to the aforementioned $1,543,923.45 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard, <em>United States v. Igbonwa, </em>120 F.3d 437, 440 (3d Cir.1997), and conclusions of law <em>de novo. Henglein v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp., </em>260 F.3d 201, 208 (3d Cir.2001). Our review of a district court\u2019s decision on summary judgment is plenary. <em>Fogleman v. Mercy Hosp., Inc., </em>283 F.3d 561, 566 n. 3 (3d Cir.2002). On review, we are required to apply the same test the district court should have utilized initially. <em>J.F. Feeser, Inc. v. Serv-A-Portion, Inc., </em>909 F.2d 1524, 1530-31 (3d Cir.1990). We have jurisdiction to hear LP\u2019s appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">For substantially all of the reasons so ably expressed by the District Court in its comprehensive opinion, found at <em>Scopia Mortgage Corp. v. Greentree Mortgage Co., L.P., </em>233 F.Supp.2d 625 (D.N.J. 2000), we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment in favor of Scopia and against LP holding that LP is not entitled to either the $1,543,923.45 respecting Scopia\u2019s tax liability, nor is it entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees for defending against Scopia\u2019s claim for $939,696.16, which LP had received by mistake and has retained.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b130-10\">. Scopia's appeal from the District Court's order had been withdrawn on June 17, 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b130-11\">. The Scopia-LP contract had warranted against material misrepresentations of fact in the contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b130-17\">. As earlier noted, the District Court had ruled against Seopia when Seopia sought to recover the overpayment of $939,696.16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b130-18\">. At oral argument, we questioned LP on this counterclaim. No argument was made by LP with respect to LP's attorneys' fees claim and we hold it meritless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b131-9\">. LP claimed that the District Court violated the \"law of the case doctrine\u201d by granting partial summary judgment on the breach of contract claim to LP and then ultimately granting judgment to Scopia on this claim. We hold that claim to be meritless. See <em>Williams v. Runyon, </em>130 F.3d 568, 572-73 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
