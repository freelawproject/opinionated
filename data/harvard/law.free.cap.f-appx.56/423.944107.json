We affirm. Because the facts are familiar to the parties, we recount them only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">1. Conduct may be properly characterized as a Grade A violation where two elements are met: the conduct must be a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and must be \u201cpunishable\u201d as a felony. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(l). Madrid conceded that his conduct constitutes a violation of his supervised release. He further conceded that his conduct constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1, emt. n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Madrid\u2019s conduct is punishable as a felony \u00a7 245(a)(1) violation. The court properly evaluated Madrid\u2019s <em>actual conduct </em>rather than relying upon his misdemeanor \u00a7 245(a)(1) conviction in coming to this conclusion. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1, cmt. n. 1; <em>see also United States v. Jolibois, </em>294 F.3d 1110, 1114 (9th Cir.2002) (upholding a revocation of supervised release based upon actual conduct where the defendant was not prosecuted for that conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">California Penal Code \u00a7 245(a)(1) punishes conduct that is <em>\u201clikely to produce </em>great bodily injury\u201d (emphasis added). <em>See also People v. Wingo, </em>14 Cal.3d 169, 121 Cal.Rptr. 97, 534 P.2d 1001, 1008 (1975) (stating that \u201csince the statute focuses on force <em>likely </em>to produce harm, it is immaterial that the force actually resulted in no harm whatever\u201d) (emphasis in original). Conduct that violates \u00a7 245(a)(1) may be punished as either a misdemeanor or a felony. <em>People v. Superior Court (Alvarez), </em>14 Cal.4th 968, 60 Cal.Rptr.2d 93, 928 P.2d 1171, 1174 (1997). We therefore reject Madrid\u2019s assertion that the district court could only find his conduct punishable as a felony, instead of as a misdemeanor, under \u00a7 245(a)(1) where his conduct resulted in <em>actual </em>great bodily injury to the victim. There is no such requirement in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">2. Insofar as Madrid can be understood as arguing that, despite his conviction and concession, his conduct did not violate \u00a7 245(a)(1) at all, his argument fails. Madrid delivered one unprovoked blow to his victim\u2019s head, which resulted in knocking the victim to the ground. The victim\u2019s bleeding shin, swollen eye, and lip abrasion, though perhaps not examples of great bodily injury themselves, indicate that Madrid hit the victim with force sufficient to cause great bodily injury. <em>Cf. In re Nirran W., </em>207 Cal.App.3d 1157, 255 Cal.Rptr. 327, 329 (1989) (upholding defendant\u2019s felony \u00a7 245(a)(1) conviction where he delivered a single blow, without warning and with force sufficient to knock his victim down).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s finding that Madrid\u2019s conduct is punishable as a felony \u00a7 245(a)(1) violation and is therefore a Grade A violation of his supervised release is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b460-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
