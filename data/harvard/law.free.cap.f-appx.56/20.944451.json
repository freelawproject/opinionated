Lynch, Judge) granting summary judgment and dismissing his complaint alleging various violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>Corona v. Lunn, et al., </em>No. 00 Civ. 7330, 2002 WL 550963 (S.D.N.Y. April 11, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Reviewing <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, <em>Singer v. Fulton County Sheriff, </em>63 F.3d 110, 114 (2d Cir.1995), we, too, view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Appellant and draw all inferences in his favor, <em>see Weyant v. Okst, </em>101 F.3d 845, 854 (2d Cir.1996). For substantially the reasons set forth by the district court, however, we find that the Appellant failed to adduce sufficient evidence in support of his Section 1983 claims to create a genuine issue of material fact for purposes of defeating summary judgment. Accordingly, the Order of the district court granting summary judgment and dismissing Appellant\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
