Coleman\u2019s counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Although counsel states that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, she argues that the district court improperly used the minimum statutory sentence as the guideline sentence when determining a downward departure. Coleman did not file a pro se supplemental brief or move for an extension of time within the thirty day filing period. We deny Coleman\u2019s motion for a thirty day extension to file the supplemental brief. The United States has not filed a brief. In accordance with <em>An-ders, </em>we have considered counsel\u2019s brief and have examined the entire record for meritorious issues. We find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-23\">On appeal, Coleman\u2019s counsel argues the district court improperly used the statutory minimum term of imprisonment from which to depart downward. We find this issue is without merit. <em>United States v. Pillow, </em>191 F.3d 403, 407-08 (4th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-24\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Coleman\u2019s convictions and sentence. Because this court requires that counsel inform her client, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review we deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
