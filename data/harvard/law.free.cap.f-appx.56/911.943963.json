Because Mr. Carter has failed to make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), we deny his request for a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-19\">Mr. Carter was convicted of manufacturing methamphetamine, sentenced to twenty years in prison, and fined $50,000.00. He unsuccessfully challenged his conviction on direct appeal and in a petition for state post-conviction relief. In his federal habeas corpus petition, Mr. Carter asserts his trial and appellate counsel were ineffective in four respects: failure to assert the denial of a speedy trial, failure to call a specific witness, failure to designate his first preliminary hearing transcript in the record on appeal, and failure to note a conflict of interest of trial counsel. Mr. Carter also contends his conviction was based on evidence obtained as a result of an unconstitutional seizure, the trial court erred in denying his request for identification of a confidential informant, insufficient evidence existed to support his conviction, and the fine of $50,000.00 was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-24\">In its report and recommendation to the district court, the magistrate judge addressed each of Mr. Carter\u2019s claims on the merits and concluded that none warranted relief. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and denied Mr. Carter\u2019s petition and request for a COA. Mr. Carter appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-25\">In order to obtain a COA after a district court has rejected a petitioner\u2019s constitutional claims on the merits, the petitioner must demonstrate \u201cthat jurists of reason could disagree with the district court\u2019s resolution of his constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>2003 WL 431659, *4 (U.S. Feb.25, 2003). <em>See also Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Based on our review of Mr. Carter\u2019s brief, the entire record on appeal, and the magistrate judge\u2019s thorough and well reasoned report and recommendation, we hold that Mr. Carter has not satisfied the standard for COA and therefore we dismiss his appeal. Only two claims require further comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>First, we take issue with Mr. Carter\u2019s assertion that his right to a speedy trial was violated by the ineffective assistance of his trial counsel. Under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), Mr. Carter must show his trial counsel\u2019s performance was both deficient and prejudicial. As the magistrate judge correctly reasoned, Mr. Carter faded to satisfy <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">It is true that the period of time between the filing of the information against Mr. Carter and his trial was substantial, totaling twenty-three months. Mr. Carter was arrested and charged on July 1, 1997, but his case did not go to trial until June 14, 1999. Mr. Carter specifically contends that the decision of his trial counsel, Ms. Cox, to request and conduct a second preliminary hearing, interfered with his right to a speedy trial. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">Mr. Carter\u2019s first preliminary hearing had been conducted in March 1998 by an attorney other than Ms. Cox. In her representation of Mr. Carter, Ms. Cox requested in a March 1999 hearing that the court grant a second preliminary hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When the court specifically questioned Mr. Carter to determine whether he approved of the delay, Mr. Carter answered affirmatively. While Ms. Cox\u2019s request for a second preliminary hearing did extend Mr. Carter\u2019s trial date, the request did not make her representation deficient. Ms. Cox was not present at the first preliminary hearing and it is apparent from the record that she believed a second hearing would provide her the opportunity to examine witnesses and develop additional evidence necessary to substantiate a motion to the dismiss the case against Mr. Carter. Not only did Ms. Cox have sufficient grounds to request the second hearing, but Mr. Carter acquiesced in the request. Nor has Mr. Carter shown he was prejudiced by Ms. Cox\u2019s request for the second hearing. Therefore, the district court correctly denied this claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">We also address Mr. Carter\u2019s claim that his conviction was based on evidence obtained as a result of an unconstitutional seizure. Mr. Carter alleges that the police lacked probable cause to stop and question him and therefore that his subsequent arrest and the search of his vehicle were unconstitutional. In so arguing, Mr. Carter overlooks the essential fact that the police did not \u201cstop\u201d him. Mr. Carter was arrested in the course of an undercover police investigation of drug activity at a specific business location. Officers were engaging in consensual conversations with individuals who entered the business\u2019 parking lot and parked their cars there. The officers did the same with Mr. Carter after he stopped his car in the parking lot. There is nothing unlawful about such police activity. <em>See United States v. Men-denhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 554-55, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 64 L.Ed.2d (1980) (in the absence of evidence indicating a citizen believed he was not free to depart from an officer\u2019s presence, \u201cotherwise inoffensive contact between a member of the public and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>police cannot, as a matter of law, amount to a seizure of that person\u201d). It was only after the officers observed a weapon in Mr. Carter\u2019s vehicle and smelled strong chemicals associated with methamphetamine manufacturing that the officers placed Mr. Carter under investigative detention and discovered the materials used to manufacture methamphetamine. The officer\u2019s actions were entirely reasonable and did not violate Mr. Carter\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">For these reasons, coupled with our conclusion that the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Carter\u2019s petition was neither debatable nor adequate to encourage us to proceed further, we DENY Mr. Carter\u2019s application for a COA and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b947-20\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b948-6\">. In February 1999, the trial court had previously granted Ms. Cox\u2019s request for a continuance of Mr. Carter's trial to await the conclusion of a separate trial in which Mr. Carter was a defendant. Such a request was entirely reasonable. <em>See Castro v. Ward, </em>138 F.3d 810, 819-20 (10th Cir.1998) (right to speedy trial not violated where defendant\u2019s trial delayed until conclusion of second trial in which defendant was charged).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b948-10\">. We further note that on June 11, 1999, after the trial court denied Mr. Carter\u2019s motion to dismiss, Mr. Carter requested that his trial be further continued. His request was denied, and trial proceeded on June 14, 1999. In light of Mr. Carter\u2019s own request for a continuance, as well as his affirmation of Ms. Cox\u2019s petition for a second preliminary hearing, his claim of a denial of his right to a speedy trial rings hollow.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
