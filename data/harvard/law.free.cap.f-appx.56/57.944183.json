Garaufis, Judge), convicting him, following a jury trial, of one count of obstruction of justice, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503. The District Court sentenced Calle to 22 months\u2019 imprisonment, three years of supervised release, a $4,000 fine, and a $100 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-19\">Calle raises two arguments on appeal. First, he argues that the District Court should have dismissed the obstruction of justice count, on which he was convicted, for insufficiency of the evidence pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 29. Second, he argues that comments made by the prosecutor in her rebuttal summation so infected the trial with unfairness as to make his conviction a denial of due process. Each of Calle\u2019s arguments lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-20\">In challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction for obstruction of justice, Calle bears a heavy burden. He \u201cmust establish that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, no rational trier of fact could have found all of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Schwarz, </em>283 F.3d 76, 105 (2d Cir.2002). Relying principally on <em>Schwarz </em>and <em>United States v. Aguilar, </em>515 U.S. 593, 115 S.Ct. 2357, 132 L.Ed.2d 520 (1995), Calle argues that the government failed to present sufficient evidence to prove that he possessed the specific intent to obstruct justice. In <em>Schwarz </em>and <em>Aguilar, </em>the obstruction of justice charges stemmed from the defendants\u2019 making false statements to federal investigators \u201cwho might or might not testify before a grand jury.\u201d <em>Aguilar, </em>515 U.S. at 600; <em>see Schwarz, </em>283 F.3d at 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-21\">The evidence introduced at Calle\u2019s trial, in contrast, established that, in direct re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>sponse to a grand jury subpoena duces tecum, Calle failed to produce responsive documents in his possession, lied about his knowledge of documents responsive to the subpoena, and lied about his involvement with the company that the grand jury was investigating. Indeed, Calle\u2019s letter to the FBI agent who served the subpoena upon him states that it is written \u201c[i]n response to the annexed Subpoena requesting documents.\u201d This letter sufficiently demonstrates Calle\u2019s specific intent to obstruct justice. <em>See Aguilar, </em>515 U.S. at 601 (stating that conduct of uttering false statements to an investigating agent \u201cfalls on the other side of the statutory line from that of one who delivers false documents or testimony to the grand jury itself\u2019); <em>United States v. Jespersen, </em>65 F.3d 993, 1000-01 (2d Cir.1995) (affirming \u00a7 1503 conviction and stating that \u201c \u2018statements ... made directly to the grand jury itself, in the form of false testimony <em>or false documents, \u2019 </em>provide a basis for \u00a7 1503 liability\u201d) (citing <em>Aguilar, </em>515 U.S. at 601 &amp; n. 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Next, Calle contends that two comments made by the prosecutor during her rebuttal summation so infected the trial with unfairness as to make his conviction a denial of due process. <em>See United States v. Elias, </em>285 F.3d 183, 190 (2d Cir.2002). During her rebuttal, the prosecutor stated that: (1) by failing to mention Calle\u2019s alleged lies in his letter in response to the grand jury subpoena, Calle\u2019s attorney \u201cessentially conceded the point\u201d and (2) Calle had a financial motive for his involvement in the crimes because \u201c[h]is house is in foreclosure.\u201d In determining whether these comments denied Calle due process, we examine three factors: \u201cthe severity of the misconduct, the measures adopted to cure the misconduct, and the certainty of conviction absent the misconduct.\u201d <em>Elias, </em>285 F.3d at 190. None of these factors weighs in Calle\u2019s favor. First, the severity of the alleged prosecutorial misconduct is minor, especially since Calle complains of only two stray remarks in an otherwise fair proceeding. <em>See Elias, </em>285 F.3d at 191. Second, the District Court provided the jury with curative instructions specific to each of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, stating that the defendant\u2019s silence on a particular issue is not a concession, that the government always retains the burden of proving every element beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the jury should disregard any mention of a foreclosure proceeding. <em>See United States v. Shareef, </em>190 F.3d 71, 79 (2d Cir.1999) (citing with approval district court\u2019s instruction to jury that government bore burden of proof and that burden never shifted). Calle\u2019s contention that the District Court should have given curative instructions sooner is without merit, as the government\u2019s rebuttal summation came at the end of the day on a Friday, and the court provided its curative instructions as soon as the jury entered the courtroom the following Monday morning. Third, Calle has failed to show that, \u201cabsent the isolated impropriety of the prosecutor in rebuttal summation (taken in the context of the entire trial), [he] would not have been convicted.\u201d <em>Elias, </em>285 F.3d at 192; <em>see also Shareef, </em>190 F.3d at 79. The government presented overwhelming evidence of Calle\u2019s having violated \u00a7 1503, independent of the remarks that Calle complains of in the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal summation. Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks did not cause Calle substantial prejudice or deprive him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
