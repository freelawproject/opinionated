Marshall was sentenced to 262 months imprisonment. He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">We review the denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion. <em>United, States v. Ubakanma, </em>215 F.3d 421, 424 (4th Cir.2000). Marshall must present a \u201cfair and just\u201d reason for withdrawing his guilty plea. Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(e); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991). Based on the factors set forth in <em>Moore, </em>we find the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Accordingly, we affirm Marshall\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
