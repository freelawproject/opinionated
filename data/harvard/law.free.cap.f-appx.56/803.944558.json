The district court concluded that the application of \u00a7 304(b) of the Illegal Immi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>gration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to an alien convicted of an aggravated felony before IIRIRA\u2019s enactment would not result in an impermissible retroactive effect. The district court reasoned that because Mr. Serrano chose to proceed to trial and was sentenced to five years or more for his aggravated felony conviction, he could not have reasonably relied on the availability of the \u00a7 212(c) waiver of deportation that predated IIRIRA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Our recent decision in <em>Armendariz-Montoya v. Sonchik </em>is controlling. 291 F.3d 1116 (9th Cir.2002). In <em>ArmendarizMontoya, </em>we held that the application of \u00a7 440(d) of the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to those aliens who were convicted after a jury trial prior to the enactment of AED-PA does not result in an impermissible retroactive effect. <em>Id. </em>at 1122. We reasoned that aliens who proceed to trial could not demonstrate reasonable reliance upon \u00a7 212(c) discretionary eligibility because \u201c[ujnlike aliens who pleaded guilty, aliens who elected a jury trial cannot plausibly claim that they would have acted any differently if they had known about \u00a7 440(d).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1121; <em>cf. INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 321-22, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (holding that IIRIRA and AEDPA are not applicable to criminal alien who <em>entered a guilty plea </em>at a time when alien was eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">Mr. Serrano pleaded not guilty and chose to proceed to trial. He was convicted and sentenced to more than five years in jail. Based upon the logic of <em>Armen-dariz-Montoya, </em>the application of IIRIRA \u00a7 304(b) does not result in an impermissible retroactive effect. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Serrano\u2019s ha-beas petition was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b839-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b840-5\"><em>. Section </em>304(b) of IIRIRA repealed \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), thereby prohibiting the Attorney General from granting discretionary relief for any alien previously convicted of an aggravated felony. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b840-6\">. This waiver did not apply to an alien convicted of an aggravated felony who served at least five years of jail time. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 102-232, 105 Stat. 1731, 1751 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b840-19\">. Section 440(d) of AEDPA was the precursor to \u00a7 304(b) of IIRIRA. Section 440(d) of AED-PA barred aliens convicted of certain crimes, including aggravated felony and controlled substance offenses, from applying to the Attorney General for \u00a7 212(c) relief. See Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, 1277 (1996). Congress then completely repealed \u00a7 212(c) pursuant to \u00a7 304(b) of IIRIRA. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
