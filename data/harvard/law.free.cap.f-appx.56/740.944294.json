Freeman, an African American, appeals the District Court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> adverse grant of summary judgment in his employment-discrimination action against his former employer, Ron Sherman Advertising, Inc. (RSA). Having carefully reviewed the record, <em>see Forrest v. Kraft Foods, Inc., </em>285 F.3d 688, 691 (8th Cir.2002) (standard of review), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-16\">Even assuming, as did the District Court, that Freeman established a prima facie case of race discrimination, <em>see Whitley v. Peer Review Sys., Inc., </em>221 F.3d 1053, 1055 (8th Cir.2000) (elements), the summary judgment record lacks evidence from which a jury could infer that RSA\u2019s proffered explanation for Freeman\u2019s dismissal \u2014 his behavior at an October 8, 1999 meeting about Freeman\u2019s work on a specific project \u2014 was pretextual. <em>See Forrest, </em>285 F.3d at 691. Freeman contends that the RSA officers were mistaken about the work that Freeman had done on the project giving rise to the October 8 meeting and that they overreacted in firing him simply for being emotional during the meeting. However, Freeman set forth no evidence indicating that the RSA officers were proceeding dishonestly to mask intentional race discrimination, <em>see Sprenger v. Fed. Home Loan Bank, </em>253 F.3d 1106, 1112 (8th Cir.2001), and it is well established that federal courts are not \u201csuper-personnel departments that re-examine[ ]\u201d the wisdom of an employer\u2019s business decisions, <em>Kipp v. Missouri Highway </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number><em>&amp; Transp. Comm\u2019n, </em>280 F.3d 893, 898 (8th Cir.2002) (quoting, originally, <em>Dale v. Chicago Tribune Co., </em>797 F.2d 458, 464 (7th Cir.1986)). Further, Freeman has failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he was similarly situated in all relevant respects to a white coworker with whom he wished to be compared. <em>See Forrest, </em>285 F.3d at 691-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">We also agree with the District Court\u2019s analysis of Freeman\u2019s retaliation claim. The record before the District Court did not show the required causal link between Freeman\u2019s filing of his December 1999 Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charge about his termination and the October 2000 statements made by an RSA employee about not using Freeman in an RSA commercial. <em>See Kipp, </em>280 F.3d at 896-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Freeman\u2019s remaining arguments provide no basis for reversal. Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b777-11\">. The Honorable G. Thomas Eisele, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
