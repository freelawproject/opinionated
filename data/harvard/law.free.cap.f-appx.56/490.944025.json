Evaporated Milk Ass\u2019n, </em>319 U.S. 21, 26, 63 S.Ct. 938, 87 L.Ed. 1185 (1943). A party who seeks a writ bears the burden of proving that it has no other means of attaining the relief desired, <em>Mallard v. U.S. Dist. Court for the Southern Dist. of Iowa, </em>490 U.S. 296, 309, 109 S.Ct. 1814, 104 L.Ed.2d 318 (1989), and that the right to issuance of the writ is \u201cclear and indisputable.\u201d <em>Allied Chemical Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 35, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980). In reviewing a denial of recusal, which raises substantive and procedural issues not within our exclusive jurisdiction, we are guided by the law of the regional circuit. <em>Baldwin Hardware Corp. v. Franksu Enterprise Corp., 78 </em>F.3d 550, 556 (Fed.Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-19\">Solex has not shown that it has no other means of attaining the relief desired in its mandamus petition, i.e., disqualification, because it may seek review of the district court\u2019s denial of Solex\u2019s motion to disqualify on appeal after final judgment. Unlike the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in <em>United States v. Balistrieri, </em>779 F.2d 1191, 1205 (7th Cir.1985), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has not confined review of denials of motions to recuse to mandamus petitions. <em>See U.S. v. State of Wash., </em>98 F.3d 1159, 1164 (9th Cir.1996) (Circuit Judge Kozinski noting in concurrence that a judge\u2019s failure to recuse himself may be raised on direct appeal or by petition for writ of mandamus); <em>Yagman v. Republic Insurance, </em>987 F.2d 622 (9th Cir.1993) (court reviewing the merits of a denial of recusal on appeal and noting that an earlier mandamus petition had been denied). Similarly, Solex has not shown that we should, on the eve of trial, stay the scheduled proceeding because the propriety of the district court conducting the trial may also be reviewed on appeal after final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-20\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b526-21\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>(1) The petition for a writ of mandamus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">(2) The motion to stay is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
