The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 41 months imprisonment and 2 years supervised release on both counts, to be served concurrently. On appeal, Perez-Alejo argues that the district court plainly erred in failing to group the two offenses under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(a), because they involved the same victim (society at large) and the same transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-18\">We find no plain error. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>243 F.3d 1103, 1108 (8th Cir.2001) (standard of review). The two offenses address different societal interests. Thus, they cannot be grouped. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2, comment, (n.2) (where victim is societal interest that has been harmed, counts are grouped together only where societal interests are closely related); <em>United States v. Barron-Rivera, </em>922 F.2d 549, 554-55 (9th Cir.1991) (\u00a7 922(g) protects society against those deemed unqualified to possess firearms, while \u00a7 1326 is designed to enforce immigration laws); <em>see also United States v. Herrera, </em>265 F.3d 349, 353 (6th Cir.2001) (district court properly did not group illegal-reentry and firearm offenses because purposes behind laws are dissimilar); <em>United States v. Salgado-Ocampo, </em>159 F.3d 322, 328 (7th Cir. 1998) (same); <em>United States v. Baeza-Suchil, </em>52 F.3d 898, 900 (10th Cir.1995) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-22\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-19\">. The Honorable Donald E. O'Brien, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
