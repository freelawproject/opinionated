R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Defendant Nicholas Vasquez appeals his sentence for possession of a stolen firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(j), claiming the district court erred in applying a four-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">On May 18, 2001, the West Valley City, Utah, Police Department received a residential burglary report. The police located and stopped the vehicle in which the burglary suspects had fled. As the vehicle stopped, the passenger, who was later identified as Vasquez, got out of the vehicle and ran. The police found Vasquez and, in close proximity to him, two loaded semi-automatic handguns wrapped in a gray shirt. The complainants positively identified Vasquez and the other suspect and indicated that Vasquez was wearing the gray shirt at the time of the burglary. The victim of the burglary identified various items in the vehicle that had been taken from his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">On May 23, 2001, a two-count indictment was filed against Vasquez charging him with one count of possession of a stolen firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(j), and one count of possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(k). Vasquez pled guilty to possession of a stolen firearm and the other charge was dismissed. Vasquez was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of thirty-seven months. The district court concluded the two handguns were used or possessed in connection with the burglary and applied a four-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Vasquez contends the district court erred in applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) in this case. Specifically, he argues there was insufficient evidence for the district court to conclude that the two handguns were used in connection with the burglary. We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error, giving due deference to the court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to the facts. <em>United States v. Walters, </em>269 F.3d 1207, 1214 (10th Cir. 2001). We view the evidence and inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the district court\u2019s determination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">Section 2K2.1(b)(5) of the Guidelines provides that \u201c[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense ... increase by 4 levels.\u201d For purposes of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), the term \u201cfelony offense\u201d \u201cmeans any offense (federal, state, or local) punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, whether or not a criminal charge was brought, or conviction obtained.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n. 7. The phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d is not defined. While we have noted that judicial interpretations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) provide \u201csome guidance\u201d in construing the \u201cin connection with\u201d requirement, <em>United States v. Gomez-Arrellano, </em>5 F.3d 464, 466 (10th Cir. 1993), we have rejected any assertion that judicial precedent interpreting \u00a7 924(c) controls when a sentence may be enhanced under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), <em>United States v. Bun-ner, </em>134 F.3d 1000, 1006 (10th Cir.1998). \u201cGuided by these principles, we have generally held that if the weapon facilitated or had the potential to facilitate the underlying felony, then enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) is appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Gomez-Arrellano, </em>5 F.3d at 466). However, the enhancement is not appropriate if possession of the weapon was coincidental or entirely unrelated to the offense. <em>Walters, </em>269 F.3d at 1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>After reviewing the record, we conclude the district court did not err in applying the enhancement. Although Vasquez correctly notes that the complainants did not observe him in possession of a firearm, the totality of the evidence was sufficient to allow the court reasonably to infer that the handguns had the potential of facilitating the burglary. As the district court stated at sentencing, \u201clogic and common sense show[ ] that Mr. Vasquez did not bring those weapons merely by chance,\u201d and that, instead, \u201c[t]hey were there because they played a role or could have played a role had the occasion presented itself in the burglary.\u201d ROA, Vol. II at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b502-24\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
