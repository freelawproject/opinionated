Cameron appeals the thirty-month custodial sentence the district court imposed after revoking his supervised release. Cameron contends his sentence is unreasonable as it exceeded the eight-to-fourteen month sentence suggested under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.4, p.s. (2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-22\">Our review of the record reveals no abuse of discretion by the district court in imposing Cameron\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir.1995) (providing standard of review). The district court was presented with the nature and extent of Cameron\u2019s violations, the worksheet providing the recommended sentencing range of \u00a7 7B1.4(a), and the three-year maximum sentence. In light of the fact that the district court was perfectly within its province to depart from that recommended range in light of its prior decision to depart downward based on Cameron\u2019s prior substantial assistance, <em>see </em>\u00a7 7B1.4, comment, (n.4), we reject Cameron\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-23\">Accordingly, we affirm Cameron\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
