Madden sued Attorneys Liability Protection Society alleging a bad faith failure to settle his professional negligence claim against its insured. The district court granted summary judgment to defendant, and Madden appealed. After oral argument and a careful review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">George R. Madden sued his former attorneys, Robert Prigge and Moulton Bell-ingham Longo &amp; Mather (\u201cMBL <em>&amp; </em>M\u201d), claiming that their conduct fell below the required standard of care while representing him in the purchase of a ranch in Montana. He alleged that MBL &amp; M faded to inform him of the existence and scope of certain covenants and servitudes placed on the ranch by its previous owner, the Nature Conservancy, and that these restrictions reduced the value of that property. After several years of litigation and, ultimately, court-ordered mediation, Madden received a settlement of two million dollars. Thereafter, Madden sued his former attorneys\u2019 malpractice carrier, Attorneys Liability Protection Society (\u201cALPS\u201d), both at common law and pursuant to Montana\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices Act, Mont.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-201 and 242 (2002) (\u201cSection 201\u201d and \u201cSection 242\u201d respectively), claiming they refused in bad faith to settle his claim timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">The district court granted summary judgment to ALPS, holding that the undisputed facts established that ALPS had a reasonable basis for contesting Madden\u2019s claim. We review this conclusion of law <em>de novo. Thomas v. Oregon Fruit Prods. Co., </em>228 F.3d 991, 993 (9th Cir.2000). The district court\u2019s interpretation of Montana law is also reviewed <em>de novo. Redwood Empire Life Support v. County of Sonoma, </em>190 F.3d 949, 953 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">Under Montana law, ALPS has a duty to attempt to reach a prompt, fair and equitable settlement of a claim for which \u201cliability has become reasonably clear.\u201d MontCode Ann. \u00a7 33-18-201(6). In order to determine whether liability is reasonably clear, an insurer has a duty to \u201cconduct!] a reasonable investigation\u201d of the claim. Mont.Code Ann. \u00a7 33-18-201(4). A third-party claimant has an independent cause of action against an insurer for damages caused by a violation of this statute. Mont.Code Ann. \u00a7 33-18-242(1). On the other hand, an insurer may not be held liable for violating this section if it had a \u201creasonable basis in law or in fact for contesting the claim or the amount of the claim.\u201d Mont.Code Ann. \u00a7 33-18-242(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-13\">Madden argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to ALPS because ALPS did not conduct an independent investigation of his claim, and ALPS failed to attempt to promptly settle his claim after its liability to him had become reasonably clear.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>A. <em>Section 33-18-201(1): Failure to conduct a reasonable investigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The parties do not dispute <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that an investigation was conducted by Dana Christensen, the attorney retained by ALPS to defend MBL &amp; M against Madden\u2019s claim. Nor is there any dispute that Christensen thoroughly investigated Madden\u2019s claim and informed ALPS that MBL &amp; M had valid defenses to it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Madden\u2019s argument is that ALPS was obligated to conduct an additional, \u201cindependent\u201d investigation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">We reject this interpretation of Section 201(4). Madden has cited no law that requires an insurer to second-guess the informed opinion of counsel that its insured has defenses to a claim, and we know of none. Indeed, to so hold would, as the district court noted, put the carrier at odds with the insured, and in bed with the claimant. On the contrary, in the absence of some event that would put the insurer on notice of an insufficiency in the investigation conducted by the competent counsel it retained to defend its insured, that investigation is attributable to the insurer and fulfills its obligation under Montana law. <em>See Ensey v. Colorado Cas., </em>306 Mont. 68, 30 P.3d 350, 352 (Mont.2001) (attorney retained by insurer can act on its behalf to fulfill obligations under Section 201).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">B. <em>Section 33-18-212(5): \u201cReasonable basis\u201d defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">Section 242(5) provides that \u201c[a]n insurer may not be held liable under this section if the insurer had a reasonable basis in law or in fact for contesting the claim or the amount of the claim, whichever is in issue.\u201d The party asserting this defense has the burden of establishing it by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Watters v. Guar. Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>300 Mont. 91, 3 P.3d 626, 639 (Mont.2000). Although whether the insurer had a \u201creasonable basis in law or in fact\u201d for contesting the claim is generally a question of fact, and cannot be decided \u201cas a matter of law,\u201d <em>Dean v. Austin Mut. Ins. Co., </em>263 Mont. 386, 869 P.2d 256, 258 (Mont.1994), the Montana Supreme Court has determined that \u201cwhere the underlying \u2018basis in law is grounded on a legal conclusion, and no issues of fact remain in dispute,\u201d summary judgment is appropriate. <em>Watters, </em>3 P.3d at 639 (case law provided insurer with absolute defense as a matter of law). <em>See also Bartlett v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>280 Mont. 63, 929 P.2d 227, 231 (Mont.1996) (affirming summary judgment where claimant as a matter of law did not have an insurable interest in damaged property, and therefore insurer clearly had a reasonable basis for not paying claim); <em>Watts v. Westland Farm Mut. Ins. Co., </em>271 Mont. 256, 895 P.2d 626, 630 (Mont.1995) (affirming sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>mary judgment in favor of insurer where insurance policy was, as a matter of law, not in effect at time of insured\u2019s loss).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">ALPS argues that this is such a case. In its motion for summary judgment, ALPS recited the following facts in support of its contention that it had a reasonable basis in law and in fact for failing to settle Madden\u2019s claim: Madden\u2019s realtor had confirmed that Madden had a copy of the covenants and servitudes prior to purchasing the ranch; Christensen provided ALPS with an initial analysis of Madden\u2019s claim, concluding that there were a number of viable defenses; in a subsequent letter, Christensen informed ALPS that Madden\u2019s claim was \u201centirely defensible;\u201d and an expert opined that MBL <em>&amp; </em>M\u2019s conduct in the underlying representation did not fall below the standard of professional care.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Under these undisputed facts,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> MBL &amp; B\u2019s liability to Madden was not so clear that ALPS had a duty as a matter of law to settle Madden\u2019s claim upon its filing. On the contrary, ALPS had a reasonable basis in fact to contest Madden\u2019s claim. If Madden knew of the restrictive covenants and servitudes prior to purchasing the ranch, then MBL &amp; B\u2019s liability to him was not \u201creasonably clear\u201d and ALPS was entitled to defend against Madden\u2019s claim. The mere fact that ALPS ultimately settled Madden\u2019s claim does not automatically establish that it exercised bad faith in failing to settle that claim sooner. <em>See Palmer by Diacon v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>261 Mont. 91, 861 P.2d 895, 914 (Mont.1993). To hold otherwise would \u201cimpair the insurer\u2019s right to a zealous defense and even its right of access to the courts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the district court correctly entered summary judgment for ALPS and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b364-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-14\">. Despite the fact that the issue on appeal is whether ALPS is entitled to the summary judgment granted it by the district court, Madden continues to argue that <em>he </em>is entitled to summary judgment. Although he filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, the denial of that motion is not under review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\">. The district court noted in its order that Madden failed to respond appropriately to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, submitting \u201clegal contentions in opposition to facts identified by ALPS as not being in dispute.\u201d As a result, there is no evidence in the record to contradict ALPS\u2019s contentions regarding Christensen\u2019s investigation or that his conclusions were communicated to ALPS.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b365-8\">. Madden acknowledges in his brief that Christensen told ALPS that its insured had informed Madden's real estate agent of the covenants and servitude prior to the closing on the ranch.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b365-13\">. ALPS contends that the district court\u2019s holding on the reasonable investigation issue was <em>dicta, </em>because its holding that ALPS had a reasonable basis for contesting Madden\u2019s claim sufficed to decide the case. The statute, however, provides that failure to conduct an investigation is an independent cause of action. Mont.Code Ann. \u00a7 33-18-242(1). <em>See also Walker v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>241 Mont. 256, 786 P.2d 1157, 1159 (Mont. 1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b366-6\">. Madden did not dispute ALPS\u2019s recitation of the undisputed facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
