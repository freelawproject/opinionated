Acquisition Corp., a Chapter 7 debtor. Breathe-Ez Limited, a limited partnership, granted a license to A.S. Acquisition Corp. The bankruptcy court allowed this license to be transferred, along with the other assets of A.S. Acquisition Corp.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">These appeals were initially brought on behalf of Breathe-Ez by A1 Pollard, the court-appointed wind-up partner for Breathe-Ez (which was itself in dissolution). Pollard and Breathe-Ez voluntarily dismissed these appeals. Elfman was allowed to reinstate these appeals as an individual and not on behalf of Breathe-Ez. The bankruptcy trustee, Suzanne L. Decker, challenges Elfman\u2019s standing to bring these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">To have standing to appeal a bankruptcy order, an \u201cappellant must be a \u2018person aggrieved\u2019 by the bankruptcy court\u2019s order.\u201d <em>In re P.R.T.C., Inc., </em>177 F.3d 774, 777 (9th Cir.1999). \u201cAn appellant is aggrieved if \u2018directly and adversely affected pecuniarily by an order of the bankruptcy court\u2019; in other words, the order must diminish the appellant\u2019s property, increase its burdens, or detrimentally affect its rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Fondiller v. Robertson, </em>707 F.2d 441, 442 (9th Cir.1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Elfman does not have standing because he is not an aggrieved party. Although Elfman characterizes himself as Breathe-Ez\u2019s \u201cmanaging partner for wind up,\u201d he is, in fact, only a limited partner of that organization. As a limited partner, he \u201chas no interest in specific partnership property.\u201d Cal. Corp.Code \u00a7 15671. The bankruptcy order affected the <em>partnership\u2019s </em>property: the license that the partnership owned and granted to the debtor. Elfman has no interest in this property. And the bankruptcy court\u2019s order did not affect Elfman\u2019s personal interest in the limited partnership; Elfman\u2019s share of the partnership remains the same. As an individual, Elfman has no standing to appeal the bankruptcy court\u2019s order. <em>Cf. Mayer v. C.W. Driver, </em>98 Cal.App.4th 48, 60, 120 Cal.Rptr.2d 535 (Cal.Ct.App.2002) (holding that a partner has no standing to sue in his individual capacity for damage caused to partnership property).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">Appeals DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b452-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
