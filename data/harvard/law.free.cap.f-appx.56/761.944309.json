Mueller, </em>304 F.3d 918, 920 (9th Cir. 2002). State prisoners seeking to challenge a non-capital conviction must therefore file a petition within one year from \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). Prisoners such as Tucker whose judgment became final prior to AEDPA\u2019s enactment had until April 24, 1997 to file a petition for federal habeas corpus relief. <em>Lott, </em>304 F.3d at 920; <em>Patterson v. Stewart, </em>251 F.3d 1243,1245 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">The April 24, 1997 filing date may be tolled during the pendency of a \u201cproperly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). The Supreme Court of Nevada dismissed Tucker\u2019s appeal pursuant to Nevada Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b), which governs appeals in criminal cases, and not Nevada Revised Statute 34.726(1), which governs petitions for post-conviction relief. Therefore, Tucker\u2019s September 18, 1996 filing was not a proper application for \u201cState post-conviction or other collateral review\u201d permitting tolling under \u00a7 2244(d)(2), but a direct, albeit fatally late, appeal of his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">We briefly note Tucker\u2019s additional argument that the one-year statute of limitation should be equitably tolled on account of his trial counsel\u2019s deficient performance. Because the District Court did not include this issue within the certificate of appeala-bility, and because Tucker has not moved before this Court to expand the issues on appeal, we may not address the merits of the equitable tolling claim. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c); <em>Valerio v. Crawford, </em>306 F.3d 742, 764 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc); <em>Hiivala v.
