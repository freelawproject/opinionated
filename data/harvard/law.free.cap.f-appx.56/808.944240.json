Leslie appeals from the district court\u2019s December 12, 2001 order affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s denial of Leslie\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the bankruptcy court\u2019s refusal to dismiss the Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding initiated by Leslie. We dismiss the appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-18\">Leslie concedes that the sole reason for seeking dismissal of his bankruptcy case\u2014 which is the only issue on appeal \u2014 -is to pursue a separate lawsuit filed against ICA Construction Corporation (ICA). However, the bankruptcy trustee appointed to administer Leslie\u2019s bankruptcy estate settled the ICA litigation and that action has been dismissed with prejudice. No stay was obtained. Nevertheless, Leslie argues that his appeal is not moot because the matter appealed from is \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review,\u201d is of public interest, and will have collateral consequences. But there is no reasonable chance of his being subject to the same kind of order again. <em>See Pub. Utils. Comm\u2019n v. Fed. Energy Regulatory Comm\u2019n, </em>100 F.3d 1451, 1460 (9th Cir. 1996) (\u201cWhen resolution of a controversy depends on facts that are unique or unlikely to be repeated, the action is not capable of repetition and hence is moot.\u201d). Nor are other debtors likely to face anything similar. Finally, Leslie identifies no cognizable collateral consequences. As there is no effective relief to be granted, the appeal is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-22\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b844-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
