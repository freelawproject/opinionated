Upon de novo review, <em>see Kinserlow v. CMI Corp., </em>217 F.3d 1021, 1025 (8th Cir.2000), we conclude the district court did not err in denying Davis judgment as a matter of law. We also conclude the court did not abuse its discretion in denying Davis remittitur, as the award was not conscience-shocking or unjust. <em>See Duty v.
