We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). We review de novo, <em>United States v. Ahumada-Aguilar, </em>295 F.3d 943, 947 (9th Cir.2002), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Vargas-Contreras challenges the legality of the 1995 deportation order upon which his conviction was based, as permitted by <em>United States v. Mendozar-Lopez, </em>481 U.S. 828, 107 S.Ct. 2148, 95 L.Ed.2d 772 (1987). He contends that the deportation violated due process because the immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) informed him that he was statutorily ineligible for discretionary relief from deportation pursuant to \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1995), and he relied on this when electing to waive his right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Because the IJ accurately stated the existing law at the time of the hearing, there was no fatal flaw in the deportation proceeding, and Vargas-Contreras\u2019 waiver of appeal was intelligent and effective. <em>See United States v. Garza-Sanchez, </em>217 F.3d 806, 809-10 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that immigration judge satisfies his obligation by advising the respondent of the relief for which he is statutorily eligible). Therefore, Vargas-Contreras\u2019 collateral challenge to his deportation fails to meet the fundamental unfairness requirement of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d) and the district court properly denied his motion to dismiss the indictment. <em>See United States v. GarciaMartinez, </em>228 F.3d 956, 960 n. 5 (9th Cir.2000) (noting that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d) codified due process requirements outlined by <em>Mendoza-Lopez).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b394-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
