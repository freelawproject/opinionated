Gaines Jr. appeals pro se the district court\u2019s dismissal of his two civil rights actions pursuant to a stipulation between Pomona College and the Chapter 7 trustee of Gaines\u2019s bankruptcy estate. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the question of standing de novo. <em>Barrus v. Sylvania, </em>55 F.3d 468, 469 (9th Cir.1995). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-23\">The district court properly dismissed Gaines\u2019s actions because they were property of his bankruptcy estate and only the bankruptcy trustee had standing to bring the actions. <em>See Moneymaker v. Coben (In re Eisen), </em>31 F.3d 1447, 1451 n. 2 (9th Cir.1994) (stating that the bankruptcy trustee, as the representative of the bankruptcy estate, is the only party with standing to prosecute causes of action belonging to the estate).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-24\">Gaines\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s refusal to enter default is frivolous because Gaines requested entry of default four days after Pomona College filed its answer. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-25\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Gaines\u2019s motion to re-cuse Judge Snyder. <em>See United States ex rel. Hochman v. Nackman, </em>145 F.3d 1069, 1076 (9th Cir.1998). Judge Snyder is a graduate of Pomona College and contrib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>utes money to the school. However, these are not contacts that could \u201creasonably lead one to question [her] impartiality ...\u201d <em>See id. </em>(and cases cited therein) (no abuse of discretion for failure to recuse where district judge made small yearly contribution to his law school alumni association).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b422-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
