Because his service does not satisfy the statutory requirements of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8333, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-31\">A board decision must be affirmed unless it is found to be: \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-32\">To qualify for a Civil Service Retirement annuity, an applicant must have completed at least five years of civilian service, of which one of the last two years of service must be creditable under the Civil Service Retirement Act (\u201cCSRA\u201d). 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8333(a), (b) (2000). Barreto argues that the board\u2019s denial of an annuity was not in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>accordance with law because his service, from his indefinite appointment on January 30,1956, until his separation on July 1, 1958, was creditable under the CSRA. He asserts that the appointment was made when the ban on CSRA coverage of non-permanent appointments lapsed between the revocation of Executive Order No. 10,-180, 3 C.F.R. \u00a7 363 (1950), and the promulgation of 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 29.2 (1960) (effective October 30, 1956). Executive Order 10,530, 3 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 189, 191, 193 (1954), however, \u201ckept in place the exclusion of nonpermanent employees from coverage by the CSRA effected by Executive Order 10,180 until the Civil Service Commission promulgated new regulations, which it did in 1956.\u201d <em>Casilang v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>248 F.3d 1381, 1383 (Fed.Cir.2001). Consequently, Barreto\u2019s service is not creditable under the CSRA.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
