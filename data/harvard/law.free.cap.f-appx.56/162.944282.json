Counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel states there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but contends on Phillips\u2019 behalf that Phillips\u2019 plea was not knowing and voluntary and that the district court erred in determining his sentence. Phillips has not filed a pro se supplemental brief, although informed of his right to do so. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Phillips first contends his plea was not knowing and voluntary. Because Phillips did not move to withdraw his guilty plea in the district court, this court reviews the Rule 11 proceeding for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 527 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 200, 154 L.Ed.2d 169 (2002). An appropriately conducted Rule 11 proceeding raises a strong presumption that the plea is final and binding. <em>United States v. Puckett, </em>61 F.3d 1092, 1099 (4th Cir.1995). The record establishes the Rule 11 hearing was adequate, and the district court did not err in accepting Phillips\u2019 guilty plea. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114,117,120 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Phillips next contends the district court erred in determining his sentence. Because Phillips did not raise this issue in the district court, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We find no such error in the district court\u2019s determination of Phillips\u2019 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record and find no error. Accordingly, we affirm Phillips\u2019 conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
