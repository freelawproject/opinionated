We must affirm the Benefits Review Board\u2019s approval of the ALJ\u2019s decision on attorney\u2019s fees unless it is either unsupported by substantial evidence on the records considered as a whole or contrary to applicable law. <em>Todd Shipyards Corp. v. Director, Office of Workers Compensation Programs, </em>950 F.2d 607, 610 (9th Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>We must ask \u201c[D]id the plaintiff achieve a level of success that makes the hours reasonably expended a satisfactory basis for making a fee award?\u201d <em>Hensley v. Eck-erhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 434, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). \u2018Where the relief sought and obtained is limited to money, the terms \u2018extent of success\u2019 and \u2018level of success\u2019 are euphemistic ways of referring to money.\u201d <em>McGinnis v. Kentucky Fried Chicken of California, </em>51 F.3d 805 (9th Cir.1994). The ALJ did not err in finding that a <em>de minimis </em>award of $1 per week for permanent partial disability compensation constituted only \u201cpartial success.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Harvey is not automatically entitled to a full lodestar amount. <em>Farrar v. Hobby, </em>506 U.S. 103, 115, 113 S.Ct. 566, 121 L.Ed.2d 494 (1992). We have previously upheld a fifty-percent reduction in attorney\u2019s fees when the plaintiff successfully proved causation but received only a small percentage of the requested damage award. <em>Harris v.
