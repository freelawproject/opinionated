Rodriguez challenges the verdict on the basis of evidentiary rulings made at trial. We affirm for the reasons stated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-18\">1. The incidents alleged in this case took place while Rodriguez was incarcerated at the Green Haven Correctional Facility (\u201cGreen Haven\u201d). The Complaint alleged several violations of Rodriguez\u2019s constitutional rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 &amp; 1985. He alleges that prison officials retaliated against him because of his refusal to become a jailhouse informant. In a thorough and well-reasoned opinion, the district court granted summary judgment only as to Rodriguez\u2019s claim that Lt. Schneider, a hearing officer at Green Haven, had intentionally placed glass in a special kosher meal while Rodriguez was temporarily segregated in Green Haven\u2019s special housing unit (\u201cSHU\u201d). This Court reviews the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. See Young v. County of Fulton, </em>160 F.3d 899, 902 (2d Cir.1998). We affirm for substantially the same reasons as the district court. <em>See Rodriguez v. Lt. Schneider, et </em>al., 95 Civ. 4083(RPP), 1999 WL 459813 (S.D.N.Y. June 29, 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-19\">This Court is required to construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and to draw all reasonable inferences in its favor. <em>See Maguire v. Citicorp Retail Servs., Inc., </em>147 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>232, 235 (2d Cir.1998). However, it is undisputed that Lt. Schneider was not on duty on the day the glass was placed in Rodriguez\u2019s food, and Rodriguez has pointed to no evidence establishing that anyone else did so at Lt. Schneider\u2019s direction. Any inference that Lt. Schneider was responsible for this incident would be sheer conjecture and thus insufficient to defeat summary judgment. <em>See Kerzer v. Kingly Mfg., </em>156 F.3d 396, 400 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">2. Rodriguez also challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion <em>in limine </em>to obtain the names of (and cross-examine) confidential informants who purportedly informed prison authorities of threats made by Rodriguez against Lt. Schneider. These reports were the basis of an administrative segregation recommendation and resulted in both Rodriguez\u2019s segregation to the SHU and his removal from his position as a representative on the Inmate Grievance Resolution Committee. The court did not immediately rule on the motion, but counsel for Rodriguez was barred from eliciting the informants\u2019 identities on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">We have recognized that the \u201crequirements of prison security are unique,\u201d and that in this context the non-disclosure of a confidential informant\u2019s identity in disciplinary proceedings may satisfy due process. <em>Giakoumelos v. Coughlin, </em>88 F.3d 56, 62 (2d Cir.1996). Due process is satisfied so long as the disciplinary finding is supported by \u201csome evidence,\u201d which may include information received by a non-testifying confidential informant so long as there was \u201csome examination of indicia relevant to [an informant\u2019s] credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Russell v. Scully, </em>15 F.3d 219, 223 (2d Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Rodriguez concedes the inadequacy of any due process claim, but argues the district court\u2019s decision prevented him from fully developing his retaliation claim; he sought to establish that the purported threats against Lt. Schneider were fabricated. Evidentiary decisions are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Tocco, </em>135 F.3d 116, 127 (2d Cir.1998). In making its ruling, the district court had to balance legitimate penological interests with Rodriguez\u2019s right to a fair trial. An independent hearing officer concluded during the administrative segregation hearing that based on earlier, reliable information the informants had provided in other situations, the information was credible. And aside from eliciting the identity of the informants, Rodriguez was permitted full cross-examination of two of the three prison guards who had testified to the informant\u2019s communications at the hearing, including the officer who had purportedly spoken directly to the informants. (An additional guard had died in the intervening time.) Regardless of its impact on the fairness of a criminal proceeding, the district court\u2019s ruling reasonably balanced the interests involved in this prisoner\u2019s civil rights action. We see no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">3. A district court\u2019s determination as to whether counsel\u2019s conduct caused prejudice is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Pappas v. Middle Earth Condo. Ass\u2019n, </em>963 F.2d 534, 540 (2d Cir.1992). Defense counsel twice referred in summation to facts not in evidence: (1) that Rodriguez converted to Judaism in prison in order to obtain better meals, and (2) that Lt. Schneider\u2019s wife (also a prison guard) was conducting an investigation into Rodriguez\u2019s alleged drug smuggling. The court sustained objections to both comments. Counsel for Rodriguez asked for no curative instructions; however, the court properly instructed the jury in the charge to disregard as facts any statements made by lawyers and to rely only on evidence prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>erly in the record. The jury is presumed to have followed those instructions. <em>Francis v. Franklin, </em>471 U.S. 307, 324 n. 9, 105 S.Ct. 1965, 85 L.Ed.2d 344 (1985). The misconduct, if any, was <em>\u201cde minimis </em>in the context of the entire trial\u201d and \u201cpromptly dealt with by the trial court\u2019s rulings and curative instructions.\u201d <em>Pappas, </em>963 F.2d at 540. We see no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
