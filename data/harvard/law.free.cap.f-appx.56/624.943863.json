We have reviewed the administrative record and find that substantial evidence supports the conclusion of the IJ and the Board that Alhag failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution necessary to qualify for relief from deportation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) (1994);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b) (2002). We conclude that the record supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Alhag failed to establish his eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">The standard for withholding of deportation is \u201cmore stringent than that for asylum eligibility.\u201d <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). An applicant for withholding must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution. <em>INS v. Cardo-za Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). As Alhag has failed to establish refugee status, he cannot satisfy the higher standard for withholding of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-12\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-13\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b661-26\">. Alhag does not argue past persecution to this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b661-27\">. We note that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) was repealed by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub.L. No. 104-128, 110 Stat. 3009 (IIRIRA), effective April 1, 1997. Because this case was in transition at the time the IIRIRA was passed, \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) is still applicable here under the terms of the transitional rules contained in \u00a7 309(c) of the IIRI-RA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
