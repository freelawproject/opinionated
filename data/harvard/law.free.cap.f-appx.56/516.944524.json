Drawing an adverse inference from Daiki-chi\u2019s failure to produce Watanabe to testify regarding his speech was not improper under the circumstances. <em>Warshawsky &amp; Co. v. NLRB, </em>182 F.3d 948, 955 (D.C.Cir. 1999); <em>Int\u2019l Union, UAW v. NLRB, </em>459 F.2d 1329, 1344-45 (D.C.Cir.1972). Viewed in context, Lu\u2019s comments could reasonably be construed as creating an impression of surveillance. Likewise, the comments by Saito and Dipu, which would be close calls if viewed in isolation, could reasonably be interpreted as coercive in light of Watanabe\u2019s prior threats. As for the failure to rehire, the General Counsel presented a sufficient prima facie case to shift the burden of proof to Daikichi without presenting evidence of disparate treatment. <em>Parsippany Hotel Mgmt. Co. v. NLRB, </em>99 F.3d 413, 423-424 (D.C.Cir. 1996); <em>MECO Corp. v. NLRB, </em>986 F.2d 1434, 1437-38 (D.C.Cir.1993). The employees may not have had a right to be rehired, but the company still had an obligation not to make its decisions on the basis of protected activity. <em>NLRB v. Low </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number><em>Kit Mining Co., </em>3 F.3d 720, 726-27 (4th Cir.1993). Accordingly, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the petition for review be DENIED, and the cross-application for enforcement be GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
