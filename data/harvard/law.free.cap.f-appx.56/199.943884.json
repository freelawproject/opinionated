Banks pled guilty to three counts of armed bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d) (2000), and one count of using or carrying a firearm during a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2000). The district court sentenced Banks to a seventy-eight-month sentence on the bank robbery counts and a consecutive seven-year sentence on the \u00a7 924(c) count. Banks appeals his sentence. His counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging the district court\u2019s finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Banks brandished a firearm and asserting that the district court erred in applying an adjustment for use of a firearm under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) (2001), but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. We grant Banks\u2019 motion to file a pro se supplemental brief, which raises one additional issue. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-20\">Banks contends that the district court erred in imposing a seven-year sentence for the \u00a7 924(c) conviction because brandishing was not charged in the indictment. Banks\u2019 claim is foreclosed by <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 2412,153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-21\">Next, Banks contends that the district court erred in applying an adjustment for use of a firearm under USSG \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) when he also was convicted of a \u00a7 924(c) offense. We find no plain error in the application of the enhancement. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (stating standard of review); USSG \u00a7 2K2.4, comment, (n.2); <em>United States v. Park, </em>167 F.3d 1258,1260-61 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-22\">Finally, in his pro se supplemental brief, Banks relies on Amendment 489 to the Sentencing Guidelines and asserts that the district court\u2019s calculation of his sentence was incorrect. However, he relies on the text that was deleted by the amendment. Our review discloses that the district court properly calculated his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-23\">As required by Anders, we have examined the entire record and find no m\u00e9rito-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>rious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Banks\u2019 convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
