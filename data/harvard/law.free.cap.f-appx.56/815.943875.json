The bankruptcy court found that Hurt had been ousted by her co-tenants and was entitled to damages. Tona appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to the district court. The district court affirmed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">This Court reviews de novo the district court\u2019s decision on an appeal from a bankruptcy court. <em>In re Cardelucci, </em>285 F.3d 1231, 1233 (9th Cir.2002). The bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusions of law are reviewed de novo and its factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>In re Su, </em>290 F.3d 1140, 1142 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">We agree with the district court that the issue of Hurt\u2019s undivided one-half interest in the Broadway property is well settled. Likewise, we find no error in the bankruptcy court\u2019s determination that Hurt was ousted from the Broadway property. Nor can we say that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in calculating the amount of damages awarded to Hurt.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">AFFIRMED. Costs are awarded to the Appellee.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b852-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
