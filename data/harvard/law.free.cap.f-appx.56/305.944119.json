The district court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231 and we have jurisdiction over this timely appeal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-29\">Whether Escobedo received ineffective assistance of counsel is reviewed de novo. <em>Mancuso v. Olivarez, </em>292 F.3d 939, 949 (9th Cir.2002). To prevail, Escobedo must demonstrate (1) that counsel\u2019s actions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance, and (2) that Escobe-do was prejudiced by reason of counsel\u2019s actions. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-90, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>Mancuso, </em>292 F.3d at 953-54. We will address the prejudice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>issue. <em>Fields v. Woodford, </em>309 F.3d 1095, 1107 (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Escobedo must \u201caffirmatively prove prejudice.\u201d <em>Strickland </em>466 U.S. at 693, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To do so, Escobedo is required to show that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Escobedo concedes that he must prove that Hamilton\u2019s alleged \u201cbad advice\u201d caused Escobedo to reject a plea offer, which he otherwise would have accepted. <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 57, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985) <em>Strickland </em>test applies to \u201cineffective assistance claims arising out of the plea process.\u201d); <em>Turner v. Calderon, </em>281 F.3d 851, 879 (9th Cir. 2002). To demonstrate such prejudice, Escobedo offers only the statement that \u201c[a] sufficient showing of ineffective assistance of counsel was made at the evidentiary hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">However, the District Court explicitly found that Escobedo was not prejudiced by Hamilton\u2019s alleged failures. The court found that \u201cthe testimony of Charles Hamilton, III, Esq. given at the evidentiary hearing was, and is, credible, and the testimony given by the defendant was not, and is not, credible,\u201d and observed that Hamilton testified that Escobedo \u201c\u2018never expressed an interest in cooperating with the government\u2019 \u201d which Escobedo knew was a condition of the plea agreement. The district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Alvarez-Tautimez, </em>160 F.3d 573, 575 (9th Cir.1998). There is no clear error in this finding, and Escobedo has not even endeavored to show otherwise. Therefore, Escobedo has faded to prove the second component of his <em>Strickland </em>claim on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">With respect to whether he was prejudiced by Hamilton\u2019s failure to procure an interpreter for all but one of their meetings, Escobedo states only that this failure \u201cdenied Mr. Escobedo the ability to fully explore all legal and factual issues relevant to his case.\u201d Escobedo admits that to prove his claim, he would have to demonstrate that but for counsel\u2019s failure, he would have pled guilty. Nowhere in his brief does he assert that but for the lack of an interpreter on four out of five meetings with his attorney, he would have pled guilty. Therefore, Escobedo has failed to carry his burden of proving that he was prejudiced by the lack of an interpreter at meetings with his lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">We need not explore whether counsel\u2019s assistance was ineffective because Escobe-do\u2019s claim fails Strickland\u2019s prejudice inquiry, and we therefore affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b341-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
