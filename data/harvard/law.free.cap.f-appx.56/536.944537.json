Gen.Stat. \u00a7 46a-51(15), used an incorrect definition of \u201cdisability\u201d under that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-23\">It is clear that the District Court erred in its interpretation of Conn. GemStat. \u00a7 46a-51(15) by substituting the statute\u2019s requirement that an impairment be \u201cchronic\u201d with the requirement that it be \u201cchronic and permanent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-24\">Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 46a-51(15) defines a person to be \u201cphysically disabled\u201d if he or she suffers from \u201cany chronic physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>handicap, infirmity or impairment, whether congenital or resulting form bodily injury, organic processes or changes from illness.\u201d The District Court, however, stated repeatedly in its opinion that, to qualify as disabled under the CFEPA, the plaintiff must suffer from a \u201chandicap, infirmity or impairment\u201d that is \u201cchronic <em>and permanent. </em>\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">\u201cChronic\u201d and \u201cchronic and permanent\u201d constitute significantly different standards. The Connecticut Superior Court has defined \u201cchronic\u201d to mean \u201cof long duration, or characterized by slowly progressive symptoms ... distinguished from acute.\u201d <em>Shaw v. Greenwich Anesthesiology Associates, P.C., </em>137 F.Supp.2d 48, 65 (D.Conn.2001) (citing <em>Gilman Bros. v. Conn. Comm\u2019n on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>CV 950536075, 1997 WL 275578, at *4 (Conn.Super.Ct. May 13, 1997)). This is consistent with the dictionary definition of \u201cchronic,\u201d which provides: \u201cOf diseases, etc.: Lasting a long time, long-continued, lingering, inveterate.\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Oxford English Dictionary </em>(2d ed.1989). \u201cPermanent,\u201d by contrast, means \u201c[cjontinuing or designed to continue indefinitely without change,\u201d <em>id., </em>or \u201cnot expected to change in status [or] condition,\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>(4th ed.2000). An impairment, therefore, could be chronic (\u201clong-continued, lingering\u201d) without being permanent (\u201cdesigned to continue indefinitely without change\u201d or \u201cnot expected to change in status [or] condition\u201d). The requirement that an impairment be \u201cchronic and permanent,\u201d as stated by the District Court, therefore would narrow the scope of the CFEPA from encompassing any impairment that may \u201clast[] a long time\u201d to encompass only those impairments that are \u201cnot expected to change.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">There is support for the view that permanence <em>may </em>be a feature of a disability under the standard of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. See, e.g., Toyota Motor Mfg., Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, </em>534 U.S. 184, 122 S.Ct. 681, 691, 151 L.Ed.2d 615 (2002) holding that a qualifying disability under the ADA may be \u201cpermanent <em>or </em>long-term\u201d (emphasis supplied). However, the judges in the District of Connecticut and Connecticut state courts previously have rejected the view that the ADA standard is incorporated into CFEPA. <em>Shaw, </em>137 F.Supp.2d at 65 (stating that \u201c[t]o be \u2018disabled\u2019 under Connecticut law is different from being \u2018disabled\u2019 under the ADA\u201d). Therefore, even were the ADA to require that an impairment be \u201cpermanent\u201d, if the District Court relied on the ADA in finding a permanence requirement in the CFEPA, that reliance on the federal statute was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">For the above reasons, we vacate the judgment and remand the cause to the District Court. On remand, given the admissions of appellant\u2019s counsel at oral argument that his Local Rule 9(c) Statement could be improved by framing the factual issues more precisely, we direct the District Court to permit the parties to amend their Local Rule 9(c) statements to the extent that the parties deem appropriate in order to assist the District Court in applying the appropriate standard of liability-</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b573-6\"> \"Inveterate,\u201d for its part, also does not mean \"permanent\u201d or incurable. It means, \"Of disease: Of long standing, chronic; hence, deep-seated and resisting treatment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
