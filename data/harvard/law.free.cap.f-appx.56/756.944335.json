Raymond Thomas HAIGHT, Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b792-8\">No. 02-3428.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b792-9\">United States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b792-10\">Submitted March 6, 2003.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b792-11\">Decided March 11, 2003.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b792-13\">Before BYE, FAGG, and RILEY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b792-16\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b792-17\">Raymond Thomas Haight pleaded guilty to possession of a stolen firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(j) and 924(a)(2), and the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 41 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release. On appeal, Haight argues that the district court erred in setting his base offense level at 20 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A), and in assessing 2 criminal history points on the ground that he was under a criminal justice sentence at the time of the instant offense. After careful review of the record, we reject Haight\u2019s arguments, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-18\">Because we have held previously that possession of a sawed-off shotgun was a crime of violence, we conclude that Haight\u2019s 2001 conviction warranted a base offense level of 20. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A); <em>United States v. Allegree, </em>175 F.3d 648, 651 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 958, 120 S.Ct. 388, 145 L.Ed.2d 303 (1999). Further, we conclude that Haight\u2019s 2001 suspended sentence\u2014 which required his compliance with conditions and provided the sentencing court with the power to revoke, alter, or vacate the suspension \u2014 was a criminal justice sentence, warranting 2 criminal history points. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d) &amp; comment. (n.4); <em>United States v. Labella-Szuba, </em>92 F.3d 136, 138 (2d Cir.) (although defendant\u2019s sentence did not include active supervision, it was criminal justice sentence because sentencing court retained power to revoke conditional discharge), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1047, 117 S.Ct. 624, 136 L.Ed.2d 547 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-22\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-19\">.
