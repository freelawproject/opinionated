We do not recite the facts here as they are known to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-16\">This case falls under the transitional rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). When the BIA conducts its own review of the record, as here, this court reviews the BIA\u2019s decision rather than the Immigration Judge\u2019s, except to the extent that the BIA explicitly adopts the Immigration Judge\u2019s ruling. <em>Cordon-Garcia v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 985, 990 (9th Cir.2000). This court upholds the decision of the BIA if it is \u201c \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-17\">In this case, Petitioner was threatened in 1982 by the NPA and the Laban party. However, as the BIA noted, she moved to Quezon City and did not experience further trouble from this group. Petitioner claimed that she continued to suffer persecution because in 1990 the government police shot her in the leg during a KMU rally. However, Petitioner conceded in her hearing that the government shot generally into the crowd, not specifically at her. Because reasonable, substantial and probative evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Petitioner did not establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>future persecution, the petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b378-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Cir.
