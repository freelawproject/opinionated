Drawing all inferences in favor of the government, there was sufficient evidence from which a rational juror could infer Keaggy\u2019s knowledge of and intent to commit mail fraud. <em>United States v. Stoddard, </em>150 F.3d 1140, 1143-44 (9th Cir.1998). There was also sufficient evidence that the Keaggys\u2019 false statements to the Small Business Administration were material. <em>United States v. Service Deli, Inc., </em>151 F.3d 938, 941 (9th Cir.1998) (false statement is material if \u201ccapable of influencing\u201d a federal agency; need not actually influence agency\u2019s decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-20\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Keaggy\u2019s motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. As the district court noted, it is questionable whether the evidence was indeed \u201cnewly discovered\u201d or whether Keag-gy had exercised due diligence in discovering it, but, in any event, the evidence was not likely to produce a different verdict. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>209 F.3d 1103, 1106 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-21\">In sentencing Keaggy, the district court recognized its authority to depart downward, but did not feel such a departure was warranted. As such, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s decision not to depart. <em>United States v. Davoudi, </em>172 F.3d 1130,1133 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b881-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
