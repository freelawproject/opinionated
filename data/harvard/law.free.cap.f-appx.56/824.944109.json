The court\u2019s inquiry into the merits of Jenkins\u2019 motion was adequate and provided it with a \u201csufficient basis for reaching an informed decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Adelzo-Gonzalez, </em>268 F.3d 772, 777 (9th Cir.2001) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-16\">Neither was the district court\u2019s denial of Jenkins\u2019 motion for a continuance of his sentencing hearing an abuse of discretion. Jenkins\u2019 counsel adequately represented him at the sentencing hearing, resulting in a lack of prejudice. <em>See United States v. Zamora-Hernandez, </em>222 F.3d 1046, 1049 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-21\">The district court also acted within its discretion when it denied Jenkins\u2019 motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Erroneous advice as to the potential sentence does not constitute a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d for withdrawing a guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>257 F.3d 1030, 1032 (9th Cir.2001); <em>see also United States v. Mich-lin, </em>34 F.3d 896, 899 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b860-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
