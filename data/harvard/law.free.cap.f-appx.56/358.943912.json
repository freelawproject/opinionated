We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., </em>26 F.3d 885, 888 (9th Cir.1994). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">The Secretary presented evidence that Cheng was fired because she made threatening remarks in the aftermath of a fatal workplace shooting. Because Cheng failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the proffered reasons for her termination were pretextual, summary judgment on both her discrimination and retaliation claims is proper. <em>See Villiari-mo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., </em>281 F.3d 1054,1062-65 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Cheng\u2019s claim that the First Amendment protects the statements that were the basis for her termination fails because those statements did not involve matters of public concern. <em>See Weeks v. Bayer, </em>246 F.3d 1231,1234-35 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">To the extent Cheng challenges the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d) validating her termination, her claim fails because the MSPB did not abuse its discretion and its decision was based on substantial evidence. <em>See McClaskey v. U.S. Dep\u2019t. of Energy, </em>720 F.2d 583, 586 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b395-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
