The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted defendants summary judgment, and denied Brunzo\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Brunzo appeals. After careful review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-19\">Under our cases, the alleged conditions of Brunzo\u2019s confinement simply do not amount to an atypical and significant hardship relative to the ordinary incidents of prison life. <em>See Portley-El v. Brill, </em>288 F.3d 1063,1065 (8th Cir.2002); <em>Kennedy v. Blankenship, </em>100 F.3d 640, 642-43 &amp; n. 2 (8th Cir.1996). As a result, summary judgment was appropriate, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying reconsideration, see <em>Smith v. Chem. Leaman Tank Lines, Inc., </em>285 F.3d 750, 752 (8th Cir.2002) (standard of review for motion for reconsideration).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-20\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b789-17\">. The HONORABLE RICHARD G. KOPF, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
