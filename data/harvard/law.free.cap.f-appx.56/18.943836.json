Perrelli appeals from a Judgment entered April 11, 2002 in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (Alfred V. Covello, Judge) dismissing his complaint for failure to prosecute and failure to comply with an order of the court, pursuant to Rules 4(m) and 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-18\">We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint for failure to prosecute and for non-compliance with a court order. <em>See Thompson v. Maldonado, </em>309 F.3d 107, 110 (2d Cir. 2002) (re: dismissal for non-compliance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m)); <em>LeSane v. Hall\u2019s Sec. Analyst, Inc., </em>239 F.3d 206, 209 (2d Cir.2001) (re: dismissal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) for failure to prosecute and for non-compliance with court order). Our review of the record reveals that Appellant woefully failed to comply with Rule 4(m)\u2019s 120-day service requirement. Appellant also failed to comply with the district court\u2019s order, issued eight months after Appellant filed his complaint, requiring Appellant to report the status of service of process within 15 days of the order or risk dismissal. Three months after issuing the order, after receiving no reply from Appellant, the district court dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-19\">Appellant did not then provide, nor has he since provided, an explanation or other evidence establishing \u201cgood cause\u201d for his non-compliance. On the contrary, Appellant\u2019s default suggests to this Court, as it likely suggested to the district court, his disinterest in properly prosecuting his claims at this time. We are mindful of the constraints placed on a district court\u2019s discretion to dismiss under Rule 41(b). <em>See LeSane, </em>239 F.3d at 209. Nonetheless, we find sufficient grounds warranting dismissal of Appellant\u2019s complaint and conclude that the district court did not abuse its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>discretion in doing so. Accordingly, the Order of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
