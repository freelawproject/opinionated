An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(l)(2000). Here, the district court denied a certificate of appealability because Childress failed to timely file his notice of appeal from the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion, despite being given an extension of time to do so. Because the district court was without authority to fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ther extend Childress\u2019 appeal time, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a), and because Childress failed to timely file his notice of appeal, Childress did not qualify for a certificate of appealability. <em>See generally Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001). We have reviewed the record and conclude that Childress failed to make the requisite showing under \u00a7 2253, and the district court properly denied Chil-dress\u2019 request for a certificate of appeala-bility. Moreover, to the extent Childress seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion, we are without jurisdiction to consider the appeal absent a timely notice of appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
