The court determined that an \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard applied to the Trustees\u2019 denial of Miro\u2019s application for benefits, because the applicable benefit plan gave the Trustees substantial discretional authority to construe the plan and determine eligibility for benefits. The court then held that Trustees\u2019 determination was not arbitrary and capricious. Miro appeals from both aspects of the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-21\">We affirm for substantially the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s April 10, 2002 Opinion and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-22\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
