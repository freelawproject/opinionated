R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b392-7\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Robert Henderson appeals pro se the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his action alleging violations of the Truth in Lending Act and state law claims against several defendants. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">The district court did not err by dismissing Henderson\u2019s claims against Visa USA, Inc., and Best Western International, Inc., under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) because there was no factual or legal basis for the claims. <em>See Ove v. Gwinn, </em>264 F.3d 817, 821 (9th Cir.2001) (complaint\u2019s allegations of material fact are \u201cconstrued in the light most favorable\u201d to the plaintiff, but \u201cconclusory allegations of law and unwarranted inferences are insufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">The district court also properly dismissed the claims against Chase Manhattan Bank, USA, N.A., Park Crest Motel, Don Kim, and Hyun Oh because Henderson\u2019s amended complaint, filed on April 26, 1999, contained no allegations against these defendants. <em>See </em>N.D. Cal. Civ. Local R. 10-1 (\u201cAny party filing or moving to file an amended pleading must reproduce the entire proposed pleading and may not incorporate any part of a prior pleading by reference.\u201d); <em>see also Jacobsen v. Filler, </em>790 F.2d 1362, 1364 (9th Cir.1986) (pro se litigants in the ordinary civil case are not excused from compliance with procedural rules). The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Henderson\u2019s motion under Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b) for relief from the orders dismissing these defendants because the motion merely reiterated arguments that the district court previously had considered and properly rejected. <em>See Maraziti v. Thorpe, </em>52 F.3d 252, 255 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-15\">Moreover, the district court properly denied Henderson\u2019s motion for disqualification pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144 because the affidavit in support of the motion relied exclusively on Judge Ware\u2019s rulings in this case. <em>See United States v. Studley, </em>783 F.2d 934, 939 (9th Cir.1986) (to provide grounds for disqualification, alleged prejudice must result from an extrajudicial source; a judge\u2019s prior adverse rulings are not sufficient cause for disqualification).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-16\">We also have reviewed Henderson\u2019s contentions that the attorneys for the defendants obstructed justice and should be suspended from practice in the district court. We find no merit to these contentions. Henderson\u2019s request for \u201crelief from cross-complaint of Best Western\u201d also is baseless because Best Western did not obtain any relief pursuant to its cross-complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-17\">Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Henderson\u2019s request for appointment of counsel because he did not show exceptional circumstances. <em>See Terrell v. Brewer, </em>935 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b392-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth'Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
