We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and review the attorney\u2019s fee award for abuse of discretion. <em>See Fischer v. SJB-P.D., Inc., </em>214 F.3d 1115, 1118 (9th Cir.2000). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-15\">The district court abused its discretion by (1) failing to award attorney\u2019s fees for the preparation of Lissner\u2019s initial motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs and (2) reducing Lissner\u2019s attorney hours and b\u00fcling rates without considering a\u00f1 of the submitted evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-16\">Lissner\u2019s initial attorney\u2019s fees motion, wh\u00fce unsuccessful, was a \u201cnecessary step to [his] ultimate victory ...\u201d and thus his fees for that motion should be included in the ultimate attorney\u2019s fee award. <em>See Cobrales v. County of Los Angeles, </em>935 F.2d 1050, 1053 (9th Cir.1991). The USCS\u2019s contention that Lissner could not have preva\u00fced in his initial attorney\u2019s fees motion because he lost the underlying summary judgment motion is misplaced. At the time Lissner brought his motion, a complainant in a FOIA action was eligible for attorney\u2019s fees if \u201che [could] prove that (1) his filing of the FOIA action was necessary to obtain the information sought and (2) the action had a \u2018substantial causitive effect\u2019 on the ultimate receipt of that information.\u201d <em>Long v. IRS, </em>932 F.2d 1309, 1313 (9th Cir.1991) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>\u201cThe mere fact that [the] defendants [had] voluntarily released documents [did] not preclude an award of attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Church of Scientology of California v. United States Postal Service, </em>700 F.2d 486, 492 (9th Cir.1983) (emphasis omitted). Even before his success on appeal, Lissner\u2019s FOIA suit caused the USCS\u2019s release of some of the information Lissner was seeking; thus, Lissner\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs was not frivolous. Because Lissner\u2019s motion was a necessary step toward his eventual victory, it should be accounted for in his attorney\u2019s fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">The district court also failed to consider all of Lissner\u2019s proffered evidence before reducing his documented attorney hours and billing rates. It found with regard to billing rates that Lissner</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZW\">presented] no evidence about the experience level of any of the attorneys or paralegals ... [,] no evidence about comparable rates for paralegals and librarians in the Los Angeles area ... [,] no evidence that the rates charged in Palo Alto, California, are comparable to rates charged in Los Angeles and no evidence that it was necessary to hire counsel from Palo Alto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The record shows, however, that Lissner submitted detailed information about the backgrounds and experience levels of all attorneys and paralegals on the case, the reasonableness of Lissner\u2019s submitted billing rates, and the generally higher rates charged in the Los Angeles area for comparable work. The evidence initially submitted with Lissner\u2019s motion was sufficient to establish the reasonableness of the rates, and his reply evidence was properly offered to respond to the USCS\u2019s claim that the rates were unreasonable. The district court\u2019s failure to review or acknowledge such evidence was an abuse of discretion. <em>Cf. In re Conejo Enter., Inc., </em>96 F.3d 346, 353-54 (9th Cir.1996). We therefore remand for the district court to reconsider the reasonableness of Lissner\u2019s claimed attorney hours and billing rates in light of <em>all </em>of the proffered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Finally, we award Lissner full attorney\u2019s fees and costs for this appeal and refer the calculation of the amount of those fees and costs to the Appellate Commissioner, who is authorized to enter judgment thereon. <em>See </em>Ninth Circuit Rule 39-1.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b367-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
