Prior to August 17, 1998, Myers was a voluntary employee with no expectation of receiving compensation. <em>See Tony &amp; Susan Alamo Found, v. Sec\u2019y of Labor, </em>471 U.S. 290, 300-01, 105 S.Ct. 1953, 85 L.Ed.2d 278 (1985). Accordingly, no genuine issue of material fact was raised regarding Myers\u2019 entitlement to back wages for that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">2. Appellants failed to make a sufficient showing regarding the \u201coff-the-clock\u201d hours they claimed to have worked. Accordingly, entry of summary judgment was appropriate on those claims. <em>See Orr v. Bank of America, </em>285 F.3d 764, 781-82 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">3. The court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Myers on her claim that she did not receive her final paycheck. Although there was some evidence that the check was issued, there was no evidence that the check was actually paid to Myers. Accordingly, no material issue of fact existed regarding the employer\u2019s failure to comply with ORS 652.140. <em>See Emery v. Portland Typewriter &amp; Office Mach., </em>86 Or.App. 635, 740 P.2d 218, 219-20 (1987) (requiring <em>payment </em>of wages upon termination).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">In turn, no evidence was presented to establish that the employer\u2019s failure was willful. Accordingly, the court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of the employer was warranted. <em>See id. </em>Neither party presented time cards to establish the number of hours to which Myers was entitled on her final paycheck. Therefore, the court was entitled to rely on Myers\u2019 undisputed testimony. <em>See Far Out Productions, Inc. v. Oskar, </em>247 F.3d 986, 997 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">4. Summary judgment in favor of the employer on the employees\u2019 claim that they worked through lunch hours without being paid was appropriate. \u201cThe plain language of Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\u201d <em>See Brother Records, Inc. v. Sardine, </em>318 F.3d 900, 908-09 (9th Cir.2003) (citation and alteration omitted). The employees\u2019 insufficient showing by way of the fabricated time cards similarly mandated entry of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">5. The court properly denied Myers\u2019 motion to reconsider the willfulness issue because Myers did not present any new evidence. <em>See Sch. Dist. No. 1J, Multnomah County v. ACandS, Inc., </em>5 F.3d 1255, 1263 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">6. The employer\u2019s obligation to document adequate recordkeeping was never triggered because Appellants did not produce sufficient evidence that they performed the work in question and were improperly compensated. <em>See Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., </em>328 U.S. 680, 687, 66 S.Ct. 1187, 90 L.Ed. 1515 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">7. The court\u2019s award of attorney fees was reasonable and within its discretion. <em>See Sorenson v. Mink, </em>239 F.3d 1140, 1144-45 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-14\">8. Appellants\u2019 request to strike the employer\u2019s introduction section of the opening brief is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-15\">The magistrate judge properly allocated the burdens of production and entered summary judgment in the absence of material questions of fact remaining for trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number><em>See Brother Records, Inc. v. Jardine, </em>318 F.3d at 908-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b869-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
