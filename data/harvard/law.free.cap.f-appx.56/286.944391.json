Evans, </em>891 F.2d 686 (8th Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>495 U.S. 931, 110 S.Ct. 2170, 109 L.Ed.2d 499 (1990). Later, in May 2002, after filing multiple unsuccessful motions for postconviction relief, Hinds brought a motion for resentencing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582, arguing a retroactive amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines prohibited using certain admissions he made at his guilty-plea hearing as \u201cstipulations\u201d for the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>determining his Guidelines range. The district court <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">On appeal, Hinds identifies Amendment 613 as the basis for his requested relief. Contrary to Hinds\u2019s viewpoint, section 3582(c)(2) does not authorize the requested relief because Amendment 613-even applied retroactively-would not have lowered Hinds\u2019s sentencing range. Amendment 613 limited the use, in sentencing, of stipulations that establish a more serious offense than the offense of conviction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.2(a) (1989) (\u201cin the case of conviction by a plea of guilty or <em>nolo con-tendere </em>containing a stipulation that specifically establishes a more serious offense than the offense of conviction, determine the offense guideline section in Chapter Two most applicable to the stipulated offense\u201d); U.S.S.G.App. C Supp. Amendment 613 (2001) (\u201cA factual statement or a stipulation contained in a plea agreement ... is a stipulation for purposes of [\u00a7 lB1.2(a) ] only if both the defendant and the government explicitly agree that the factual statement or stipulation is a stipulation for such purposes.... \u201d). There was no stipulation in Hinds\u2019s case; rather, the record shows the district court made its determinative sentencing findings over Hinds\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-8\"> The Honorable Jimm Larry Hendren, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
