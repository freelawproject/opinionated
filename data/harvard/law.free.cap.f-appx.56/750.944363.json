The district court sentenced Montez to 108 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release. His counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising for reversal the district court\u2019s drug quantity determination and refusal to grant a downward departure. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-18\">The district court did not plainly err by considering \u2014 as contemplated by the plea agreement \u2014 drug quantities from Montez\u2019s relevant conduct when determining his base offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 1B1.3 (relevant conduct includes acts and omissions \u201cthat were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction\u201d), 2D1.1, comment. (n.12) (court may consider as relevant conduct \u201cquantities of drugs not specified in the count of conviction\u201d); <em>United States v. Montanye, </em>996 F.2d 190,192 (8th Cir.1993) (standard of review). Further, the district court\u2019s discretionary refusal to depart downward is unreviewable on appeal. <em>See United States v. Lim, </em>235 F.3d 382, 385 (8th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-19\">Having found no nonfrivolous issues following our independent review of the record in accordance with <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>(1988), we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b786-14\">.
