After an administrative law judge (ALJ) conducted a hearing and issued an unfavorable decision, and after the Appeals Council denied review, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> upheld the Commissioner\u2019s final decision, giving rise to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude that the Commissioner\u2019s final decision is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. <em>See Py-land v. Apfel, </em>149 F.3d 873, 876 (8th Cir. 1998) (standard of review). In particular, we agree with the district court that, even assuming Duran\u2019s prior work as a waitress did not constitute relevant work experience, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.965(a) (2002) (after 15 years, it is no longer realistic to expect that skills and abilities acquired on job continue to apply), substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s alternative finding, based on testimony by a vocational expert (VE), that Duran could perform other jobs existing in significant numbers. <em>See Johnson v. Apfel, </em>240 F.3d 1145, 1149 (8th Cir.2001) (arguable deficiency in ALJ\u2019s opinion-writing technique does not require setting aside finding supported by substantial evidence); <em>Miller v. Shalala, </em>8 F.3d 611, 613 (8th Cir.1993) (per curiam) (VE\u2019s testimony constitutes substantial evidence if question ALJ asked included impairments ALJ accepted as true). We reject as unsupported Duran\u2019s arguments that the ALJ needed to develop the record further. <em>Cf. Shannon v. Chater, </em>54 F.3d 484, 488 (8th Cir.1995) (reversal for failure to develop record is justified only where such failure is unfair or prejudicial). Because Duran\u2019s remaining arguments are either redundant or contradicted by the record, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b790-9\">.
