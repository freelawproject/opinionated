The district court sentenced Perry to fifty-seven months imprisonment. Perry now appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Perry contends the district court erred at his sentencing hearing by admitting hearsay testimony concerning a statement made by his wife and co-conspirator, Mary Perry, to an FBI Special Agent. Perry claims the statement was not made in furtherance of the conspiracy and was therefore inadmissable hearsay. In making its factual determinations, a sentencing court may consider any reliable and relevant information, including hearsay. <em>United States v. Puckett, </em>61 F.3d 1092, 1095 (4th Cir.1995) (citing <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>881 F.2d 95, 106-07 (4th Cir.1989)). <em>See also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661; Fed.R.Evid. 1101(d). Consequently, we find Perry\u2019s claim meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">Perry contends the district court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) for his role in the offense. A district court\u2019s determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a factual finding that is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>108 F.3d 512, 518 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">Under USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), a two-level enhancement is to be given if the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of any criminal activity that did not involve five or more participants and was not otherwise extensive. We find the district court did not clearly err in its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-13\">Accordingly, we affirm Perry\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
