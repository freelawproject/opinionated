Matus argues that (1) notwithstanding his ineligibility for cancellation of removal, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii), we should reverse the BIA\u2019s decision and remand the case for consideration of an adjustment of status application and (2) that he was denied due process in his hearing before the IJ. We disagree and deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-17\">We review for an abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Watkins v. INS, </em>63 F.3d 844, 847 (9th Cir. 1995). The BIA properly denied Matus\u2019s motion to reopen because he was ineligible for an adjustment of status due to his admission that he falsely represented himself to be a citizen of the United States for a purpose or benefit under the INA. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii); <em>Pichardo v.
