Petitioner\u2019s principal argument is that he established, by sufficient evidence, past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution against him by the Chinese government for participating in pro-democracy demonstrations in 1989. Petitioner maintains that his evidence of persecution \u2014 alleging various forms of adverse employment actions and workplace tensions \u2014 established a prima facie showing of his refugee status for purposes of obtaining asylum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158. Petitioner further argues that the BIA erred as a matter of law in denying his motion to reopen the proceedings after determining that the evidence presented in support of this motion was not previously unavailable, as required by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(c)(1) (2001). We disagree with Petitioner\u2019s position in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">On direct review from the BIA, we review the BIA\u2019s findings under a \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test, <em>Melgar de Torres v. Reno, </em>191 F.3d 307, 312-13 (2d Cir.1999), and, in so doing, must pay considerable deference to the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum, <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv. v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Indeed, this Court may reverse the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum only if an applicant\u2019s evidence compels a contrary holding. <em>Id. </em>In this context, then, Petitioner must show that his evidence, in light of all credibility determinations as well as all reasonable evidentiary inferences, could only be construed as having established past persecution against him or as demonstrating a well-founded fear of future persecution based on, among other things, Petitioner\u2019s political opinions, affiliations, and activities. <em>See Zhang v. Slattery, </em>55 F.3d 732, 738 (2d Cir.1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 1176, 116 S.Ct. 1271, 134 L.Ed.2d 217 (1996) (citations omitted). This, according to the BIA, Petitioner faded to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">We agree that Petitioner failed to demonstrate that he sustained any past physical persecution, that the adverse employment actions constituted \u201ca deliberate imposition of <em>substantial </em>economic disadvantage,\u201d <em>Guan Shan Liao v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>293 F.3d 61, 70 (2d Cir.2002) (emphasis added) (quotations and internal quotation marks omitted), for purposes of establishing prior economic persecution, or that his participation and subsequent expatriation create an acute and continuing risk that he would be targeted for persecution should he return to China, <em>see Osorio v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv., 18 </em>F.3d 1017, 1031 (2d Cir.1994). Petitioner\u2019s failure to establish past persecution or to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution for purposes of asylum precludes any finding that the BIA erred in denying Petitioner\u2019s application for a withholding of deportation. <em>See Zhang, </em>55 F.3d at 738 (\u201cAn applicant who has failed to satisfy the requirements for asylum has necessarily failed to satisfy the requirements for withholding of return.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">Additionally, reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, <em>see Immigration &amp; Naturalization </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number><em>Serv. v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 322, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992), we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that the motion was not based on previously unavailable evidence, as required by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2\u00a9) (1) (2001). Evidence that Tang\u2019s wife was forced to undergo an abortion because of Tang\u2019s political activities was both previously available to Tang, and relevant to the determination of refugee status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). <em>See Matter of Chang, </em>20 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 38, 44 (BIA 1989). For the reasons stated above, the decisions of the BIA are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
