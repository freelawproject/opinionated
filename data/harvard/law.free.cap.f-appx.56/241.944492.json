The case has been referred to this panel pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. We unanimously agree that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-15\">Nelms pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiring to import cocaine, a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 963. Nelms was sentenced to 175 months of imprisonment to be followed by a four-year term of supervised release. On direct appeal, we affirmed his conviction and sentence. <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>209 F.3d 614, 615 (6th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-16\">In March 2001, Nelms filed the instant \u00a7 2255 motion, raising multiple claims for relief. The magistrate judge recommended that the district court deny Nelms\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. Over Nelms\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s findings and denied relief. The court subsequently granted Nelms a certificate of appealability on the following issue: whether defense counsel was ineffective in failing to challenge his classification as a career offender under USSG \u00a7 4B1.1 because, at the time of sentencing, the predicate offenses could have been prosecuted as misdemeanors under Ohio law.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-19\">In his timely appeal, Nelms argues that the date of federal sentencing- \u2014 -rather than the date of the predicate convictions \u2014 is when a conviction must be tested as a \u201cprior felony\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.1. Both parties have filed briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-20\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly denied Nelms\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. To establish that counsel was ineffective, Nelms must show: (1) deficiency-that counsel\u2019s performance was, under all of the circumstances, unreasonable under prevailing professional norms: and (2) prejudice-that there is a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-94, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-21\">Because Nelms was properly classified as a career offender, Nelms cannot show <em>Strickland </em>prejudice from counsel\u2019s alleged failure to investigate or challenge the counting of his prior convictions. It is not disputed that Nelms\u2019s predicate convictions (both for aggravated drug trafficking in violation of Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2925.03) were felonies at the time he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>convicted of those crimes; however, Nelms contends that the controlling factor is the state of the law of the time of federal sentencing. In this regard, \u00a7 4B1.2 (c) states that \u201cthe date that a defendant sustained a conviction shall be the date that the guilt of the defendant has been established, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of <em>nob contendere. </em>\u201d In addition, the guidelines direct that a sentencing judge must focus on the character of a <em>conviction. </em>\u00a7 4B1.2, comment, (n.3). The guidelines to not require an examination of statutory evolution. Accordingly, we conclude that the date of the predicate conviction governs the \u00a7 4B1.1 determination. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>114 F.3d 435, 445 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.
