Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981, as then in effect, the Government alleged that the funds in Clemente\u2019s account were (i) proceeds traceable to a violation of wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1348, affecting a financial institution, and (ii) property involved in a violation of the money laundering statutes, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1956, 1957. In separate Orders, the district court (1) denied Clemente\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction; (2) granted partial summary judgment to the Government with respect to approximately $24.8 million of the funds, representing the amount lost by two victims; and (3) granted partial summary judgment to the Government with respect to the remaining the funds, representing the amount lost by the other two victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Clemente challenges the denial of her motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that the civil forfeiture law has no extraterritorial application absent \u201cconduct\u201d or \u201ceffects\u201d in the United States. Clemente\u2019s argument is premised on her allegation that the only U.S. activity at issue in this case is the incidental and transient use of U.S. wires during the transfer of funds from the foreign victims\u2019 non-U.S. banks to her account, which she claims was located in London.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">The district court assumed for the purposes of the motion that Clemente accurately characterized the U.S. connection to the fraud, and held that it had subject matter jurisdiction over that part of the <em>res </em>representing the foreign victims\u2019 funds because the use of wires within the United States was sufficient to confer jurisdiction over the predicate acts of wire fraud and money laundering. Because it would have jurisdiction over the predicate acts, the court concluded that it had jurisdiction over the forfeiture claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of Clemente\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. See, e.g., Luckett v. Bure, </em>290 F.3d 493, 496 (2d Cir.2002). We agree with the district court that it had jurisdiction, but we do so on different grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">The Government presented uncontro-verted evidence that the funds in Clem-ente\u2019s account were held by Merrill Lynch in an account it maintains at Northern Trust Company in New York. The foreign victims (and the American victims) were given directions to wire the money to a Northern Trust account in New York, which was in fact Clemente\u2019s account. The funds were held by Northern Trust in New York for months. The substantial and prolonged U.S. connection to these funds, and to the underlying fraud, was significantly greater than under Clem-ente\u2019s version. Hence, we see no error in the district court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over all the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-13\">Clemente also challenges the district court\u2019s two grants of partial summary judgment to the Government. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>ment <em>de novo. See, e.g., Young v. County of Fulton, </em>160 F.3d 899, 902 (2d Cir.1998). After reviewing Clemente\u2019s arguments, we affirm for substantially the reasons given by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
