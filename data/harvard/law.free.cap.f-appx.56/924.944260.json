The SSA charged Doze with: 1) acting as an agent for a group of boarding home operators; 2) giving preferential treatment to a group of boarding home operators; and 3) failing to follow SSA procedures governing the handling of claims for benefits and claims-related matters. These charges were set out in a 46-page letter proposing Doze\u2019s removal and were supported by more than 300 documents that were provided to Doze.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-24\">The American Federation of Government Employees (\u201cAFGE\u201d or \u201cunion\u201d) filed a grievance against the SSA on Doze\u2019s behalf, and the case was referred to arbitration pursuant to the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement. Doze was rep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>resented by an AFGE representative at the six-day arbitration proceeding. On April 23, 2001, the Arbitrator issued his Opinion and Award. The Arbitrator found that removal was proper and denied the grievance, concluding that Doze had \u201csimply denied the first two charges,\u201d and that the \u201c[vjolumes of evidence, transcript and argument\u201d generated during the arbitration provided ample evidence to support a finding of misconduct warranting Doze\u2019s removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Doze timely sought review of the Arbitrator\u2019s decision pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121(f). In her informal brief, Doze contends that the Arbitrator erred by \u201cfail[ing] to take into account [whether she] act[ed] as an agent with criminal intent.\u201d In addition, Doze summarily denies the truth of several of the Arbitrator\u2019s factual conclusions, and requests a reversal of the Arbitrator\u2019s decision, reinstatement, an award of back pay, and her \u201cname cleared of any wrongdoing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">This court reviews the decisions of arbitrators in grievances affecting federal employees under the same standard of review that is applied in reviewing decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121(f); <em>Cornelius v. Nutt, </em>472 U.S. 648, 656, 105 S.Ct. 2882, 86 L.Ed.2d 515 (1985); <em>Frank v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>35 F.3d 1554, 1556 (Fed.Cir.1994). The standard applied is deferential, requiring this court to affirm the decision of the Arbitrator unless it is: \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c)(1)-(3); see <em>also Hayes v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>727 F.2d 1535, 1537 (Fed.Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">In her two-page informal brief, <em>pro se </em>Petitioner Doze contends that the Arbitrator erred by \u201cfailing] to take into account [whether she] act[ed] as an agent with criminal intent.\u201d In addition, Doze summarily denies the truth of several of the Arbitrator\u2019s factual findings, stating: \u201cI never got involved in any type of scheming. I never showed preferential treatment to the recipients or boarding home operators. Nor did I act as an agent for any boarding home operators.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">As pointed out in the SSA\u2019s informal brief, as a technical matter, Doze has failed to carry her burden by failing to proffer anything more than conclusory denials or to direct this court to any basis in the record that would support her assertions of error. <em>See Darwin Constr. Co. v. United States, </em>811 F.2d 593, 596 n.1 (Fed. Cir.1987). The SSA also notes that Doze apparently concedes that the Arbitrator applied the correct law. Accordingly, the SSA claims, Doze\u2019s assertions on appeal are subject to summary rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">Despite these defects, we choose to read Doze\u2019s <em>pro se </em>pleading liberally, and-in light of the arguments presented in the arbitration proceedings-conclude that Doze\u2019s assertion that the Arbitrator failed to take into account whether she acted \u201cas an agent with criminal intent\u201d is an attempt to reassert a legal argument asserted by Doze\u2019s union representative in the arbitration proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">In the union\u2019s written submission to the Arbitrator, it argued that under this court\u2019s holding in <em>King v. Nazelrod, </em>the SSA had charged Doze with a criminal violation and was therefore required to prove each element of that violation by a preponderance of the evidence. 43 F.3d\u2019 663, 666 (Fed.Cir.1994) (holding that \u201c[i]t would be unfair ... to permit the Agency to brand [an employee] a criminal without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>requiring it to prove the elements commonly associated with the crime\u201d). The union contended that the SSA\u2019s first charge, that Doze \u201cacted as an agent,\u201d implicated the criminal violation defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 205(a), thereby subjecting the SSA to the requirement set forth in <em>King. </em>The union further contended that the SSA had failed to demonstrate two elements of the crime of \u201cacting as an agent\u201d against the Government: criminal intent and the existence of a traditional agency relationship. Accordingly, the union asserted, charge one could not be lawfully sustained under this court\u2019s precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">In its best light, the gravamen of Doze\u2019s argument on appeal appears to be a reassertion of this argument that, absent a finding that the two disputed elements had been proven by the SSA, the Arbitrator could not lawfully sustain the first of the three charges set forth in Doze\u2019s removal letter. We, however, do not read the Arbitrator\u2019s decision to have specifically sustained charge one or based its ultimate determination that removal was appropriate on charge one. In fact, apparently responding to this very argument, the Arbitrator stated that \u201cwhatever the motive, and whether or not a technically pure agency relationship was shown to have existed, [Doze\u2019s] inappropriate actions were preferential in nature and against government policy....\u201d The Arbitrator then proceeded to find that \u201cthere were numerous repetitions of dishonest and inappropriate conduct,\u201d and that the conduct proven was of the type \u201cfor which an employee can be terminated on the first offense.\u201d Thus, without any obvious reference to charge one, and apparently relying on misconduct contained in the specifications underlying charges two and three, the Arbitrator specifically concluded that the penalty of removal was reasonable. Accordingly, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Doze has sufficiently reasserted the union\u2019s argument, and assuming, again solely for purposes of argument, that charge one sufficiently implied a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 205(a), we find no error in the Arbitrator\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">After reviewing the record on appeal, we hold that the Arbitrator\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. And, in light of the Arbitrator\u2019s findings regarding the seriousness of Doze\u2019s misconduct, we cannot conclude that the Arbitrator erred in finding removal was appropriate. Accordingly, the award of the Arbitrator is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b962-5\">. Moreover, even were we to find that the Arbitrator did erroneously sustain charge one, we note that this finding would not require a reversal of the Arbitrator's decision. <em>See, e.g. O\u2019Neill v. Dep\u2019t of Housing &amp; Urban Dev., </em>220 F.3d 1354, 1364-65 (upholding penalty of removal on the basis of other misconduct despite invalidation of a charge based on violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 205(a)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
