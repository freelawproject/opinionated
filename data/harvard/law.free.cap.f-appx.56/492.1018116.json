May opposes. May also submits a motion requesting various relief.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">May filed a complaint seeking reinstatement of unemployment benefits that were originally issued to a man now deceased. The Court of Federal Claims stated that May claimed to be the personal representative of that man. The Court of Federal Claims also stated that the Ohio Unemployment Compensation Review Commission had denied May\u2019s request for the unemployment benefits. The Court of Federal Claims dismissed May\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction, stating that its jurisdiction is limited to actions against the United States arising under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491. May appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">The United States argues that the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 judgment should be summarily affirmed. We agree. Summary disposition of a case \u201cis appropriate, <em>inter alia, </em>when the position of one party is so clearly correct as a matter of law that no substantial question regarding the outcome of the appeal exists.\u201d <em>Joshua v. United States, </em>17 F.3d 378, 380 (Fed.Cir.1994). In the present case, it is clear that summary disposition is warranted. May\u2019s complaint regarding the denial of unemployment benefits is clearly outside of the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">(1) The United States\u2019 motion for summary affirmance is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-11\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b985-9\"> May requests reconsideration of this court\u2019s October 31, 2002 order that rejected a different notice of appeal for filing and stated that \"[a]dditional appeals, petitions, and documents submitted by May will be reviewed and, if jurisdiction is lacking, the clerk may refuse to file the documents.\u201d May\u2019s motion for reconsideration is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-14\">This appeal was not rejected by the clerk, because this court has jurisdiction to review final judgments of the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
