For reversal, Hayes claims the District Court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in denying Hayes\u2019s motion for a new trial, erred by finding, after an evidentiary hearing, that Hayes knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">The District Court did not err. A defendant who does not alert the trial court that he wishes to testify when his attorney rests without calling him to the stand has waived his right to testify. <em>United States v. Bernloehr, </em>833 F.2d 749, 751-52 (8th Cir.1987). In the present case, Hayes did nothing at trial to signal the District Court that he disagreed with his trial counsel\u2019s decision to rest without Hayes\u2019s testimony. Under <em>Bemloehr, </em>Hayes is barred from claiming he was denied his right to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">Even if <em>Bemloehr </em>were not controlling, the record is replete with evidence to support a finding that Hayes was aware of, and knowingly and voluntarily waived, his right to testify. This evidence includes Hayes\u2019s previous experience with the criminal-justice system and the testimony of his trial counsel. The District Court expressly found that Hayes was not a credible witness, a finding that is not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Santos-Garcia, </em>313 F.3d 1073, 1081 (8th Cir.2002) (noting that a district court\u2019s credibility findings are virtually unreviewable on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-10\">.
