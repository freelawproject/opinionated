We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review a jury\u2019s verdict for substantial evidence, <em>Gilbrook v. City of Westminster, </em>177 F.3d 839, 856 (9th Cir.1999), and review a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, and conclusions of law de novo, <em>Kimbro v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>889 F.2d 869, 873 (9th Cir. 1989).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s determinations that national origin and age were not motivating factors in defendant\u2019s decision not to promote Pankov. Evidence presented at trial showed that Pankov was not qualified for the Operator IV position because he was not proficient in \u201cBPCS\u201d and did not have five years of experience with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Substantial evidence also supports the jury\u2019s findings that national origin and age were not motivating factors in defendant\u2019s decision not to award discretionary bonuses to Pankov. Evidence presented at trial showed that the improvements Pankov proposed or made were not significant enough to warrant a bonus.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">Substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s determination that Pankov was terminated not because of his national origin or age, or in retaliation for his complaints about alleged discriminatory treatment, but because he violated a company policy prohibiting intimidating and disruptive behavior in the workplace. The evidence showed that Pankov beame increasingly aggressive, received two warnings to avoid confrontations with co-workers, and then \u201ccompletely lost control\u201d at a meeting on November 12,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">The district court did not err by ruling for defendant on Pankov\u2019s state law claims for national origin and age discrimination because the evidence showed that defendant had nondiscriminatory reasons for denying Pankov a promotion and bonuses, and for terminating his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">We deny all pending requests for costs and fees, without prejudice to the filing of such motions in accordance with Fed. R.App. P. 38 and Ninth Circuit Rule 39-1.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b809-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
