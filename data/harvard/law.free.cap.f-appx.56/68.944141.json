Wood, <em>Judge), </em>granting the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation\u2019s (\u201cHHC\u201d) motion for summary judgment and dismissing Tanvir\u2019s claims that it discriminated and retaliated against him in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and common law. Tanvir alleged that the HHC dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>criminated against him on account of his race and national origin by transferring him to Bellevue Hospital Center and by not selecting him for various positions within the HHC. In addition, Tanvir alleged that the HHC retaliated against him for a lawsuit he filed in 1993 and for bringing the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Following discovery, the HHC moved for summary judgment. Magistrate Judge Douglas F. Eaton, to whom the matter was referred, found that, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) the HHC provided unrebutted, legitimate, non-discriminatory and non-retaliatory reasons for its actions; (2) Title VII\u2019s statute of limitations barred one of Tanvir\u2019s claims of non-promotion; (3) no rational jury could find that the HHC had improperly discriminated against Tanvir by promoting other, more-qualified candidates; (4) Tanvir failed to provide evidence that he was qualified for the positions he sought or that there was intentional racial discrimination resulting in a violation of his right to \u201cmake or enforce contracts\u201d as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981; and (5) Tanvir failed to provide evidence to support his claims of breach of contract and emotional distress. The magistrate judge recommended that the HHC\u2019s motion for summary judgment be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations in their entirety and granted the HHC summary judgment. We review grants of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>drawing all factual inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Harris v. Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>310 F.3d 73, 78 (2d Cir.2002). After such a review of the record, we AFFIRM for substantially the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
