Cole was observed driving in a stolen Ford Thunderbird with the lights off. Police pursued Cole, who fled first in the car, then on foot, but was apprehended. Cole was tried, found guilty by a jury, and the Nebraska Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction. Cole unsuccessfully filed two pro se petitions for postconviction relief in State court. The Nebraska Court of Appeals summarily affirmed the lower court\u2019s denial of relief in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">Cole then petitioned the federal district court for habeas relief on many claims. The district court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> denied the petition but granted a certificate of appealability on one narrow issue: whether fraudulent intent is a material element of the offense of theft by receiving stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">Nebraska law defines theft by receiving stolen property as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-10\">A person commits theft if he receives, retains, or disposes of stolen movable property of another knowing that it has been stolen, or believing that it has been stolen, unless the property is received, retained, or disposed with intention to restore it to the owner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">Neb.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 28-517 (Michie 1995). Cole argues the State must prove as an element of the offense that Cole did not intend to restore the car to its owner, and the State failed to do so at trial. Cole raised this issue before the state court in pro se filings but Cole\u2019s counsel did not include this issue in any filings presented to the state courts. The State argues this is a question of Nebraska state law, and federal courts reviewing habeas petitions are limited to deciding whether the conviction violated clearly established Federal law. The State also contends that Cole did not raise a federal claim about the element of the offense in state court so the claim is procedurally defaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-14\">Habeas review is a limited inquiry. We may grant habeas relief only when the decision of a state court is contrary to or involves an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) (2000). \u201cA state court decision is \u2018contrary to\u2019 clearly established federal law if the rule applied by the state court directly contradicts Supreme Court precedent or if the state court has reached a result opposite to a result reached by the Supreme Court on \u2018materially indistinguishable\u2019 facts.\u201d <em>Johnston v. Luebbers, </em>288 F.3d 1048, 1051 (8th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 405, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring)). We do not review questions of state law in habeas proceedings. <em>Lee v. Gammon, </em>222 F.3d 441, 443 (8th Cir.2000); <em>Woods v. Solem, </em>891 F.2d 196,199 (8th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-15\">To prevail, Cole cannot argue only that Nebraska law requires proof of fraudulent intent as a material element of theft by receiving stolen property, but also must argue that the state prosecutor\u2019s failure to prove this material element denied Cole due process. <em>Woods, </em>891 F.2d at 199. The State argues that this claim is procedurally defaulted because the fraudulent intent issue was raised pro se, not by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>counsel, and because it was not raised in proper due process trappings. We disagree. The record indicates that Cole has been advocating this fraudulent element of the offense claim since before his trial. Cole repeatedly requested appointment of counsel who would argue his theory of the case. Although many attorneys were appointed, and excused, none raised Cole\u2019s claim. When counsel refused to raise it on appeal, Cole submitted supplemental pro se briefs. Cole has done all he can to place the issue before the courts. <em>Clem-mons v. Delo, </em>124 F.3d 944, 948 (8th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Procedural problems aside, we cannot review Cole\u2019s claim because, at its root, the claim presents a question of state law. Repackaging the claim in due process wrapping does not transform a state law issue into a federal claim. <em>Carson v. Dir. of the Iowa Dep\u2019t of Corr. Servs., </em>150 F.3d 973, 975 (8th Cir.1998). \u201c \u2018[T]he Supreme Court has made it clear that the states define the elements of state offenses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 976 (quoting <em>Johnson v. Rosemeyer, </em>117 F.3d 104, 110 (3d Cir.1997)). There is no Constitutional reason why a state offense must include particular elements. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">This case presents a good example of why federal courts do not decide questions of state law in habeas proceedings. Cole\u2019s argument rests on the plain language of the statute, specifically the clause excepting receiving stolen property with the intention of returning it to its rightful owner. Cole cited no Nebraska case defining the elements of the crime of theft by receipt of stolen property. The State explains that Nebraska law did require proof of fraudulent intent in earlier years. <em>See, e.g., State v. Dinverno, </em>205 Neb. 775, 290 N.W.2d 203, 204 (1980) (explaining elements of theft by receiving stolen property include receipt of the property, knowing it to be stolen, and intent to defraud the owner according to the 1943 statute); <em>Goldsberry v. State, </em>66 Neb. 312, 92 N.W. 906, 907 (1902) (including fraudulent intent as an element of the offense). Nebraska adopted the model penal code approach in 1977. The State argues that Nebraska law abandoned the fraudulent intent construction in favor of the guilty knowledge formulation in the model penal code. Under the guilty knowledge formulation, the defendant must know the property is stolen to have guilty knowledge. Recent Nebraska case law does speak in terms of guilty knowledge. <em>State v. LaFreniere, </em>240 Neb. 258, 481 N.W.2d 412, 414 (1992) (defining the central focus of the crime as the accused\u2019s knowledge or belief); <em>State v. Nuss, </em>235 Neb. 107, 454 N.W.2d 482, 484 (1990) (defining the element of intent as guilty knowledge); <em>State v. Jones, </em>230 Neb. 968, 434 N.W.2d 333, 335-36 (1989) (accused\u2019s admission the property was not his goes to the requisite guilty knowledge for the offense). Under the State\u2019s argument, the clause Cole relies on provides an affirmative defense for persons who receive or retain stolen property with the honorable intentions of returning it, but the clause does not form an element of the offense. <em>See State v. Lopez, </em>109 N.M. 578, 787 P.2d 1261, 1264 (1990) (holding under model penal code intent to restore stolen property to the owner is an affirmative defense). Like Cole, the State cites no Nebraska case stating the precise elements of theft by receiving stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Cole asserts counsel\u2019s failure to raise the fraudulent intent claim in state court was ineffective assistance. This issue is beyond the scope of the certificate of appeal-ability. Cole has not moved to expand the certificate, thus we decline to consider whether any of Cole\u2019s numerous attorneys provided ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>Cole\u2019s petition does not present a debatable issue of federal law; thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b779-12\"> The Honorable Richard G.
