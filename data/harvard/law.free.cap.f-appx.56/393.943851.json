David Special Commitment Ctr., </em>158 F.3d 1035, 1037 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">We decide this case in light of the state\u2019s repeated and documented failures to rectify the constitutional shortcomings of its civil commitment facilities for sex offenders. Against this backdrop, the district court acted within its discretion when it relied upon the opinion of the court-appointed expert, and required the siting of a \u201cless restrictive alternative\u201d facility at a location other than McNeil Island. <em>See Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 </em>U.S. 307, 322-23, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982). The district court\u2019s ruling did not unduly interfere with the internal operation of the state\u2019s facilities. <em>See id. </em>at 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b430-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
