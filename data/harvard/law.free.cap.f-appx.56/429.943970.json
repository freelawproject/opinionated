To the contrary, it is clear from the complaint that Gallik was attempting to argue that the APA provided an independent basis for subject matter jurisdiction over her <em>retaliation </em>claim. This passing reference to the APA thus does not remedy the absence of non-retaliation claims in Gallik\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-23\">To the extent that Gallik\u2019s appeal seeks to raise non-retaliation claims that were not raised with the district court, her effort is unavailing. This court has repeatedly held that issues not raised below are waived on appeal. <em>E.g., Int\u2019l Union of Bricklayers Allied Craftsman v. Martin Jaska, Inc., </em>752 F.2d 1401, 1404 (9th Cir. 1985) (\u201cWe will not ... review an issue not raised below unless necessary to prevent manifest injustice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-24\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b465-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b465-20\">. Gallik does not dispute that, to the extent her claims rest solely on allegations of whist-leblowing retaliation, the district court properly dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The parties agree that Gallik was an employee covered by the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101 <em>et seq. </em>(2000). Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1221(a), an employee who was retaliated against by her employer for whistleblowing activities, \"may ... seek corrective action from the Merit Systems Protection Board\u2019\u2019 (MSPB). Judicial review of whistleblowing claims is only permitted pursuant to an order from the MSPB. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1221(h).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
