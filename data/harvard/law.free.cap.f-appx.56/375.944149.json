Proctor seeks to challenge his Nevada state convictions and sentence for burglary and being an ex-felon in possession of a firearm and sentence. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. Reviewing de novo, <em>see Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Proctor contends that his constitutional rights were violated when the prosecutor and Proctor\u2019s trial counsel allegedly tampered with witnesses. Proctor also claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Proctor\u2019s state petition did not adequately describe the operative facts and federal legal theory underlying his habeas claims, so as to give the state courts a fair opportunity to consider them. Therefore, his claims are unexhausted. <em>Kelly v. Small, </em>315 F.3d 1063, 1066 (9th Cir.2003) (as amended); <em>Duncan v. Henry, </em>513 U.S. 364, 365, 115 S.Ct. 887, 130 L.Ed.2d 865 (1995) (per curiam) (holding that to satisfy the exhaustion requirement of \u00a7 2254, a petitioner must fairly present federal claims to the state courts by identifying them as such, in order to give the state the opportunity to pass upon and correct alleged violations of its prisoners\u2019 federal rights). Proctor\u2019s claims were not \u201cfairly presented\u201d to the state court since his petition failed to include either a sufficient description of how the prosecuting attorney and defense counsel allegedly threatened defense witnesses, or any facts supporting his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">We conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing Proctor\u2019s habeas petition for failure to exhaust, because he failed to provide the state courts a fair opportunity to act on his federal claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b412-13\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b412-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b412-10\">. We decline to review Proctor's claim regarding the state court\u2019s failure to hold an evidentiary hearing because it is not encompassed in the certificate of appealability.
