See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b850-24\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-25\">We reverse the district court\u2019s affir-mance of the Social Security Administration\u2019s denial of appellant Janice An-dreyka\u2019s application for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits. Where, as here, a Social Security claimant\u2019s testimony is medically supported, an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) may reject that testimony \u201conly by offering specific, clear and convincing reasons for doing so. The clear and convincing standard is the most demanding required in Social Security cases.\u201d <em>Moore v. Comm\u2019r of the Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>278 F.3d 920, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>924 (9th Cir.2002). The ALJ\u2019s reasons for discounting Andreyka\u2019s testimony fail to meet this strict standard. We therefore accept Andreyka\u2019s testimony as true. <em>Varney v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>859 F.2d 1396, 1398-99 (9th Cir.1988). Because it is undisputed that Andreyka\u2019s testimony, if fully credited, would compel the conclusion that she is disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act, we remand for an immediate award of benefits for the closed period from June 13, 1996, to August 26, 1999. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b850-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b851-6\">O\u2019SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A6b\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">I must respectfully dissent from the decision to reverse the district court and to award disability benefits. The Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny benefits may be overturned \u201conly if it is not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Morgan v. Apfel, </em>169 F.3d 595, 599 (9th Cir.1999). Substantial evidence means \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where the evidence is susceptible to more than one rational interpretation, it is the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that must be upheld. <em>Id.; Andrews v. Shalala, </em>53 F.3d 1035, 1041 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">In this case, the ALJ rejected Andrey-ka\u2019s complaints of debilitating diarrhea. To do so, the ALJ must provide \u201cspecific, cogent reasons for the disbelief.\u201d <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 834 (9th Cir.1995). \u201c[T]he Commissioner\u2019s reasons for rejecting the claimant\u2019s testimony must be clear and convincing.\u201d <em>Morgan, </em>169 F.3d at 599. The reasons the ALJ provided for rejecting Andreyka\u2019s testimony were (1) her numerous daily activities were inconsistent with her testimony of debilitating disability; (2) there were two prior inconsistent statements on the record; (3) the claimant\u2019s behavior during the hearing was inconsistent with her claim; (4) the claimant\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with the documentary medical evidence; and (5) the fact the claimant was willing to be transferred by her employer to another job, and the fact the claimant worked in antiques, supports an inference that she fabricated her testimony and in fact had the residual capacity to perform sedentary work.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">Taken as a whole, the ALJ provided specific and legitimate reasons for rejecting Andreyka\u2019s testimony. We have upheld decisions to reject claimant testimony based on less substantial reasons than these. <em>See e.g., Rollins v. Massanari, </em>261 F.3d 853, 857 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Morgan, </em>169 F.3d at 599-600; <em>Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 604 n. 5 (9th Cir.1989). \u201cIt may well be that a different judge, evaluating the same evidence, would have found [the] allegations ... credible.\u201d <em>Fair, </em>885 F.2d at 604. This administrative law judge did not. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
