(\u201cAllstate\u201d). The Plummers sued Allstate for breach of contract and related torts in connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>with property damage to their home, caused by the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The district court determined that the Plummers\u2019 contract claim was time-barred by the one-year limitations provision in their homeowners insurance policy with Allstate. The Plummers\u2019 tort claims also failed because they were considered to be dependent causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">On January 1, 2001, after summary judgment in this case but while this appeal was pending, California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) \u00a7 340.9 became effective. CCP \u00a7 340.9 revived all time-barred insurance claims for damages arising out of the Northridge earthquake so long as, inter alia, the insured contacted her insurer pri- or to January 1, 2000 and the insured\u2019s claim had not been litigated to finality. Because the Plummers have satisfied the conditions for revival of their claims under CCP \u00a7 340.9, and in light of our decision in <em>Campanelli v. Allstate Life Ins. Co., </em>322 F.3d 1086 (9th Cir.2003), we reverse and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with <em>Campanelli.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b879-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
