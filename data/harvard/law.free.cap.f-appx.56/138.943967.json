Getahun contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Board improperly applied the asylum standard in assessing this claim and faded to give proper weight to relevant country conditions in finding that she failed to establish a prima facie case that it is more likely than not she would suffer torture if she returned to Ethiopia. We have reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s decision. We conclude that the Board applied the correct standard in evaluating Getahun\u2019s claim, and did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen. <em>See Stewart v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 595 (4th Cir.1999); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
