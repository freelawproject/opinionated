Defendant filed a motion to suppress \u201call evidence seized as a result of a traffic stop which occurred in southwestern New Mexico on December 22, 2000,\u201d which evidence, according to the defendant, \u201cwas seized subsequent to an illegal investigatory stop conducted by agents of the government.\u201d An evidentiary hearing was held on the motion to suppress, at which time Pierre E. St. Aude, an agent of the United States Border Patrol, testified at length, and the defendant testified briefly. After the hearing, the district court denied the motion to suppress, the district court concluding, <em>inter alia, </em>that the agent had an \u201cobjective and particularized basis to stop the vehicle\u201d in which the defendant was riding as a passenger. In so doing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>the district court enumerated the various \u201cfacts\u201d which it relied on to reach its conclusion. The defendant thereafter pled guilty to both counts in the indictment, retaining his right to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to suppress. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2). The defendant was later sentenced to imprisonment for 60 months on each count, the sentences to be served concurrently, and a term of supervised release of four years. Defendant appeals and contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">As above stated, the district court in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress concluded that the Border Patrol agent \u201chad an objective and particularized basis to stop the vehicle.\u201d The vehicle, incidentally, was a blue Chevy pickup truck, and the search of that vehicle disclosed 235 pounds of marijuana in burlap bags which were covered by bales of hay. As also stated, the defendant was a passenger in the vehicle, which was being driven by Daniel James Eddy.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, we accept the district court\u2019s findings of fact, unless they are clearly erroneous, but the ultimate determination of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is a conclusion of law which we review <em>de novo. United States v. McKissick, </em>204 F.3d 1282, 1296 (10th Cir.2000), <em>United States v. Long, </em>176 F.3d 1304,1307 (10th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">The issue in this case is whether the agent had an objectively reasonable suspicion that the persons in the blue Chevy pickup truck were engaged in criminal activity. If the agent had such a suspicion, the stop of the other vehicle, assuming there was a \u201cstop,\u201d was lawful. In this regard, in <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981), the Supreme Court spoke as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-12\">Courts have used a variety of terms to capture the elusive concept of what cause is sufficient to authorize police to stop a person. Terms like \u201carticulable reasons\u201d and \u201cfounded suspicion\u201d are not self-defining; they fall short of providing clear guidance dispositive of the myriad factual situations that arise. But the essence of all that has been written is that the totality of the circumstances \u2014 the whole picture \u2014 must be taken into account. Based upon that whole picture the detaining officers must have a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-13\">The district court, in the instant case, in its order listed all of the \u201cfacts\u201d which it believed constituted \u201can objective and particularized basis to stop the vehicle.\u201d We do not deem it necessary to repeat here the \u201cfacts\u201d which the court relied on. The parties in their respective briefs have itemized these facts with considerable particularity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Our study of the record indicates that the district court did not err in its conclusion that the \u201cstop\u201d of the vehicle was \u201creasonable\u201d and therefore not \u201cunreasonable\u201d and prohibited by the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-14\">The present case is, in some respects, quite similar to the recent case of <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002). In that case, the Supreme Court held that, though \u201ceach act,\u201d of a series of acts, was \u201cperhaps innocent in itself,\u201d that \u201ctaken togeth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>er, they warranted further investigation,\u201d and rejected any \u201cdivide-and-conquer analysis.\u201d In <em>Arvizu, </em>the Supreme Court reemphasized that in determining whether there is objectively reasonable suspicion to make an investigatory stop of a vehicle, the totality of the facts and circumstances should be considered, not individual facts viewed in isolation, one from others.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">It is on this basis that we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. Such being the case, we do not deem it necessary to consider whether the agent, who was driving a marked vehicle, actually stopped the Chevy pickup, or whether the driver thereof voluntarily stopped his own vehicle on the shoulder of the road and that the agent simply drove up behind the truck and, at that point in time, turned on his overhead lights.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b949-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b950-7\">. This case had its origin when the Border Patrol received information from a reliable informant, a local rancher, that a pickup truck with which he, the informant, was not familiar had been traveling on highway 338, in an isolated area, with bales of hay in the rear of the truck. Agent St. Aude was dispatched to investigate the matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
