Curtis contends First Preston Management Corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>erred by denying her application for an occupied conveyance. We find First Preston\u2019s denial of Curtis\u2019 application for an occupied conveyance was not \u201cplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u201d <em>Auer v. Robbins, </em>519 U.S. 452, 461, 117 S.Ct. 905, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). Curtis also contends the district court erred by granting summary judgment to Principal Residential Mortgage Corporation prior to her receiving notice of the motion. We find any error harmless. <em>See Fender v. General Elec. Co., </em>380 F.2d 150, 152 (4th Cir. 1967) (concluding that district court\u2019s consideration of summary judgment before counter-affidavits were due was harmless error because, among other reasons, there was \u201cno material surprise,\u201d and Fender did not contradict General Electric\u2019s proof); <em>see also Powell v. United States, </em>849 F.2d 1576, 1580 (5th Cir.1988) (applying a harmless-error analysis to a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment sua sponte without ten-day notice); <em>Harrington v. Vandalia-Butler Bd. of Educ., </em>649 F.2d 434, 436-37 (6th Cir.1981) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s final order. Having granted the Appellees\u2019 motion to submit the case on briefs, we dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
