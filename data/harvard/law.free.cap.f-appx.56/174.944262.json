Copley appeals from the district court\u2019s order accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and dismissing his action in which he sought recovery of damages from the former trustee of his bankruptcy estate, counsel for the trustee, and the trustee\u2019s bonding company. We have reviewed the record and the opinion of the district court and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Copley v. Holbrook, </em>No. CA-01-782-3 (S.D.W.Va. Sept. 26, 2002). We deny Copley\u2019s motions to supplement the record and for correction of the bankruptcy court\u2019s docket sheet and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
