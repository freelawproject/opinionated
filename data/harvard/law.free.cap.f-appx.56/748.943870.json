The district court found that Conrod had failed to state a constitutional claim. Having reviewed the record de novo, <em>see Cooper v. Schriro, </em>189 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1999) (per curiam), we conclude dismissal of Conrod\u2019s constitutional claims was proper. We believe, however, that Conrod sufficiently stated a Privacy Act claim against the Bureau of Prisons, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a; <em>Sellers v. Bureau of Prisons, </em>959 F.2d 307, 312 (D.C.Cir.1992) (if agency willfully or intentionally makes adverse determination based on records that are not maintained with \u201csuch accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary,\u201d agency will be liable for money damages), and that this claim warrants remand for service of process. On remand Conrod should be given the opportunity to amend his complaint to include a tort claim: his filings indicate he may have been attempting to present such a claim, and a letter attached to his complaint suggests that he has exhausted his administrative remedies under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2671-2680. Accordingly, we affirm in part and remand for further proceedings. We deny Conrod\u2019s pending motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
