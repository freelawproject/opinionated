Guinyard is currently serving a sentence for his 1998 conviction in New York state court on counts of robbery in the second degree and reckless endangerment in the first degree. The district court granted a certif\u00edcate of appealability only as to Guinyard\u2019s argument that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to assure an alert jury, a claim premised on a brief interruption of the jury charge in which the judge paused to ask:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">Everybody is awake here? Let me see. We have somebody who is \u2014 -wake up. All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">Tr. at 1471. The trial proceedings then resumed without objection or discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>See Ryan v. Miller, </em>303 F.3d 231, 245 (2d Cir.2002). We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>See Morris v. Reynolds, </em>264 F.3d 38, 45 (2d Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 2381, 153 L.Ed.2d 199 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-14\">1. Guinyard raised an ineffective assistance claim and a sleeping juror claim in state court, but he may not have raised the former based on the latter, as he does here. It is therefore unclear whether he actually exhausted his claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1). The district court found, however, that \u201cthe State, through counsel, expressly waive[d] the [exhaustion] requirement\u201d by stipulating to its satisfaction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(3); <em>Clark v. Bennet, </em>No. 98-CV-1445 (FB), 1999 WL 360205, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. May 28, 1999) (\u201c[although the ineffective assistance of counsel claim ... may still be raised in a proper collateral attack, and therefore is not exhausted, the government has explicitly waived the exhaustion requirement\u201d); <em>cf. Lurie v. Wittner, </em>228 F.3d 113, 123 (2d Cir.2000) (declining to find express waiver because counsel\u2019s statement in the district court was ambiguous), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>532 U.S. 943, 121 S.Ct. 1404,149 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-16\">2. It is also unclear whether the specific claim Guinyard presents in this appeal was \u201cadjudicated on the merits\u201d in state court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Nonetheless, \u201cwe decline to decide whether the petitioner\u2019s federal claim was \u2018adjudicated on the merits\u2019 within the meaning of AEDPA, because under either AEDPA or a <em>de novo </em>standard of review, we must affirm the denial of his application for habeas corpus relief.\u201d <em>Washington v. Schriver, </em>255 F.3d 45, 48 (2d Cir.2001). That is, Guinyard\u2019s ineffective assistance claim based on the allegedly sleeping juror fails even under <em>de novo </em>review.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-17\">3. In order to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner must show that (1) \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance was deficient,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>it \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe deficient performance prejudiced the defense,\u201d meaning \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 694,104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-18\">Guinyard cannot establish that his lawyer\u2019s performance was deficient on this score. As the district court noted, there is no proof that any juror was asleep, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>opposed to daydreaming or concentrating with eyes shut. <em>Guinyard v. Keane, </em>No. 00 CV 684(JBW), 2002 WL 459923, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 27, 2002). And there is no reason to believe trial counsel failed unreasonably to observe something amiss in the jury box.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Moreover, even if trial counsel saw a distracted juror, it was among the objectively reasonable strategic choices for counsel to forgo an objection. The juror in question may have been one that defense counsel favored and wanted to keep. Or counsel may have concluded that pursuing the matter would have been fruitless, since the trial court had discretion to decide how to remedy such a problem and had already called the jurors to attention. <em>See People v. Marks, </em>225 A.D.2d 1087, 639 N.Y.S.2d 196, 196 (4th Dep\u2019t 1996) (holding court \u201cdid not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion to discharge a juror defense counsel believed had been asleep for portions of the trial\u201d); <em>People v. Jones, </em>213 A.D.2d 250, 623 N.Y.S.2d 868, 869 (1st Dep\u2019t 1995). Or counsel may have wished to avoid annoying the jury during the critical final stages of trial. As the district court found, trial counsel adequately protected Guinyard\u2019s rights when necessary throughout the proceeding. 2002 WL 459923, at *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">4. Because Guinyard cannot establish that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, there is no need to remand for an evidentiary hearing on possible prejudice. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 700 (\u201cFailure to make the required showing of <em>either </em>deficient performance or sufficient prejudice defeats the ineffectiveness claim.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
