DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b555-11\">No. 01-7189.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b555-12\">United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b555-13\">Filed March 10, 2003.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b555-15\">Before GINSBURG, Chief Judge, and SENTELLE and RANDOLPH, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b555-16\">\n<em>JUDGMENT</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b555-17\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b555-18\">This appeal was considered on the record from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and on the briefs of the parties. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b555-19\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s orders granting the District of Columbia\u2019s motions to dismiss and for summary judgment be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-20\">Even if we assume that Sakote\u2019s claim for \u201cunconstitutional retaliation\u201d based upon his allegedly protected complaints about his supervisor would support individual liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the district court was correct to conclude that Sakote failed to raise a genuine issue of fact concerning the existence of a custom of unconstitutional behavior by the District. <em>See Monell v. Dept. of Social Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 690-91, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). The three other complaints upon which Sakote relied, whatever their merit, did not show sufficiently widespread conduct to impute knowing violation of or deliberate indifference to his rights by the District. <em>Cf. Canton v. Harris, </em>489 U.S. 378, 390 n. 10,109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (\u201cIt could ... be that [municipal employees], in exercising their discretion, so often violate constitutional rights that the need for further training must have been plainly obvious to the city policymakers, who, nevertheless, are \u2018deliberately indifferent\u2019 to the need\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-23\">The district court also correctly dismissed Sakote\u2019s claims for retaliation under the federal and D.C. false claims acts because Sakote was not \u201cinvestigating matters that \u2018reasonably could [have] le[d]\u2019 to a viable False Claims Act case.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Yesudian v. Howard Univ., </em>153 F.3d 731, 740 (D.C.Cir.1998). The supervisor\u2019s alleged attempt to bilk Sakote out of a portion of his paycheck would not constitute a kickback scheme involving government funds and actionable under the False Claims Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-24\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
