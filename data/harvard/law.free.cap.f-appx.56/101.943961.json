R.C., in a 72 count Second Amended Complaint, alleged violations of his rights under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the due process and equal protection clauses of the Constitution fo the United States. He brought his claims both directly and under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985. Because R.C. was an older high school student when he filed suit in 1994 (and is now a 29 year old man), he has limited the relief he seeks under the plethora of statutes he invokes to compensatory and punitive damages. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The parties and the District Court are intimately familiar with the lengthy history of this case, a history that began in the late-1980\u2019s and culminated in the decision of the District Court we are now called upon to review. It would, therefore, serve no useful purpose to summarize that history or the numerous ways in which R.C. alleges that error was committed. Suffice it to say, we have reviewed with great care the extensive record in this case, the decision of the District Court, and the contentions of the parties on appeal. Our review convinces us that for substantially the reasons set forth by the District court in its oral opinion of June 26, 2000 and Order of June 29, 2000, the Order of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
