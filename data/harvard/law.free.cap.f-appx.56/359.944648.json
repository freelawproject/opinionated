We have jurisdiction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482(a). We review de novo the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Tax Court\u2019s legal conclusions, and review for clear error its findings of fact. <em>Baizer v. Comm\u2019r, </em>204 F.3d 1231, 1233-34 (9th Cir.2000). We review for abuse of discretion the Tax Court\u2019s imposition of sanctions. <em>Wolf v. Comm\u2019r, </em>4 F.3d 709, 716 (9th Cir.1993). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">The Tax Court correctly concluded that Hromiko received taxable earnings for the years 1994 through 1997 that he assigned to a trust to avoid paying tax. <em>See Zmuda v. Comm\u2019r, </em>731 F.2d 1417, 1420-21 (9th Cir.1984). The Tax Court did not clearly err in upholding penalties for failure to file returns and failure to pay estimated tax. <em>See Henry v. Comm\u2019r, </em>170 F.3d 1217, 1219 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The Tax Court did not abuse its discretion when it imposed a $12,500 sanction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6673(a) on the grounds that Hromiko\u2019s positions were frivolous and he instituted this action primarily for delay. <em>See Olson v. United States, </em>760 F.2d 1003, 1005 (9th Cir.1985) (\u201cThis court has repeatedly rejected the argument that wages are not income as frivolous.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The Tax Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Hromiko\u2019s motion to withdraw deemed admissions, as Hromiko failed to respond to propounded admissions even after receiving an extension of time to respond. <em>See Hadley v. United States </em>45 F.3d 1345, 1348 (9th Cir.1995) (construing Fed.R.Civ.P. 36(b), which is analogous to Tax Ct. R. 90(f)).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Hromiko\u2019s remaining contention regarding the appellate process also lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b395-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
