We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Where, as here, the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision but also engages in its own review of the record, we review both the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s decisions for substantial evidence. <em>See De Leon-Barrios v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 391, 393 (9th Cir.1997). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">We lack jurisdiction to consider petitioners\u2019 contention that the IJ improperly limited Dr. Peck\u2019s testimony and interfered with their right to present evidence because this issue was not raised before the BIA. <em>See Cortez-Acosta v. INS, </em>234 F.3d 476, 480 (9th Cir.2000) (stating that this court lacks jurisdiction to consider due process challenges based on correctable procedural errors not raised before the BIA) (citing <em>Vargas v. INS, </em>831 F.2d 906, 907-08 (9th Cir.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by adopting the IJ\u2019s decision because the addition of case citations not included in the IJ\u2019s decision demonstrates that the BIA gave individualized consideration to petitioners\u2019 case. <em>See Larita-Martinez v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1092, 1096 (9th Cir.2000) (finding the addition of case law not cited by the IJ indicates that the BIA conducted an independent review).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b836-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
