We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h), precludes any discretionary waiver of deportation by the Attorney General for \u201can alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if ... since the date of such admission, the alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony.\u201d Salvador\u2019s argument that the Immigration Judge violated his due process rights by not advising him that he could apply for relief under \u00a7 212(h) has no merit. The record reflects that Salvador was convicted of three counts of child sexual abuse, an aggravated felony. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A) (defining \u201caggravated felony\u201d to include \u201cmurder, rape, or sexual abuse of a minor.\u201d). Since he was not eligible for a discretionary waiver, the Immigration Judge\u2019s failure to advise him that he could apply for one was not a constitutional defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">The holding of <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), is inapplicable to Salvador\u2019s situation. In <em>St. Cyr, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u00a7 212(c) relief remained available for aliens, like St. Cyr, whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who would have been eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect. Salvador is not similarly situated to St. Cyr in particular since his convictions were obtained by a jury verdict, not a plea agreement. As such, \u201c[t]he factors that militated in favor of St. Cyr \u2014 his \u2018settled expectations\u2019 based on \u2018transactions or considerations already past\u2019 \u2014 are not present [here].\u201d <em>Jimenez-Angeles v. Ashcroft, </em>291 F.3d 594, 602 (9th Cir.2002). Unlike St. Cyr, who gave up valuable rights and preserved others when entering into a plea agreement with the government, Salvador\u2019s convictions imposed upon him all the legal liabilities stemming from those convictions. Accordingly, there is no compelling factor preventing the retroactive application of the IIRIRA rules foreclosing the Attorney General\u2019s discretion to waive his deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">Finally, Salvador\u2019s equal protection argument is foreclosed by our holding in <em>Taniguchi v. Schultz, </em>303 F.3d 950, 957-58 (9th Cir.2002) (rational basis exists for denying the \u00a7 212(h) waiver to aggravated felon lawful permanent residents but not to other aliens).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b807-8\">.
