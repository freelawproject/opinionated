Bronson argues that the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) engaged in abusive conduct that exhibited improper bias against her. The magistrate judge acknowledged that \u201c[throughout the course of the hearing, the ALJ repeatedly insulted and belittled plaintiffs counsel with sarcastic and degrading remarks\u201d and that the \u201cALJ\u2019s actions appear to have been unnecessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-22\">Generally, we presume that an ALJ is unbiased. <em>Rollins v. Massanari, </em>261 F.3d 853, 857-58 (9th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Verduzco v. Apfel, </em>188 F.3d 1087, 1089 (9th Cir.1999)). While \u201c \u2018expressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance, and even anger\u2019 \u201d by themselves \u201cdo not establish bias,\u201d <em>Rollins, </em>261 F.3d at 858 (quoting <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555-56,114 S.Ct. 1147,127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994)), a claimant may rebut the presumption that an ALJ is unbiased if he shows that \u201cthe ALJ\u2019s behavior, in the context of the whole case, was \u2018so extreme as to display clear inability to render fair judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Liteky, </em>510 U.S. at 551); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.940.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-23\">In Bronson\u2019s hearing, the ALJ directed his abuse primarily at her counsel. He frequently demonstrated a bitter impatience towards Bronson\u2019s counsel, constantly interrupting her direct examination of Bronson and cross-examination of the vocational expert. The manner in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>the ALJ conducted himself with Bronson\u2019s counsel \u2014 constantly berating her<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and questioning her competence in front of her client \u2014 constituted bias such that in this context Bronson had no chance for a full and fair hearing. The ALJ\u2019s hostility towards Bronson\u2019s counsel was so severe and pervasive that it colored the entire hearing with bias. <em>Cf. Rollins, </em>261 F.3d at 858. Because the ALJ failed to provide Bronson with a full and fair hearing, we REMAND to the Commissioner for a new hearing before a different ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-18\">.
