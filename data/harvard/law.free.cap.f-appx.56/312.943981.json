We review de novo whether a person is \u201cin custody\u201d for <em>Miranda </em>purposes, but review factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Kim, </em>292 F.3d 969, 973 (9th Cir.2002). The district court properly concluded that Glover was not subjected to a custodial interrogation in light of the totality of the circumstances: he was not summoned by law enforcement; not confronted with evidence of guilt; was in familiar physical surroundings; made admissions within about ten minutes of questioning; and was not physically restrained, handcuffed, or threatened with firearms. <em>See United States v. Hayden, </em>260 F.3d 1062, 1066 (9th Cir.2001) (affirming denial of suppression, outlining relevant factors for \u201cin custody\u201d determination), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1151, 122 S.Ct. 1117,151 L.Ed.2d 1011 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b349-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
