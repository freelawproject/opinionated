Hall, District Judge) denying its motion for a new trial pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. (\u201cRule\u201d) 59. In August 1999, plaintiff filed a complaint alleging violations of the Lan-ham Act (unfair competition, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a), trademark infringement, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114, and trademark dilution, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(c)), the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (\u201cCUTPA\u201d), <em>Conn. GenStat, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 42-110a, <em>et seq., </em>and Connecticut common law (unfair competition, false designation of origin, and trademark infringement and dilution). Defendant Newport Corporation filed a counterclaim for violation of the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (\u201cACPA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(d)(1). After an eleven-day jury trial, the jury found for defendant on all of plaintiffs claims, and for plaintiff on the ACPA claim. Plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial, challenging the jury verdicts with respect to all of the Lanham Act claims, the common law trademark infringement claim, and the CUTPA claim. The district court denied the motion in its entirety. On appeal, plaintiff challenges the district court\u2019s decision with respect to the Lanham Act and common law infringement claims, and the CUTPA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-14\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 59 motion for abuse of discretion, except when the motion was \u201cmade on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, [in which case] such a ruling is not renewable on appeal.\u201d <em>See Baker v. Dorfman, </em>239 F.3d 415, 422 (2d Cir.2000). Plaintiff challenges the district court\u2019s denial of the Rule 59 motion on several grounds. To resolve this appeal, we need only consider one of plaintiffs contentions: That the jury\u2019s verdict with respect to \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d should be disregarded due to several errors at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>After instructing the jury regarding the applicable law, the district court gave the jury a special verdict form containing forty interrogatories. Question 2 required that the jury determine whether plaintiff had established \u201cthat [defendant\u2019s] use of its mark [NEWPORT] in conjunction [with its specific products] is likely to cause confusion.\u201d The jury answered \u201cno\u201d. Plaintiff contends that the district court should have disregarded the jury\u2019s answer to Question 2 for the following reasons: (1) when read in conjunction with Question 1, Question 2 led to an unreliable jury verdict on likelihood of confusion, (2) the jury instructions with respect to likelihood of confusion were flawed, and (3) the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings relating to likelihood of confusion were erroneous. None of these arguments has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Plaintiffs first argument can be paraphrased as follows: Because in answering Question 1 the jury determined that plaintiff had not established that it was the senior user of a valid mark for the specific line of products at issue (controllers of various sorts), the jury\u2019s consideration of Question 2 (likelihood of confusion) was hypothetical and its assessment of the <em>Polaroid </em>factors \u201ctainted.\u201d <em>See Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Elecs. Corp., </em>287 F.2d 492, 495 (2d Cir.1961). Because plaintiff failed to object to the formulation of Questions 1 and 2, it must demonstrate \u201cfundamental\u201d error in order to warrant a new trial. <em>See Shade v. Hous. Auth. of New Haven, </em>251 F.3d 307, 312 (2d Cir.2001). We find that the jury could have fairly evaluated the two marks for likelihood of confusion, while also concluding that plaintiff did not have a valid mark covering certain controller technology at the time that defendant began using the NEWPORT mark in association with its controller products. As the district court noted, the jurors were instructed to consider each element of the Lanham Act claim separately and \u201cthere is a strong presumption that the jury ... complied with those instructions.\u201d <em>Bingham v. Zolt, </em>66 F.3d 553, 563 (2d Cir.1995). We find no reason to overcome that presumption in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Second, plaintiff argues that the jury instructions with respect to two of the <em>Polaroid </em>factors \u2014 relevant forms of purchaser confusion and bad faith \u2014 were erroneous because the instructions lacked sufficient detail. Plaintiff objected to these instructions, but even so district courts are given wide discretion in instructing the jury, and \u201cinstruction^] will be deemed adequate, so long as the charge, taken as a whole, is correct and sufficiently covers the case so that a jury can intelligently determine the questions presented to it.\u201d <em>Care Travel Co. v. Pan Am. World Airways, Inc., </em>944 F.2d 983, 996 (2d Cir.1991) (citations omitted). We find that the district court\u2019s instructions with respect to bad faith and purchaser confusion satisfy these criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Third, plaintiff argues that three of Judge Hall\u2019s evidentiary rulings relevant to likelihood of confusion were in error: (1) admission of testimony by defendant\u2019s marketing expert, (2) exclusion of statements made by the Patent Trademark Office regarding one of defendant\u2019s patent applications and, (3) exclusion of a videotape proffered by plaintiff. For substantially the same reasons articulated in the district court\u2019s order denying plaintiffs Rule 59 motion, we find that none of these rulings approaches abuse of discretion <em>See Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136, 142, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">For the reasons set forth above, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying plaintiffs Rule 59 challenge to the jury\u2019s conclusion that there was no likelihood that the parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>use of the mark NEWPORT would cause confusion. Because likelihood of confusion is a required element of plaintiffs Lanham Act and common law trademark infringement claims and, in this case, the CUTPA claim, the jury\u2019s answer to Question 2 provides a sufficient basis to affirm the district court\u2019s denial of plaintiffs Rule 59 motion in its in entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
