We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion under Federal Rule of Evidence 403 in admitting evidence of Ochoa\u2019s \u201cYo Diablo\u201d or \u201cEl Diablo\u201d statement. The identity of the person who went into Perales\u2019s cell, kicked him, and swung a white sock filled with batteries at his head, was in dispute; and Ochoa\u2019s statement, made while he was standing over Perales\u2019s body, amounted to a boast which tended to show that Ochoa was the perpetrator. Nor was the statement unduly prejudicial. The statement is not particularly inflammatory, and the government did not give it an inflammatory spin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">We review Ochoa\u2019s claim that the government\u2019s closing impermissibly shifted the burden to him for plain error, as no objection was made at the time. The summation included one inartful comment that could be interpreted as shifting the burden, but otherwise reiterated that the government bore the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The district court clearly and correctly instructed that the government had the burden of proving every element of every charge beyond a reasonable doubt. It also instructed the jury that statements of counsel were not evidence. In these circumstances, we cannot say that the isolated comment affected Ochoa\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>502 F.3d 931, 995-96 (9th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b1009-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
