Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-23\">Contrary to Mercado\u2019s contentions, the IJ concluded Mercado lacked good moral character based on discretionary factors and required him to establish extreme hardship under former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(1). We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s discretionary determinations that Mercado failed to demonstrate good moral character and extreme hardship for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>suspension of deportation. <em>See Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1151-52 (9th Cir. 1997). We also lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s alternative denial of suspension of deportation as a matter of discretion. <em>Id. </em>(\u201c[Tjhere is no direct judicial review of the Attorney General\u2019s ultimate decision not to suspend deportation proceedings.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Because the IJ denied Mercado\u2019s application on three unreviewable grounds, remand to the BIA for clarification of its decision is unnecessary. <em>Cf. Lanza v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 917, 927 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Contrary to Mercado\u2019s contention, the IJ denied his request for voluntary departure as a matter of discretion, and we lack jurisdiction to review that decision. <em>See Gomez-Lopez v. Ashcroft, </em>393 F.3d 882, 884 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b510-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
