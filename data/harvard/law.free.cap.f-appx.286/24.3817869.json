We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis and affirm for the reasons stated by the district court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Morris v. United States Supreme Court, </em>No. 1:06-cv-00578-JAB-PTS (M.D.N.C. Apr. 4, 2008 &amp; May 27, 2008). We further deny Morris\u2019 motions for judgment on the pleadings, to put the Bible back in all public schools in the U.S.A., and to impose sanctions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b51-11\"> To the extent Morris seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order of September 28, 2006, accepting the magistrate judge's recommendation and dismissing Morris\u2019 civil complaint as frivolous, the appeal is clearly untimely. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B) (stating that when the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed no more than sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
