We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-25\">Addressing in turn the points made in Singh\u2019s two counseled briefs:</p>\n<p id=\"b378-26\">1. His assertion of bias is without basis in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-27\">2. While the detention, interrogation, and physical mistreatment by government officials about which Singh testified might well be persecution <em>if believed, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>IJ found him incredible. Singh claims that neither the IJ nor the BIA made any specific finding that he was not credible, but this is not so. After observing his demeanor and analyzing his testimony for consistency, detail and specificity, as well as persuasiveness, the IJ explicitly stated she \u201cdoes not find this Respondent to be credible\u201d; \u201cjust does not believe Respondent\u2019s claim\u201d; and \u201c[i]n summary, Respondent has not testified credibly to his claims of persecution by the Indian authorities.\u201d Likewise, the BIA noted the IJ\u2019s conclusion and specifically referred to Singh\u2019s changed testimony with respect to the 1991 election that he failed adequately to explain.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Singh\u2019s contention that the BIA misstated his testimony about participating in the 1991 election, then used that misstatement to uphold the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, fails as Singh was responding throughout to questions about his participation in \u201celections\u201d by indicating what he did to advance the Akali Dal Mann cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">3. The BIA\u2019s reliance on contradictions between Singh\u2019s testimony and information in the background materials was not improper simply because Singh himself was not mentioned in those materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">4. The IJ found that affidavits from friends who knew Singh well lacked weight because they did not mention Singh\u2019s political activities, did not say that he sang songs about political topics, did not indicate that he had problems on account of involvement in politics, and did not mention a 1994 arrest after feeding militants. The BIA did not address the issue because it was not pursued. Even if preserved, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">5. The BIA\u2019s citation to <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), was not misplaced on the footing that Singh\u2019s testimony alone was sufficient, as he argues. An applicant\u2019s testimony, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain his burden of proof without corroboration, but if the testimony is not believed, or the IJ does not know what to believe, failure to corroborate may be fatal. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1090 (9th Cir. 2000)). That is the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b378-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication' and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
