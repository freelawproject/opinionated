The district court sentenced petitioner to consecutive 46-months\u2019 prison terms on Counts Two and Three, and a consecutive 60 months\u2019 prison term on Count Five.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-19\">On August 29, 2005, we affirmed petitioner\u2019s convictions and sentences in <em>United States v. Payne, </em>148 Fed.Appx. 804 (11th Cir.2005). Petitioner thereafter moved the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate his convictions and sentences. The district court denied relief, and we issued a certificate of appealability on one issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-20\">Whether the district court erred in denying [petitioner\u2019s] claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to argue at sentencing that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X1.1 applied to [his] two conspiracy convictions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-21\">A convicted defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must establish both prongs of the two-prong standard established by <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>: professional error on counsel\u2019s part and prejudice to the outcome of the criminal proceeding. 466 U.S. 668, 687, 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 2069, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). As for the first prong, \u201cthe defendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. In assessing counsel\u2019s representation, we must be mindful that \u201ccounsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066. The second prong requires the defendant to establish a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-22\">To calculate a defendant\u2019s base offense level for offenses involving a conspiracy, the Sentencing Guidelines instruct the district court to refer to the guideline provision for the substantive offense, as provided in the statutory index, along with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1131.2(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When a conspiracy is not covered by a specific guideline provision, \u00a7 2Xl.l(a) calls for the application of \u201c[t]he base offense level for the substantive offense, plus any adjustments from such guideline for any offense conduct that can be established with reasonable certainty.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X1.1(a). Moreover, \u00a7 2X1.1(b)(2) also provides for a three-level downward adjustment of the offense level for a conspiracy not covered by a specific guideline section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\">[Ujnless the defendant or a co-conspirator completed all the acts the conspirators believed necessary on their part for the successful completion of the substantive offense or the circumstances demonstrate that the conspirators were about to complete all such acts but for apprehension or interruption by some similar event beyond their control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">U.S.S.G. 2X1.1(b)(2). However, \u00a7 2Xl.l(c)(l) instructs that \u201cwhen a ... conspiracy is expressly covered by another offense guideline section, apply that guideline section.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X1.1(c)(1). The application notes list the \u201c[ojffense guidelines that expressly cover conspiracies .... \u201d <em>Id., </em>cmt. (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Here, the district court erroneously found that \u00a7 2X1.1 did not apply to petitioner\u2019s convictions on Counts Two and Three. The record clearly demonstrates that assuming counsel was aware of the error, his failure to argue for a downward adjustment under \u00a7 2Xl.l(b)(2) did not constitute ineffective assistance. But for their arrest, petitioner and his codefendants \u201cwere about to complete\u201d all the acts they \u201cbelieved necessary on their part for the successful completion of the [robbery]....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X1.1(b)(2). Given this fact, the three-level downward adjustment was not available.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">In sum, not only did petitioner fail to demonstrate that counsel\u2019s assistance was ineffective, he failed to establish that <em>Strickland </em>prejudice \u2014 a reasonable probability that he would have received lesser sentences on Counts Two and Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-7\">.
