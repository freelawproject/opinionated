NELSON, TASHIMA, and FISHER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b543-34\"> The panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b544-4\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">David Geozos appeals the 180-month sentence imposed following his guilty plea to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). We affirm the sentence because Geozos is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The district court correctly concluded that Geozos is an armed career criminal because he had at least three previous convictions for violent felonies. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Geozos does not dispute that his previous conviction for assault qualifies as a crime of violence. Geozos\u2019 contention that his three 1981 convictions for robbery should be treated as one offense is unavailing because they were temporally distinct. <em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>149 F.3d 1026, 1031 (9th Cir.1998). Additionally, neither the nature of the plea nor the age of the prior convictions exempts them from the scope of the ACCA. <em>See United States v. Alvarez, </em>972 F.2d 1000, 1006 (9th Cir.1992) (per curiam) (age of conviction is not relevant under ACCA); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>47 F.3d 993, 995 (9th Cir.1995) (plea of nolo contender establishes a \u201cconviction\u201d for the crime charged in the indictment).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, Geozos falls within the sentencing mandate of the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">The district court lacked the discretion to impose a sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See United States v. Hemandez-Castro, </em>473 F.3d 1004, 1007 (9th Cir.2007). Geozos\u2019 argument that after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), district courts have the discretion to deviate from statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums is foreclosed by this circuit\u2019s case law. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Mueller, </em>463 F.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b544-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-10\">. We need not reach the issue of whether Geozos\u2019 1992 conviction for burglary under Florida law constitutes a crime of violence because the assault and robbery convictions qualify Geozos for treatment under the ACCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
