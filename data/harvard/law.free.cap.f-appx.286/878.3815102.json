We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">In August 2002, plaintiff Rashay Reasoner entered into a lease agreement with the Housing Authority of the City of Teag-ue (the \u201cHousing Authority\u201d) to lease a public housing unit in a complex specifically designed and operated to assist elderly persons in Teague, Texas. Reasoner, who is not elderly and planned to live with her minor son in the complex, was nonetheless permitted to lease an apartment in the community as an accommodation for Reasoner\u2019s disabilities. The Housing Authority received numerous complaints on multiple occasions from other residents that the behavior of both Reasoner and her son was in violation of the \u201cRules and Regulations\u201d attached to Reasoner\u2019s rental contract, which prohibited, among other things, \u201cloud, disorderly, or unlawful\u201d conduct, and playing \u201cin the driveways, parking areas, or on the entrance sidewalks of apartments\u201d of others. The Housing Authority also received a report that Reasoner threatened to kill another tenant, the consequence of which was that a criminal trespass order was issued against Reasoner.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">Subsequently, on January 4, 2005, the Housing Authority notified Reasoner that she and her son would need to vacate their unit by February 7, 2005, in response to these multiple violations of the lease. Shortly thereafter, the Housing Authority issued a second notice adding failure to pay rent as an additional basis for eviction. At this time, Reasoner had not paid rent in two months. Following a trial by jury before the Precinct 2 Justice of the Peace in Freestone County, Texas, the jury found for the Housing Authority, and a judgment was entered on March 9, 2005, ordering Reasoner to vacate the unit. Reasoner did not appeal that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-12\">Instead, on January 28, 2005, Reasoner filed the instant lawsuit alleging discrimination on the bases of disability and familial status under the Fail- Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604. Reasoner abandoned her claim based on disability prior to trial, electing only to pursue her familial status discrimination claim. Following a remand from this court reversing summary judgment for the Housing Authority on the basis of the <em>Rooker-FeMmmi </em>doctrine, <em>Reasoner v. Housing Auth. of the City of Teague, </em>188 Fed.Appx. 282 (5th Cir.2006), the case was calendared for an October 29, 2007, trial date. On October 25, 2007, the Housing Authority moved to amend its answer to include as a defense the statutory exemption from all provisions regarding familial status for \u201chousing for older persons\u201d granted by Congress in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3607(b)(1) and (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-13\">The district court orally granted the Housing Authority\u2019s motion to amend over Reasoner\u2019s objection at the opening of the one-day bench trial conducted in this cast1. In so doing, the district court explained that it would grant the motion notwithstanding the fact that it was filed four days prior to trial because the claimed exemp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>tion was \u201cnot something that would come as a surprise to the plaintiff....\u201d A minute entry granting the motion to amend was docketed the same day. The bench trial ensued, at the conclusion of which the district court made express findings of fact and conclusions of law. Specifically, the district court concluded in relevant part that, \u201cDefendant has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the housing complex located at 802 South 7th Street is properly designated as \u2018housing for older persons.\u2019 Thus, the provisions in the Fair Housing Act relating to \u2018familial status\u2019 do not apply in this case.\u201d On November 16, 2007, the district court entered judgment in favor of the Housing Authority. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">On appeal, Reasoner raises three points of error. She argues that: (1) the district court erred in granting the Housing Authority\u2019s motion to amend its answer to include the exemption for \u201chousing for older persons\u201d; (2) the district court should have held the Housing Authority to the \u201ccompelling business necessity\u201d standard in establishing a justification for evicting Reasoner and K.R.; and (3) the district court erred in admitting written statements evidencing Reasoner\u2019s threat against another tenant. Because we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the Housing Authority\u2019s motion to amend, and because Reasoner failed to challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe provisions in the Fair Housing Act relating to \u2018familial status\u2019 do not apply in this case,\u201d we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on that basis and decline to reach Reasoner\u2019s other points of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">With respect to a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion to amend a pleading, we have explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-7\">\u201cWhether leave to amend should be granted is entrusted to the sound discretion of the district court....\u201d <em>Quintanil-la v. Tex. Television, Inc., </em>139 F.3d 494, 499 (5th Cir.1998). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) requires the trial court to grant leave to amend \u201cfreely,\u201d and the language of this rule \u201cevinces a bias in favor of granting leave to amend.\u201d <em>Chitimacha Tribe of La. v. Harry L. Laws Co., </em>690 F.2d 1157, 1162 (5th Cir.1982). The district court must have a \u201csubstantial reason\u201d to deny a request for leave to amend. <em>Jamieson v. Shaw, </em>772 F.2d 1205, 1208 (5th Cir. 1985).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-8\"><em>Lyn-Lea Travel Corp. v. Am. Airlines, Inc., </em>283 F.3d 282, 286 (5th Cir.2002). Rule 15(a) provides, \u201c[A] party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party\u2019s written consent or the court\u2019s leave. The court should freely give leave when justice requires.\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 15(a)(2). In discussing the pleading requirement for affirmative defenses, we have said that the central purpose for the requirement \u201cis the prevention of unfair surprise.\u201d <em>Ingraham v. United States, </em>808 F.2d 1075, 1079 (5th Cir.1987). However, as the issue is not before us, we do not consider whether the exemption for \u201chousing for older persons\u201d under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3607(b) is an affirmative defense that must be pleaded under Rule 8(c). <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">In <em>Lyn-Lea Travel Corp., </em>we affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of the defendant\u2019s motion to amend its answer to include a federal preemption defense after such defense had been raised in the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment but prior to trial. 283 F.3d at 286. There we explained that, because preemption was an issue of law, the relevant facts of which were undisputed at trial, and the plaintiff was not deprived of discovery, the district court did not abuse its discretion in grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>ing leave to amend. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Quintanil-la, </em>139 F.3d at 499).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Similarly, in this case the applicability of the statutory exemption under \u00a7 3607(b) is an issue of law the relevant facts of which \u2014 that the complex in which Reasoner and K.R. lived was \u201chousing for older persons\u201d within the meaning of the Fair Housing Act \u2014 were undisputed, and indeed admitted, at trial. Thus, Reasoner was not prejudiced by the denial of the opportunity for discovery. Further, because the statutory exemption from the familial status provisions for \u201chousing for older persons\u201d is included in a related section of the same Title under which Reasoner brought her claim, as the district court determined, \u201cit\u2019s not something that would come as a surprise to [Reasoner]\u201d that the Housing Authority would assert it as a defense. To the contrary, the only surprise was that the Housing Authority had not asserted it initially in its answer and as a ground for summary judgment. Consequently, it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to grant the Housing Authority\u2019s motion to amend in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">On appeal, Reasoner argues that our decision in <em>Oden v. Oktibbeha County, </em>246 F.3d 458 (5th Cir.2001), forecloses the Housing Authority from amending its answer, and as a consequence, renders the \u201chousing for older persons\u201d exemption waived. We disagree. As the Housing Authority asserts in its brief, in <em>Oden, </em>we merely held that a statutory affirmative defense is waived when it is raised for the first time in a post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law, after the jury had reached a verdict and the district court had entered judgment on that verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 467. The defendants in that case never sought to amend their responsive pleadings prior to trial pursuant to Rule 15(a) as the Housing Authority did here. Thus, <em>Oden </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">Substantively, Reasoner does not challenge on appeal the district court\u2019s factual finding that the housing unit in which she lived was properly designated \u201chousing for older persons\u201d within the meaning of the Fair Housing Act. In fact, Reasoner acknowledged that it was in her trial testimony. (Tr. 34:16-19). As a consequence, that issue is not before us, and we defer to the district court\u2019s factual finding on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">Further, we need not reach Reasoner\u2019s other points of error because they are mooted by our affirming the district court\u2019s judgment on the ground that the \u00a7 3607(b) exemption acts as a complete bar to Reasoner\u2019s claim in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b905-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5m Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
