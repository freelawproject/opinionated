In addition, following the district court\u2019s transfer of Garcia\u2019s habeas corpus petition to us under \u00a7 106(c) of the REAL ID Act, Garcia challenges his 1996 deportation proceedings (No. 05-73199). Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the BIA\u2019s findings of fact for substantial evidence, <em>Moran v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1089, 1091 (9th Cir. 2005), and we deny the petition for review in No. 06-75262, and dismiss as moot the petitions in Nos. 04-74297 and 05-73199.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">The BIA properly determined that Garcia was removeable as charged in the November 26, 2004, Notice to Appear, as an alien present in the United States without having been admitted or paroled, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), and as an alien who had twice previously been ordered removed and who sought admission within 20 years of the date of his last removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(A)(ii). The agency also properly denied Garcia\u2019s request for permission to reenter nunc pro tunc because he was presently inadmissable and, therefore, ineligible for adjustment of status. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">Because the November 3, 2005, order of removal is lawful and valid, Garcia\u2019s challenges to his July 22, 1996, deportation order are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW IN 06-75272 DENIED; PETITIONS FOR REVIEW IN 04-74297 and 05-73199 DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b478-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
