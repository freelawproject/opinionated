The district court sentenced him to 30 months of imprisonment, within the guidelines range. Campos objected in the district court to the sentence imposed. Campos now appeals, challenging only the reasonableness of the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">In applying the Sentencing Guidelines in this case, the district court enhanced Campos\u2019s offense level by 12 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B) based on Campos\u2019s prior drug-trafficking conviction. Campos does not challenge the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines. Instead, he contends that his sentence was unreasonable in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). He maintains that our prior jurisprudence impermissibly constrained the district court\u2019s sentencing discretion in a manner incompatible with <em>Gall </em>and <em>Kimbrough. </em>We have recently rejected this same argument. <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338-39 (5th Cir.2008)(per curiam); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 557 n. 1 (5th Cir.2008), petition for cert. filed (July 2, 2008)(No. 08-5226).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-19\">Campos has not overcome the rebuttable presumption that his within-guidelines sentence was reasonable. See <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). We thus conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it imposed Campos\u2019s 30-month sentence. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b227-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
