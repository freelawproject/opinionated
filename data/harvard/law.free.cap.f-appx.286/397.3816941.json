The parties are familiar with the facts, which we repeat here only to the extent necessary. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits de novo, <em>see Gillett-Netting v. Barnhart, </em>371 F.3d 593, 595 (9th Cir.2004), and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-22\">We will affirm the Commissioner\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Batson v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>359 F.3d 1190, 1193 (9th Cir. 2004). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>See Howard ex rel. Wolff v. Barnhart, </em>341 F.3d 1006, 1011 (9th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-23\">Generally, the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) will afford more weight to the opinions of treating medical professionals. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2). An ALJ should \u201cgive more weight to opinions from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>[a claimant\u2019s] treating sources, since these sources are likely to be the medical professionals most able to provide a detailed, longitudinal picture of [the claimant\u2019s] medical impairment(s) and may bring a unique perspective ... that cannot be obtained from ... individual examinations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">A treating physician\u2019s opinion is not necessarily binding. <em>Batson, </em>359 F.3d at 1195. \u201cWhen confronted with conflicting medical opinions, an ALJ need not accept a treating physician\u2019s opinion that is conclusory and brief and unsupported by clinical findings.\u201d <em>Tonapetyan v. Halter, </em>242 F.3d 1144, 1149 (9th Cir.2001). When an ALJ rejects the opinion of the treating physician in favor of a conflicting opinion, however, he must provide \u201cspecific and legitimate reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record for so doing.\u201d <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830 (9th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Reddick v. Chater, </em>157 F.3d 715, 722 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Here, the ALJ provided two reasons for rejecting Dr. Davis\u2019s opinion. First, the ALJ stated that because Dr. Davis gave an opinion on Boardman\u2019s ability to return to work, an issue reserved to the Commissioner of Social Security, Davis\u2019s opinion was not entitled to special significance. Second, the ALJ stated that there is no evidence to support Dr. Davis\u2019s opinion that Boardman is disabled. Neither of these statements provides the specific- and legitimate reasoning that we require. Furthermore, the ALJ\u2019s conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The ALJ is correct that a determination of a claimant\u2019s ultimate disability is reserved to the Commissioner, and that a physician\u2019s opinion on the matter is not entitled to special significance. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(e). However, a treating physician\u2019s <em>medical </em>opinions are generally given more weight. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2). Medical opinions \u201creflect judgments about the nature and severity of [a claimant\u2019s] impair ment(s), including [a claimant\u2019s] symptoms, diagnosis and prognosis, what [a claimant] can still do despite impairments), and [a claimant\u2019s] physical or mental restrictions.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Here, Dr. Davis clearly expressed a medical opinion. He described Board-man\u2019s symptoms, including \u201cmoderate to severe\u201d chronic back pain. He gave a prognosis of no foreseeable improvement in Boardman\u2019s condition. Dr. Davis also described restrictions on Boardman\u2019s activity, such as the likelihood that Board-man would miss more than five days of work per month and require multiple breaks each day. Rather than afford weight to these medical opinions, the ALJ ignored them on the ground that Dr. Davis also expressed an opinion regarding Boardman\u2019s ultimate disability and residual functional capacity. While this may be a specific reason to reject a treating physician\u2019s medical opinion, it is not a legitimate one.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">The ALJ continued to conflate Dr. Davis\u2019s medical and non-medical opinions by stating that \u201cthere is no evidence of record to support the physician\u2019s opinion that the claimant is disabled and unable to work.\u201d This statement is irrelevant at best. The regulations clearly state that Dr. Davis\u2019s opinion regarding Boardman\u2019s ultimate disability are not dispositive. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(e)(3). Lack of evidence to support Dr. Davis\u2019s conclusion on that score therefore makes little difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">Even if the ALJ intended to refer to Dr. Davis\u2019s <em>medical </em>opinions, he failed to provide specific and legitimate reasons for rejecting those opinions. The ALJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>must explain his own interpretations, and cannot merely list contrary opinions when stating that a treating physician\u2019s opinion is unsupported. <em>Regennitter v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>166 F.3d 1294 (9th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Furthermore, a claim that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d to support Dr. Davis\u2019s medical opinions would not be supported by substantial evidence. To the contrary, there is evidence, including extensive documentation of Boardman\u2019s discussions with Dr. Davis, prescription records, and electro-diagnostic testing results, to support Dr. Davis\u2019s medical conclusions. The ALJ implicitly criticized Dr. Davis\u2019s reports by describing the elements of acceptable medical evidence (albeit in the context of yet more conflated discussion of non-medical opinions). The reports, however, include precisely the type of medical evidence, such as treatment and response histories, prognoses, and clinical findings (including the results of mental status examinations) that the ALJ suggested were lacking. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513(b). <em>Cf. Tonapetyan, </em>242 F.3d at 1149 (holding that ALJ properly rejected examining physician\u2019s opinion on the grounds that it was premised only on claimant\u2019s subjective complaints, the ALJ discounted claimant\u2019s credibility, and the record supported the ALJ\u2019s credibility finding).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-14\">The parties agree that we have the discretion to credit Dr. Davis\u2019s medical opinion as true on remand. <em>See Connett v. Barnhart, </em>340 F.3d 871, 876 (9th Cir.2003). We generally credit improperly rejected evidence as true when there are no outstanding issues to be resolved and it is clear that the ALJ would be required to find the claimant disabled once the rejected evidence is taken into account. <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1292 (9th Cir. 1996). Here, Dr. Davis\u2019s medical opinion established that Boardman would require frequent breaks and be absent from work five days per month. The vocational expert testified that, under such limitations, Boardman would be unable to do any job. We therefore credit Dr. Davis\u2019s opinion as true and find that the record compels a finding that Boardman is disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Accordingly, we REVERSE with instructions to the district court to REMAND this case to the Commissioner of Social Security for payment of benefits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"****\">\n<p id=\"b424-24\"> phis disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
