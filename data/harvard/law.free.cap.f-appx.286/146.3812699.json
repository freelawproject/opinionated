Dong argues that the BIA abused its discretion in finding that Dong\u2019s allegations of increased enforcement of China\u2019s population control laws were insufficient to qualify as changed country conditions un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>der 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii), so as to exempt Dong\u2019s motion to reopen from the time and number bars. Dong also argues that the BIA mischaracterized his argument to refer to changes in his personal circumstances rather than the country\u2019s. He further avers that, given the rise of persecutive measures to enforce family planning practices and the birth of his children, he or his wife will be subjected to forced abortions and/or sterilization if returned to China, thus warranting the grant of asylum and withholding of removal. For this reason, Dong argues, he and his wife have a reasonable fear of persecution if they return to China.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">In its decision, the BIA considered Dong\u2019s arguments and evidence as to conditions in China and Dong\u2019s personal circumstances. However, Dong\u2019s own evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion. Dong\u2019s evidence shows that abortions and forced sterilizations continued to be documented, although officially not permitted, but not that they increased. Furthermore, Dong\u2019s two prior motions to reopen argued the same \u201cchanged\u201d circumstances. In those motions, Dong argued that he and his wife feared China\u2019s coercive family planning policies. Dong fails to show an increase in the threat that he describes in those prior motions. Dong has failed to show that the BIA abused its discretion. <em>See Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Dong additionally asserts that the BIA erred in requiring him to show changed circumstances in China under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Dong argues that, under 8 U.S.C. 1158(a)(2)(D), aliens with changed personal circumstances after a removal order may file a successive asylum application without having to show a change in country conditions. In <em>Matter of C-W-L, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 346, 351 (BIA 2007), the BIA rejected this argument and we reject it as well. Section 1158(a)(2)(D) governs asylum applications only and is not applicable to the reopening of removal proceedings. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii), on the other hand, expressly applies to aliens under final orders of removal seeking to apply or reapply for asylum. Dong fails to show that the BIA analysis of his motion to reopen under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii), rather than \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D), was arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statutes. <em>See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">For these reasons, Dong\u2019s petition for review of the decision of the BIA is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b173-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
