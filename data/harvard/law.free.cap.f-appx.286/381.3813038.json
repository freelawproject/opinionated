The court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees to the Burlington as a prevailing party under the Act. PSR appeals both orders. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-22\">A. PSR\u2019s Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b408-23\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s determination that a party lacks standing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number><em>See Buono v. Norton, </em>371 F.3d 543, 546 (9th Cir.2004). The district court found that PSR had suffered actual injury fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and that PSR thus had satisfied the first two prongs of standing analysis. <em>See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992) (setting forth elements of constitutional standing as (1) injury in fact, (2) traceable to action of the defendant, and (3) likely to be redressed by a favorable decision). The district court nonetheless declined to find standing because PSR was obligated to pay any funds it recovered to the PSR Trust. The court concluded that this obligation meant that the injury to PSR was not redressable, as required by <em>Lujan. See also Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org., </em>426 U.S. 26, 43-46, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">An intervening decision of the United States Supreme Court undermines this ruling. In <em>Sprint Communications Co. v. APCC Services, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2531, 171 L.Ed.2d 424 (2008), the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff\u2019s obligation to turn the proceeds of its litigation over to a third party does not deprive that plaintiff of Article III standing that it otherwise enjoys. <em>Id. </em>at 2535-36. The Supreme Court stated that the inquiry regarding redressability \u201cfocuses, as it should, on whether the <em>injury </em>that a plaintiff alleges is likely to be redressed through the litigation \u2014 not on what the plaintiff ultimately intends to do with the money he recovers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2542. Here, PSR has suffered a direct injury in cleanup expenses which would be remedied by an award of contribution from the Burlington, and that remedy is not undone by PSR\u2019s obligation to turn the funds it recovers over to the PSR Trust. We therefore conclude that the district court erred in dismissing PSR\u2019s contribution action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">B. Attorneys\u2019 Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">After dismissing PSR\u2019s claim, the district court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees to the Burlington as a prevailing party under the Act. <em>See </em>Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 70.105D.080 (2007) (\u201cThe prevailing party in [an action under the Act] shall recover its reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\u201d). Because we reverse the summary judgment against PSR, the Burlington is not now a prevailing party with respect to PSR. We therefore vacate the award of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">C. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">The summary judgment dismissing PSR\u2019s contribution action for lack of standing is reversed, and the matter is remanded. The award of attorneys\u2019 fees to the Burlington is vacated. PSR is entitled to its costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">REVERSED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-15\">. The Port of Seattle was also a plaintiff and appellant in this action, but it entered a voluntary dismissal of its appeal with prejudice. That dismissal was confirmed by separate order; it does not affect PSR's appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
