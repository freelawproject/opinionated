Hill sued Forest River, his former employer, alleging that he was subjected to racial discrimination in the workplace. The parties eventually settled after Forest River submitted, and Hill accepted, an Offer of Judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68. We conclude that the district court was justified in withholding attorney fees and costs from Hill because of its determination that the parties had a mutual understanding that the Offer of Judgment was inclusive of such costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-26\">A district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny attorney fees is generally reviewed for abuse of discretion, though any underlying findings of fact are reviewed for clear error, and any legal analysis is reviewed de novo. <em>Thomas v. City of Tacoma, </em>410 F.3d 644, 647 (9th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Hall v. Bolger, </em>768 F.2d 1148, 1150 (9th Cir.1985), and <em>Fischer v. SJB-P.D. Inc., </em>214 F.3d 1115, 1118 (9th Cir.2000)). A prevailing plaintiff in a civil rights action \u201cshould ordinarily recover an attorney\u2019s fee [under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988] unless special circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>stances would render such an award unjust.\u201d <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 429, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983) (citation omitted). We use a two-prong test to evaluate whether such special circumstances exist: \u201c(1) whether allowing attorney\u2019s fees would further the purposes of \u00a7 1988 and (2) whether the balance of the equities favors or disfavors the denial of fees.\u201d <em>Bauer v. Sampson, </em>261 F.3d 775, 785-86 (9th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Gilbrook v. City of Westminster, </em>177 F.3d 839, 878 (9th Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The district court applied this test and determined that the balance of the equities disfavored awarding attorney fees to Hill. The district court found that prior to litigation, the parties had engaged in settlement negotiations with the shared understanding that each offer was inclusive of attorney fees. Based on the parties\u2019 seL tlement negotiations and Hill\u2019s attorney\u2019s own admission that all previous offers were inclusive of attorney fees, the district court determined that the Offer of Judgment was also understood to be inclusive of attorney fees. The district court did not clearly err in drawing this conclusion. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of attorney fees and need not reach the district court\u2019s alternative grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny costs for an abuse of discretion. <em>Amarel v. Connell, </em>102 F.3d 1494, 1523 (9th Cir.1997). The district court denied Hill\u2019s request for the same reason as it denied attorney fees: the mutual understanding between the parties that the Offer of Judgment was inclusive of costs. The district court was well within its discretion in withholding attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">The district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b557-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
