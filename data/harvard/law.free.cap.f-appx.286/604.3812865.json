Huang contends that she is a member of a particular social group consisting of young unmarried women in rural China, and that her family was persecuted based on her membership in this group. After careful review, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-21\">We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Because the BIA did not adopt the IJ\u2019s decision, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. To the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. See D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). The BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we will \u201caffirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (quotation omitted). Put another way, we will reverse a finding of fact only when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>a reversal. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is any person who is unwilling to return to her home country or to avail herself of that country\u2019s protection \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). The applicant satisfies this burden by showing, with specific and credible evidence: (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2006). A showing of past persecution creates a presumption of a \u201cwell-founded fear,\u201d subject to rebuttal by the government. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. If she cannot show past persecution, then a petitioner must demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution that is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. The subjective component can be established \u201cby the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution,\u201d while the objective component \u201ccan be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he or she has a good reason to fear future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">\u201cPersecution\u201d is \u201can extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotations omitted). We have stated that mere harassment does not amount to persecution. <em>Id. </em>In assessing whether an alien has suffered past persecution, the BIA should consider the cumulative effect of the alleged acts of persecution. <em>See De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1008 (11th Cir.2008). Thus, while individual instances of mistreatment might not amount to persecution, the record considered as a whole still may compel a finding of past persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 1009 (holding that record compelled a finding that the petitioner endured past persecution where, although the petitioner\u2019s physical injuries were minor, she endured repeated death threats, two physical attacks, the murder of a family friend who refused to give information on the petitioner\u2019s whereabouts, and a kidnaping accompanied by a beating).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">Again, Huang relies on her membership in a particular social group consisting of young unmarried women in rural China.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to Huang, her family was persecuted based on her membership in this group. The alleged persecution consisted of her father\u2019s detention by authorities, the destruction of her family\u2019s crops, and the beating of her boyfriend. The BIA found that while Huang and her family had been harassed by the son of the town leader, who was romantically interested in Huang, Huang \u201cwas never harmed and there is no evidence that anyone in China is interested in harming her on account of any protect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>ed ground.\u201d We have held that harassment, such as threats and acts of intimidation, particularly those that result in no physical harm, do not rise to the level of persecution. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. From our review of the record, we are not compelled to conclude the BIA erred when it concluded that the mistreatment alleged by Huang amounts to mere harassment, rather than persecution. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Huang did not suffer past persecution, or a well-founded fear of future persecution, sufficient to warrant asylum.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-19\">. Huang also applied for relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\"CAT\u201d), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). She does not challenge the denial of her CAT claim and, accordingly, has waived the claim. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b631-7\">. To the extent Huang also relies on her membership in a particular social group consisting of women in fear of forced marriages, we lack jurisdiction to review that claim since Huang did not raise it in the immigration court. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b632-15\">. Because Huang has not established past persecution or future persecution, we need not reach the issue of whether she belongs to a particular social group.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
