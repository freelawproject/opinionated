We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence and will uphold the agency\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-20\">Jo failed to challenge to the agency\u2019s determination that his asylum application was untimely, and thus waived that contention. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-21\">We deny the petition with respect to the withholding of removal claim because the record does not compel a finding of past persecution, or a clear probability of future persecution by the government or forces that the government is unable or unwilling to control. <em>See Castro-Perez v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 1069, 1072 (9th Cir.2005); <em>see also Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1180 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc) (holding that petitioners alleging a pattern or practice of persecution by non-government actors must also prove that the government is unable or unwilling to control those actors.)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-22\">Jo\u2019s CAT claim fails because he has not demonstrated that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if he returns to Indonesia. <em>See El Himri v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 932, 938 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-23\">Jo\u2019s unopposed request for a sixty-day extension to file a supplemental brief, filed on August 30, 2007, is granted. The clerk shall file Jo\u2019s supplemental brief, received on September 17, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-24\">Respondent\u2019s motion for leave to file respondent\u2019s supplemental brief out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>time, filed November 6, 2007, is granted.
