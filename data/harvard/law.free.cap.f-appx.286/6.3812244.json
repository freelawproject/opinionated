Fordham was sentenced to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-16\">On appeal, Fordham contends the Government breached the terms of the plea agreement by failing to recommend a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. \u201c[W]hen a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.\u201d <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971). \u201cIt is well-established that the interpretation of plea agreements is rooted in contract law, and that \u2018each party should receive the benefit of its bargain.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Peglera, </em>33 F.3d 412, 413 (4th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>United States v. Ringling, </em>988 F.2d 504, 506 (4th Cir.1993)). \u201cA central tenet of contract law is that no party is obligated to provide more than is specified in the agreement itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, \u201cthe government\u2019s duty in carrying out its obligations under a plea agreement is no greater than that of \u2018fidelity to the agreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Fentress, </em>792 F.2d 461, 464 (4th Cir.1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-18\">Pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement, a two-level downward adjustment under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3El.l(a) (2006) would be applied if the district court, in its discretion, determined that Fordham had accepted responsibility. If the court so determined, the Government agreed to move for an additional one-level decrease under \u00a7 3El.l(b). Because Fordham absconded for more than a year and continued to engage in criminal conduct, the court concluded that a two-level downward adjustment under \u00a7 3El.l(a) was not warranted. Consequently, the Government was not obligated to move for an additional one-level decrease under \u00a7 3E 1.1(b). While Fordham alternatively asserts that the Government breached the plea agreement by arguing against application of the initial two-level downward adjustment, the Government was not obligated to remain silent as the plea agreement explicitly provided that the Government</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ay-dedup-0\">retain[ed] the right to inform the Court of any relevant facts, to address the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Court with respect to the nature of the offense, to respond to questions raised by the Court, to correct any inaccuracies or inadequacies in the presentence report, [and] to respond to any statements made to the Court by or on behalf of the Defendant____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Since Fordham assented to these terms, both in writing and during the Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 hearing, we conclude she cannot establish that the Government breached the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"A_\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
