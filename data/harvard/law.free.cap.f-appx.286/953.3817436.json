In 2003 police officers arrested Slaughter after seeing him carry two rifles from the home of a retired sergeant of the Illinois State Police who was under surveillance. The officers stopped Slaughter\u2019s vehicle and discovered eight firearms in his car. During post-arrest interviews Slaughter admitted to stealing a total of 33 to 38 guns from the police sergeant\u2019s home and selling some of the firearms to known gang members. Slaughter pleaded guilty, without a plea agreement, to being a felon in possession of a firearm, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C \u00a7 922(g)(1), and possessing stolen firearms, <em>see Id. </em>\u00a7 922(j). A probation officer determined Slaughter\u2019s base offense level to be 20, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A), applied a six-level increase because the offense involved between 25 and 99 firearms, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(C), a two-level increase because some of the firearms were stolen, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A), a four-level increase for possessing or transferring a firearm with reason to believe that they would be used in connection with another felony offense, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>\u00a7 3E1.1. The probation officer determined Slaughter\u2019s total offense level to be 29 and his criminal history category to be VI, producing a guidelines range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">The sentencing judge adopted the probation officer\u2019s calculations, finding that the government had proven the facts underlying the sentencing enhancements by a preponderance of the evidence. After considering the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the judge imposed the statutory maximum prison term of 120 months on the first count and a consecutive term of 68 additional months on the second count for a total prison term of 188 months \u2014 the high end of the advisory range.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">Slaughter\u2019s only argument on appeal is that his sentence violated his Fifth Amendment right to due process because the district court found facts that significantly increased his sentence using the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard as opposed to the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard. We review Slaughter\u2019s constitutional challenge de novo. <em>United States v. Hollins, </em>498 F.3d 622, 629 (7th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">We have repeatedly held that \u201cdistrict court judges do not violate the Constitution when they find facts by a preponderance of the evidence for purposes of calculating a guideline range, as long as the guidelines remain advisory and the ultimate decision is based on consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Shannon, </em>518 F.3d 494, 496 (7th Cir.2008); <em>see also United States v. Martinez, </em>520 F.3d 749, 752 n. 1 (7th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Seymour, </em>519 F.3d 700, 710 (7th Cir.2008). Moreover, all of our sister circuits allow district judges to enhance sentences based on facts found by a mere preponderance of the evidence as long as they do not increase the statutory maximum. <em>See United States v. Bras, </em>483 F.3d 103, 107 (D.C.Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Curran, </em>525 F.3d 74, 84-85 (1st Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>525 F.3d 211, 215 (2d Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Fisher, </em>502 F.3d 293, 306 (3d Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Benkahla, </em>530 F.3d 300, 312 (4th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Fambro, </em>526 F.3d 836, 851 &amp; n. 96 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Brika, </em>487 F.3d 450, 459 (6th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>506 F.3d 685, 688 (8th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>509 F.3d 1201, 1220 (9th Cir. 2007); <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>525 F.3d 960, 966 (10th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>489 F.3d 1117, 1129 (11th Cir. 2007). Slaughter admits that our current case law forecloses his claim. We have rejected Slaughter\u2019s only argument in previous cases, and we have no reason to revisit the issue now.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
