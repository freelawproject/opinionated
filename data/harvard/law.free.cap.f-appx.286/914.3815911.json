Appellant El\u00edseo Cayabyab Beltran (\u201cBeltran\u201d) now appeals from a final order of deportation issued against him by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d). Beltran contends that he is eligible for discretionary relief from deportation under former \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c), and that his case should be remanded to the immigration court to consider the merits of this claim. The government argues that Beltran is ineligible for relief under the terms of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">For the reasons discussed below, we reverse the decision of the BIA and remand for consideration of the merits of Beltran\u2019s petition for relief under \u00a7 1182(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-11\">I. Background and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b941-12\">Beltran originally entered the United States as an immigrant in 1977, when he was fourteen years old, along with his parents and siblings. Prior to that time Beltran lived in the Philippines.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-13\">Since entering the United States, Bel-tran his been convicted of three crimes. He was first convicted of larceny of a building, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 750.360, in 1981. He was sentenced to six months in jail and five years of probation. In 1984, Beltran was found to have violated his probation by (1) leaving Michigan without permission to care for an ill relative and (2) failing to make certain court-ordered payments. As a result, Bel-tran\u2019s probation was revoked and he was sentenced to a year in jail, with credit for the six months that he had previously served.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-16\">In 1992, Beltran was convicted of first-degree retail fraud, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 750.356c, after attempting to steal a television and VCR from a store at which he worked. He was sentenced to three years\u2019 probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-17\">Finally, in 2000, Beltran pled no contest to fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 750.520e, a misdemeanor. The record does not disclose the nature of the underlying conduct. He was sentenced to time served as a pretrial detainee (about 120 days) and released.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-18\">As a result of his first two convictions, Beltran was served with an order to show cause in August 1994, initiating what has turned out to be a long and tortuous series of deportation proceedings. The order to show cause charged Beltran with deporta-bility under former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2)(A)(ii) because he had been convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-19\">A. Original Proceedings in Immigration Court</p>\n<p id=\"b941-20\">Beltran appeared <em>pro se </em>before an immigration judge in October 1995. He admitted the factual allegations and conceded deportability as charged. To avoid deportation, he petitioned for a waiver under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which allowed an immigration judge to provide discretionary relief from deportation for legal permanent residents. Following a hearing in February 1996, the immigration judge issued a decision finding Beltran deporta-ble under \u00a7 1251(a)(2)(A)(ii) and denying his application for a \u00a7 1182(c) waiver on the merits. The judge ordered Beltran deported to the Philippines.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">B. The First Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Beltran appealed to the BIA, arguing that the immigration judge should have granted his application for a \u00a7 1182(c) waiver. In October 1998, the BIA vacated the deportation order, finding that the immigration judge had not adequately advised Beltran of the free legal services available to him, and remanded the case to the immigration court for further proceedings. The BIA also held that Beltran was statutorily eligible for a \u00a7 1182(c) waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">C. Remanded Proceedings in Immigration Court</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">An immigration judge held a new hearing in January 1999. Beltran failed to appear because, as the parties agree, he was never served with the necessary papers due to a change of address. The immigration judge issued an <em>in absentia </em>order of deportation, finding that Beltran had abandoned any application for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">Beltran filed a motion to reopen the case and rescind the <em>in absentia </em>order of deportation in March 2001. The immigration judge denied the motion, finding that Bel-tran had failed to comply with the regulations concerning notification of an address change during deportation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">D. The Second Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b942-13\">Beltran again appealed to the BIA. The BIA dismissed the appeal in February 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-14\">Beltran then petitioned for review in this Court. We reversed, holding that Beltran had complied with the statutory requirements for notification of a change of address, and remanded the case to the immigration court with instructions to grant Beltran\u2019s motion to reopen his deportation hearing. <em>Beltran v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 407 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-15\">E. Second Set of Remanded Proceedings in Immigration Court</p>\n<p id=\"b942-16\">Following the remand to the immigration court, the Department of Homeland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) lodged an additional charge of deportability against Beltran, supported by additional factual allegations. DHS said that, because of the one-year sentence imposed after Beltran\u2019s probation violation, his larceny conviction was an \u201caggravated felony\u201d as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). Consequently, Beltran was subject to deportation under former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii). In addition, DHS argued that, because Beltran\u2019s 2000 conviction for fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct occurred after the repeal of \u00a7 1182(c),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that section could not provide Beltran with relief from deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">In June 2004, an immigration judge sustained the additional factual allegations and the additional charge of deportability. The immigration judge found that the 1981 larceny conviction was an \u201caggravated felony\u201d as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). The judge also found that the aggravated felony conviction did not bar Beltran from relief under \u00a7 1182(c), since the conviction occurred prior to September 30, 1996, and thus fell within the rule articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">However, the immigration judge determined that, despite Beltran\u2019s statutory eligibility for \u00a7 1182(c) relief, that provision would not provide relief from Beltran\u2019s 2000 conviction for fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct. The immigration judge held that the conviction for fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct involved \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d and that in order to avoid deportation Beltran would require an additional waiver issued under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a). Finally, the immigration judge concluded that Beltran was barred from \u00a7 1229b(a) relief because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony (the 1981 larceny conviction and subsequent probation violation) and therefore declined to consider Beltran\u2019s application for a waiver under \u00a7 1182(c), reasoning that even if the waiver were granted, Beltran would remain subject to deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2)(A)(ii). The immigration judge again ordered Beltran deported to the Philippines.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">F. The Third Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">Beltran again appealed from the immigration judge\u2019s order of deportation. In October 2004, the BIA issued a decision affirming the immigration judge\u2019s order without a separate opinion. Beltran filed a motion for reconsideration with the BIA, which was denied. He then petitioned for review in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-12\">In March 2005, DHS moved to remand the proceedings \u201cin view of the lengthy and complex history of this deportation matter [to] allow the [BIA] to clarify in the first instance the applicability of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b (cancellation of removal) in the case of an alien in deportation proceedings, and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1212.3(g) and 1212.3(h)(3) in the case of an alien whose proceedings commenced prior to 1996, but who suffered an additional criminal conviction after April 1, 1997.\u201d Beltran did not oppose the motion, and in June 2005 we issued an order remanding the case to the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-13\">G. The BIA\u2019s Decision on Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b943-14\">Following the remand, the BIA issued a new decision dismissing the appeal. During the remanded proceedings, DHS reiterated its earlier argument that \u00a7 1182(c) would not provide Beltran with complete relief and that it was therefore unnecessary to consider the merits of Beltran\u2019s petition for relief under that statutory pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>vision. DHS also argued an additional theory that it had not previously raised, specifically that under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(f)(5), Beltran is statutorily ineligible for \u00a7 1182(c) relief because one of the two claimed grounds of deportability (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii) (conviction of an aggravated felony)) does not have a \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d in former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a). Beltran argued that DHS should be foreclosed from raising the \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d argument due to collateral estoppel, law of the case, or some related doctrine. He further argued that \u00a7 1182(c) would provide him with relief from deportation despite his conviction for fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct in 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">The BIA dismissed the appeal, holding first that Beltran was not eligible for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b. The BIA noted that Beltran was subject to \u201cdeportation proceedings\u201d that commenced prior to the enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), Pub.L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (1996). IIRIRA replaced \u201cdeportation proceedings\u201d with \u201cremoval proceedings\u201d under a new set of statutory provisions and regulations. Section 1229b, which provides for \u201ccancellation of removal,\u201d was enacted as an amendment to IIRIRA. As such, \u00a7 1229b is not applicable to cases, like Beltran\u2019s, proceeding under the old law of \u201cdeportation proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">The BIA further held that Beltran was not eligible for \u00a7 1182(c) relief because his 1981 larceny conviction lacks a \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d of inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a), as required by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(f)(5). Rejecting Beltran\u2019s contention that collateral estoppel or law of the case should bar consideration of the statutory counterpart argument, the BIA noted that \u201cthe current issue has never before been resolved or adjudicated by any governing body that has issued a decision in this case, and is crucial in deciding whether or not the respondent is eligible for a waiver\u201d under \u00a7 1182(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">In immigration appeals, we ordinarily review questions of law <em>de novo, </em>but we defer to the BIA\u2019s reasonable interpretations of the immigration statutes. <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>451 F.3d 400, 403 (6th Cir. 2006); <em>see also INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, </em>526 U.S. 415, 424, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999). The BIA\u2019s factual findings may be reversed only where \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">A. The BIA Erred in Allowing DHS to Raise a New Argument on Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">In June 2005, we granted DHS\u2019s unopposed motion to remand the case to the BIA \u201cto clarify in the first instance the applicability of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b (cancellation of removal) in the case of alien in deportation proceedings, and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1212.3(g) and 1212.3(h)(3) in the case of an alien whose proceedings commenced prior to 1996, but who suffered an additional criminal conviction after April 1, 1997.\u201d After the remand, the BIA issued an opinion holding that Beltran was ineligible for relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) because there was no \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d to his 1981 larceny conviction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a), as required by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(f)(5). The record does not show that either Beltran, the government, or the immigration courts had previously raised the \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d issue even in passing.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>We hold that DHS waived the \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d issue by failing to raise it in administrative proceedings prior to Bel-tran\u2019s appeal to this Court and that the BIA\u2019s consideration of the issue after the remand for clarification impermissibly exceeded the scope of the mandate. Prior to the 2005 remand, the government had consistently taken the affirmative position that Beltran was statutorily eligible for relief under \u00a7 1182(c). Counsel for DHS explicitly conceded the point during the June 2004 hearing before the immigration judge. Furthermore, the immigration judge stated in her opinion that Beltran was eligible for \u00a7 1182(c) relief, and DHS successfully moved for summary affir-mance of that opinion. Therefore, DHS could not have made the \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d argument for the first time before this Court. \u201cIt is a well-established rule that this Court will not consider claims that are presented for the first time on appeal nor arguments that are not properly raised below.\u201d <em>Berryman v. Rieger, </em>150 F.3d 561, 568 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">The fact that the case was remanded to the BIA for clarification does not change this result. In accordance with DHS\u2019s motion, the remand was granted to allow the BIA (which had not issued a separate opinion) to clarify the application of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1212.3(g) and 1212.3(h)(3), issues which were essential to the immigration court\u2019s disposition of the case. The remand was not license for the BIA to consider wholly new legal arguments that could not have been raised in this Court absent the remand. \u201c[U]pon remand of a case for further proceedings after a decision by the appellate court, the trial court must proceed in accordance with the mandate and the law of the case as established on appeal. The trial court must implement both the letter and the spirit of the mandate, taking into account the appellate court\u2019s opinion and the circumstances it embraces.\u201d <em>Brunet v. City of Columbus, </em>58 F.3d 251, 254 (6th Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the BIA exceeded the scope of the mandate in allowing DHS to raise an issue that was not discussed in the immigration court\u2019s opinion and that could not have been raised in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">B. Beltran Is Not Otherwise Foreclosed From Seeking Relief Under \u00a7 1182(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">Once the \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d bar to \u00a7 1182(c) has been lifted, Beltran is not otherwise foreclosed from seeking relief from deportation under that provision. The only suggestion to the contrary comes in the 2004 opinion of the immigration court. That opinion held that \u00a7 1182(c) would not provide Beltran with relief from his 2000 conviction for fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct because the conviction occurred after \u00a7 1182(c) was repealed. In its decision after the remand, the BIA rejected the immigration court\u2019s position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsiW\">However, just as cancellation of removal, which replaced the now repealed waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act, was explicitly enacted for those aliens in removal proceedings, former section 212(c) of the Act was preserved for those aliens in deportation proceedings subject to its [sic] Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAED-PA\u201d), which took effect on April 24, 1996, and IIRIRA amendments. Thus, under section 309(c) of the IIRIRA, the respondent, who is not eligible to seek cancellation of removal for his 2000 conviction because he is in deportation proceedings, is technically eligible to seek section 212(c) relief as to his post-AED-PA and IIRIRA convictions because section 309(c) of the IIRIRA specifically makes the repeal of the pre-IIRIRA deportation laws, including repeal of sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>tion 212(c) of the Act, inapplicable to those aliens in deportation proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-4\">Moreover, the regulation at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(g), was retained at the time that the new regulations pertaining to relief under former section 212(c) of the Act were enacted in accordance with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289 [121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347] (2001). As a result, while the AEDPA changes to the old deportation laws should apply to bar the respondent from eligibility for a section 212(c) waiver for his 2000 conviction, the regulation at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(g) bars that result. Thus, the respondent\u2019s case is governed by the pre-AEDPA versions of former section 212(c) of the Act as those versions relate to his various convictions unless the regulation at 8 C.F.R. 1212.3(h)(3) bars that outcome. In this regard, we find that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(h)(3) should not be read to automatically bar relief under former section 212(c) of the Act for an alien who remains in old-law deportation proceedings because to do so would countermand section 309(c) of the IIRIRA which specifically preserved relief under former section 212(c) of the Act for aliens in old-law deportation proceedings such as the respondent in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">JA 4. The BIA\u2019s reasoning is persuasive; Beltran\u2019s deportation proceedings are governed by pre-AEDPA law, and he remains eligible for relief under \u00a7 1182(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">In its brief, DHS adopts the BIA\u2019s position that Beltran\u2019s case is governed by pre-AEDPA law and that he remains eligible for \u00a7 1182(c) relief. Respondent\u2019s Br. at 28-32. Further, DHS agrees with Bel-tran that if the BIA is reversed on the \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d issue, the case should be remanded to the immigration court for consideration of the merits of Beltran\u2019s petition for \u00a7 1182(c) relief. Respondent\u2019s Br. at 53-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">For the reasons stated above, we REVERSE the decision of the BIA and REMAND the case to the immigration court with instructions to consider the merits of Beltran\u2019s petition for relief from deportation under \u00a7 ' 1182(e).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-8\">.
