To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence [s]he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Amouzou fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that she seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-29\">Additionally, we uphold the denial of Amouzou\u2019s request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum-even though the facts that must be* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>proved are the same-an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because Amouzou fails to show that she is eligible for asylum, she cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">We also find that substantial evidence supports the finding that Amouzou failed to meet the standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2008). We find that Am-ouzou failed to make the requisite showing before the immigration court. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review in Case No. 07-1074.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">In Case No. 07-1576, Amouzou contends that the Board abused its discretion in denying her motion to reopen. Based on our review of the record, we find no abuse of discretion in the Board\u2019s finding that Amouzou failed to establish that the evidence she sought to introduce was previously unavailable. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2008) (setting forth standard of review); <em>Onyeme v. INS, </em>146 F.3d 227, 234 (4th Cir.1998) (recognizing the failure to introduce previously unavailable, material evidence as an independent ground on which a motion to reopen may be denied). We therefore deny the petition for review in Case No. 07-1576.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Finally, in Case No. 07-1977, Amouzou claims that the Board abused its discretion in denying her motion to reconsider and in denying her request for sua sponte reopening. We find no abuse of discretion in the Board\u2019s finding that Amouzou failed to establish an error of fact or law in its prior decision. Additionally, we lack jurisdiction to review Amouzou\u2019s claim that the Board should have exercised its sua sponte power to reopen her removal proceedings. <em>See Lenis v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 1291, 1292-93 (11th Cir.2008) (collecting cases). We therefore deny the petition for review in Case No. 07-1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">Accordingly, we deny all three petitions for review as set forth above. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
