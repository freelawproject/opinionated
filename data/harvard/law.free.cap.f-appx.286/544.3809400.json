Rule 43(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b571-17\">ORDER DENYING CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b571-18\">Appellant, Fredrick Cameron, seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) from this court so he can appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habe-as petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (providing no appeal may be taken from a final order disposing of a \u00a7 2254 petition unless the petitioner first obtains a COA). Because Cameron has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d this court denies his request for a COA and dismisses this appeal. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-19\">Cameron was convicted by a Kansas jury of one count of criminal possession of a firearm, in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 21-4204(a)(2), and one count of unlawful possession of a controlled substance, in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 65-4162(a)(3). He was sentenced to concurrent terms of twenty-one months\u2019 imprisonment on the firearm charge and twelve months\u2019 imprisonment on the drug charge. He filed a direct appeal with the Kansas Court of Appeals, arguing (1) the state did not presented sufficient evidence to support the firearm conviction and (2) his sentence was unconstitutionally increased by using prior convictions not submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The Kansas Court of Appeals denied relief on both claims. As to the sufficiency of the evidence claim, the court reviewed the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the state and concluded a rational jury could have convicted Cameron on that evidence. The court rejected the sentencing claim, holding recidivism is specifically exempted from the Supreme Court\u2019s rulings in <em>Ap-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number><em>prendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). <em>See State v. Ivory, </em>273 Kan. 44, 41 P.3d 781, 783 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Cameron filed the instant \u00a7 2254 habeas petition on April 18, 2007. In his petition, Cameron raised the sufficiency-of-the-evidence and sentencing claims previously raised on direct appeal. Applying the standard set forth in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, the district court concluded the Kansas Court of Appeals\u2019 adjudication of those two claims was not contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 309, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>see also Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 301, 124 S.Ct. 2531; <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">To be entitled to a COA, Cameron must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make the requisite showing, he must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (quotations omitted). In evaluating whether Cameron has satisfied his burden, this court undertakes \u201ca preliminary, though not definitive, consideration of the [legal] framework\u201d applicable to each of his claims. <em>Id. </em>at 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029. Although Cameron need not demonstrate his appeal will succeed to be entitled to a COA, he must \u201cprove something more than the absence of frivolity or the existence of mere good faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">This court has reviewed Cameron\u2019s application for a COA and appellate brief, the district court\u2019s order, and the entire record on appeal pursuant to the framework set out by the Supreme Court in <em>Miller-El </em>and concludes that Cameron is not entitled to a COA. The district court\u2019s resolution of Cameron\u2019s claims is not reasonably subject to debate and the claims are not adequate to deserve further proceedings. Accordingly, Cameron has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d and is not entitled to a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">This court denies Cameron\u2019s request for a COA and dismisses this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
