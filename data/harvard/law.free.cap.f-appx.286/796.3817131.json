The IJ, finding that Jerez-Sanchez\u2019s experiences did not constitute persecution, denied her application. Jerez-Sanchez appealed the decision to the BIA, which remanded the case so that she could present evidence of current conditions in Guatemala. On remand, the IJ, adopted the reasoning of the previous Immigration Judge, denied the application, and granted Petitioners voluntary departure in lieu of removal to Guatemala. Jerez-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>Sanchez appealed and the BIA affirmed the decision of the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a). We uphold the BIA\u2019s determinations if they are supported by reasonable, substantial and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>Yusupov v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>518 F.3d 185, 197 (3d Cir.2008). Where the BIA substantially adopts the findings of the IJ, we review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA. <em>He Chun Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>376 F.3d 215, 222 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">To establish eligibility for asylum, Jer-ez-Sanchez must show a reasonable likelihood that she experienced past persecution or that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution \u201con account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A) (referring to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A)); <em>Chukwu v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>484 F.3d 185, 188 (3d Cir.2007). To obtain withholding of removal, she must demonstrate a clear probability that her life or freedom would be threatened in Guatemala on account of her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A); <em>Romanishyn v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>455 F.3d 175, 178 n. 1 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Jerez-Sanchez\u2019s claim of past persecution rested on various encounters her husband, family members, neighbors and friends had with guerilla forces from 1980 to 1991.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Jerez-Sanchez testified that guerillas threatened her fianc\u00e9, brother-in-law and father. She believes her family was targeted by guerillas because they informed the government of the guerillas\u2019 whereabouts and were members of the Civilian Patrol. Finally, Jerez-Sanchez testified that, since she left Guatemala, her two sisters were raped in her home town and a friend of the family was killed by guerillas while working as a security guard at a bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">While Jerez-Sanchez\u2019s experiences in Guatemala are tragic, they do not constitute past persecution under Immigration and Nationality Act. <em>See Konan v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 497, 506 (3d Cir.2005)(general conditions of civil unrest or chronic violence and lawlessness do not support asylum). Jerez-Sanchez failed to testify to any personal harm she suffered at the hands of guerillas. <em>See Cham v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>445 F.3d 683, 693 (3d Cir.2006) (an applicant cannot rely solely on the persecution of her family members to qualify for asylum). Further, the threats made by guerillas were not personally directed at her, nor can they be described as \u201chighly imminent, concrete and menacing.\u201d <em>Chavarria v. Gonzalez, </em>446 F.3d 508, 520 (3d Cir.2006). Because Jerez-Sanchez failed to demonstrate past persecution she was not eligible for discretionary grant of asylum for humanitarian reasons. <em>See Al-Fara v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 733, 740 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">Jerez-Sanchez also failed to prove a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Gomez-Zuluaga v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>527 F.3d 330, 345 (3d Cir.2008). Jerez-Sanchez presented only her subjective belief that guerillas were still active in Guatemala. <em>See Kibinda v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>477 F.3d 113, 120 (3d Cir.2007) (well founded fear of persecution must be supported by objective evidence). She did not present any tangible evidence that her family is being targeted because they were government informants. Moreover, the U.S. State Department Country Report on Gua-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>t\u00e9mala indicates that there were no substantiated reports of politically motivated killings in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">We find no merit in Jerez-Sanchez\u2019s contention that she did not receive an individualized determination from the BIA. <em>See Abdulai v. Ashcroft, </em>239 F.3d 542, 549 (3d Cir.2001). The BIA opinion specifically identifies and rejects arguments she made in front of the IJ. <em>Id. </em>at 550.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">For the above-stated reasons, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b823-15\">. The children\u2019s applications are derivative of Jerez-Sanchez\u2019s asylum application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b824-7\">. Because we write solely for the parties who are familiar with the facts, we will not recount each incident in detail. The incidents, however, were violent and often ended in the death of Jerez-Sanchez\u2019s family or friends.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b825-17\">. Because Jerez-Sanchez failed to make out an asylum claim, she necessarily failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Lukwago </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 157, 182 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
