Because the parties are familiar with the facts of this case, we do not recount them here. We review de novo an appeal from an order denying a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of qualified immunity, and we affirm in part and dismiss in part. <em>Kennedy v. City of Ridgefield, </em>439 F.3d 1055, 1059 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">I. <em>Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">As an initial matter, we address Tubar\u2019s renewed motion to dismiss this interlocutory appeal for lack of jurisdiction. A district court\u2019s rejection of an individual defendant\u2019s defense of qualified immunity, insofar as it rests on a question of law, is immediately appealable as a collateral order. <em>See Behrens v. Pelletier, </em>516 U.S. 299, 306, 116 S.Ct. 834, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996). In denying Clift\u2019s motion for summary judgment, however, the district court noted that there were disputed issues of fact, which generally deprives us of jurisdiction \u201cto consider an interlocutory appeal.\u201d <em>See Collins v. Jordan, </em>110 F.3d 1363, 1370 (9th Cir.1996). But because the parties accept Tubar\u2019s version of the material facts as true for purposes of this appeal, we conclude that we may properly exercise jurisdiction over Clift\u2019s appeal. <em>See Wilkins v. City of Oakland, </em>350 F.3d 949, 951 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cWhere disputed facts exist, we will determine if the denial of qualified immunity was proper by assuming that the version of events offered by the non-moving party is correct.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-15\">We decline to exercise pendant appellate jurisdiction over the City of Kent\u2019s appeal, and accordingly, we dismiss the City\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Ordinarily, an individual defendant\u2019s interlocutory appeal from an order denying qualified immunity does not support the exercise of pendant appellate jurisdiction to review the denial of a municipality\u2019s motion for summary judgment in a \u00a7 1983 action. <em>Huskey v. City of San Jose, </em>204 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>F.3d 893, 902 (9th Cir.2000). We may, however, exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over a municipality\u2019s interlocutory appeal where the municipality\u2019s \u00a7 1983 liability is \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the individual defendant\u2019s claim of qualified immunity. <em>Id. </em>at 904-06. That is, where resolution of an officer\u2019s assertion of qualified immunity will necessarily resolve the municipality\u2019s liability under <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), we may assert pendant appellate jurisdiction. Because we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Clift\u2019s summary judgment motion, our decision in his appeal does not conclusively resolve the City\u2019s municipal liability under \u00a7 1983. The City\u2019s claims are thus not inextricably intertwined, and we may not exercise pendant appellate jurisdiction over the City\u2019s appeal. <em>See Huskey, </em>204 F.3d at 905-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Tubar\u2019s renewed motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is denied in part and granted in part. The City\u2019s appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">II. <em>Merits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Clift argues that the district court erred when it determined that Tubar had alleged a constitutional violation, because: 1) Clift did not \u201cseize\u201d Tubar for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, and, alternatively, 2) even if Clift\u2019s actions constituted a seizure, they were objectively reasonable and did not violate Tubar\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. Clift further argues that the law was not clearly established at the time of the shooting such that a reasonable officer facing circumstances similar to those in this case would have known that his actions were unlawful. We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Qualified immunity protects government officials acting in their official capacities from civil liability unless their conduct violates \u201cclearly established\u201d statutory or constitutional rights of which a \u201creasonable\u201d official would have known. <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). A police officer is entitled to qualified immunity from suit alleging excessive force unless, under the \u201cparticularized\u201d circumstances he faced at the time of his actions, it would have been clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted. <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">In <em>Saucier, </em>the Supreme Court imposed a specific, sequential analysis for determining whether qualified immunity is warranted. We first consider whether the facts alleged, taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, show that the officer\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right. <em>Id. </em>at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151. If we find that no violation occurred, \u201c[t]he inquiry ends,\u201d and \u201cthe plaintiff cannot prevail.\u201d <em>Motley v. Parks, </em>432 F.3d 1072, 1077 (9th Cir. 2005) (en banc). If the facts alleged demonstrate a constitutional violation, we will then consider whether the right in question was \u201cclearly established\u201d such that a reasonable officer would know that \u201chis conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\u201d <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">Tubar\u2019s excessive force claim is governed by the Fourth Amendment, because \u201capprehension by the use of deadly force is a seizure subject to the reasonableness requirement of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Tennessee v. Garner, </em>471 U.S. 1, 7, 105 S.Ct. 1694, 85 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985). <em>See also Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 395, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989) (holding that a claim that a law enforcement official used excessive force in making an arrest, investigatory stop, or other \u201cseizure\u201d is judged under the Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Amendment\u2019s objective \u201creasonableness\u201d standard); <em>Scott v. Harris, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 1777, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007) (declining to establish a special rule for deadly force and explaining that <em>\u201cGarner </em>was simply an application of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s \u2018reasonableness\u2019 test\u201d articulated in <em>Graham). </em>A seizure is the \u201cintentional acquisition of physical control\u201d by a government actor; a seizure occurs \u201cwhen there is a governmental termination of freedom of movement <em>through means intentionally applied.\u201d Brower v. County of Inyo, </em>489 U.S. 593, 596-97, 109 S.Ct. 1378, 103 L.Ed.2d 628 (1989) (emphasis in original). Clift argues that he did not seize Tubar because Tubar was not the intended object of the gunfire. This argument is unavailing. Because both More-house and Tubar were suspects at the time that Clift shot at the vehicle, Clift\u2019s intent to stop the vehicle also constituted intent to seize both of them. Accordingly, we conclude that by shooting Tubar, Clift seized Tubar for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Clift\u2019s argument that the seizure was objectively reasonable likewise fails. We assess an allegedly excessive use of deadly force according to the rule set forth in <em>Gamer: </em>\u201c[wjhere the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious bodily harm [or death], either to the officer or to others, it is not constitutionally unreasonable to prevent escape by using deadly force.\u201d <em>Garner, </em>471 U.S. at 11, 105 S.Ct. 1694. Taking Tubar\u2019s allegations as true, a jury could conclude that Clift was never in danger, and even assuming that he acted reasonably when he fired the first two shots, the vehicle was no longer a threat when he fired the third shot. <em>See Blanford v. Sacramento County, </em>406 F.3d 1110, 1116-19 (9th Cir.2005). We conclude that at this stage of the litigation \u2014 summary judgment \u2014 Tubar produced sufficient evidence to show that Clift\u2019s use of deadly force amounted to a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Finally, we are unpersuaded by Clift\u2019s argument that the law was not clearly established at the time of the shooting such that a reasonable officer would have known that his actions were unlawful. We agree with the district court that our decision in <em>Acosta v. City and County of San Francisco, </em>83 F.3d 1143 (9th Cir.1996), clearly established Tubar\u2019s right not to be shot in a car that posed no immediate danger to the police officer or others. <em>Sec also Garner, </em>471 U.S. at 11, 105 S.Ct. 1694. Taking Tubar\u2019s factual allegations as true, no reasonable officer could have thought that the use of deadly force was reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">AFFIRMED in part, DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b375-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
