We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">When the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed no more than sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S. Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on April 20, 2006. The notice of appeal was filed, at the earliest, on October 22, 2007.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because AlomiaTorres failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b38-10\"> In accordance with Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1) and <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988), a prisoner\u2019s notice of appeal is deemed \u201cfiled\u201d when it is deposited into the institution's mail system. Alomia-Torres' notice of appeal is dated October 22, 2007, and we conclude that this was the earliest date it could have been filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
