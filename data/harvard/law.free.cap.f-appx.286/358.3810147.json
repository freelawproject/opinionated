Cuesta appeals his conviction in magistrate\u2019s court for knowingly driving a motor vehicle carrying alcoholic beverages while under the age of 21, in violation of Cal. Veh.Code \u00a7 23224(a), while in a National Park. <em>See </em>36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.2(b) (prohibiting the violation of state traffic and vehicle laws in park areas). On the initial appeal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3402, the district court affirmed Cuesta\u2019s conviction. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-15\">Cuesta first contends that the Park Ranger lacked the requisite level of suspicion to stop Cuesta\u2019s vehicle, and that the length and scope of the stop exceeded its justification. We review the reasonableness of an investigatory stop <em>de novo, see United States v. Grigg, </em>498 F.3d 1070, 1074 (9th Cir.2007), including \u201c[t]he determination of whether a seizure exceeds the bounds of an investigatory <em>Terry </em>stop and becomes an arrest,\u201d <em>United States v. Charley, </em>396 F.3d 1074, 1079 (9th Cir.2005). We hold that the park employees\u2019 tip gave rise to the reasonable suspicion that Cues-ta, or some other individual in the car, was committing an ongoing crime, <em>see Grigg, </em>498 F.3d at 1074-75, or was \u201cwanted in connection with a past misdemeanor that the police may reasonably consider to be a threat to public safety[,]\u201d such as driving under the influence, <em>id. </em>at 1081. Although a seizure under <em>Terry </em>may not amount to an arrest without probable cause, \u201c[t]he period of detention was permissibly extended because new grounds for suspicion of criminal activity continued to unfold.\u201d <em>United States v. Mayo, </em>394 F.3d 1271, 1276 (9th Cir.2005). Specifically, the admission of Cuesta and his passengers that they had been drinking and that they were under the age of 21 gave rise to probable cause to search the vehicle for alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-16\">Cuesta next contends that he was in custody at the time the ranger questioned him, and his statements therefore were taken in violation of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). We review <em>de novo </em>whether a defendant was in custody at the time law enforcement officers elicited incriminating statements such that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required. <em>United States v. Leasure, </em>122 F.3d 837, 839-40 (9th Cir.1997) (per curiam). The ranger\u2019s questioning of Cuesta never exceeded the purpose of the <em>Terry </em>stop, and thus the investigation did not become a custodial interrogation for purposes of <em>Miranda. See United States v. Cervantes-Flores, </em>421 F.3d 825, 830 (9th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (noting that <em>Terry </em>expressly allows officers to ask questions \u201creasonably related in scope to the justification for their initiation\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Cuesta further contends that the magistrate judge\u2019s reopening of his trial, following the magistrate judge\u2019s oral grant of his motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 29, violated his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. However, \u201c[d] ouble-j eopardy principles have never been thought to bar the immediate repair of a genuine error in the announcement of an acquittal,\u201d <em>Smith v. Massachusetts, </em>543 U.S. 462, 474, 125 S.Ct. 1129, 160 L.Ed.2d 914 (2005), and thus the grant of a Rule 29 motion must be sufficiently final to terminate jeopardy. Although the magistrate judge\u2019s initial ruling appears to be unequivocal, he reconsidered his determination immediately thereafter, both by asking if the government wanted to be heard, and then wondering aloud whether the government provided evidence of an essential element. Further, the magistrate judge did not give either party the opportunity to argue the motion before granting it, making it less likely that his decision was on the merits. <em>See United States v. Byrne, </em>203 F.3d 671, 673-74 (9th Cir.2000) (discussing factors used to determine finality). The trial court \u201cis afforded wide discretion in determining whether to allow the government to reopen and introduce evidence after it has rested its case.\u201d <em>United States v. Suarez-Rosario, </em>237 F.3d 1164, 1167 (9th Cir.2001). Based on the record before us, we cannot say that the magistrate judge abused his discretion in granting the government\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Cuesta argues that the magistrate judge should not have admitted testimony by the ranger concerning the date of birth reported on Cuesta\u2019s driver\u2019s license. The record indicates, however, that the magistrate judge did not ultimately rely on the testimony concerning Cuesta\u2019s driver\u2019s license in order to establish that Cuesta was under 21. Because we will only reverse an erroneous evidentiary ruling if it \u201cmore likely than not affected the verdict[,]\u201d <em>United States v. Pang, </em>362 F.3d 1187, 1192 (9th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), we find it unnecessary to consider whether the magistrate judge erred in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Finally, Cuesta contends that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he knew there were alcoholic beverages in his vehicle. \u201cThere is sufficient evidence to support a conviction if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Shipsey, </em>363 F.3d 962, 971 n. 8 (9th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Under this standard, the circumstantial evidence of Cues-ta\u2019s knowledge was sufficient to uphold the magistrate judge\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
