HOLMES, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">Plaintiff-Appellant Earl K. Shriner, appearing pro se, challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his civil rights complaint for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Reviewing Mr. Shriner\u2019s filings liberally,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we hold that the district court properly dismissed his claim and, for substantially the same reasons as the district court, AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">In November of 2007, Mr. Shriner, who is incarcerated at the Larned Correctional Mental Health Facility,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> filed a number of grievances seeking a transfer to a state hospital for a competency evaluation. Mr. Shriner alleged that he had \u201ca mental block\u201d and \u201cother things\u201d he is \u201cnot sure of.\u201d R., Vol. I, Doc. 1, at 2 (CM Rights Complaint, filed Dec. 12, 2007). After his grievances were denied, he filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging violations of his constitutional rights. The district court construed his complaint to allege (1) an Eighth Amendment violation arising from the refusal to transfer him for a medical evaluation, and (2) a deprivation of due process resulting from the failure to evaluate his request for the transfer. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the district court dismissed Mr. Shriner\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim, finding it was obvious that his claims would fail. Mr. Shriner then appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-16\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b591-17\">We review a dismissal for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) de novo. <em>Perkins v. Kan. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>165 F.3d 803, 806 (10th Cir.1999). \u201cDismissal of a pro se complaint for failure to state a claim is proper only where it is obvious that the plaintiff cannot prevail on the facts he has alleged and it would be futile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>to give him an opportunity to amend.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In reviewing a pro se litigant\u2019s complaint, we accept the allegations as true and construe those allegations, and any reasonable inferences that might be drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Regarding Mr. Shriner\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim, the district court properly applied <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994), and <em>Perkins, supra, </em>in concluding that Mr. Shriner\u2019s complaint did not state an Eighth Amendment violation. Mr. Shriner\u2019s allegation that he was denied a transfer for the evaluation of his mental block does not demonstrate \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to his \u201csufficiently serious\u201d medical needs. <em>See Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970; <em>Perkins, </em>165 F.3d at 811. And a mere disagreement with the treatment offered by medical staff is not enough to establish an Eighth Amendment violation. <em>See Perkins, </em>165 F.3d at 811. Accordingly, Mr. Shriner could not prevail on his Eighth Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Regarding Mr. Shriner\u2019s due process claim, the district court properly determined that the failure to transfer does not implicate due process. Although an involuntary transfer to a mental hospital for treatment of a medical problem may implicate due process, a prison official\u2019s refusal to transfer an inmate to a hospital on demand does not deprive the inmate of any established liberty interest. <em>See San-din v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 479 n. 4, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995). Here, Mr. Shriner is already in a facility designed to treat mental health issues, and the prison\u2019s decision not to transfer him to a state hospital should be afforded deference. <em>See id. </em>at 482-83, 115 S.Ct. 2293. Accordingly, Mr. Shriner could not prevail on a claim that he was denied due process by the denial of his requested transfer to a state hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Shriner\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">We also GRANT Mr. Shriner\u2019s request for leave to proceed without prepayment of the appellate filing fee. Although Mr. Shriner has made partial payments toward his district court filing fee, we remind him of his continuing obligation to make such payments until both his district court and appellate fees have been paid in full. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b)(1) \u2014 (2).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b591-13\"> This Order and Judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1. After examining the briefs and the appellate record, this three-judge panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not be of material assistance in the determination of this appeal. See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-14\">. Because Mr. Shriner is proceeding pro se, we review his pleadings and filings liberally. See <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972); <em>Howard v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, </em>487 F.3d 808, 815 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b591-19\">.
