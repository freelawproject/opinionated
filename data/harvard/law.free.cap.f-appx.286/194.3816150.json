Ellsworth appeals the 60-month non-guidelines sentence imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>following his guilty plea conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Ells-worth argues for the first time on appeal that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it reflects the district court\u2019s consideration of a prior conviction for illegal possession of a firearm, for which he asserts he was unrepresented.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">When the district court imposes a non-guidelines sentence, we \u201cmay consider the extent of the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Even if we \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate, [this] is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">We \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>see United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 524-25 (5th Cir.2008), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(June 30, 2008) (No. 08-5101). The district court provided extensive justification for the sentence and concluded that a non-guidelines sentence of 60 months of imprisonment was appropriate. In light of the deferential standard set forth in <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597-98, we find that the sentence imposed by the district court was not substantively unreasonable or an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">Ellsworth also argues that the district court was required to provide him with notice before imposing a non-guidelines sentence. As Ellsworth concedes, this argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>United States v. Mejia-Huerta, </em>480 F.3d 713, 722-23 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2954, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2008); <em>see also Irizarry v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2198, 2202-04,171 L.Ed.2d 28 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-16\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b220-38\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
