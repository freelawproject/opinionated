The order is not appeal-able unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Coombs has not made the req<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>uisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability, deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis, and dismiss the appeal. We deny as moot Coombs\u2019 motion to place this appeal in abeyance until March 3, 2008.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b834-18\"> To the extent Coombs seeks retroactive application of <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1 (2007) (Amendment 706) to his sentence, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(c) (Mar. 3, 2008), he may apply for a reduction in the district court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
