Luis was sentenced to 46 months\u2019 incarceration, three years supervised release, and a $100 special assessment. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">We review a challenged sentence for reasonableness, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261-64, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a standard that applies both to the sentence imposed and the procedures employed in determining the sentence. <em>See United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 26 (2d Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103, 114-15 (2d Cir.2005). In both respects, we review for abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court committed neither procedural nor substantive error in sentencing Luis. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
