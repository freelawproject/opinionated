We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-25\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s order affirming the administrative law judge\u2019s denial of benefits. <em>Lewis v. Apfel, </em>236 F.3d 503, 509 (9th Cir.2001). The agency\u2019s decision must be affirmed if it was supported by substantia] evidence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>based on the application of correct legal standards. <em>See Batson v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>359 F.3d 1190, 1193 (9th Cir. 2004) .</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">We reject Barnard\u2019s argument that the ALJ erred by not further developing the record of her psychological and mental impairments. The ALJ\u2019s duty to develop the record fully is triggered when there is ambiguous evidence or when the record is inadequate. <em>See Mayes v. Massanari, </em>276 F.3d 453, 459-60 (9th Cir.2001). The record for evaluating the claimant\u2019s mental condition during the relevant period was adequately developed by an initial hearing and upon the stipulated remand from the district court. Barnard\u2019s psychological problems were not diagnosed until five years after the date last insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">Barnard also argues that the ALJ erred in rejecting a treating physician\u2019s conclusions drawn nine months after the date last insured. We disagree. An ALJ should ordinarily give great weight to a treating physician\u2019s findings in disability cases. <em>See Batson, </em>359 F.3d at 1195 (citing <em>Tonapetyan v. Halter, </em>242 F.3d 1144, 1149 (9th Cir.2001)). When these findings conflict with the opinion of other doctors, however, the ALJ may reject the testimony so long as he provides \u201cspecific and legitimate reasons that are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>See Bayliss v. Barnhart, </em>427 F.3d 1211, 1216 (9th Cir. 2005) ; <em>see also Andrews v. Shalala, </em>53 F.3d 1035, 1041 (9th Cir.1995) (holding that clear and convincing reasons are not required to reject contradicted conclusions of a treating physician). The ALJ pointed to inconsistencies in the doctor\u2019s opinion, her reliance on Barnard\u2019s subjective complaints, and clinical observations of two prior physicians that did not corroborate the doctor\u2019s conclusion. The ALJ is responsible for resolving conflicts and ambiguity in medical evidence. <em>See Lewis, </em>236 F.3d at 509. He has done so here; we will not substitute our judgment for his. <em>See Reddick v. Chater, </em>157 F.3d 715, 720-21 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-10\">The ALJ\u2019s determination that Barnard was not credible was supported by \u201cspecific, clear and convincing reasons.\u201d <em>See Lingenfelter v. Astrue, </em>504 F.3d 1028, 1036 (9th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1281 (9th Cir.1996)). The ALJ cited Barnard\u2019s reported lack of cooperative effort during physical evaluations as a reason to reject her testimony. This is a sufficient reason. <em>See Thomas v. Barnhart, </em>278 F.3d 947, 959 (9th Cir.2002). Furthermore, the ALJ concluded that Barnard\u2019s husband and a long-time friend testified to a level of debilitation that could not be supported by medical evidence. This is a valid reason for rejecting lay witness testimony. <em>See Lewis, </em>236 F.3d at 511; <em>see also Vincent ex rel. Vincent v. Heckler, </em>739 F.2d 1393, 1395 (9th Cir.1984) (\u201cAlthough courts have upheld the use of lay testimony in some instances, it is not the equivalent of medically acceptable diagnostic techniques that are ordinarily relied upon to establish a disability.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-11\">Contrary to Barnard\u2019s argument, the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question to the vocational expert was based on medical assumptions that reflected the claimant\u2019s limitations. <em>See Roberts v. Shalala, </em>66 F.3d 179, 184 (9th Cir.1995). Barnard argues that the ALJ neglected to include limitations relating to an injury received a decade prior to the date last insured or her perceived limitations based on subjective measures of pain and fatigue. We find no error in these omissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-12\">Finally, the ALJ did not err when he failed to determine a date of disability onset. This must be done only after a claimant is found disabled. <em>See Crane v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number><em>Shalala, </em>76 F.3d 251, 255 (9th Cir.1996). The ALJ did not need to determine an onset date because the ALJ properly concluded that Barnard was not disabled at the last date insured, and that conclusion was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"axr-dedup-0\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b1016-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.

The treating physician\u2019s opinion is not inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-9\">In December 1998, Kimberly Goslin, M.D., Ph.D., an Assistant Professor of Neurology at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, began treating Plaintiff. According to Dr. Goslin, Barnard\u2019s MRIs, performed at the University, showed \u201csignificant abnormalities ... which can certainly explain many of her complaints,\u201d and her \u201cpain makes it difficult to perform a good motor examination ...\u201d Contrary to the ALJ\u2019s assertion, Dr. Goslin\u2019s opinion describing Barnard as <em>\u201ccurrently </em>fully disabled\u201d does not contradict her qualification that she had not yet completed her evaluation and could not make recommendations regarding <em>long term </em>disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-12\">The ALJ questioned how Plaintiff was unable to walk beyond a few feet without excruciating pain, and how her reported symptoms of upper extremity numbness, weakness, and pain corresponded with the MRI findings. In response, Dr. Goslin cautioned she \u201cgenerally prefer[s] not to be involved in disability issues regarding patients [she] is treating, especially when the chief complaint is pain which is so difficult to quantitate and prove.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She noted that Plaintiff has a history of fibro-myalgia and multiple traumas; MRIs that show \u201csignificant abnormalities in the cervical [spine] consistent with her symptoms\u201d; and low back and leg pain which she believes is musculoskeletal and \u201cperhaps related to her fibromyalgia.\u201d Dr. Goslin observed that \u201c[m]usculoskeletal pain can be quite severe and chronic,\u201d and \u201cstrongly recommended a physical therapy and rehabilitation program\u201d along with \u201canesthesia pain service treatment.\u201d The doctor <em>reiterated </em>her opinion that Plaintiff is \u201ccurrently disabled by her pain, but if there is continued doubt, it might be worthwhile to have a fibromyalgia expert evaluate her.\u201d Contrary to the ALJ\u2019s assertion, Dr. Goslin\u2019s letter does not represent a retreat from her first opinion. Dr. Goslin has not been inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-13\">B. Other physicians did not provide independent clinical findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-14\">\u201cBy rule, the Social Security Administration favors the opinion of a treating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>physician over non-treating physicians.\u201d <em>Orn v. Astrue, </em>495 F.3d 625, 631 (9th Cir.2007) (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527). If a treating source\u2019s medical opinion is not well-supported by medically acceptable evidence or is inconsistent with substantial evidence in the record, it is still entitled to deference. <em>See Orn, </em>495 F.3d at 632 (citing \u00a7 404.1527).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Two earlier treating physicians had diagnosed Plaintiff with fibromyalgia. In 1997, an examining physician described Plaintiff as an obese woman who demonstrated a consistent lack of effort. The ALJ relied on the examining doctor\u2019s observation of Barnard\u2019s \u201clack of effort\u201d but omitted the doctor\u2019s finding that a \u201csignificant decreased quadriceps reflex\u201d warranted an MRI scan,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that the \u201cdiagnosis of fibromyalgia [] [was] the most likely explanation\u201d of her neck pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">To refute a treating physician\u2019s opinion and relegate it to less than \u201ccontrolling weight,\u201d there must be \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d in the record that reflects another doctor\u2019s conflicting opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Orn, </em>495 F.3d at 632 (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2)). The ALJ must make findings setting forth specific, legitimate reasons for rejecting the treating physician\u2019s opinion. <em>See Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830-31 (9th Cir.1995). With the exception of his observation that Barnard \u201cdemonstrated a consistent lack of effort,\u201d there is no evidence that the examining doctor contradicted Dr. Goslin\u2019s opinions. Even if he had contradicted her, Dr. Gos-lin\u2019s opinion would still control.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-13\">To establish \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d the examining physician with a conflicting opinion must provide independent clinical findings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When an examining physician relies on the same clinical findings and differs only in his conclusions, the examining doctor\u2019s conclusions are not \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Orn, </em>495 F.3d at 632. Here, the examining physician did not offer independent clinical findings that differed from those of Dr. Goslin: he agreed that Plaintiff had fibromyalgia, recommended further testing, did not offer different diagnoses, and did not rely on medical tests not relied upon by Dr. Goslin. Therefore, the examining doctor\u2019s opinion, assuming they conflicted with Dr. Goslin\u2019s, would not have constituted \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-14\">In addition, the ALJ rejected Dr. Gos-lin\u2019s opinion because it was provided nine months after Barnard\u2019s date last insured<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> had expired. This reasoning is improper: \u201c[Mjedical evaluations made after the expi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>ration of a claimant\u2019s insured status are relevant to an evaluation of the pre-expiration condition.\u201d <em>Sampson v. Chater, </em>103 F.3d 918, 922 (9th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Smith v. Bowen, </em>849 F.2d 1222, 1225 (9th Cir.1988)). In fact, it is not uncommon that a physician\u2019s examination completed two or more years after the insured status expiration date is considered relevant. <em>See. Smith v. Bowen, </em>849 F.2d 1222, 1225 (9th Cir.1988) (citing several cases from other Circuits to support the court\u2019s conclusion). The record includes progressive worsening of Barnard\u2019s symptoms of degenerative disk disease such that Barnard eventually underwent an \u201canterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C5-6\u201d in December 2003,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which further bolsters Plaintiffs claim of a disabling pre-expiration condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">Despite ease law to the contrary, the ALJ accorded \u201cmarginal\u201d probative value to the more recent medical records because it was treatment five years after her date last insured. Moreover, the district court, in its remand, had ordered the update of medical records in February 2002, <em>four years </em>after Plaintiffs date last insured. It is fair to assume the court expected that the records would be considered regardless of the later time frame. Allocating such \u201cmarginal\u201d probative value does not comport with the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">C. The treating doctor did not rely primarily on Barnard\u2019s complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">Lastly, the ALJ found that \u201cDr. Goslin\u2019s conclusions were based in large part on [Plaintiffs] subjective complaints,\u201d which he found were not fully credible. This observation is misleading. Dr. Goslin based her opinion not only on Plaintiffs complaints but on her complete medical record (provided by the ALJ), the MRIs, and the doctor\u2019s physical examination of Barnard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-10\">\n<em>Adverse Credibility Findings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-11\">A. Rejecting Plaintiff\u2019s testimony was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-12\">\u201cPain of sufficient severity caused by a medically diagnosed anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormality may provide the basis for determining that a claimant is disabled.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Barnhart, </em>469 F.Supp.2d 793, 798 (D.Ariz.2006) (quoting <em>Light v. Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>119 F.3d 789, 792 (9th Cir.1997)) (inner quotations and citations omitted). It is undisputed that Plaintiff has at least two severe impairments, fibromyalgia and a 1991 status post left rotator cuff strain. Degenerative disk disease appears to be another significant, if not severe, impairment from the record overall.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Degenerative disk disease and fibromyalgia both can cause substantial pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-13\">\u201cMoreover, once a claimant produces objective medical evidence of an underlying impairment, an ALJ may not reject a claimant\u2019s subjective complaints based solely on lack of objective medical evidence to fully corroborate the alleged severity of pain.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>469 F.Supp.2d at 798 (quoting <em>Moisa v. Barnhart, </em>367 F.3d 882, 885 (9th Cir.2004)) (inner quotations, cita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>tions, and alteration omitted). Fibromyal-gia was diagnosed by every doctor who treated or examined Barnard, and although not specifically diagnosed, every doctor who saw Barnard examined or treated her for spinal degeneration and disease. Therefore, Barnard\u2019s complaints of severe pain cannot be rejected simply because the severity of her pain is not fully corroborated by the objective medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">The ALJ found Plaintiff \u201cnot fully credible\u201d because:</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">1) She has a long and consistent history of asserting extreme functional limitations for which objective findings are lacking; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">2) She demonstrated a consistent lack of effort during examinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">As already noted, the ALJ cannot rely solely on the lack of objective medical evidence to fully corroborate the alleged severity of pain. Moreover, Dr. Goslin opined that Barnard was unable to fully participate in the examinations due to her pain, which arguably explains her lack of effort. Furthermore, \u201c[ujnless the ALJ makes a finding of malingering based on affirmative evidence thereof, he or she may only find the claimant not credible by making specific findings as to credibility and stating clear and convincing reasons for each.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>469 F.Supp.2d at 798 (quoting <em>Robbins v. Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>466 F.3d 880, 883 (9th Cir.2006)) (inner quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">The ALJ did not make a finding of malingering and his reasons to support the adverse credibility finding are not clear and convincing. Although Plaintiff has arguably made some statements which could impact upon her credibility, they do not support an adverse credibility finding. Given the complete record before the Court, Plaintiffs credibility does not support denial of her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-10\">B. Rejecting husband\u2019s and family friend\u2019s testimony was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-11\">Lay testimony about a claimant\u2019s symptoms is competent evidence which the ALJ must consider unless he gives reasons for the rejection that are germane to each witness. <em>Nguyen v. Chater, </em>100 F.3d 1462, 1467 (9th Cir.1996). Plaintiffs husband testified that his wife was no longer able to do much of her previous activity, and that he did most of the household chores. The ALJ rejected this testimony for two reasons. First, the husband had \u201csecondary financial interests\u201d in assisting his wife to acquire benefits. This rationale contradicts our Circuit case law. Rejecting the testimony of family witnesses because they are biased would amount to a wholesale dismissal of any family member as a credible witness. <em>See Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1289 (9th Cir.1996) (\u201cThe fact that a lay witness is a family member cannot be a ground for rejecting his or her testimony\u201d). \u201cTo the contrary, testimony from lay witnesses who see the claimant every day is of particular value.\u201d <em>Smolen, </em>80 F.3d at 1289. \u201cBecause symptoms sometimes suggest a greater severity of impairment than can be shown by objective medical evidence alone, careful consideration must be given to any available information about symptoms.\u201d SSR 95-5p.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-12\">Second, the ALJ found that the testimony reflected observations of Plaintiff at the time the testimony was given rather than the earlier relevant time period. The ALJ also relied on this to reject the testimony of Plaintiffs friends. However, the husband\u2019s written statement, which parallels his oral testimony, was completed one year before Plaintiffs date last insured, and a friend\u2019s testimony referenced Plaintiffs symptoms \u201cover the last two years.\u201d Additionally, testimony is frequently taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>after the date last insured due to a significant time lapse between the claim for benefits and the ALJ hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">The ALJ\u2019s reasons for rejecting the lay testimony are not applicable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AjVN\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">The decision denying benefits is not supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, the ALJ made unsupported credibility determinations of the Plaintiff and gave little weight to the opinion of Plaintiffs treating physician, who found Barnard was fully disabled. The ALJ did not adequately assess the entire record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">For the foregoing reasons, I would remand for payment of benefits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1018-10\">. The ALJ specifically uses this statement to describe her reply as a \"retreat.'' He disregards the SSA's own observation, which mirrors that of Dr. Goslin: \"Because symptoms, such as pain, <em>are subjective and difficult to quantify, </em>any symptom-related functional limitations\u201d reported by claimant or others are taken into account if reasonably consistent with objective medical evidence. <em>See </em>20 C. F.R. 404.1529(c)(3) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">. The doctor recommended the MRI to ascertain if the decreased reflex was due to a disk herniation; however, it was not performed at that time because the SSA would not pay for it and Barnard did not have the funds or insurance to cover it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">. There is no evidence that the previous treating physicians offered any opinions that contradicted those of Dr. Goslin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1019-9\">. \"Independent clinical findings are either (1) diagnoses that differ from those offered by another physician and that are supported by substantial evidence; or (2) findings based on objective medical tests that the treating physician has not herself considered.\u201d Ora, 495 F.3d at 631 (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1019-15\">. <em>If </em>the doctor had provided independent clinical findings that differed from Dr. Goslin's, it would have been considered \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d and it is at this juncture that the ALJ would have had sole province to decide which of the conflicting opinions would control. <em>See Lingenfelter v. Astrue, </em>504 F.3d 1028, 1042 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1019-16\">. The \"date last insured\u201d is the last day of coverage based on a claimant's years of employment. In this case, Plaintiff's date last insured is March 31, 1998, and she must therefore establish disability status on and before that date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">. In 2002, Barnard was diagnosed with cervical and lumbar spine degeneration; in early September 2003, an MRI showed \"paracen-tral disc protrusion,\" and later that month, another MRI showed \"moderate diffuse spon-dvlotic changes,\u201d \"moderately severe spinal stenosis,\u201d and \"disc and osteophyte protrusion.\u201d In October 2003, Plaintiff was diagnosed with \"cervical myelopathy secondary to bilateral C5-6 disc herniation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1020-15\">. In fact, the ALJ focused primarily on Barnard's degenerative disk disease in his decision, rather than her fybromyalgia, which he tended to ignore in his analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1022-18\">. The Majority\u2019s reliance on a 1984 case to affirm the ALJ's rejection of lay testimony is not persuasive. <em>See Vincent on Behalf of Vincent v. Heckler, </em>739 F.2d 1393, 1395 (9th Cir.1984). The <em>Vincent </em>court offers a cursory observation that lay testimony is not equivalent to medical evidence, and at the same time acknowledges that the AU did not discuss the testimony in his decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
