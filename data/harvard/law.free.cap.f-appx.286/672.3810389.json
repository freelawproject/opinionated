He was assessed a 16-level increase in his base offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), based on his prior conviction of battery on a law enforcement officer, for which he served 21 days\u2019 imprisonment and which qualified as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d On appeal, Martinez-Gonzalez challenges the 16-level increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-23\">\u201cThe district court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines is subject to <em>de novo </em>review on appeal, while its factual findings must be accepted unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>419 F.3d 1189, 1192 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-24\">Under \u00a7 1326(a), any alien who has been deported and subsequently reenters the United States without permission is subject to a maximum two-year sentence. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Under the next subsection, the maximum sentence increases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-25\">(b) ... Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, in the case of any alien described in such subsection\u2014(1) whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for ... a felony (other than an aggravated felony), such alien shall be fined un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>der title 18, United States Code, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both; (2) whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony, such alien shall be fined under such title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, the base offense level for a defendant convicted of unlawfully entering or remaining in the United States is 8, but this offense level may be enhanced by 16 levels if \u201cthe defendant previously was deported ... after ... a conviction for a felony that is ... a crime of violence,\u201d by 8 levels following a conviction for an aggravated felony, or by 4 levels following a conviction for any other felony. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Under \u00a7 2L1.2, a \u201cfelony\u201d is defined as \u201cany federal, state, or local offense punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. 2). The guideline\u2019s definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d includes \u201cany offense under federal, state, or local law that has an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. l(B)(iii)). Finally, the guideline incorporates the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d as used in \u00a7 1101(a)(43), which includes, among other things, a crime of violence for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. 3(A)); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). Here, the parties agree that Martinez-Gonzalez\u2019s prior conviction for battery on a law enforcement officer constituted a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2, but it did not meet the requirements of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d because he was sentenced to less than one year of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">The gist of appellant\u2019s argument on appeal is as follows. He argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) evidences the congressional intent that the most serious crime of illegal reentry occurs when a defendant illegally reenters having been previously removed subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony. Appellant points out that the maximum sentence in such case is 20 years, and the maximum sentence is 10 years when a defendant reenters illegally having been previously removed subsequent to a conviction for any other felony. Appellant argues that the sentencing scheme set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b) is inconsistent with the foregoing congressional intent in that the Guideline provides for only an 8-level enhancement for an illegal entry following a conviction for an aggravated felony, whereas the Guideline provides a greater enhancement\u201416 levels\u2014-for an illegal reentry following conviction for a felony that is a crime of violence. Appellant argues that this scheme is inconsistent with the congressional intent, because Congress intended that the most serious crime of illegal reentry was one following conviction of an aggravated felony. Moreover, appellant argues that his prior conviction did not even qualify as an aggravated felony (because he was sentenced to less than one year of imprisonment). Thus, appellant argues, the appropriate sentence for him would be the sentence immediately below the sentence provided for illegal reentry following conviction of an aggravated felony\u2014i.e., an enhancement of only 4 levels applicable to illegal reentry following conviction for any other felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">We reject the premise of appellant\u2019s argument. We do not believe that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) was intended by Congress to fine tune the sentencing process in the manner suggested by appellant. To the contrary, the plain meaning of \u00a7 1326(b) merely establishes the maximum sentence. The congressional establishment of maxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>mum sentence is a far different enterprise than the congressionally mandated function of the Sentencing Commission\u2014he. to establish objective guidelines to assist district judges in f\u00edne tuning appropriate sentences for particular crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">Pursuant to the statute, the maximum sentence for illegal reentry by an alien whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for a felony (other than an aggravated felony) is 10 years. Appellant\u2019s sentence falls well within that maximum. As a pri- or panel of this court noted in a somewhat different context: \u201cA conflict could arise if application of the Guideline resulted in violation of the statute, as where the sentence arrived at by application of the Guideline exceeded the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>United States v. Lazo-Ortiz, </em>136 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.1998). However, such conflict did not arise in <em>Lazo-Ortiz, </em>and there is no conflict in this case between the statutory maximum and the relevant Guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Having rejected the premise of appellant\u2019s argument, we note that appellant has acknowledged that his prior conviction did constitute a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-23\">.
