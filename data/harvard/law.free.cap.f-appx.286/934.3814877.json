Cain claims that southern-Illinois attorney Ronald Osman, two lawyers working for Osman, and Osman\u2019s law firm \u2014 all Illinois citizens \u2014 stole Cain\u2019s proposal to bring a <em>qui tam </em>action against a St. Louis-based insurance company. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>dismissed Cain\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim. We affirm that dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">We draw all inferences in the light most favorable to Cain. <em>See Malone v. Nielson, </em>474 F.8d 934, 935 (7th Cir.2007). In August 1998, Cain approached Osman about filing a <em>qui tam </em>lawsuit against General American Life Insurance Company under the False Claims Act. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3729-33. Cain had been a podiatrist before losing his medical license. The reason, according to the complaint, is that he was performing \u201cexcessive Medicare surgeries,\u201d though malpractice also seems to have played a part. <em>See Cain v. State Bd. of Podiatry, </em>834 S.W.2d 260, 261 (Mo.Ct. App.1992); <em>Cain v. Arkansas State Podiatry Examining Bd., </em>275 Ark. 100, 628 S.W.2d 295, 296 (1982). He told Osman that, in his role as a Medicare provider, he had acquired information that would support a false-claims action against General American. In two separate mailings, Cain sent the lawyer his personal files totaling 400 typewritten pages plus exhibits; Harry Riggs, a former General American employee, was mentioned in those files. On September 10, 1998, Osman wrote Cain in response to his first mailing and told him that the law firm would \u201cnot be opening a file\u201d or \u201ctaking any action\u201d on Cain\u2019s behalf. Osman explained in his letter that, after reviewing Cain\u2019s materials, he did \u201cnot believe\u201d that Cain had a \u201cviable action under the False Claims Act.\u201d On September 18, Osman returned Cain\u2019s second mailing and reiterated that his law office would not be taking any action to assist Cain.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">Seven months later, however, Osman filed a <em>qui tam </em>action against General American on behalf of relators Harry Riggs and Nancy Riggs. <em>See United States ex rel. Riggs v. Gen. Am. Life Ins. Co., </em>No. 4:99-cv-00608-RWS (E.D. Mo. filed Apr. 16, 1999). The government took over the litigation and settled it in June 2002 for more than $70 million. Cain maintains that Osman purloined information from his files and used it to file <em>Riggs, </em>thus cheating him out of millions. He sued Osman and the other defendants in the Southern District of Illinois, claiming that they had committed the Illinois torts of fraud, outrage, bad faith, and conspiracy. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). We review that dismissal de novo. <em>Malone, </em>474 F.3d at 935.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">The elements of common-law fraud in Illinois are \u201c(1) a false statement of material fact; (2) defendant\u2019s knowledge that the statement was false; (3) defendant\u2019s intent that the statement induce plaintiff to act; (4) plaintiffs reliance upon the truth of the statement; and (5) plaintiffs damages resulting from reliance on the statement.\u201d <em>Wernikoff v. Health Care Serv. Corp., </em>376 Ill.App.3d 228, 315 Ill.Dec. 524, 877 N.E.2d 11, 16 (2007). The federal rules impose a higher pleading standard for fraud claims than typical notice pleading: \u201ca party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b); <em>see United States ex rel. Fowler v. Caremark RX, L.L.C., </em>496 F.3d 730, 740 (7th Cir.2007). This requirement means that a \u201ccomplaint alleging fraud must provide the who, what, when, where and how.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">Cain\u2019s fraud claim falters on all five elements, but we can limit our discussion to the first. Cain contends that his complaint alleges a statement of fact that is materially false: Osman\u2019s representation that he did not believe Cain had a \u201cviable action under the False Claims Act.\u201d This statement, however, is a legal opinion, not a representation of fact. It cannot support a fraud claim because, in \u201can action for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>fraud, the alleged misrepresentation must be one of fact and not an expression of opinion.\u201d <em>People ex rel. Peters v. Murphy-Knight, </em>248 Ill.App.3d 382, 187 Ill.Dec. 868, 618 N.E.2d 459, 463 (1993); <em>see Equity Capital Corp. v. Kreider Transp. Serv., Inc., </em>967 F.2d 249, 254 (7th Cir.1992) (\u201cUnder Illinois law, \u2018a representation is one of opinion rather than fact if it only expresses the speaker\u2019s belief, without certainty, as to the existence of a fact.\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Marino v. United Bank of Ill., N.A., </em>137 Ill.App.3d 523, 92 Ill.Dec. 204, 484 N.E.2d 935, 937 (1985))). Thus, putting aside that Cain always was free to consult other lawyers about his prospects for suing American General, Osman\u2019s opinion that Cain did not have a claim under the False Claims Act could not constitute a \u201cfalse statement of material fact.\u201d Moreover, Osman\u2019s successful representation of Hairy Riggs \u2014 a former American General employee turned whistle blower \u2014 does nothing to undermine the conclusion that Osman was expressing a legal opinion to Cain. Cain, who attributes the loss of his license to \u201cexcessive Medicare surgeries,\u201d does not even suggest any similarity between the <em>Riggs </em>litigation and the content of the files he disclosed to Osman \u2014 except that his files documented his own contacts with Harry Riggs when submitting Medicare claims to American General. That is not enough to satisfy his burden to plead the \u201cwho, what when, where, and how\u201d of a fraud scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">Cain also claims that Osman\u2019s actions constitute the tort of outrage. Outrage is a common-law tort that \u201coriginated as a catchall to permit recovery when an existing tort claim was unavailable, but in the narrow instances in which an actor\u2019s conduct exceeded all permissible bounds of a civilized society.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Torts \u00a7 45 cmt. a (Tentative Draft No. 5, 2007). In Illinois the tort of outrage is cited infrequently, and when it is, it tends to be used synonymously with intentional infliction of emotional distress. <em>See Robertson v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>95 Ill.2d 441, 69 Ill.Dec. 954, 448 N.E.2d 866, 868-69 (1983); <em>Feltmeier v. Feltmeier, </em>333 Ill. App.3d 1167, 268 Ill.Dec. 109, 777 N.E.2d 1032, 1037-38 (2002); <em>Doe v. Chand, </em>335 Ill.App.3d 809, 269 Ill.Dec. 543, 781 N.E.2d 340, 345, 347 (2002); <em>Calcagno v. Personal-care Health Mgmt., Inc., </em>207 Ill.App.3d 493, 152 Ill.Dec. 412, 565 N.E.2d 1330, 1337 (1991). Under Illinois law, a plaintiff claiming intentional infliction of emotional distress must prove that the defendant intentionally or recklessly engaged in \u201cextreme and outrageous conduct\u201d that caused severe emotional distress. <em>Sornberger v. City of Knoxville, Ill., </em>434 F.3d 1006, 1030 (7th Cir.2006); <em>see Lopez v. City of Chi, </em>464 F.3d 711, 720 (7th Cir. 2006). As with the tort of outrage, extreme and outrageous conduct is conduct that \u201cgoes beyond all bounds of decency and is considered intolerable in a civilized community.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>464 F.3d at 720 (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">The defendants\u2019 alleged misdeed did not constitute \u201cextreme and outrageous conduct\u201d under Illinois law. <em>See Pugh v. Tribune Co., </em>521 F.3d 686, 699 (7th Cir.2008) (\u201c[A] plaintiff can plead himself out of court by alleging facts that show there is no viable claim.\u201d). The factual scenario that Cain essentially alleges \u2014 that in reviewing Cain\u2019s files Osman and his codefendants gleaned a <em>qui tarn </em>theory and the name of a plaintiff to front it \u2014 is unseemly if true but does not come close to describing conduct that goes \u201c \u2018beyond all possible bounds of decency.\u2019\u201d <em>See Kleidon v. Rizza Chevrolet, Inc., </em>173 Ill. App.3d 116, 122 Ill.Dec. 876, 527 N.E.2d 374, 377 (1988) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 46, cmt. d (1965)). So the outrage claim is doomed at the outset, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>it\u2019s also worth noting that Cain does not allege that the conduct of the <em>defendants </em>actually caused him emotional distress, much less actionable distress \u201cso severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.\u201d <em>See Lifton v. Bd. of Educ. of City of Chi., </em>416 F.3d 571, 579 (7th Cir.2005). Cain\u2019s gripe is not that he suffered emotionally or even that he lost money out of his own pocket; instead, he simply contends that the defendants deprived him of the <em>financial reward </em>that, under the False Claims Act, motivates <em>qui turn, </em>plaintiffs to step forward and serve as \u201cprivate attorneys general.\u201d <em>See United States v. Bank of Farmington, </em>166 F.3d 853, 857-58 (7th Cir.1999); <em>United States ex rel. Hall v. Tribal Dev. Corp., </em>49 F.3d 1208, 1213 (7th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Finally, Cain\u2019s claims of bad faith and conspiracy fare no better than his other claims. \u201cBad faith\u201d is a label that Illinois courts sometimes apply in actions sounding in tort or contract, e.g., fraud, negligence, or breach of contract, but there is no independent tort of \u201cbad faith\u201d in Illinois outside of certain insurance cases involving an insurer\u2019s duty to act in good faith in responding to settlement offers. <em>See Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co. v. City of Chi., </em>260 F.3d 789, 797 (7th Cir.2001); <em>Twin City Fire Ins. Co. v. Country Mut. Ins. Co., </em>23 F.3d 1175, 1179-80 (7th Cir.1994); <em>Voyles v. Sandia Mortgage Corp., </em>196 Ill.2d 288, 256 Ill.Dec. 289, 751 N.E.2d 1126, 1131 (2001); <em>Cramer v. Ins. Exch. Agency, </em>174 Ill.2d 513, 221 Ill.Dec. 473, 675 N.E.2d 897, 903-04 (1996). Moreover, although Illinois does recognize a claim for civil conspiracy, there first must be an underlying tort, which, in Cain\u2019s situation, there is not. <em>See Borsellino v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., </em>477 F.3d 502, 509 (7th Cir.2007). Cain\u2019s allegations perhaps suggest an ethical breach, <em>see </em>III. R. Prof\u2019l Conduct 1.6(a), but \u201c[t]he mere fact that an attorney may have violated professional ethics does not, in and of itself, give rise to a cause of action for damages,\u201d <em>Owens v. McDermott, Will &amp; Emery, </em>316 Ill.App.3d 340, 249 Ill.Dec. 303, 736 N.E.2d 145, 157 (2000); <em>see Doe v. Roe, </em>289 Ill.App.3d 116, 224 Ill.Dec. 325, 681 N.E.2d 640, 649 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
