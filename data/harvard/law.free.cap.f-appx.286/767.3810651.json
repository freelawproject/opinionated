Videla, denying her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Pei Pei Liu a.k.a,. Bei Bei Liu a.k.a. Pei Liu a.k.a. Yun Jung Kim, </em>No. A 95 710 348 (B.I.A. Dec. 17, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 95 710 348 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 12, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Shu Wen Sun v. BIA </em>510 F.3d 377, 379 (2d Cir. 2007) (per curiam). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). For asylum applications governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination refusing to credit Liu\u2019s testimony regarding her persecution based on the practice of Falun Gong. The IJ reasonably identified several inconsistencies in the record and relied on Liu\u2019s demeanor to find that she testified as though she were \u201cworking from a script.\u201d <em>See Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 400-01 (2d Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-11\">The IJ appropriately found that Liu\u2019s inconsistent answers regarding her place of residence in the United States, whether she was a student when she left China, and whether she received medical care after her arrest by school authorities suggested that she was not testifying from actual experience. The IJ also properly based his adverse credibility finding on the omission from Liu\u2019s written application of the cadres\u2019 frequent visits to her home and appropriately rejected Liu\u2019s varying explanations for that omission. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005) (emphasizing that the agency need not credit an applicant\u2019s explanations for inconsistent testimony unless those explanations would compel a reasonable fact-finder to do so).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the same vein, the IJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>noted that Liu did not mention, during her airport interview, her alleged arrest by school authorities. The IJ was not obliged to credit Liu\u2019s explanation that she thought that immigration officials were asking whether she had been arrested by government authorities. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The IJ also relied on Liu\u2019s demeanor to find that she had memorized her answers. We owe this demeanor finding \u201cgreat deference.\u201d <em>Tu Lin, </em>446 F.3d at 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Given that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination, its denial of Liu\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief was proper because each claim rested on the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir .2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b794-8\">. Liu argues that she did, in fact, include the cadres\u2019 visits in her asylum application but that the discussion of the visits was left out of the English translation of her application. Liu offers a new translation of the application that mentions the visits. However, Liu did not raise this argument to the BIA, and thus it is not properly before us. <em>See Lin Zhong v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number><em>U.S. Dep't of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 123 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
