The district court sentenced Wheeler to a total of 152 months\u2019 imprisonment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Wheeler timely appealed. His attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), identifying no meritorious grounds for appeal but questioning whether the district court erred in calculating Wheeler\u2019s criminal history points. Wheeler filed a supplemental pro se brief claiming that he was denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Counsel questions whether the district court erred in calculating Wheeler\u2019s criminal history points, alleging that the government did not refute Wheeler\u2019s testimony that five of his prior convictions were attained without the representation of counsel. A defendant may challenge at sentencing the validity of a prior conviction on the ground that he was denied counsel. <em>Custis v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 485, 495, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994). However, he bears the burden of showing that the prior conviction is invalid. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>977 F.2d 105, 110-11 (4th Cir.1992). Wheeler had to overcome the presumption that the state court informed him of his right to counsel as it was required by statute to do, and that, if he was not represented, it was because he waived his right to counsel. <em>See Parke v. Raley, </em>506 U.S. 20, 28-34, 113 S.Ct. 517, 121 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992). Although he testified that he did not recall having counsel or waiving his right to counsel for the challenged convictions, Wheeler offered no affirmative evidence to rebut the presumption that he had counsel or signed a waiver of counsel form. Thus, the district court did not err in overruling Wheeler\u2019s objection and considering the prior convictions in calculating his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">In his supplemental pro se brief, Wheeler asserts that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel generally are not cognizable on direct appeal unless counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness conclusively appears on the record. <em>See United States v. James, </em>337 F.3d 387, 391 (4th Cir.2003). Wheeler fails to make this showing. Accordingly, we decline to consider this issue on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Wheeler\u2019s conviction and sentence. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is denied at this juncture. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
