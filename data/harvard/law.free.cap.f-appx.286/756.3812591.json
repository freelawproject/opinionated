Oct. 11, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-13\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted). In reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, this Court has remained mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that motions to reopen are \u201cdisfavored.\u201d <em>See Maghradze v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 150, 154 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 107, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-15\">As a preliminary matter, to the extent that Singh attempts to challenge the merits of the agency\u2019s underlying denial of his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) relief, that decision is not properly before this Court and we dismiss the petition for review to that extent. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>Ke Zhen Zhao, </em>265 F.3d at 89-90. Only the BIA\u2019s October 2007 decision is before us as that is the only decision from which a petition for review was timely filed. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). Additionally, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to reopen Singh\u2019s case <em>sua sponte </em>under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a), because such a decision is \u201centirely discretionary.\u201d <em>See Azmond Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-16\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that Singh failed to establish <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for the underlying relief he sought. <em>See Poradisova v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 70, 78 (2d Cir.2005). In his motion, Singh asserted that the Indian po<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>lice discovered his political activity in the United States. However, as the BIA noted, the IJ found Singh\u2019s testimony not credible, including his assertion that he was politically active in the United States. The BIA affirmed that credibility finding, which remains unchallenged. We have found that the BIA may deny a motion to reopen which fails to overcome a prior adverse credibility determination. <em>See Kaur, </em>413 F.3d at 234; <em>see also Qin Wen Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 143, 147-48 (2d Cir.2007). Thus, we find no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s denial of Singh\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
