FLETCHER, THOMAS, and WARDLAW, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b501-28\"> The panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b501-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-23\">Mickey Lynn Manning appeals from the 63-month sentence imposed following her guilty-plea conviction for conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and computer fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(a)(5)(A). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We vacate remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-27\">Manning contends that her guilty-plea was rendered involuntary because she was not sentenced pursuant to an agreement to set her total offense level at 23. We conclude that a plain reading of the plea agreement demonstrates that there was no such agreement and that her plea was knowing and voluntary. <em>See United States v. Schuman, </em>127 F.3d 815, 817-18 (9th Cir.1997) (per curiam); <em>see also United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number><em>States v. Nguyen, </em>235 F.3d 1179, 1182-83 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Manning also contends that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that she was an organizer under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. We conclude that the district court did not err when it determined that Manning was an organizer. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>497 F.3d 964, 969-70 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Additionally, Manning contends that the district court procedurally erred when it failed to address the sentencing factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), specifically her history and characteristics. We conclude that there was no procedural error. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 995-96 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Finally, Manning contends that the district court erred by delegating to the probation office the authority to apply unexpected monetary gains to her financial obligations and by imposing restrictions on the consumption of alcohol. We agree, and we remand to the district court for resentencing consistent with this decision. <em>See United States v. Betts, </em>511 F.3d 872, 876-81 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b501-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
