On appeal, he argues that his sentence is unreasonable. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-18\">We will affirm a sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release if it is within the prescribed statutory range and is not plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir. 2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1813, 167 L.Ed.2d 325 (2007). Here, it is uncontested that Strange sold crack cocaine on three occasions within one year of his release from confinement and that the district court sentenced Strange within his properly-calculated advisory sentencing range of 37-46 months. (J.A. 23). <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.4(a) (2006). Under these circumstances, we do not find that the district court\u2019s sentence was plainly unreasonable. <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 437; <em>see Rita v. United </em>States,U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (noting that \u201c[w]here a [sentencing] matter is ... conceptually simple\u201d and the record makes clear that the sentencing judge considered the evidence and arguments \u201cwe do not believe the law requires the judge to write more extensively.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-24\">Accordingly, we affirm Strange\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-25\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
