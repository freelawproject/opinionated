She challenges (1) the application of a single version of the Guidelines to all of her crimes, (2) the district court\u2019s failure to deduct pledged collateral from her intended loss, and (3) the reasonableness of her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-23\">Hunter maintains that the grouping of her crimes for sentencing under a single version of the Guidelines constitutes an Ex Post Facto Clause violation. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-24\">Although the district court did not explicitly state whether it was applying the grouping or relevant conduct provisions of the Guidelines, <em>compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2 <em>with </em>\u00a7 1B1.3, it appears that the district court\u2019s sentence depended wholly on grouping. For example, if the court had planned to use relevant conduct in sentencing, it would not have been considering earlier versions of the Guidelines during sentencing, because a relevant conduct calculation does not implicate the Ex Post <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Facto Clause. <em>United States v. Kienen-berger, </em>13 F.3d 1354, 1357 (9th Cir.1994). In addition, it would have been an incorrect application of the Guidelines to include all of Hunter\u2019s various crimes as relevant conduct, because her offenses were not part of the same \u201ccommon scheme or plan\u201d or \u201ccourse of conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 cmt. n. 9(A)-(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Having concluded that Hunter was, or should have been, sentenced under the grouping provision of the Guidelines, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2, we now hold that the district court\u2019s application of a single version of the Guidelines to all of Hunter\u2019s crimes violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. Hunter was sentenced under the 2003 version of the Guidelines, even though many of her conviction offenses occurred prior to 2000. Because there was a significant increase in the sentencing range from 2000 to 2003 in the Guidelines, Hunter\u2019s sentence violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. <em>United States v. Stevens, </em>462 F.3d 1169, 1170 (9th Cir.2006) (stating that \u201cthe Ex Post Facto Clause of the U.S. Constitution requires the defendant to be sentenced under the guidelines in effect at the time of the offense if the guidelines have undergone substantive changes that would disadvantage the defendant\u201d) (citing <em>United States v. Alfaro, </em>336 F.3d 876, 881 (9th Cir.2003)); <em>United States v. Ortland, </em>109 F.3d 539, 546 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">We therefore vacate Hunter\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing. Because we are vacating the sentence, we do not address whether the district court\u2019s sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Hunter also argues that the amount of intended loss, resulting from her fraudulent schemes, should have been reduced by the amount of collateral that she pledged in securing one of the loans. She failed, however, to provide evidence of any pledged collateral. We therefore affirm the district court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b508-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
