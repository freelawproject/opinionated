INS, </em>282 F.3d 1218, 1222 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The regulations provide that \u201ca party may file only one motion to reopen,\u201d and that the motion \u201cmust be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened.\u201d <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen as untimely because it was filed on August 10, 2007, more than 90 days after the November 6, 2006 final administrative decision. Accordingly, respondent\u2019s unopposed motion for summary disposition in part is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Further, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision declining to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s unopposed motion to dismiss this petition for review in part for lack of jurisdiction is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"a9l-dedup-0\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
