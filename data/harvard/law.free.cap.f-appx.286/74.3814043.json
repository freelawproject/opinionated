See Thompke v. Myrtle Beach, No. 4:05- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>cv-00452, 2007 WL 950388 (D.S.C. Mar. 26, 2007). We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on March 26, 2007. The notice of appeal was filed on September 26, 2007. Because Thompke failed to file a timely notice of appeal and the district court denied an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We deny Thompke\u2019s motion to preclude certain court staff from working on this appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
