The district court granted the Government\u2019s motion for a downward departure pursuant to <em>U.S. Sen</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number><em>tencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1 (2006), and sentenced Mancha to the statutory minimum of 240 months of imprisonment. Mancha timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">On appeal, counsel has filed an <em>Anders</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>brief, in which he states there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Mancha was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not filed a brief. The Government declined to file a brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Our review of the record reveals that the district court conducted a thorough inquiry pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 that ensured that Mancha\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary, and supported by a sufficient factual basis. Mancha\u2019s sentence was the mandatory minimum sentence. The district court was without authority, in the absence of a substantial assistance motion filed by the government pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007), to sentence Mancha below the statutory mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>450 F.3d 565, 568-69 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Mancha\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Mancha, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Man-cha requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Mancha.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b128-8\"><em> Anders v.
