(\u201cBQS\u201d) and Eugenio Tavares dos Santos (collectively \u201cPetitioners\u201d) appeal from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>district court\u2019s order upholding the Department of Homeland Security Administrative Appeals Office\u2019s (\u201cAAO\u201d) decision, which affirmed the United States Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services\u2019 (\u201cUSCIS\u201d) denial of their petition for an extension of dos Santos\u2019s L-1A visa as an intra-company transferee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(15)(L).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">After concluding that dos Santos was not eligible for an L-1A visa, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 1101(a)(15)(L), 1101(a)(44)(A), the AAO was not required to consider, sua sponte, whether dos Santos qualified for an L-1B visa as an employee acting in a position of \u201cspecialized knowledge,\u201d <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(15)(L). BQS never petitioned the USCIS to consider dos Santos for an L-1B classification, nor did it raise such argument in its appeal to the AAO. The Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) placed the burden of proof on Petitioners to demonstrate dos Santos\u2019s visa eligibility, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 1361, and the applicable regulations required B Q S to notify USCIS of any changes in dos Santos\u2019s capacity of employment, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.2(J )(7)(i)(C) (instructing the employer to \u201cfile an amended petition, with fee, at the Service Center where the original petition was filed to reflect ... [a] <em>change in capacity of employment (i.e., from a specialized knowledge position to a managerial position)\u201d </em>(emphasis added)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">In addition, the district court did not err in declining to invoke its equitable powers to allow BQS to submit evidence from outside the record or to conduct discovery. \u201cWhen reviewing an agency decision, \u2018the focal point for judicial review should be the administrative record already in existence, not some new record made initially in the reviewing court.\u2019\u201d <em>Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Serv., </em>450 F.3d 930, 943 (9th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Camp v. Pitts, </em>411 U.S. 138, 142, 93 S.Ct. 1241, 36 L.Ed.2d 106 (1973)). An exception to this rule applies where the plaintiff makes \u201ca showing of agency bad faith,\u201d <em>Sw. Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Forest Serv., </em>100 F.3d 1443, 1450 (9th Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted), but Petitioners have not made such a showing here. USCIS was not required to inform BQS that it had submitted insufficient evidence to support its claim that it was \u201cdoing business\u201d in the United States as 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.2(Z )(7)(i)(A)(3) requires. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 103.2(b)(8)(ii) (stating that if the required initial evidence is not submitted, USCIS \u201cin its discretion <em>may </em>deny the application or petition ... or request that the missing initial evidence be submitted within a specified period of time\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 103.2(b)(8)(iii) (stating that if the evidence submitted fails to establish eligibility, \u201cUSCIS <em>may ... </em>deny the application or petition ... [or] request more information or evidence from the applicant or petitioner\u201d (emphasis added)). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>The fact that the USCIS notified BQS that its petition failed to show that dos Santos was employed in a qualifying capacity did not require the agency to inform BQS that other aspects of its petition were deficient.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Finally, the district court did not have jurisdiction equitably to extend dos Santos\u2019s visa as Petitioners requested. <em>See Carrillo-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>353 F.3d 1077, 1079 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that \u201cthe doctrine of equitable tolling has no application\u201d to a statutory visa requirement and that an agency \u201cmay not invoke equitable powers to override Congress\u2019s explicit public policy determinations, reflected in the statutory framework\u201d for such matters (citing <em>INS v. Pangilinan, </em>486 U.S. 875, 884-85, 108 S.Ct. 2210, 100 L.Ed.2d 882 (1988))).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">Accordingly, the decision of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b990-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b991-7\">. In a concurrently filed opinion, we address Petitioners\u2019 claim that the agency abused its discretion in determining that dos Santos did not qualify for an L-1A visa. <em>See Brazil Quality Stones, Inc. v. Chertoff, </em>531 F.3d 1063 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b991-8\">. We construe as waived Petitioners\u2019 claim that the USCIS's denial of their petition violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because such claim was not raised in their opening brief. <em>See Paladin Assocs., Inc. v. Mont. Power Co., </em>328 F.3d 1145, 1164 (9th Cir.2003) (explaining that this court \u201cordinarily will not consider matters on appeal that are not specifically and distinctly argued in an appellant\u2019s opening brief\") (citing <em>Kim v. Kang, </em>154 F.3d 996, 1000 (9th Cir. 1998)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b992-10\">. Petitioners\u2019 reliance on <em>Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc), is unavailing. In that case, we equitably tolled the filing deadline on a petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen deportation proceedings after he was affirmatively misled by an Immigration and Naturalization Service agent's incorrect advice. <em>Id. </em>at 1184. In this case, Petitioners were not misled by any agency representations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
