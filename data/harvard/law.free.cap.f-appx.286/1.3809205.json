Boston\u2019s case was referred to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 686(b)(1)(B) (2000). The magistrate judge recommended that relief be denied and advised Boston that failure to file timely objections to this recommendation could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. Despite this warning, Boston failed to timely object to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-24\">The timely filing of objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned that failure to object will waive appellate review. <em>Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845\u201446 (4th Cir.1985). <em>See generally Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Boston has waived appellate review by failing to file timely objections after receiving proper notice. We accordingly deny a certificate of ap-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>pealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
