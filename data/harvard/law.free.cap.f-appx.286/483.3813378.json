R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b510-4\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">In these consolidated appeals, Francisco Vivanco-Gonzalez appeals from his conviction for illegal reentry in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, and from the district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Vivanco-Gonzalez contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment charging him with illegal reentry because, during removal hearings in 2005, his due process rights were violated when he was not adequately advised of his eligibility for pre-hearing voluntary departure. We conclude that Vivanco-Gonzalez cannot demonstrate prejudice from any due process violation because he also was removed in 1998, and he could not have been eligible for pre-hearing voluntary departure as to both removals. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(c); <em>United States v. Muro-Inclan, </em>249 F.3d 1180, 1184 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Because the district court did not err in denying the motion to dismiss the indictment, it did not err in concluding that Vivanco-Gonzalez had violated the condition of his supervised release that he not commit another Federal crime. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3); <em>United States v. Musa, </em>220 F.3d 1096, 1100 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b510-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
