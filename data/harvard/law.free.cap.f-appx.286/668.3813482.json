After a thorough review of the record, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">Louis arrived in the United States from Haiti on a business visa in December 2003 and exceeded his authorized stay. The Department of Homeland Security issued a notice to appear charging him with re-movability under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B). Louis applied for asylum,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging that he had been persecuted in Haiti based on his political opinion and work as a journalist in which he often criticized President Aristide. According to the asylum application and Louis\u2019s testimony at the removal hearing, between 2001 and 2003, Louis received a threatening phone call and he twice was approached by armed men looking for journalists.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, while a student at the university in 2002, Louis was a member of the Federation of Haitian University Students (\u201cFEUH\u201d), which was affiliated with an organization called Group 184 designed to bring about governmental change, and he participated in demonstrations. During a demonstration in July 2003, the chimeres Lavalas<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> threw stones at demonstrators and fired shots. On December 5, 2003, he participated in a demonstration with about 200 people on campus to denounce Aristide\u2019s dictatorship. Lavalas members arrived and attacked the demonstrators, breaking the legs of the faculty director. A man from Louis\u2019s neighborhood recognized Louis and threatened him, but Louis was able to escape unharmed and run to the radio station, where he learned employees were receiving threatening phone calls from Lavalas members who accused the station of opposing Lavalas. Following this incident, Louis went into hiding. Then, on December 15, 2003, a group of armed men associated with Lavalas came to his home, shot at the house, and banged in the gate demanding to see the journalist. Louis fled through the rear door and two weeks later came to the United States. Prior to his arrival, Louis had traveled to the United States for business and vacation about six times and had not requested asylum during any of these visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-15\">In support of the asylum application, Louis submitted numerous articles detailing threats made to journalists and radio stations in Haiti between 2000 and 2005.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Between 2000 and 2005, journalists were threatened, harassed, kidnaped and killed. Other articles described the rampant vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>lence occurring in Haiti, and one article urged U.S. citizens to leave Haiti due to violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The IJ denied relief, finding that there was no nexus between the alleged incidents and a protected ground, that Louis had not suffered past persecution, and that he had not shown a well-founded fear of future persecution. The IJ noted there was no evidence that Louis was well known or that Lavalas would be looking for him should he return. Thus, the IJ found that there was no evidence Louis could not relocate. On appeal to the BIA, the BIA concluded that the IJ had erred in finding that Louis was not targeted due to his political opinion, but that the incidents did not rise to the level of past persecution. The BIA further found that there was no well-founded fear of future persecution, as Louis could have relocated. This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Louis argues that he established past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution in light of the repeated threats Lavalas members have made towards journalists. Louis also asserts that Lavalas\u2019s affiliation with the government and its free reign over Haiti make it impossible for him to relocate to avoid future harm, and that he was not required to show an inability to relocate because the persecution was sponsored by the government.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The government responds that Louis failed to show an inability to relocate and, because there was no evidence that the alleged persecution was government sponsored, Louis had the burden to show it was unreasonable for him to relocate.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">We review only the decision of the BIA, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the opinion of the IJ. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir. 2001). Factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and this court \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted). A finding of fact will be reversed \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201cUnder this highly deferential standard of review, denial of relief may be reversed only if the evidence would compel a reasonable fact finder to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution exists.\u201d <em>Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 860 (11th Cir.2007). Legal determinations, however, are reviewed <em>de novo. Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1254 (11th Cir .2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">To be eligible for asylum, an applicant must prove that he is a \u201crefugee\u201d within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A); <em>see generally Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1231-32 (11th Cir.2007). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined, in relevant part, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-14\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">An applicant can prove refugee status in one of two ways: by demonstrating past persecution or fear of future persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">To establish asylum based on past persecution, the applicant must prove (1) that he was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1); <em>Sanchez Jimenez, </em>492 F.3d at 1232. A showing of past persecution creates a presumption of a \u201cwell-founded fear,\u201d subject to rebuttal by the government. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir. 2005). If the applicant fails to demonstrate past persecution, an applicant may still establish asylum based upon proof of a well-founded fear of future persecution by showing (1) a subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable fear of persecution that is (2) on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(i); <em>Sanchez Jimenez, </em>492 F.3d at 1232. Once the applicant makes an initial showing of fear of future persecution, the government may rebut the applicant\u2019s evidence by demonstrating, based upon a preponderance of the evidence, that the applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating within the country if, \u201cunder all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">Here, we will assume without deciding that Louis established past persecution and was entitled to the rebuttable presumption of future persecution. The issue is whether Louis could have relocated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">In evaluating whether it is reasonable for Louis to relocate, we consider whether Louis would face other serious harm in the place of suggested relocation; any ongoing civil strife within the country; administrative, economic, or judicial infrastructure; geographical limitations; and social and cultural constraints, such as age, gender, health, and social and familial ties. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(3). Under these factors, the government has met its burden to show Louis could have relocated reasonably. Aristide is no longer in power. And there is no evidence that Lavalas members know what Louis looks like or would seek him out if he relocated. Moreover, it appears that Louis fears the general violence that is prevalent in Haiti. When a threat of violence equally affects all people in a country regardless of them membership in a group or class, such a general threat of violence \u201cwill not support a finding of a well-founded fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Palma-Mazariegos v. Gonzales, </em>428 F.3d 30, 37 (1st Cir.2005) (cited with approval in <em>Daniel v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>194 Fed.Appx. 708 (11th Cir.2006) (unpublished)).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we DENY the petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-10\">. Because Louis offers no argument on the denial of withholding of removal or CAT relief, he has abandoned those issues. <em>Sepulve-da v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b695-11\">. Because the IJ did not make an adverse credibility finding, we consider Louis's testimony credible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b695-16\">. The chimeres Lavalas are supporters of Ar-istide.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b695-17\">. Neither Louis nor the government submitted any of the State Department's Country Reports for Haiti.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b696-8\">. In support of this claim, Louis cites the State Department\u2019s Country Reports from 2003 and 2004. As noted above, he did not submit these reports to the IJ, and, therefore, they are not properly before this court. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b697-8\">. Under the regulations, if the threat is government-sponsored, the court should assume that relocation is not an option unless the Attorney General can show that relocation was reasonable. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(3)(ii). We conclude that the threat was not government-sponsored. Louis alleged that he was persecuted by members of Lavalas, which was an organization supporting Haitian President Aristide. Aristide is no longer in power and thus, any future threat from Lavalas would not be government-sponsored. Nevertheless, even if the burden was on the government, we conclude that it was reasonable for Louis to relocate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
