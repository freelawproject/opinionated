Petitioners raise various procedural and substantive challenges to the denial of their petition. We deny review.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-21\">Petitioners Pal Rranxburgaj, Marije (his wife), Alfons (his son) and M\u00edrela (his daughter) are natives and citizens of Albania.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioner and his wife entered the United States on June 3, 2000 as visitors for pleasure authorized to stay not past December 2, 2000. M\u00edrela and Alfons entered without inspection near Brownsville, Texas on December 20, 2000 and December 31, 2000, respectively. Petitioner filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal on May 14, 2001. The immigration officer who received the application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>found that Petitioner\u2019s testimony was not credible and referred the matter to an immigration judge. Petitioner\u2019s application detailed a history of political activity in Albania\u2019s then-opposition Democratic Party, which resulted in various detentions, beatings and other adverse consequences by governmental authorities against Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Petitioners conceded removability at their November 13, 2001 hearing but requested asylum as relief from removal. Petitioner\u2019s family members did not file separate asylum applications; their relief was contingent as domiciliaries upon Petitioner\u2019s successful request. The immigration judge heard evidence at a separate hearing and, on December 9, 2002, rendered an oral decision granting asylum. The immigration judge referred to Petitioner\u2019s approximately 120-page memorandum describing \u201cconditions in Albania\u201d and \u201cthe problems that [Petitioners] have experienced.\u201d The immigration judge also referred to documentary evidence supporting Petitioner\u2019s medical injuries and \u201cpolitical activities in opposition to the Albanian government,\u201d although the immigration judge also observed that the record could have been better developed by, among other things, a medical examination in the United States and color photographs of Petitioner\u2019s scars and other signs of mistreatment. The immigration judge also referenced a Department of State profile report about Albania. The immigration judge later noted that the most recent report at the time judged Albania\u2019s human rights record as \u201cpoor\u201d and that police there \u201cbeat and otherwise abused suspects, detainees, and prisoners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The immigration judge heard Petitioner\u2019s testimony and found him credible in his testimony regarding a series of arrests and \u201csignificant physical mistreatment\u201d in Albania from late 1990 to August 1999. The immigration judge considered inconsistencies in Petitioner\u2019s claims and the fact that he obtained a government-issued passport from Albania after his alleged problems with the government, but the judge believed Petitioner\u2019s account that he obtained the passport after coming out of hiding and while avoiding his home area where he experienced problems. The immigration judge also credited the testimony of a non-family character witness who visited Albania in 2001 and spoke with Petitioner\u2019s concerned brothers.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Respondent appealed the grant of asylum to the BIA and, while the appeal was pending, filed a motion to remand. The motion to remand relied upon new evidence obtained in an April 30, 2003 investigation report (\u201cEmbassy Report\u201d) from the American Embassy in Albania concluding that Petitioner presented fraudulent documents as part of his asylum application. The BIA remanded the matter, which was assigned to a different immigration judge because the first judge was a visiting judge from Seattle. The BIA reasoned that remand was appropriate because Petitioner submitted the allegedly fraudulent documents thirteen days before the immigration judge\u2019s decision and it took four and a half months for the embassy to complete its investigation. Therefore, the BIA concluded that this evidence could not have been presented at the earlier hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">On remand, the immigration judge considered the new evidence, including an affidavit seeking to rebut part of the Embassy Report, and issued a written decision on October 3, 2005 denying asylum and ordering Petitioners deported to Albania. The immigration judge found that Petitioner lacked credibility because he \u201csubmitted fraudulent documentation as corroborating evidence to support his claims of past persecution and a well-founded fear of future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>persecution.\u201d The immigration judge noted that Petitioner submitted no evidence to rebut the Embassy Report\u2019s conclusion that he presented a counterfeit police certificate claiming that Albanian police arrested Petitioner\u2019s son. With respect to medical documentation, the immigration judge concluded that Petitioner did not provide sufficient evidence to rebut the Embassy Report. The immigration judge concluded that the false evidence constituted \u201cessential elements of [Petitioner\u2019s] asylum claim\u201d and \u201c[t]he bottom line is that [Petitioner\u2019s] submission of fraudulent documents has discredited his claims for asylum and withholding of removal and, therefore, his applications for relief must be denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The immigration judge also presented an alternative basis for denying asylum. The immigration judge found that, even if Petitioner\u2019s claim were deemed credible, changed country conditions in Albania rebut Petitioner\u2019s presumption of a well-founded fear of prosecution. Therefore, according to the immigration judge, Petitioner failed to show a likelihood of persecution upon return to Albania. According to the 2004 country report, there were no political killings, Albania\u2019s human rights record improved noticeably after 1998 and political activities such as elections have been generally free of violence and police interference since 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Petitioner appealed this decision to the BIA, which dismissed the appeal on April 6, 2007. The BIA agreed that the immigration judge could base an adverse credibility determination upon the unrebutted false police report that Petitioner submitted. The BIA also affirmed the alternative holding that changed country conditions were a sufficient basis to deny the asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">When the BIA includes its own commentary while adopting the decision of the immigration judge, this court reviews both decisions. <em>Lazar v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 469, 474 (6th Cir.2007). For final orders of removal, factual findings are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Mostafa v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 622, 624 (6th Cir.2005). Under that standard, \u201cfindings of fact are \u2018conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Yu v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 700, 702 (6th Cir.2004) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B)); .sec <em>also INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (requiring that the evidence \u201ccompel\u201d an alternate conclusion before reversing the BIA); <em>Ouda v. INS, </em>324 F.3d 445, 451 (6th Cir.2003) (\u201c[T]he petitioner must show that the evidence presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite persecution or fear of persecution.\u201d). Constitutional questions and questions of law, such as application of law to undisputed or adjudicated facts, are reviewed <em>de nono. Abn-Khaliel v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 627, 630 (6th Cir.2006). The Sixth Circuit reviews de novo alleged due process violations in removal hearings. <em>Mikhailevitch v. INS, </em>146 F.3d 384, 391 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">A. Petitioner\u2019s Due Process Challenges</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">Petitioner\u2019s proceedings did not deprive him of due process of law. \u201cWe have stated that Fifth Amendment guarantees of due process extend to aliens in [removal] proceedings, entitling them to a full and fair hearing. To constitute fundamental unfairness, however, a defect in the removal proceedings must have been such as might have led to a denial of justice.\u201d <em>Ndrecaj v. Mukasey, </em>522 F.3d 667, 673 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>(6th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted). Petitioner must prove prejudice to establish a violation of due process. Warner <em>v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 534, 539 (6th Cir.2004) (citations omitted). \u201cTherefore, reviewing an alleged due process violation is a two-step inquiry: first, whether there was a defect in the removal proceeding; and second, whether the alien was prejudiced because of it.\u201d <em>Ndrecaj, </em>522 F.3d at 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Petitioner contends that the decision to remand constituted a violation of due process because the BIA did not adhere to its own precedent when it remanded to another immigration judge. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) (2008). The record, however, reflects that the BIA acted reasonably and in accord with its regulations when it remanded the matter following the presentation of new evidence contained in the Embassy Report, which Respondent did not receive until after the initial grant of asylum. There was thus no defect in the proceedings. Petitioner questions the delay between when Respondent inquired with the American Embassy in Albania and the dates when the embassy received the inquiry and issued its report. Despite that delay, and whatever its cause, it is undisputed that Respondent had less than two weeks before the hearing to examine the authenticity of Petitioner\u2019s supporting documentation. However long the document investigation should have taken, it is apparent, given the nature of the investigation, the geographic distance and bureaucratic levels involved, that a thirteen-day turnaround would have been impossible. Respondent objected on authenticity grounds and then followed up with a thorough embassy investigation of fraud, which presented attendant and inherent logistical difficulties of distance, different time zones, language translation and the like. Petitioner argues that Respondent should have pressed authenticity, before knowing any facts to establish or suspect fraud, and requested a delay of the removal hearing. Such a requirement would present significant burdens upon Respondent and a system-wide logjam of all cases for the marginal benefit of rooting out fraud in an unknown fraction of the cases. Under the circumstances, we conclude that the decision to remand created no defect in the proceedings and did not form prejudice of a constitutional dimension for Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Further, Petitioner cites no authority establishing that he had a right to a particular immigration judge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cA <em>neutral </em>judge is one of the most basic due process protections.\u201d <em>Reyes-Melendez v. INS, </em>342 F.3d 1001, 1006 (9th Cir.2003) (emphasis added, internal quotation omitted). \u201cIt is undisputed that petitioners in such proceedings are entitled to an unbiased arbiter who has not prejudged their claims.\u201d <em>Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>398 F.3d 722, 725 (6th Cir.2005). The record in this case does not suggest that the second immigration judge approached the case with a closed mind or a partial position. Because the first immigration judge was a visiting judge from Seattle, it was sensible for the parties to present the case live to a different immigration judge in Detroit. Nor does Petitioner cite persuasive authority requiring Respondent to make a remote judge available by teleconferencing technology. The lack of such a requirement perhaps reflects the inherent drawbacks of judging the credibility of live testimony transmitted remotely through technology that is confining in many material respects. In light of these unavoidable shortcomings, there was no reversible error in the determination that the original immigration judge was unavailable pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Petitioner styles other arguments<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as due process concerns, but they are in fact challenges on the merits to the adverse credibility determination of the second immigration judge. As explained below, the record demonstrates that this immigration judge gave due weight and consideration to the previous factual findings, but counterbalanced them against the new evidence of fraud and the changed country conditions. Disagreement with the conclusions of the original immigration judge does not necessarily mean that the arbiter had a bias that \u201cthreatened the fundamental fairness of the hearing.\u201d <em>Ndrecaj, </em>522 F.3d at 673. Further, any alleged prejudice to Petitioner is of no constitutional moment, as the denial of asylum finds adequate support in the adverse credibility determination and changed country conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">B. Factual Findings</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Credibility determinations in asylum proceedings depend on \u201call relevant factors,\u201d including the applicant\u2019s demeanor and the consistency and plausibility of the various statements. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(4)(C) (2008) (applying the same credibility test to statements made in a removal proceeding). \u201cCredibility determinations are considered findings of fact, and are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. This is a deferential standard: A reviewing court should not reverse simply because it is convinced that it would have decided the ease differently.\u201d <em>Sylla v. INS, </em>388 F.3d 924, 925 (6th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also Mapouya v. Gonzales, </em>487 F.3d 396, 406 (6th Cir.2007). \u201cWhile an adverse credibility finding is afforded substantial deference, the finding must be supported by specific reasons. An adverse credibility finding must be based on issues that go to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Sylla, </em>388 F.3d at 926 (citations omitted); <em>see also Liti v. Gonzales, </em>411 F.3d 631, 637 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">The factual basis for the adverse credibility determination in this case is an April 30, 2003 Embassy Report that calls into question a medical document and an Albanian police certificate that Petitioner submitted in support of his asylum application. The Embassy Report identifies the investigator and his qualifications. He interviewed Zeqir Duka, a coroner who denied any record of Petitioner, including the genuineness and accuracy of an October 25, 2000 certificate that Petitioner used in his asylum application stating that he was treated for wounds after being struck by hard objects at a 1991 demonstration. Petitioner submitted a rebuttal affidavit signed by \u201cLicensed Forensic Physician\u201d Zeqir Duka and stating that Petitioner indeed complained of those injuries in 1991. Elsewhere, the declaration is from a primary care doctor with a different spelling\u2014\u201cZeqir Dukaj\u201d and a noticeably different signature. The record therefore fails to present an equivocal answer to the kind of doctor involved, the spelling of his name and, importantly, whether he can corroborate the persecution that Petitioner claims. Under these circumstances, the record compels no conclusion, including the one that Petitioner advances: that he rebutted the Embassy Report. Because the apparent contradictions are material and not adequately explained, there is substantial evidence to support the adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>credibility determination. Moreover, the contradictions touch upon a central component of Petitioner\u2019s asylum application: whether he was beaten at a 1991 demonstration and subsequently treated by a disinterested party who could corroborate the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The Embassy Report also states that a November 11, 2000 police certificate documenting the arrest of Petitioner\u2019s son was false according to an Albanian police official who stated in 2003 that no such certificate was ever issued. Petitioner challenges this portion of the report as suspect and unreliable because it is unclear whose statement the report memorialized and because no separate document or declaration verifying the report was filed. Petitioner also argues that \u201c[a] response by anyone other than the person who issued the original certificate is immaterial.\u201d But the response came from the director of the same district\u2019s Police Commissariat, a high-ranking official who presumably bears responsibility for all his office\u2019s records, and not just those that he personally issued. Further, a fair reading of the report presents no ambiguity; the police director, and not the consular investigator, determined that Petitioner\u2019s certificate was not authentic. At the very least, the Embassy Report raises questions about the police certificate that undercut the reliability of key evidence presented to support Petitioner\u2019s claim that his son was also detained by Albanian authorities. Again, the record compels no conclusion in either direction, including whether Petitioner rebutted the Embassy Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The Sixth Circuit has repeatedly held that submission of even one fraudulent document in support of a key element of an asylum claim is \u201csufficient to support an adverse credibility determination.\u201d <em>Selami v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 621, 625 (6th Cir.2005) (citations omitted); <em>see also Yon-go v. INS, </em>355 F.3d 27, 33 (1st Cir.2004); <em>Akinmade v. INS, </em>196 F.3d 951, 956 (9th Cir.1999). In <em>Selami, </em>the petitioner presented a false Albanian newspaper article purporting to identify him as an anti-Communist who was forced to flee the \u201cRed Terror\u201d of the Neo-Communists. 423 F.3d at 623-24. The article in question appeared in a different format than the rest of the newspaper submitted and the Library of Congress later verified that it was a forgery. <em>Id. </em>at 624. The petitioner had no rebuttal other than claiming the matter was not central to his claim and that he was unaware of the forgery because his father sent him the article. <em>Id. </em>at 625-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">In this case, the alleged forged documents are not obviously false or so weakly defended, but the matters called into question are just as central to the asylum claim. Further, the Embassy Report constitutes an adequate quantum of evidence under the applicable standard of review. While a tribunal in the first instance might have made a different credibility determination, the record before this court does not compel a contrary determination. We must therefore defer to the judgment of the immigration judge. All relevant factors do not point inexorably to only one possible credibility determination. Finally, as explained below, the changed country conditions provide an independent and adequate basis for the decision of the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">C. Changed Country Conditions</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">To claim asylum protection, Petitioner must demonstrate that he is a refugee as defined in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13. A refugee seeking asylum must demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b) (2008). For established cases of past persecution, a petitioner has a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution, but that presumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>may be rebutted. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). In this case, Petitioner claims that his political activities aimed at democratic reform caused him and his family to suffer various forms of retribution. He alleges that he suffered a series of beatings and detentions from about 1990 until late 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Subsequent electoral change and other developments in Albania led to a very different assessment by the United States Department of State in 2004. The 2004 country report found no political killings, noticeable improvement in Albania\u2019s human rights record after 1998 and a political environment generally free of violence and political interference since 2000. The immigration judge noted these changes and observed that they would control even if Petitioner\u2019s claim of past persecution was credible. Petitioner, according to the BIA, did not \u201cmeaningfully address\u201d the changed country conditions in his appeal. Indeed, Petitioner\u2019s brief to the BIA was silent on the issue and his notice of appeal to the BIA was incorrect because it stated that the immigration judge relied on generally changed country conditions to discredit an otherwise credible claim. The immigration judge actually assumed the credibility of the claim but found that it was nonetheless untenable because the changed country conditions rebutted any presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution. We further note that the first immigration judge expressly relied on an earlier country report and upon \u201cconditions in Albania\u201d when he granted asylum. Despite Petitioner\u2019s objections, it was thus altogether appropriate for the second immigration judge to give due weight to the updated country report and the new conditions in Albania.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The Sixth Circuit has previously relied upon Albania\u2019s changed country conditions in affirming the denial of an application for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Ndrecaj, </em>522 F.3d at 676. The court rejected challenges raising due process concerns, <em>id. </em>at 673, and questioning the adverse credibility determination of the immigration judge, <em>id. </em>at 674-76. Turning to the changed country conditions, the court relied in part upon the petitioner\u2019s admission that he did not fear Albania today, but rather the possibility that the previous ruling party would retake power by force. <em>Id. </em>at 676. The court noted the 2004 Department of State Country Report, as well as a media report that the Democratic Party of Albania had won an election in Albania. <em>Id. </em>According to the Sixth Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">Thus, on the basis of published reports of Albania\u2019s political development, we have previously stated that the conditions in Albania are \u201cfundamentally changed,\u201d and we cannot fault the IJ for reaching the same conclusion. Given Ndrecaj\u2019s admission that he can return to Albania and his failure to show any real threat of individualized persecution, we must agree with the IJ that the changed country conditions provide an independent basis for the IJ\u2019s finding of a failure to show a well-founded fear of future persecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 676-77 (quoting <em>Liti, </em>411 F.3d at 640).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">The most salient distinction in this case is that Petitioner continues to express a vigorous subjective belief that he would be persecuted if returned to Albania. But it is a distinction that makes no difference in the outcome, because a fear of future prosecution must be \u201cboth subjectively genuine <em>and </em>objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Mikhailevitch, </em>146 F.3d at 389 (emphasis added, citation omitted). Petitioner \u201ccannot rely on speculative conclusions or mere assertions of fear of possible persecution, but instead must offer reasonably specific information showing a real threat of indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>vidual persecution.\u201d <em>Mapouya, </em>487 F.3d at 412 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">In this case, Petitioner\u2019s subjective fear is grounded without exception in pre-2000 allegations. Since then, according to the evidence considered by the immigration judge, Petitioner\u2019s political party has gained electoral success and the repressiveness of the ruling powers has subsided. There is, as other courts have held, simply no objective basis for Petitioner\u2019s current fear of future persecution. <em>See Hoxhallari v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 179, 187-88 (2d Cir. 2006); <em>Tota v. Gonzales, </em>457 F.3d 161, 166-68 (1st Cir.2006); <em>Shehu v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 435, 437-38 (5th Cir.2006). The strength of this precedent and the lack of objective grounds for Petitioner\u2019s subjective fear of future persecution offer the most compelling grounds to affirm the decision to deny Petitioner\u2019s claim for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we deny review of the decision of the BIA.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-22\">.
