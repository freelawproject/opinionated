We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence and will uphold the agency\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-24\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that the harm Suhartina suffered did not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016-18 (9th Cir.2003). Furthermore, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that she failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 1018. Although Suhartina is a member of a disfavored group, and therefore need only demonstrate a \u201ccomparatively low level of individualized risk in order to prove she has a wTell-founded fear of future persecution,\u201d <em>Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 927 (9th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), the incidents she suffered are insufficient to compel the conclusion that she met this burden. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 927-29. Finally, the record does not compel the conclusion that Suhartina established a pattern or practice of persecution against ethnic Chinese Buddhists in Indonesia. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number><em>See Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1178-81 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc). Accordingly, Suhartina failed to establish eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Because Suhartina failed to establish eligibility for asylum, she necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Mansour v. Ashcroft, </em>390 F.3d 667, 673 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Suhartina\u2019s CAT claim fails because she has not demonstrated that it is more likely than not that she will be tortured if she returns to Indonesia. <em>See El Himri v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 932, 938 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b513-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
