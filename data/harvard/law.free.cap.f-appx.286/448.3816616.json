We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to deny a petition brought under \u00a7 2254, <em>see Sass v. Cal. Bd. of Prison Terms, </em>461 F.3d 1123, 1126 (9th Cir.2006), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-21\">Appellees\u2019 contention that there is no federal protected liberty interest in parole release in California is foreclosed. <em>See id. </em>at 1127-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-22\">Because the California Board of Prison Terms\u2019 (\u201cBoard\u201d) 2004 decision to deny Crawford parole was supported by some evidence, including Crawford\u2019s refusal to participate in vocational training or self improvement programs, there was no due process violation. <em>See Irons v. Carey, </em>505 F.3d 846, 851 (9th Cir.2007). Accordingly, the state court\u2019s decision rejecting Crawford\u2019s due process claim was not contrary to, and did not involve an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>see also Irons, </em>505 F.3d at 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-23\">We decline to reach Crawford\u2019s contentions concerning Board bias, ex post facto laws, state law violations, and the Board\u2019s decision to defer his next parole hearing for three years, because Crawford did not raise these arguments in the district court. <em>See Manta v. Chertoff, </em>518 F.3d 1134, 1144 (9th Cir.2008) (\u201cAs a general rule, we do not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b474-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
