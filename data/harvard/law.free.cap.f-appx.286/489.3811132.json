We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We grant the petition for review in No. OS-72235, and we deny the petition for review in No. 05-75630.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-24\">We conclude that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility decision is not supported by substantial evidence because the inconsistencies found by the IJ do not go to the heart of Mirzakhanyan\u2019s claim that she was persecuted on account of her Pentecostal religion. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1105 (9th Cir.2006) (minor inconsistencies that do not go to the heart of the asylum claim generally do not support an adverse credibility finding).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-25\">Accordingly, we grant the petition for review and remand to the BIA to determine whether, accepting Mirzakhanyan\u2019s testimony as credible, she is eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>under CAT. <em>See generally INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 17-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Petitioners do not challenge the BIA\u2019s September 16, 2005 order upholding the IJ\u2019s denial of reopening. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1045 (9th Cir.2001) (issues not supported by argument are deemed abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">No. 05-72235: PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">No. 05-75630: PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b515-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
