The district court denied Ruiz\u2019s IFP motion and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP status, Ruiz is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-18\">Aside from conclusional allegations, Ruiz does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that he failed to present an arguable or non-frivolous issue for appeal. Further, aside from conclusional allegations that his complaint was filed under the Alien Tort Claims Act, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Mexican Military Justice Code, the United Nations Charter, and Article VI of the United States Constitution, Ruiz does not address the district court\u2019s determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his claims. Ruiz\u2019s attempt to incorporate by reference the arguments set forth in his notice of appeal is an insufficient means of raising those arguments in this court. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Therefore, these issues are deemed abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-21\">Ruiz has not shown that the district court\u2019s certification was incorrect. The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. Accordingly, Ruiz\u2019s request for IFP status is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Ruiz\u2019s motions for a temporary restraining order (stay of deportation), a transfer or relocation to another facility, and a picture of the district court judge are also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-22\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b869-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
