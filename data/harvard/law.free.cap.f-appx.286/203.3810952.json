Finding no error in his conviction, we affirm the conviction. However, for the reason set forth below, we vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-20\">Gonzalez first attacks his conviction, arguing that the district court violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(5) by purportedly rejecting his plea agreement without informing him that his guilty plea could be withdrawn. After reviewing the record, however, it is clear that there was no plea agreement for the district court to reject. What Gonzalez points to as a \u201cplea agreement\u201d was merely his counter offer to the government\u2019s plea offer. Although the government never accepted the terms of this counter-offer, Gonzalez filed it with the district court. Because of this, the district court struck the document and Gonzalez conceded during his rearraignment that he never had an agreement with the government. Accordingly, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>court did not err in accepting Gonzalez\u2019s guilty plea and thus, we AFFIRM his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Gonzalez does raise colorable claims regarding the propriety of his sentence, however. He argues that his sentence, which the district court imposed prior to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is unconstitutional in light of that decision. He also contends that the district court erred in its determination of the quantity of drugs attributable to him and in applying various enhancements to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Gonzalez preserved his claim that he should have been sentenced under non-mandatory Guidelines by objecting under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), <em>see United States v. Olis, </em>429 F.3d 540, 543-44 (5th Cir.2005), and the government concedes that it cannot show that this error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 286 (5th Cir.2005). It is clear that the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory, and nothing in the record indicates that the court would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory Guidelines system. Where, as here, a <em>Booker </em>error has been preserved in the district court and this court cannot say that the error is harmless, this court \u201cwill ordinarily vacate the sentence and remand\u201d for resentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 284 (internal quotation mark and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">As this case must be remanded for re-sentencing, we decline to address Gonzalez\u2019s particular claims concerning the quantity of drugs attributable to him and the enhancements applied to his sentence. Instead, we \u201cleave to the discretion of the district court, whether in its discretion, it will impose the identical sentence with the identical departures or enhancements, or both.\u201d <em>United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 377 n. 62 (5th Cir.2005). To the extent that these claims remain relevant after resentencing, Gonzalez may pursue them in a subsequent appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">Gonzalez\u2019s sentences on both counts are VACATED and the case is remanded for resentencing under <em>Booker. </em>Gonzalez\u2019s motions to proceed pro se and to relieve counsel are DENIED as untimely. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is likewise DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b230-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
