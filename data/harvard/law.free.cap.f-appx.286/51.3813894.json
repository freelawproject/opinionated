Frogge contends that he is entitled to such relief on the ground that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective by failing to develop and present, for sentencing purposes, mitigating evidence of his permanent organic brain damage. As explained below, we are constrained to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">It is undisputed that, on the night of November 4, 1994, Frogge stabbed and killed his father, Robert Edward Frogge, and his invalid stepmother, Audrey Yvonne Frogge. In 1995, Frogge was tried and found guilty in the Superior Court of For-syth County, North Carolina, on two counts of first-degree murder. The jury then considered whether Frogge should receive the death penalty for each of the murders. On the jury\u2019s recommendation, Frogge was sentenced to life imprisonment for the killing of his father, and to death for the murder of his stepmother. The Supreme Court of North Carolina thereafter granted him a new trial on the ground that inadmissible hearsay had been introduced during the guilt phase of the 1995 trial. <em>See State v. Frogge, </em>345 N.C. 614, 481 S.E.2d 278 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">At Frogge\u2019s second trial in 1998, he was found guilty on two counts of first-degree murder, as well as an additional count of robbery -with a dangerous weapon. Frogge was sentenced to life imprisonment for the killing of his father, a concurrent prison term for the robbery, and, on the jury\u2019s recommendation, received a death sentence for the murder of his stepmother. At this trial, the jury had considered the death penalty only with respect to his stepmother\u2019s murder. Frogge appealed his death sentence and the robbery conviction, and the state supreme court affirmed. <em>See State v. Frogge, </em>351 N.C. 576, 528 S.E.2d 893 (2000). The state supreme court summarized the facts of the case as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-10\">The State\u2019s evidence at defendant\u2019s second trial tended to show that defendant stabbed his father and bedridden stepmother to death. At the time of the murders, defendant lived with his father and stepmother at their home in Winston-Salem. Defendant\u2019s father did not work, and his stepmother had been confined to her bed for over two years. Defendant worked part-time and helped around the house, but paid no rent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-11\">Between 4:00 and 4:30 a.m. on 5 November 1994, the Winston-Salem Police Department received a 911 call from a person who identified himself as Danny Frogge. Frogge reported that his parents were dead. When Winston-Salem police officers arrived at the scene, they found the bodies of Robert and Audrey Frogge in their bedroom. Robert Frogge was found on the floor lying on his left side with bloodstains on his shirt and arms. He had sustained ten stab wounds. A leather wallet, containing his driver\u2019s license and miscellaneous papers but no money, was found next to his body. The wallet, which was lying open, had a drop and a smear of blood inside. Near the wallet, a white, bloodstained sock was found. An iron bar from a lawnmower was found under Robert Frogge\u2019s body. Audrey Frogge was found in her hospital-type bed with bloodstains on her chest and arms. She had sustained eleven stab wounds to her chest. In addition, she suffered defensive knife wounds to her hand. A hospital-type rolling table stood beside the bed. Dr. Patrick Lantz, a forensic pa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>thologist, opined that the angle of the stab wounds indicated the person stabbing Audrey Frogge either stood at the edge of the bed beside the table or climbed on the bed itself to deliver the blows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-5\">Outside the home near the back porch, the officers found a bloodstained butcher knife. Just beyond the edge of the woods behind the house, the officers found men\u2019s clothing, including a pair of blue work pants, a pink tee shirt with red stains, a pair of men\u2019s underwear, and a white sock which contained bloodstains and blood spatter. The white sock appeared to match the sock found near Robert Frogge\u2019s body. The officers also collected several pairs of white underwear and blue work pants from defendant\u2019s bedroom which appeared similar to those found in the woods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">While talking further with the officers that night, defendant appeared calm and showed no signs of emotion. In a statement to Winston-Salem Police Detective Sergeant Dennis Scales, defendant claimed that on the day of the murders he had been in and out of the house on numerous occasions taking care of his stepmother and preparing her supper. After a night of drinking and crack cocaine use with friends, he returned to the home at approximately 4:00 a.m. and found his parents murdered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">The State also offered into evidence defendant\u2019s testimony from the sentencing proceeding of his first trial. This testimony included the following: On the day of the murders, defendant worked around the house and later met with Earl Autrey, Audrey Frogge\u2019s son-in-law, at approximately 2:00 p.m. The two began drinking. Defendant went back to his parents\u2019 home to prepare supper for his stepmother and later returned to Autrey\u2019s home to continue drinking. Subsequently, defendant returned to his parents\u2019 home. Defendant had consumed almost an entire pint of liquor and several beers. Defendant\u2019s father awoke from a nap between 8:00 and 8:30 p.m. and began to argue with defendant about his drinking. Defendant could not recall what he said to his father; however, his father became so upset that he took an iron bar from a lawnmower and jabbed and hit defendant four or five times. Defendant got up, went to the kitchen, and retrieved a butcher knife. He recalled stabbing his father three or four times while his father held the iron bar. Defendant did not remember stabbing his stepmother, but admitted that he must have done it. He then took approximately twenty-five or twenty-six dollars from his father\u2019s wallet. Defendant attempted to wash the blood from his hands. He then changed clothes and threw the soiled clothes in the woods behind the house. When asked how blood got inside his father\u2019s wallet, defendant stated that he did not know, but admitted it might have dropped from his hand. Defendant left and went to Kim Dunlap\u2019s house. He and Dunlap then rode with Dunlap\u2019s sister to downtown Winston-Salem. They used the money defendant had taken from his father\u2019s wallet to purchase crack cocaine. After smoking the crack, defendant and Dunlap returned to defendant\u2019s parents\u2019 home in a taxicab around 4:00 or 4:30 a.m. Defendant entered the house, but returned to the taxicab and said that his parents were dead. He then called the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-9\">Defendant elected to testify on his own behalf at his second trial. His testimony was similar to that given at his first sentencing proceeding. He testified he served over four years in prison for a previous second-degree murder conviction and that he saved $8,000 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>purchase a mobile home where he resided for six months after his release. Thereafter he returned to live with his father and stepmother. Defendant again admitted killing his father and stepmother and stated that after the murders, he changed his clothes and washed his hands. His testimony differed somewhat in that defendant claimed he did not take the money from his father\u2019s wallet until after he had washed his hands and was preparing to leave the house approximately thirty minutes after the murders. Defendant again admitted purchasing crack cocaine with the money he took from his father\u2019s wallet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><em>Frogge, </em>528 S.E.2d at 895-96. Following the state supreme court\u2019s affirmance of Frogge\u2019s death sentence for the murder of his stepmother, the Supreme Court of the United States denied Frogge\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari. <em>See Frogge v. North Carolina, </em>531 U.S. 994, 121 S.Ct. 487, 148 L.Ed.2d 459 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">In 2001, Frogge filed a Motion for Appropriate Relief (\u201cMAR\u201d) in the Superior Court of Forsyth County (the \u201cMAR court\u201d), alleging, inter alia, ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The MAR court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the ineffective assistance issue in August 2002 (the \u201cMAR hearing\u201d). By its Order of October 29, 2003, the MAR court granted relief to Frogge, ruling in his favor on the ineffective assistance claim, thus vacating the death sentence he had received for the murder of his stepmother and ordering a new sentencing hearing. <em>State v. Frogge, </em>No. 94 CRS 44964 (N.C.Super.Ct. Oct. 29, 2003) (the \u201cMAR Order\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">As described by the MAR court, Frogge\u2019s ineffective assistance claim \u201carf\u00f3se] out of the alleged failure of trial counsel to investigate and offer evidence that at the time of the murders the defendant suffered permanent residual effects of a head injury sustained from a beating in 1990.\u201d MAR Order 8-9. Frogge maintained that his trial counsel should have arranged for neurological testing to assess whether the 1990 injury resulted in permanent organic brain damage and whether such brain damage contributed to the murders of his father and stepmother \u2014 an inquiry that, according to Frogge, \u201cwould have resulted in an opinion from an adequately qualified expert that as a result of [a brain damage-related] mental disturbance and consumption of alcohol, the defendant\u2019s capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct and to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was impaired.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9 (internal quotation marks omitted). Frogge further contended</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-11\">that the failure to investigate, and to offer the evidence that would (or should) have been developed, was objectively unreasonable, satisfying the \u201cperformance\u201d prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. He then argue[d] that if the jury at the sentencing stage had been presented with this evidence, a reasonable probability exists that the ultimate result \u2014 recommendation of the death penalty \u2014 would have been different, satisfying the \u201cprejudice\u201d prong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 9-10 (citing <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>The trial records and the MAR hearing evidence reflected that Frogge was represented by lead counsel Danny Ferguson and associate counsel David Freedman at both the 1995 and 1998 trials. During the sentencing phase of the 1995 trial, Frogge\u2019s sisters testified to changes they observed in Frogge\u2019s personality after the 1990 beating, and a defense expert, clinical psychologist Dr. Gary Hoover, opined that the resulting brain damage contributed to Frogge\u2019s murders of his father and stepmother. Dr. Hoover\u2019s methodology and opinion were challenged by the State\u2019s rebuttal expert, neuropsychiatrist Dr. Stephen I. Kramer, who perceived no link between the head injury and the murders of Frogge\u2019s parents. At least one juror on the 1995 jury found two statutory mitigating circumstances with respect to each of the murders: that Frogge was under the influence of a mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the offense, <em>see </em>N.C. GemStat. \u00a7 15A-2000(f)(2) (the \u201c \u2018(f)(2)\u2019 mitigator\u201d), and that he suffered from an impaired capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 15A-2000 (f)(6) (the \u201c \u2018(f)(6)\u2019 mitigator\u201d). Thereafter, for the 1998 trial, Frogge\u2019s counsel replaced Dr. Hoover with another expert, clinical psychologist Dr. William Tyson, who testified during the guilt phase \u2014 in an attempt to avoid first-degree murder convictions \u2014 that Frogge possibly suffered from a personality disorder and that he likely had been acting on impulse with limited ability to reason at the time of the murders; Dr. Tyson did not mention Frogge\u2019s 1990 head injury or opine on its effects. The State again presented Dr. Kramer as its rebuttal expert, and Frogge\u2019s sisters again gave nonexpert testimony (during the sentencing phase) regarding the head injury. The 1998 jury did not find either the \u201c(f)(2)\u201d mitigator or the \u201c(f)(6)\u201d mitigator with respect to the murder of Frogge\u2019s stepmother.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>In its MAR Order, the MAR court made the following findings of fact, based on the evidence presented to it:</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">1. For the 1995 trial, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel engaged and offered testimony from a psychologist, Dr. Hoover.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">2. Dr. Hoover testified in the form of opinion that at the time of the homicides in 1994, the defendant suffered from \u201c[d]elirium due to multiple etiologies, substance intoxication delirium, alcohol [sic] and mood disorder due to postcon-cussive disorder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">3. Dr. Hoover described the latter as \u201cthe aftermath of a head injury that [Frogge] sustained in 1990 that left him with residual mood difficulties and cognitive functions, intellectual skills ... [that] caused him to have episodic seizures, slurred speech and increased irritability, more withdrawn type of personality, episodes of paranoia over the years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">4. In Dr. Hoover\u2019s opinion, the \u201cpo-stconcussive\u201d disorder combined with substance-induced delirium to produce explosive rage provoked by the defendant\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">5. Dr. Hoover based his diagnosis in part on \u201cknown\u201d correlation between \u201cresidual behavioral difficulties\u201d and head injuries, and the descriptions provided to him of marked differences in the defendant\u2019s behavior after the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">6. During cross-examination, Dr. Hoover admitted that he had done no neurological or neuropsychological testing of the defendant, stating that medical records and behavioral information provided were sufficient for the \u201cdiagnosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">7. The State offered rebuttal expert testimony from Dr. [K]ramer, a neuro-psychiatrist, who disagreed with Dr. Hoover\u2019s opinion concerning \u201cdelirium.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">8. Dr. [K]ramer said that Dr. Hoover\u2019s conclusions were \u201cnot supported,\u201d and lacked \u201cdata.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-13\">9. Dr. [Kjramer\u2019s own review of the medical records concerning the 1990 head injury did not support a conclusion that it had any effect on the defendant in 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-14\">10. Dr. [Kjramer testified that tests could have been done on the defendant to determine whether the head injury contributed to the homicides in 1994, but that none were done.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-15\">11. At the 1995 sentencing phase, the \u201c(f)(2)\u201d and \u201c(f)(6)\u201d mitigators were submitted to the jury, and were found by at least one juror; however, with respect to the murder of Audrey Frogge, the jury did not find that the mitigating factors found outweighed the aggravating factors, and recommended death.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-16\">12. For the 1998 trial, defense counsel elected not to use Dr. Hoover again, and engaged another psychologist, Dr. Tyson.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-17\">13. During the 1998 trial, Dr. Tyson testified that at the time of the homicides, the defendant suffered from a \u201cpersonality disorder ... defined as a pervasive limitation to adult functioning that had been aggravated by long term substance abuse and dependence,\u201d as a result of which \u201cit was most likely he would have been acting on impulse with limited ability to reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>14. Dr. Tyson did not perform or request any neurological or neuropsy-chological tests on the defendant, and none were done. His diagnosis was not supported by reliance on any such tests, review of medical records concerning the 1990 head injury or descriptions by family and friends of changes in the defendant\u2019s behavior after that injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">15. Lay witnesses who testified during the 1998 trial described changes in the defendant\u2019s behavior after the 1990 head injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">16. During the 1998 sentencing phase, which pertained only to the Audrey Frogge murder, the \u201c(f)(2)\u201d and \u201c(f)(6)\u201d mitigators were submitted to the jury, but neither was found, and the jury again recommended death.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">17. Trial counsel decided not to use Dr. Hoover in favor of Dr. Tyson because of dissatisfaction with Dr. Hoover and respect for Dr. Tyson\u2019s abilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">18. Claudia R. Coleman, Ph.D., a psychologist specializing in neuropsy-chology and forensic psychology, reviewed various written materials concerning the defendant and conducted physical and other examinations of the defendant in preparation for the MAR hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">17. Among the materials reviewed by Dr. Coleman were portions of the record of the 1995 and [1998] trials (including testimony of Drs. Hoover, [K]ramer and Tyson), the defendant\u2019s criminal record and affidavits from family members and friends. She also reviewed a psychological report done by Dr. Tyson in 1998 and medical records that included information about the 1990 head injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">20. Dr. Coleman also personally met with the defendant twice, and performed a neuropsychological evaluation to determine if he suffered residual deficits from the head injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">21. Dr. Coleman testified that the defendant suffered a closed head injury, that he spent several days in the hospital, that he was \u201cin and out\u201d of clear mental status during that time, that at discharge he had speech and memory problems, that he became \u201cmore explosive\u201d and was more \u201ceasily agitated,\u201d that he had a lower tolerance for frustration, that he became more withdrawn, and that he became \u201cquite paranoid and fearful of others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-13\">22. Dr. Coleman administered several tests on the defendant, including the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale, the Weschler Memory Scale and the Rhey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. She also tested motor, visual, spatial and language skills, and performed brain injury-specific tests. She also administered tests to detect evidence of malingering.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-14\">23. Dr. Coleman observed that the defendant did well on some of the tests, and poorly on others, particularly in verbal and visual memory processes. She considered these results to be consistent with brain injury in the temporoparietal area, which was the area involved in the 1990 head injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-15\">24. Based on her review of the materials provided to her, her examination of the defendant, including test results, and her education and training, Dr. Coleman diagnosed the defendant with \u201ccognitive disorder NOS [not otherwise specified],\u201d personality disorder, combined type, with paranoid and aggressive features, and with \u201cpolysubstance dependence.\u201d The cognitive and personality disorders were causally linked to the head injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-16\">25. Dr. Coleman formed an opinion that the residual effects of the defendant\u2019s brain injury in 1990 significantly affected his behavior at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Audrey Frogge murder. She concluded that these effects made it more difficult for the defendant to control his emotions and impulses, and to consider the consequences of his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">26. In Dr. Coleman\u2019s opinion, at the time of the Audrey Frogge murder, partially as a result of the brain injury, the defendant suffered from diminished capacity fully to weigh and understand the consequences of his actions. She further determined that he committed the murder while under the influence of such conditions and that his ability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct and conform that conduct to the requirements of law was impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">27. Thomas M. Hyde, M.D., Ph.D., a neurologist, conducted a neurological evaluation of the defendant in June 2002, and reviewed Dr. Coleman\u2019s report, affidavits, hospital records and a portion of trial transcript. He observed several abnormalities, including attention and visual deficits, motor weakness and clumsiness. He concluded that the defendant has organic brain damage, referable to the frontal and parietal lobes, resulting from the 1990 head injury. In his opinion, the defendant had a significant closed head injury in 1990 that produced permanent and irreversible brain damage, which under extreme distress would lead him to act impulsively, with impaired judgment, reasoning and impulse control.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">28. If the defendant\u2019s trial counsel had been aware of Dr. Hyde\u2019s opinions in 1998, and if Dr. Hyde were available as a witness and counsel was otherwise satisfied that Dr. Hyde was a credible expert, he would have used Dr. Hyde\u2019s opinion at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">MAR Order 10-16 (internal citations omitted) (some alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Turning to the performance prong of the <em>Strickland </em>analysis, the MAR court focused heavily on two decisions: <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003) (concluding petitioner entitled to habeas corpus relief based on counsel\u2019s failure to investigate and present available mitigating evidence), and <em>Byram v. Ozmint, </em>339 F.3d 203 (4th Cir.2003) (distinguishing <em>Wiggins </em>and finding no ineffective assistance, where counsel conducted thorough investigation and made strategic decision not to present potentially damaging evidence). <em>See </em>MAR Order 19-22. The MAR court concluded that</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">[t]he circumstances here are more similar to <em>Wiggins </em>than to <em>Byram. </em>Counsel knew of Frogge\u2019s head injury, but did not investigate with the assistance of expert consultation the potential mitigation evidence of \u201corganic brain damage\u201d and its effects on his ability to control violent impulses. Counsel here had the \u201cbenefit\u201d of Dr. [Kjramer\u2019s criticism of Dr. Hooper\u2019s testimony in the 1995 trial \u2014 the \u201croadmap\u201d that post-conviction counsel now say was available. While true that the effects of Frogge\u2019s head injury include antisocial behavior that could be damaging to his case, trial counsel\u2019s failure to investigate was not influenced by that circumstance. Like trial counsel in <em>Wiggins, </em>Frogge\u2019s trial counsel turned their focus to other concerns, and were \u201cinattentive\u201d to the potential mitigating evidence arising out of the head injury. Frogge had the benefit of good lawyers with experience in capital cases, but <em>Wiggins </em>compels the conclusion that their failure to pursue the evidence of organic brain injury as has now been done in post-conviction proceedings was objectively unreasonable. From the evidence, applying applicable case law, this Court concludes that the defendant has met the burden of proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>on the performance prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 22-23. Next, with respect to the prejudice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>analysis, the MAR court determined that, \u201c[cjonsid-ering all of the circumstances, ... the evidence of the effects of organic brain injury is of such nature and potential persuasive effect that the lack of it due to ineffective assistance undermines confidence in the fairness of the 1998 sentencing phase.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29. Accordingly, the MAR court ruled that \u201c[t]he MAR for a new sentencing hearing should be granted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The State appealed the MAR Order to the Supreme Court of North Carolina. By its decision of February 4, 2005, the state supreme court reversed the MAR court and reinstated Frogge\u2019s death sentence. <em>See State v. Frogge, </em>359 N.C. 228, 607 S.E.2d 627 (2005) (the \u201cState Decision\u201d). In so doing, the state supreme court recognized that, in reviewing the MAR Order, the relevant questions were \u201cwhether the findings of fact are supported by evidence, whether the findings of fact support the conclusions of law, and whether the conclusions of law support the order entered by the [MAR] court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634 (internal quotation marks omitted). The state supreme court ultimately reversed the MAR court by finding fault with its analysis on the performance prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, without reaching the prejudice prong. <em>Id. </em>at 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The state supreme court began its State Decision by reviewing the relevant factual and procedural history \u2014 covering the 1995 trial, the 1998 trial, and the MAR court proceeding. <em>See Frogge, </em>607 S.E.2d at 628-33. In substantial part, the state supreme court focused on matters beyond those discussed in the MAR Order. For instance, essential to its State Decision, the state supreme court observed the following with respect to the pretrial investigatory efforts made by Frogge\u2019s lawyers:</p>\n<p id=\"A2U\">[W]hile preparing for defendant\u2019s second trial, defense counsel provided Dr. Tyson with their entire discovery file; advised him as to defendant\u2019s head injury, the resulting perceived changes in his personality, and the significance that family members placed on the injury; and made available to him defendant\u2019s medical records. The material supplied to Dr. Tyson also included the testimony given at [the 1995 trial] by Drs. Hoover and Kramer, and attorney Freedman believed that Dr. Tyson testified in [the 1998 trial] that he had reviewed this testimony. Even possessing this information, Dr. Tyson advised attorney Ferguson that he would not change his diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">In deciding prior to [the 1998 trial] whether to pursue evidence of defendant\u2019s head injury as potentially mitigating evidence, defense counsel testified that they depended on Dr. Tyson\u2019s expertise. Although attorney Ferguson acknowledged during the MAR hearing that he knew Dr. Tyson was not a neurologist or neuropsychologist and could not render neurological opinions, he added, \u201cI think he had the ability to tell me that if it was significant where we should go next. And he didn\u2019t indicate that there was any significance, that [the head injury] was significant. So, I relied on what he said.\u201d When cross-examined, attorney Ferguson reaffirmed that he depended on Dr. Tyson\u2019s informed opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-11\">Q. Now, I think you made it clear this morning, I just want to be sure, that you advised Doctor Tyson, or discussed with him more than once, the concerns of the family members about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>the personality changes they observed in the Defendant after the beating in 1990, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-4\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">Q. And you asked him whether that was significant, in his opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">Q. And he was firm on saying no, it would not change my diagnosis, was he not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">Q. And you felt entitled to rely on the superior knowledge of an expert?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-10\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-11\">Attorney Ferguson reemphasized the point during a similar exchange later in the hearing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-12\">Q. Doctor Tyson did not specifically focus on the head injury, did he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-13\">A. No, and as I\u2019ve said earlier, he was told about it, provided the information, and did not deem it significant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-14\">Q. Yes, sir. And yet he made that decision without [the] benefit of any type of neurological or neuropsycho-logical testing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-15\">A. Yes, sir, I assume that he had the \u2014 at least the qualifications to make that decision, whether neurological testing might be needed; and he was much more qualified to make that decision than I was, and [w]e relied on his opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-16\">All this testimony indicates that defense counsel relied both on Dr. Tyson\u2019s diagnosis of defendant\u2019s condition and on his informed opinion that additional testing or experts were not needed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-17\"><em>Id. </em>at 682-33 (some alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-18\">Turning to its analysis of Frogge\u2019s ineffective assistance claim, and invoking the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Strickland </em>and Wiggins, the state supreme court emphasized the proposition that a court must \u201creview counsel\u2019s[ ] decisions in light of the information available to them at the time and not with the benefit of hindsight.\u201d <em>Frogge, </em>607 S.E.2d at 634(citing <em>Wiggins, </em>539 U.S. at 523, 123 S.Ct. 2527; <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052). The state supreme court then observed</p>\n<p id=\"Abo\">that counsel had numerous pertinent factors to consider as they decided their strategy for defendant\u2019s second sentencing proceeding. First, defendant had committed a murder prior to suffering the head injury. Second, graphic lay evidence of defendant\u2019s 1990 head injury and its sequelae had been presented through his sisters and others close to him at the [1995] trial and would be presented again. Third, at the [1995] sentencing proceeding, Dr. Hoover had presented an expert psychological opinion that took into account both defendant\u2019s head injury and his background. The sentencing jury, having heard that evidence, returned a capital verdict. Fourth, Dr. Kramer criticized Dr. Hoover for failing to conduct additional psychological testing that might determine whether defendant\u2019s head injury was a contributing factor to the murders. However, Dr. Kramer went on to state that, in his opinion, the 1990 injury was of mild to moderate severity and defendant\u2019s prognosis on discharge was good, implying that the additional psychological testing was unlikely to bear fruit. Dr. Kramer did not indicate that in preparation for trial defendant should have been tested for organic brain damage or neurological harm resulting from the 1990 head injury. Fifth, defense counsel were dissatisfied with Dr. Hoover\u2019s performance in [the 1995 trial] and replaced him with Dr. Tyson, who had been an effective witness in the past for attorney Freedman. When supplied with defendant\u2019s medical and social his<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>tories and with transcripts of the proceedings in [the 1995 trial], Dr. Tyson stood by his opinion that defendant suffered from a personality disorder and, at the time of the murders, was acting on impulse with limited ability to reason.</p>\n<p id=\"ap-dedup-0\"><em>Id. </em>at 634-35. After outlining these factors, the state supreme, court recognized that \u201cwe must now decide whether, under <em>Wiggins, </em>the trial court properly concluded that defense counsel\u2019s decision not to pursue evidence of organic brain damage through neurological testing was objectively unreasonable and undermined confidence in the verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635. The state supreme court engaged in this assessment as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">The test in <em>Wiggins </em>is whether a strategic decision was made after sufficient investigation, not whether that decision was later proven to be correct. Unlike counsel in <em>Wiggins, </em>who abandoned the idea of pursuing a defense based on mitigation after reviewing only a psychological report, [social services] records, and a presentence investigation report, defense counsel here interviewed defendant and his siblings and obtained defendant\u2019s school records, hospital records, correctional systems records, and psychological reports. Thus, defendant\u2019s counsel cannot be said to have \u201cacquired only rudimentary knowledge of [defendant\u2019s] history from a narrow set of sources.\u201d <em>Wiggins, </em>539 U.S. at 524, 123 S.Ct. 2527. Defendant\u2019s attorneys also had the benefit of watching the first trial unfold and seeing what worked and what did not. Specifically, a defense which took defendant\u2019s head injury into account had been unsuccessful. By the time defense counsel were preparing for defendant\u2019s second trial, they had consulted two mental health experts, Drs. Hoover and Tyson, both of whom had full access to defendant, his family, and the pertinent medical records of defendant\u2019s head injury, and neither of whom recommended neurological testing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">In addition, defense counsel testified that they depended on Dr. Tyson to advise them whether or not additional testing of defendant was needed but that, after receiving all the information from the first trial, Dr. Tyson stuck by his original diagnosis of defendant. This testimony indicates that defense counsel were prepared to seek such testing if they had adequate reason to believe it was necessary or would be useful.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\"><em>Frogge, </em>607 S.E.2d at 635. Finally, after surveying decisions in what it deemed to be analogous cases, the state supreme court concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">[W]here the record demonstrates (1) defense counsel fully investigated defendant\u2019s social and medical history and provided that information to Drs. Hoover and Tyson, (2) neither expert indicated to counsel a necessity for neurological testing, and (3) counsel relied on their experts as they made the difficult but necessary choices as to which theory of defense to pursue, we are unwilling to find that the decisions of defendant\u2019s attorneys constituted ineffective assistance of counsel or represented inattention to other possible defenses. Accordingly, we conclude that defense counsel did not prematurely abandon a defense based on organic brain damage and that their election to pursue a defense predicated on other grounds constituted a \u201c \u2018reasonable professional judgment] ].\u2019 \u201d <em>Wiggins, </em>539 U.S. at 533, 123 S.Ct. 2527 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. 2052).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-10\"><em>Frogge, </em>607 S.E.2d at 637 (second alteration in original). Thus, without reaching the prejudice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, the state supreme court reversed the MAR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>court and reinstated Frogge\u2019s death sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 637-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">In June 2005, Frogge filed his federal habeas corpus petition in the Middle District of North Carolina, asserting, inter alia, his ineffective assistance claim, by which he challenges his death sentence. On March 28, 2006, the magistrate judge recommended that Frogge\u2019s petition be denied. <em>See Frogge v. Polk, </em>No. 1:05-cv-00502, 2006 WL 1666752 (M.D.N.C. Mar. 28, 2006) (the \u201cRecommendation\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With respect to the ineffective assistance claim, the magistrate judge concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAo\">[a] review of the record supports the ruling of the North Carolina Supreme Court; trial counsel\u2019s decision not to pursue evidence of organic brain damage through neurological testing was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland </em>or its progeny. There is no requirement to \u2018shop around\u2019 for a more favorable expert opinion and the hindsight of a later obtained diagnosis does not render representation ineffective. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that this court in its independent judgment believed that trial counsel were in error for failing to pursue neurological testing, the deferential standard of review under the [1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act] precludes relief. As noted, the North Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s decision is neither unreasonable nor substantially different from relevant united States Supreme Court precedent. [Frogge\u2019s ineffective assistance claim] should, therefore, be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">Recommendation 19-20 (internal citations omitted). On June 5, 2006, the district court summarily adopted the Recommendation in a two-page Order, thus rejecting Frogge\u2019s ineffective assistance claim and denying his federal habeas corpus petition. <em>See Frogge v. Polk, </em>No. 1:05-cv-00502, 2006 WL 1699999 (M.D.N.C. June 5, 2006).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court also denied Frogge a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On February 22, 2008, however, we granted Frogge a COA on his ineffective assistance claim. We possess jurisdiction over Frogge\u2019s appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-12\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of federal habeas corpus relief on the basis of a state court record. <em>See Tucker v. Ozmint, </em>350 F.3d 433, 438 (4th Cir.2003). Because the Supreme Court of North Carolina adjudicated Frogge\u2019s habe-as corpus claim on the merits, the State Decision is entitled to deference pursuant to the 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Under AEDPA, we may award relief only if (1) the state court adjudication of the issue on its merits \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>mined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d; or (2) the adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>State court factual determinations are presumed to be correct and may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Frogge contends that we should vacate his death sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), because the State Decision \u201cinvolved an unreasonable application of\u2019 Supreme Court precedent \u2014 in that the state supreme court \u201cidentifie[d] the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme] Court\u2019s decisions but unreasonably appliefd] that principle to the facts of\u2019 his case, <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) \u2014 and also because the State Decision \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the\u201d MAR court proceeding. As discussed above, the state supreme court reversed the MAR court by finding fault with its analysis on the performance prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, without reaching the prejudice prong. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (recognizing that an ineffective assistance claim requires showing (1) \u201cthat counsel\u2019s performance was deficient,\u201d and (2) \u201cthat the deficient performance prejudiced the defense\u201d). In so doing, the state supreme court largely relied on the <em>Strickland </em>analysis in <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003). <em>See State v. Frogge, </em>359 N.C. 228, 607 S.E.2d 627, 635 (2005) (observing that \u201c[t]he test in <em>Wiggins </em>is whether a strategic decision was made after sufficient investigation, not whether that decision was later proven to be correct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">The state supreme court concluded, in short, that trial counsel\u2019s decision to abandon further pursuit of evidence of Frogge\u2019s permanent organic brain damage was <em>not </em>the result of an insufficient investigation. Rather, the court ruled that counsel exercised reasonable professional judgment by \u201cfully investigat[ing] defendant\u2019s social and medical history\u201d \u2014 alerting counsel to the 1990 head injury \u2014 \u201cand providing] that information\u201d to defense experts Dr. Hoover (for the 1995 trial) and Dr. Tyson (for the 1998 trial). <em>Frogge, </em>607 S.E.2d at 637. When \u201cneither expert indicated to counsel a necessity for neurological testing,\u201d it was then reasonable for \u201ccounsel [to rely] on their experts as they made the difficult but necessary choices as to which theory of defense to pursue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, as the supreme court recognized, counsel did not know at the time they were preparing for the 1998 trial whether- \u2014 as Dr. Hoover had testified at the 1995 trial without having performed neurological tests \u2014 Frogge truly suffered from permanent organic brain damage which contributed to the murders of his father and stepmother. Dr. Hoover\u2019s testimony had been discredited by the State\u2019s expert, Dr. Kramer, who himself had opined that there was no link between the head injury and the murders. Thereafter, counsel provided information to Dr. Tyson about the head injury, and Tyson convinced them that no additional testing or experts were needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">In seeking federal habeas corpus relief, Frogge asserts that his trial counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance at the 1998 trial by: relying on Dr. Tyson, who was neither a medical doctor (much less a neurologist) nor qualified to perform neurological or neuropsychological tests; allowing a long delay between the grant of the retrial (on March 7, 1997) and Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Tyson\u2019s two examinations of Frogge (on February 16 and March 9,1998); receiving Dr. Tyson\u2019s report on March 12, 1998, just two days before the new trial began (on March 14, 1998) and two weeks before Tyson testified (on March 26,1998); advising Dr. Tyson of the head injury only after February 16, 1998;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and failing to actually provide Dr. Tyson with \u2014 rather than merely offering to make available to him\u2014 pertinent documents, including head injury-related medical records and statements from Frogge\u2019s family members. According to Frogge, \u201cthe circumstances surrounding Dr. Tyson\u2019s selection and evaluation lead to only one reasonable conclusion: defense counsel\u2019s failure to discover this evidence [of permanent organic brain damage] was the result of inattention and neglect, not \u2018sound, evidence-based judgment.\u2019 \u201d Br. of Appellant 81 (quoting <em>Meyer v. Branker, </em>506 F.3d 358, 371 (4th Cir.2007) (recognizing that \u201cthe touchstone of effective representation must be sound, evidence-based judgment, rather than a set of mandates counsel must program-matically follow without deviation\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Unfortunately for Frogge, although we might be inclined to rule favorably on his ineffective assistance claim if we were assessing it under a less deferential standard of review, we cannot say that the State Decision \u201cinvolved an unreasonable application of\u2019 Supreme Court precedent, as required by AEDPA to grant federal habe-as corpus relief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>see also Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 409, 120 S.Ct. 1495 (\u201cStated simply, a federal habeas court making the \u2018unreasonable application\u2019 inquiry should ask whether the state court\u2019s application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable.\u201d). The relevant precedent certainly includes <em>Strickland </em>and <em>Wiggins, </em>in which the Supreme Court instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">\u201c[Strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation. In other words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary. In any ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-8\"><em>Wiggins, </em>539 U.S. at 521-22, 123 S.Ct. 2527 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690-91, 104 S.Ct. 2052). The <em>Wiggins </em>Court further explained that, \u201c[i]n assessing the reasonableness of an attorney\u2019s investigation, ... a court must consider not only the quantum of evidence already known to counsel, but also whether the known evidence would lead a reasonable attorney to investigate further.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 527, 123 S.Ct. 2527.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">In the circumstances presented here, it was not objectively unreasonable for the state supreme court to determine, in reliance on <em>Strickland </em>and <em>Wiggins, </em>that Frogge\u2019s trial counsel made a valid strategic choice not to further pursue evidence of permanent organic brain damage once they informed Dr. Tyson about the 1990 head injury and he declined to rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>ommend additional testing or experts. <em>Cf. Wilson v. Greene, </em>155 F.3d 396, 403 (4th Cir.1998) (observing that, where counsel had received psychologist\u2019s report opining that defendant was not mentally ill at time of offense, \u201ccounsel was not required to second-guess the contents of this report,\u201d but rather \u201cunderstandably decided not to spend valuable time pursuing what appeared to be an unfruitful line of investigation\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). We conclude that the State Decision was not objectively unreasonable despite the known lack of qualifications on the part of Dr. Tyson to perform neurological or neuropsychological tests; that is, it was not objectively unreasonable for the state supreme court to accept counsel\u2019s MAR hearing testimony that they believed Dr. Tyson at least possessed the ability to determine whether such testing was necessary and justifiably relied on his view in this regard. We also conclude that the State Decision was not objectively unreasonable regardless of the circumstances of Dr. Tyson\u2019s evaluation of Frogge and consultation with counsel\u2014 including the timing thereof \u2014 which Frogge has not sufficiently shown to have influenced Dr. Tyson\u2019s expert opinion and advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">In addition to rejecting the proposition that the State Decision \u201cinvolved an unreasonable application of\u2019 Supreme Court precedent, we also cannot say that the State Decision \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the\u201d MAR court proceeding. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>see also Wiggins, </em>539 U.S. at 528, 123 S.Ct. 2527 (recognizing that a clear factual error \u201creflects \u2018an unreasonable determination of the facts\u2019\u201d under \u00a7 2254(d), and that, in the particular circumstances before it, the state court\u2019s \u201cpartial reliance on an erroneous factual finding further highlighted] the unreasonableness of the state court\u2019s decision\u201d). Frogge attacks several aspects of the state supreme court\u2019s characterization of the facts, including the following observations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">\u2022 \u201c[D]efense counsel provided Dr. Tyson with their entire discovery file ... and made available to him defendant\u2019s medical records,\u201d <em>Frogge, </em>607 S.E.2d at 632;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-9\">\u2022 \u201cThe material supplied to Dr. Tyson also included the testimony given at [the 1995 trial] by Drs. Hoover and Kramer, and attorney Freedman believed that Dr. Tyson testified in [the 1998 trial] that he had reviewed this testimony,\u201d <em>id.) </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-10\">\u2022 \u201cBy the time defense counsel were preparing for defendant\u2019s second trial, they had consulted two mental health experts, Drs. Hoover and Tyson, <em>both of whom had full access to defendant, his family, and the pertinent medical records of defendant\u2019s head injury, </em>and neither of whom recommended neurological testing,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 635 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">According to Frogge, these observations reflect that the state supreme court based its State Decision on the erroneous propositions that counsel had actually provided Dr. Tyson with pertinent documents, including head injury-related medical records and statements from Frogge\u2019s family members, and that Dr. Tyson had reviewed all of the 1995 trial testimony of Drs. Hoover and Kramer. Frogge asserts that, in fact, Dr. Tyson did not receive copies of the medical records and family member statements, and his own testimony at the 1998 trial indicated that he did not fully review the 1995 expert testimony. Although we can understand how one might interpret the somewhat ambiguous State Decision as Frogge has, a close reading reflects that the state supreme court merely observed (with support in the rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>ord) that counsel provided Dr. Tyson with an undefined \u201cdiscovery file\u201d and the expert testimony from the 1995 trial; told him about the 1990 head injury, thereby providing him with the relevant information; and made available to him pertinent medical records and family member statements. The state supreme court further observed that counsel believed Dr. Tyson reviewed the 1995 expert testimony, and that counsel decided not to pursue the permanent organic brain damage evidence after informing Dr. Tyson of the head injury and being advised by him that no further testing or experts were needed. The state supreme court did <em>not </em>aver that counsel actually provided Dr. Tyson with the medical records and family member statements, or that Dr. Tyson fully reviewed the 1995 expert testimony. Accordingly, the state supreme court made no clear factual errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Finally, Frogge takes issue with the state supreme court\u2019s suggestion that counsel\u2019s decision to forego testing for permanent organic brain damage was informed, at least in part, by the \u201cfailure\u201d of the head injury defense in the 1995 trial. <em>See, e.g., Frogge, </em>607 S.E.2d at 635 (observing that, in preparing for the 1998 trial, counsel \u201chad the benefit of watching the first trial unfold and seeing what worked and what did not[, including the unsuccessful] defense which took defendant\u2019s head injury into account\u201d). Although we agree with Frogge that the record does not support the proposition that counsel\u2019s 1998 trial strategy was based on the failure of the 1995 head injury defense, any contrary suggestion by the .state supreme court is not ultimately necessary to its bottom-line conclusion that counsel reasonably relied on the advice of Dr. Tyson.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">rv.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Pursuant to the foregoing, we must affirm the Order of the district court denying Frogge\u2019s petition for federal habeas corpus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b80-7\">.

The jury recommended the death penalty, however, for only the murder of Frogge's stepmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">The jury at the 1998 trial \u2014 which considered the death penalty with respect to only the stepmother\u2019s murder \u2014 found the same four aggravating circumstances that had been found by the 1995 jury. The 1998 jury also found the following six mitigating circumstances: that Frogge had been physically and emotionally abused as a child by his father; had, during his childhood, repeatedly watched his father physically, emotionally, and sexually abuse his mother and sisters; had a lengthy history of drug and alcohol abuse; had admitted his guilt; had adjusted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>well to being in custody; and had made himself available to the investigating officers. Of course, as a prerequisite to its recommendation of the death penalty, the jury also found that the mitigating circumstances were insufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b88-6\">.

Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 188, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976), an attorney\u2019s failure to present mitigating evidence in a capital case takes on heightened significance. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). While my colleagues provide a thorough recitation of the facts, they fall short in applying the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees every defendant effective assistance of counsel. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\"><em>Strickland </em>and its progeny establish that trial counsel is constitutionally obligated to provide effective assistance and to comport with prevailing professional norms. <em>Id. </em>Counsel must also investigate and introduce mitigating evidence unless he or she could \u201creasonably surmise\u201d that evidence \u201cwould be of little help.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 699, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. at 525, 123 S.Ct. 2527 (holding that counsel\u2019s failure to investigate mitigation evidence was ineffective but noting that further investigation is excusable where counsel has evidence suggesting it would be fruitless). In capital cases where a defendant does not claim actual innocence and the jury only has one choice \u2014 life imprisonment or death, counsel\u2019s <em>sole </em>role is to advocate effectively for a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">Here, defense counsel (\u201cDavid Freedman\u201d and \u201cDanny Ferguson,\u201d collectively \u201cdefense counsel\u201d) knew that before murdering his father, Robert, and step-mother, Audrey, Frogge suffered a subdural hema-toma and a subarachnoid hemorrhage to his brain, significantly altering his personality and ability to function. Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Frogge had speech problems, memory problems, and exhibited personality changes. He became more fearful, anxious, paranoid, easily agitated, and explosive. In Frogge\u2019s first trial (\u201cFrogge I\u201d), defense counsel secured Dr. Hoover, a neuropsychologist, to testify that the brain injury induced Frogge\u2019s violent actions. But in Frogge\u2019s second trial (\u201cFrogge II\u201d) defense counsel did not introduce the brain injury or seek neurological testing from an expert qualified to evaluate the extent to which that injury affected Frogge. The Superior Court of Forsyth County\u2019s (\u201cMAR Court\u201d) held that defense counsel\u2019s failure to conduct neurological testing and introduce Frogge\u2019s brain injury was ineffective assistance of counsel. The North Carolina Supreme Court reversed the MAR Court and found that defense counsel\u2019s failure to do so was a sound and strategic trial tactic. When \u201cdirectly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances,\u201d this holding is untenable. <em>Wiggins, </em>539 U.S. at 533, 123 S.Ct. 2527 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690-91, 104 S.Ct. 2052).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">In my view, one cannot, on this record, \u201creasonably surmise\u201d that the evidence of Frogge\u2019s organic brain damage would have been of \u201clittle help.\u201d Hence, my principal concern is not whether counsel should have presented a mitigation case, but rather whether counsel\u2019s failure to seek neurological testing from an expert qualified to evaluate conditions known to exist was <em>itself reasonable. Wiggins, </em>539 U.S. at 523, 123 S.Ct. 2527. As the majority, remarkably answers this question affirmatively, I must dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The Supreme Court, in <em>Wiggins, </em>held that it is constitutionally ineffective for counsel not to investigate and introduce mitigating evidence of a defendant\u2019s social background. 539 U.S. at 525, 123 S.Ct. 2527. Although aware of Wiggins\u2019s unfortunate childhood, counsel in <em>Wiggins </em>did not investigate his family and social history, which revealed that he was abused, and had limited intellectual capacities and a childlike emotional state. <em>Id. </em>at 516, 123 S.Ct. 2527. The post-conviction court concluded that the decision not to investigate was strategic and, thus, not ineffective. <em>Id. </em>at 519, 123 S.Ct. 2527; <em>see also Strickland, </em>at 690-91, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (\u201cStrategic choices made after thorough investigations are virtually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation\u201d). The Supreme Court resoundingly rejected the post-conviction court\u2019s holding, concluding that the investigation was inadequate and a reasonable competent attorney would have realized that pursing those leads was necessary to making an informed choice among possible defenses. <em>Id. </em>at 526, 534, 123 S.Ct. 2527.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Similarly in <em>Rompilla v. Beard, </em>545 U.S. 374, 125 S.Ct. 2456, 162 L.Ed.2d 360 (2005), the Supreme Court found Rompilla\u2019s counsel ineffective for failing to review Rompilla\u2019s court file and to present significant mitigating evidence about Rompilla\u2019s childhood, mental capacity, alcoholism, and prior conviction. <em>Id. </em>Noting that counsel unreasonably relied on family members and medical experts to tell them what records might be useful in Rompilla\u2019s mitigation case, the Court stated: \u201c[tjhere is no need to say more, however, for a further point is clear and dispositive: the lawyers were deficient in failing to examine the court file on Rompilla\u2019s prior conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383, 125 S.Ct. 2456.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">Here, the majority upholds the State Supreme Court\u2019s objectively unreasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>application of <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>principles. The State Supreme Court reversed the MAR Court on the basis that: (1) defense counsel conducted more than a sufficient investigation; and (2) it was a sound strategic defense to rely on expert opinion since the expert, Dr. Tyson, had Frogge\u2019s medical records and Frogge I transcripts. The record does not support either holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">To their credit, defense counsel in Frogge I did investigate and present a persuasive mitigation case. <em>But see Wiggins, </em>539 U.S. at 524, 123 S.Ct. 2527 (noting that counsel abandoned their investigation of Wiggins\u2019s background after having acquired only rudimentary knowledge of his history from a narrow set of sources.). However, for Frogge II, where the only salient issue was whether Frogge would receive a death sentence for Audrey Frogge\u2019s murder, defense counsel clearly demonstrated a lack of attention to investigating and presenting critical mitigation evidence in a capital case.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">In Frogge I, State expert, Dr. Kramer, undercut Dr. Hoover\u2019s opinion primarily on the basis that Dr. Hoover did not conduct neurological testing in support of his opinion that Frogge\u2019s brain injury was permanent and affected his mental capabilities. Because, in their view, Dr. Hoover testified poorly, defense counsel sought out a new expert for the second trial. Remarkably, defense counsel hired Dr. Tyson, a clinical psychologist, not specialized in neuroscience or neuropsycholo-gy, and who by his own admission could not perform the relevant neurological tests. (J.A. 1109.) Notwithstanding knowledge of Frogge\u2019s brain injury and the need for neurological testing, defense counsel waited until the eve of Frogge\u2019s second trial to ask Dr. Tyson, whether Frogge\u2019s brain injury \u201caffect[ed] his evaluations.\u201d (J.A. 1875.) Even though at least one juror found that Dr. Hoover\u2019s testimony in the first trial supported the statutory mitigating factor of mental illness, defense counsel accepted Dr. Tyson\u2019s opinion that the brain injury was irrelevant. Having not provided any family statements or Frogge\u2019s medical records to Dr. Tyson, it was unreasonable for defense counsel to rely on or, in the majority\u2019s words, be \u201cconvinced\u201d by Dr. Tyson\u2019s uninformed opinion. (Maj. Op. at 63.) Moreover, given that Dr. Kramer eviscerated Dr. Hoover\u2019s opinion based on his failure to conduct neurological testing, it is unfathomable that defense counsel would not obtain such testing to shore up this glaring weakness.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">What is more, there is no evidence that defense counsel\u2019s failure to conduct neurological testing and present Frogge\u2019s brain injury was a \u201cstrategic\u201d decision. Defense counsel did not testify or even suggest that they thought it a better strategy to not present the brain injury evidence. The <em>ABA Guidelines for Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases </em>notes that mental health mitigation evidence is extremely important to capital sentencing juries. <em>See </em>Commentary to ABA Guideline 4.1 (stating that \u201cmental health experts are essential to defending capital cases.\u201d). The \u201c[Supreme Court] [has] long [] referred [to these ABA standards] as \u2018guides to determining what is reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wiggins, </em>539 U.S. at 524, 123 S.Ct. 2527.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">In Frogge\u2019s case, the most persuasive mitigating evidence regarding his mental health was kept from the jury. The mandate of <em>Strickland </em>and the Constitution is not simply to investigate, but rather to provide \u201ceffective\u201d assistance. Defense counsel\u2019s actions in light of the circumstances were \u201crudimentary\u201d and certainly illogical and unreasonable. While I do not suggest that defense counsel must scour the earth \u201cshopping\u201d for the most preemi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>nent experts, I do believe that justice requires, at a minimum, for counsel to secure an expert in the relevant field. This is particularly so, for a counsel who knows, as here, the specific testing required to support its mental health defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Without question, defense counsel\u2019s initial inquiry revealed that neurological testing was necessary. The anecdotal evidence of Frogge\u2019s post-brain injury behavior, Dr. Hoover\u2019s assessment, and the testimony of Dr. Kramer taken together illustrate that defense counsel could not have \u201creasonably surmised\u201d that neurological testing, in spite of Dr. Tyson\u2019s opinion, would have been fruitless. Indeed, it is neurological testing alone that revealed that Frogge suffers from permanent organic brain damage. Thus, defense counsel\u2019s decision not to conduct neurological testing or even present evidence of Frogge\u2019s brain injury was unreasonable in light of <em>Strickland </em>and prevailing professional norms.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Additionally, the record further underscores the State Supreme Court\u2019s unreasonable denial of relief. The State Supreme Court held that it was objectively reasonable for defense counsel to rely on Dr. Tyson\u2019s assessment because Dr. Tyson had Frogge\u2019s medical and social histories, and transcripts from Frogge I. (J.A. 2198.) How the State Supreme Court reaches this conclusion is befuddling. The MAR court specifically found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-9\">Dr. Tyson did not perform or request any neurological or neuropsychological tests on [Frogge], and none were done. <em>His diagnosis was not supported by reliance on any such tests, review of medical records concerning the 1990 head injury or descriptions by family and friends </em>of changes in the defendant\u2019s behavior after that injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">(J.A. 2135, emphasis added.) In light of the Anti-Terrorism Effective Death Penalty Act\u2019s mandate that a state court\u2019s findings of fact are entitled to a \u201cpresumption of correctness,\u201d the State Supreme Court\u2019s factual error is a dispositive display of an \u201cerroneous application of facts to the law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). First, Ferguson testified that he did not \u201crecall\u201d or \u201cthink\u201d that he provided the medical records or social history reports to Dr. Tyson. (J.A. 1909). Second, in an affidavit provided to the MAR court, Dr. Tyson attested that he was not provided with, nor did he review, any medical records concerning Frogge\u2019s brain injury. (J.A. 1109.) Third, Freedman also submitted an affidavit attesting that he did not provide Dr. Tyson with Frogge\u2019s medical records, which detailed Frogge\u2019s brain injury. (J.A. 2028). Finally, the State Supreme Court did not find any error in the MAR court\u2019s clear factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">According to the majority, the State Supreme Court\u2019s factual error is inconsequential because the court \u201cmerely observed\u201d that Dr. Tyson reviewed the medical records. However, the majority, itself, recognizes that the State Supreme Court thrice stated this factual error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Most tellingly, it was only in the context of this erroneous factual predicate \u2014 Dr. Tyson being given Frogge\u2019s medical and social histories \u2014 that the Court decided whether defense counsel\u2019s failure to pursue neurological testing was objectively reasonable and prejudicial to Frogge. (J.A. 2198.) The State Supreme Court\u2019s rationale demonstrates that the Court\u2019s holding was tethered to a significant factual error. The majority\u2019s observations to the contrary are incredulous.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Put simply, the State Supreme Court\u2019s assumption that Dr. Tyson offered an opinion informed by Frogge\u2019s medical records was clearly erroneous and reflects \u201can unreasonable determination of the facts in the light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(2). Moreover, the State Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that the scope of defense counsel\u2019s investigation of Frogge\u2019s mental health meets the legal standards of <em>Strickland </em>is an objectively unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Unlike the majority, I am also certain that defense counsel\u2019s \u201cineffective assistance\u201d prejudiced Frogge within the meaning of <em>Strickland. </em>Under <em>Strickland, </em>Frogge must show that \u201cbut for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the [sentence] would have been different.\u201d <em>Bowie v. Branker, </em>512 F.3d 112, 120 (4th Cir.2008). In determining prejudice, we must \u201creweigh the evidence in aggravation against the totality of available mitigating evidence.\u201d <em>Wiggins, </em>123 S.Ct. at 2542.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Because the State Supreme Court reversed the MAR Court on the <em>Strickland </em>performance prong, it did not assess Frogge\u2019s ineffective assistance claim for prejudice. The State, however, offered substantial evidence of aggravating circumstances. For example, the State emphasized that Audrey was bedridden and Frogge stabbed her over eleven times. Due to her condition, she was also forced to watch Frogge stab his father to death. Frogge also testified that Audrey had done nothing to provoke his rage.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">Mental health evidence was the crux of Frogge\u2019s mitigation case. How else to explain why the same young man who thoughtfully came home to make his bedridden step-mother a grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup would, mere hours later, beat her to death. Thus, it was paramount for defense counsel to offer an explanation as to why Frogge went into an uncontrollable rage and murdered Audrey. Dr. Tyson testified that Frogge likely suffered from personality disorder and had limited functioning skills aggravated by substance abuse. Unlike Frogge I, no evidence of Frogge\u2019s brain injury \u2014 let alone <em>organic </em>brain damage \u2014 was presented to the jury, despite defense counsel\u2019s belief that the injury was significant. \u201cUnder North Carolina law, ... the prejudice inquiry in this case distills to whether [Frogge] had shown that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance, at least one jury member would have found the mitigating circumstances outweigh the aggravating circumstances and recommended life imprisonment.\u201d <em>Bowie v. Branker, </em>512 F.3d at 120.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">The answer to this inquiry is obvious. When presented with evidence of Frogge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>brain injury at least one juror in Frogge I found that the crime was committed under the influence of mental or emotional disturbance, thereby depriving Frogge of the capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct \u2014 a statutory mitigating factor under North Carolina law. The absence of such evidence from the guilt and penalty phase of Frogge\u2019s second trial undoubtedly prejudiced him. But for defense counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the jury would have known that Frogge suffers from permanent organic brain damage \u2014 a diagnosis the State does not rebut \u2014 which \u201cunder periods of extreme emotional distress would lead him to act impulsively and not appreciate the full consequences of his actions, impairing his judgment, reasoning and impulse control.\u201d (J.A. 1706-07.)</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Given the powerful nature of this evidence, the outcome reached by the majority truly is alarming. Frogge\u2019s organic brain damage coupled with the other mitigation evidences \u201cmight well have influenced\u201d at least one juror\u2019s \u201c \u2018appraisal\u2019 of his \u2018culpability,\u2019 \u201d as it did the experienced MAR judge \u2014 a rarity. <em>Rompilla, </em>545 U.S. at 393, 125 S.Ct. 2456 (citing <em>Wiggins, </em>539 U.S. at 538, 123 S.Ct. 2527). Quite clearly, defense counsel\u2019s failure to even present evidence of Frogge\u2019s brain injury and obtain neurological testing is ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b95-8\">. The State Supreme Court stated the following: \"[Djefense counsel provided Dr. Tyson with their entire discovery file ... and made available to him defendant\u2019s medical records;\" \"The material supplied to Dr. Tyson also included the testimony given at [the 1995 trial] by Drs. Hoover and Kramer, and attorney Freedman believed that Dr. Tyson testified in [the 1998 trial] that he had reviewed this testimony;\u201d \u201cBy the time defense counsel were preparing for defendant\u2019s second trial, they had consulted two mental health experts, Drs. Hoover and Tyson, both of whom had full access to defendant, his family, and the pertinent medical records of defendant\u2019s head injury, and neither of whom recommended neurological testing.\" <em>State v.
