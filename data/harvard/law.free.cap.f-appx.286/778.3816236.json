He challenges the BIA\u2019s denial of his applications for asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). For the reasons set forth below, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-22\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of Peregina\u2019s asylum application. The denial was based on Peregina\u2019s failure to timely file his application for asylum, and we \u201clack[] jurisdiction to review an asylum petition that an Immigration Judge (\u2018IJ\u2019) or [the BIA] deems untimely.\u201d <em>Tar-rawally v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 180, 182 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-23\">To the extent Peregina alleges violation of due process, we lack jurisdiction to address it as he failed to present the argument to the BIA. <em>See Bonhometre v. Gonzales, </em>414 F.3d 442, 448 (3d Cir.2005) (\u201c[Petitioner]\u2019s claims, though argued in the language of procedural due process, essentially claim that the IJ failed in its duty to completely develop this case.... [Because petitioner\u2019s] procedural due process claims thus could have been argued before the BIA, ... his failure to do so is thus fatal to our jurisdiction over this petition.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-24\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-25\">We do have jurisdiction, however, to review the denial of Peregina\u2019s applications for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT. Where, as here, the BIA adopted the decision of the IJ, we review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ. <em>Shehu v. Att\u2019y General, </em>482 F.3d 652, 657 (3d Cir. 2007). \u201cWe review the IJ and BIA\u2019s findings for substantial evidence and, therefore, may not set them aside unless a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>reasonable factfinder would be compelled to find to the contrary.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">\u201c[T]he Attorney General may not remove an alien to a country if the Attorney General decides that the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1281(b)(3)(A). \u201cIt is the applicant\u2019s burden to establish the threat to life or freedom by a \u2018clear probability.\u2019 This standard is satisfied if the evidence establishes that it is more likely than not that the alien would be subject to persecution on one of the specified grounds.\u201d <em>Jarbough v. Att\u2019y General, </em>483 F.3d 184, 190-191 (3d Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cA finding of past persecution raises a rebuttable presumption that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in the future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Peregina did not establish that he has suffered from past persecution. The IJ found that classmate demands for money, an after-school fight and disputes relating to Peregina\u2019s father\u2019s store were motivated by money and, regardless, were not sufficiently severe to rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Lie v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 530 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">We detect no evidence that Peregina was harmed by the Indonesian government, or that the government was unwilling or unable to protect him. In addition, Peregina has failed to establish that there is a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of persecution of Chinese Christians in Indonesia. <em>Wong v. Att\u2019y General, </em>539 F.3d 225 (3d Cir.2008) (discussing the U.S. State Department\u2019s 2003 and 2004 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Indonesia and the U.S. State Department\u2019s 2003 and 2004 International Religious Freedom Reports for Indonesia). Furthermore, because his parents and siblings remained in Indonesia unharmed, the IJ reasonably concluded that Peregina failed to establish that he would be persecuted if removed to Indonesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">\u201cTo qualify for relief under the CAT, an applicant ... bears the burden of proving through objective evidence that \u2018it is more likely than not\u2019 that s/he would be \u2018tortured\u2019 in the country to which the applicant would be removed.\u201d <em>Obale v. Att\u2019y General, </em>453 F.3d 151, 161 (3d Cir.2006). Peregina offers no support for his contention that he will be tortured should he return to Indonesia. Thus we will not reverse the denial of his application for protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\"><em>% </em># ij: :{: i{c 3:</p>\n<p id=\"b805-13\">We have considered all contentions raised by the parties and conclude that no further discussion is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-14\">The petition for review will be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
