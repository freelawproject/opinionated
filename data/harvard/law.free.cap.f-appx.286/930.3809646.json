The district court in this case held that it had no such authority. Subsequent to that determination, the Supreme Court held that a sentencing \u201cjudge may consider the disparity between the Guidelines\u2019 treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 564, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). In view of <em>Kimbrough, </em>the government concedes that we should remand this case for resen-tencing. We agree and therefore vacate the sentence and remand the case to the district court for resentencing in light of <em>Kimbrough.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
