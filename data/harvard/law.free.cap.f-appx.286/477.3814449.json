Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review factual findings for substantial evidence, <em>Cruz-Navarro v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1024, 1028 (9th Cir.2000), and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The record does not compel the conclusion that the extraordinary circumstances exception excused the untimely filing of Gorbitz Espinoza\u2019s asylum application. <em>See Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 648, 657-58 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal because Gorbitz Espinoza failed to establish that the Shining Path persecuted him on account of an imputed political opinion. <em>See Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1094-95 (9th Cir.2002) (no imputed political opinion where petitioner offered no evidence that his father had a political opinion that could be imputed to petitioner); see <em>also Cruz-Navarro, </em>232 F.3d at 1030 (no imputed political opinion where there was no evidence to show that guerillas imputed a political opinion to petitioner). Moreover, the record does not support Gorbitz Espinoza\u2019s contention that he was persecuted on account of an actual political opinion. <em>See Cruz-Navarro, </em>232 F.3d at 1030. Lastly, Gorbitz Espinoza\u2019s withholding of removal also claim fails because neither his testimony nor the documentary evidence compel a finding of a clear probability of persecution. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Gorbitz Espinoza has not established that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured \u201cby or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)(1). The record does not support Gorbitz Espinoza\u2019s contention that he was tortured previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b503-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
