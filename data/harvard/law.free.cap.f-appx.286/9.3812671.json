The district court sentenced Truesdale to eleven months and five days\u2019 imprisonment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> one year of supervised release, and ordered him to pay restitution of $359,810.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Trues-dale\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether Trues-dale\u2019s sentence was reasonable. Truesdale was advised of his right to file a <em>pro se </em>brief, but has failed to do so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-22\">Appellate courts review sentences imposed by district courts for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597-98, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473-74 (4th Cir.2007) (discussing procedure district courts must follow in sentencing defendant). Although Truesdale contends that his sentence is unreasonable, the record reflects that the district court properly determined the advisory and statutory guideline range, considered the relevant sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2008), including Truesdale\u2019s medical condition, and sentenced Truesdale below the advisory guideline range and below the applicable statutory maximum sentence. Other than his claim that the district court failed to consider his medical condition prior to sentencing him, which the record clearly belies, Truesdale offers no support for his claim that his sentence is unreasonable. As the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>court complied fully with the constitutional and statutory requirements in imposing Truesdale\u2019s sentence, we conclude that the sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Truesdale\u2019s conviction and sentence. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw from representation at this juncture. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b35-19\">. At the sentencing hearing, the district court sentenced Truesdale to twelve months\u2019 imprisonment, but later reduced the sentence, as reflected in the judgment and commitment order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b35-20\">. The probation officer calculated an advisory sentencing guideline range for Truesdale of twenty-four to thirty months\u2019 imprisonment, founded on a total offense level of seventeen and a criminal history category of I. However, as the maximum statutory sentence applicable to Truesdale\u2019s crime is twelve months\u2019 imprisonment, <em>see 26 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 7203 (2000), the resulting guideline range becomes twelve months. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 5G1.1 (c)(1) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
