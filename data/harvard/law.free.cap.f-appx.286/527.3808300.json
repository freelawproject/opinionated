We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). We review de novo the BAP\u2019s decision. <em>Turtle Rock Meadows Homeowners Ass\u2019n v. Slyman (In re Slyman), </em>234 F.3d 1081, 1085 (9th Cir.2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The BAP properly concluded that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion for default judgment because Li, Tong, and Goudie failed to present evidence that the debt was incurred by false statements, fraud, or a willful and malicious injury, and failed to present evidence that the debtors knowingly and fraudulently made false statements in their bankruptcy documents. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(2), 523(a)(6), 727(a)(4)(A); <em>Field v. Mans, </em>516 U.S. 59, 66, 116 S.Ct. 437, 133 L.Ed.2d 351 (1995) (explaining the circumstances under which \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) and (B) bar a debt from discharge); <em>Ditto v. McCurdy, </em>510 F.3d 1070, 1077 (9th Cir.2007) (indicating that the \u201cwillful and malicious injury\u201d exception under \u00a7 523(a)(6) is limited to cases in which the debtor intends to cause injury); <em>Fogal Legware of Switz., Inc. v. Wills (In re Wills), </em>243 B.R. 58, 62-64 (9th Cir. BAP 1999) (discussing the denial of discharge under \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The BAP properly concluded that the bankruptcy court did not err when it dismissed the adversary proceeding because Li, Tong, and Goudie (1) had a full and fair opportunity to present their arguments and evidence in connection with their two motions for default judgment; (2) failed to demonstrate any basis for finding the debt nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a) or for denying discharge under \u00a7 727(a); and (3) did not ask the bankruptcy court for additional time to conduct discovery or to file supplemental briefs. <em>See Columbia Steel Fabricators, Inc. v. Ahlstrom Recovery, </em>44 F.3d 800, 803 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b554-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
