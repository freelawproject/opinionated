We have jurisdiction to determine our own jurisdiction, <em>Lopez-Molina v. Ashcroft, </em>368 F.3d 1206, 1208 (9th Cir. 2004), and we dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-25\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that it had reason to believe Pineda-Cruz knowingly colluded with others in the illicit trafficking of marijuana. Pineda-Cruz\u2019s sworn statement indicated that he accepted $200 to accompany his cousin across the border and was aware that there were drugs in the car his cousin was driving. <em>See Alarcon-Serrano v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1116, 1120 (9th Cir.2000). We therefore lack jurisdiction over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>petition for review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C); <em>Lopez-Molina, </em>368 F.3d at 1209.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b514-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
