We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, <em>see Ordonez v. INS, </em>345 F.3d 777, 782 (9th Cir.2003), and we review due process claims de novo, <em>Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Hermanto\u2019s motion to reopen because it was untimely and Hermanto failed to present evidence of material changed circumstances. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2); <em>see also Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cThe critical question is ... whether circumstances have changed sufficiently that a petitioner who previously did not have a legitimate claim for asylum now has a well-founded fear of persecution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">Hermanto also claims the BIA violated her due process rights to a fair hearing because it did not allow Hermanto to present evidence of changed circumstances. The claim fails because the motion to reopen was not granted and Hermanto did not demonstrate error and substantial prejudice. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) (stating that motion to reopen shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material); <em>see also Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (holding petitioner must demonstrate error and substantial prejudice to prevail on a due process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b536-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
