Slakman, pro se, appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Barbara Adamo and Phillip Faircloth upon their renewed motion in a diversity interpleader action, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332(a)(1) and 1335, for an order of distribution of life insurance proceeds, pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 33-25-13, following the murder of Slakman\u2019s wife, Shana Slak-man (\u201cShana\u201d). Slakman argues that he established a genuine issue of material fact by rebutting the prima facie evidence that he murdered Shana, which consisted of a final state court judgment of conviction. In particular, Slakman argues that he presented facts showing that (1) the murder must have occurred after he left home because it was \u201cphysically improbable\u201d for someone to have killed Shana, moved her body, and cleaned up the crime scene in a 20-minute time frame, and (2) based on certain trial evidence and the affidavit of his retained professional engineer, he was not at home at the time Shana\u2019s body was moved. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">As a preliminary matter, in addition to the issue on appeal, we construe statements in Slakman\u2019s brief as a motion to file a deferred appendix, pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 30(c)(1). We deny the motion because the documents Slakman wishes to file in an appendix are not necessary to resolve the issue on appeal. Thus, we dispense with the appendix and thereby permit the appeal to proceed on the original record, pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 30(f). Accordingly, Slakman\u2019s motion to file a deferred appendix is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo, \u201cviewing the record and drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Weeks v. Harden Mfg. Corp., </em>291 F.3d 1307, 1311 (11th Cir.2002). Summary judgment is proper if the pleadings, depositions, and affidavits show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"atv-dedup-0\">Under Georgia law,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-13\">[n]o person who commits murder or voluntary manslaughter or who conspires with another to commit murder shall receive any benefits from any insurance policy on the life of the deceased, even though the person so killing or conspiring be named beneficiary in the insurance policy. A plea of guilty or a judicial finding of guilt not reversed or otherwise set aside as to any of such crimes shall be prima-facie evidence of guilt in determining rights under this Code section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-14\">O.C.G.A. \u00a7 33-25-13. Under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 33-25-13, a murder conviction \u201cmay serve as prima facie evidence of guilt in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>civil proceeding brought pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 33-25-13 upon either the exhaustion of the ... right to a direct appeal or the expiration of time within which a first direct appeal could have been timely filed.\u201d <em>Slakman v. Continental Cas. Co., </em>277 Ga. 189, 587 S.E.2d 24, 27 (2003). A preponderance of the evidence is sufficient to support a verdict in a civil case. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 24-4-3. Prima facie evidence means \u201cevidence of such nature as is sufficient to establish a fact and which, if unrebutted, remains sufficient for that purpose.\u201d <em>Cumulus Media, Inc. v. Clear Channel Communications, Inc., </em>304 F.3d 1167, 1176 n. 13 (11th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also King v. State, </em>179 Ga.App. 184, 345 S.E.2d 902, 904 (1986) (\u201cPrima facie evidence is such evidence as in judgment of law is sufficient, and if not rebutted remains sufficient.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed Slakman\u2019s conviction and the United States Supreme Court denied Slakman\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari. <em>Slakman v. State, </em>280 Ga. 837, 632 S.E.2d 378, 385 (2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1273, 167 L.Ed.2d 95 (2007). Thus, Slakman\u2019s conviction was prima facie evidence that he was guilty of Shana\u2019s murder for the purpose of determining that he could not receive proceeds of an insurance policy on Shana\u2019s life. Upon Adamo and Fairchild\u2019s renewed motion for summary judgment, therefore, Slakman had the burden to \u201cset forth specific facts showing that there [was] a genuine issue for trial,\u201d and that a jury in the civil case \u201ccould reasonably find for\u201d him. <em>Walker v. Darby, </em>911 F.2d 1573, 1577 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Slakman has not met his burden. Although he pointed to specific facts purportedly presented at trial, Slakman did not make all of the trial evidence part of the record in his interpleader action. The pri-ma facie evidence of guilt was a certified copy of a final conviction, along with the Georgia Supreme Court\u2019s account of the evidence in support of the conviction. The court noted that the time of death was as early as 6:00 a.m., as opposed to the 7:00 a.m. time that Slakman suggested. Additionally, the court noted that upon being told that the body was found in the bedroom, Slakman told police that they found the body in the shower. <em>Slakman v. State, </em>632 S.E.2d at 382. Moreover, the court specifically found that sufficient evidence supported the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>The record therefore shows that there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Slakman murdered his wife. Accordingly, Adamo and Faircloth were entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of Adamo and Faireloth\u2019s renewed motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">AFFIRMED AND MOTION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
