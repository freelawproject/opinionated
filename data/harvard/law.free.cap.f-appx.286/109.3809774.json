We recently affirmed the conviction but vacated the sentence and remanded for the district court to calculate gross receipts consistently with our opinion; we did not upset the district court\u2019s finding that the fraud resulted in at least $84,914 of damages. <em>See United States v. Gharbi, </em>510 F.3d 550 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-19\">Before an applicant for naturalization can be admitted as a United States citizen, he must have \u201cbeen and still [be] a person of good moral character\u201d for a specified amount of time before naturalization. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1427(a)(3). By statute, no one can be a person of good moral character \u201cwho ... has been convicted of an aggravated felony,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f)(8), with aggravated felony being defined, <em>inter alia, </em>as \u201cfraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i). Because Ghar-bi was convicted of an aggravated felony while his application for naturalization was pending, the district court did not err in dismissing without prejudice his petition for review of his naturalization application.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b135-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-23\">. Gharbi offers a number of arguments why he should be granted immediate citizenship. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>We are not authorized by statute to consider these arguments. The Supreme \"Court has repeatedly emphasized that over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete than it is over the admission of aliens.... [T]he power to expel or exclude aliens [is] a fundamental sovereign attribute exercised by the Government's political departments largely immune from judicial control.\u201d <em>Fiallo v. Bell, </em>430 U.S. 787, 792, 97 S.Ct. 1473, 52 L.Ed.2d 50 (1977) (internal citations and quotations omitted). The statutes are unambiguous that Gharbi does not qualify for citizenship. \"Once it has been determined that a person does not qualify for citizenship, ... the district court has no discretion to ignore the defect and grant citizenship.\u201d <em>I.N.S. v. Pangilinan, </em>486 U.S. 875, 884, 108 S.Ct. 2210, 100 L.Ed.2d 882 (1988) (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
