Perdomo is the primary applicant; the claims of his wife and children are derivative of his application. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(3) (2000); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.21(a) (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-21\">In their petition for review, the Petitioners argue that the Board and immigration judge erred in concluding that their asylum application was time-barred. Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000), \u201c[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General under paragraph (2),\u201d which includes both the Attorney General\u2019s decisions whether an alien has complied with the one-year time limit and whether there are changed or extraordinary circumstances excusing the untimeliness. Courts of appeal have uniformly held this jurisdiction-stripping provision precludes judicial review not only of all such determinations, but also of the merits of the underlying asylum claim. <em>See Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 151 (2d Cir.2006) (collecting cases). Given this jurisdictional bar, we cannot review the Petitioners\u2019 challenge to the finding that their asylum application was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-22\">The Petitioners also contend the Board and the immigration judge erred in denying their request for withholding of removal. \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b) (2007). Based on our review of the record, we find that the Petitioners failed to make the requisite showing. We therefore uphold the denial of their request for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Accordingly, we deny the Petitioners\u2019 petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
