Nelson denying his application for relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Kai Wang, </em>No. A 97 959 059 (B.I.A. Nov. 21, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 97 959 059 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 14, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-16\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-17\">As a preliminary matter, issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir. 2005). In his appeal from the IJ\u2019s decision, Wang argued that he had demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>strated past persecution on account of his practice of Falun Gong. The BIA declined to review that argument. However, in his brief to this Court, Wang fails to raise any past persecution claim or challenge to the BIA\u2019s decision in this regard. Thus, we deem any such arguments waived. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Wang failed to establish eligibility for relief under the CAT. The agency reasonably found that Wang\u2019s documentation did not establish that it was more likely than not he would be tortured. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c). The 2005 State Department Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions for China (\u201cProfile\u201d) indicates that Chinese nationals returned to China from the United States are detained only long enough for relatives to arrange their travel home, fines are rare, and U.S. officials have not confirmed any cases of abuse of such persons, although organizers or enforcers of illegal migrant trafficking are liable to face criminal prosecution. Profile at 160. The treatment described in the Profile would not amount to torture. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Even assuming that Wang would be detained upon his return to China, he failed to submit evidence that Chinese nationals who left illegally are subject to mistreatment or torture in detention. In particular, while he claimed that individuals from his village were detained and beaten due to their illegal departure, he failed to submit every anecdotal evidence corroborating that claim. Further, while the Amnesty International report and 2004 State Department Country Report on Human Rights Practices for China submitted by Wang indicate that torture and ill-treatment may occur in China, the agency reasonably concluded that those documents were \u201ctoo general\u201d to establish that Wang in particular was likely to be tortured. <em>Cf. Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 159-60 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that a reasonable factfinder would not be compelled to conclude that the petitioner would more likely than not be subjected to torture if removed to China based solely on the fact that she had illegally departed China, without more particularized evidence). Likewise, the agency reasonably found that the statements from Wang\u2019s father and friend in China were not probative as to whether it was more likely than not that someone in Wang\u2019s circumstances would be tortured in China. Although Wang\u2019s father and friend asserted that he \u201cmay be sentenced to prison or detention,\u201d and that the police department \u201cexecutes] a higher level of punishment on smugglers,\u201d Wang himself was not a smuggler, and his father and friend failed to reference the basis for them assertions regarding the punishments inflicted. Thus, the agency reasonably concluded that Wang-failed to meet his burden to establish eligibility for relief under the CAT. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
