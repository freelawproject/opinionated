Cebull, United States District Judge for the District of Montana, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b999-15\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-16\">Appellant Sabrina Auble appeals her conviction and sentence for importation of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952 and 960, and for possession with intent to distribute marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-17\">1. Auble\u2019s Confrontation Clause right was not violated by the admission of her co-defendant\u2019s contradictory statements because the statements, by themselves, did not \u201cfacially, expressly, clearly, or powerfully\u201d implicate her, <em>United States v. Angwin, </em>271 F.3d 786, 796 (9th Cir. 2001), and, alternatively, because the statements were non-hearsay. <em>See Tennessee v. Street, </em>471 U.S. 409, 414, 105 S.Ct. 2078, 85 L.Ed.2d 425 (1985); <em>see also United States v. Hackett, </em>638 F.2d 1179, 1186-87 (9th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-18\">2. Admission of the evidence found on Auble\u2019s co-defendant, a glass smoking pipe and a baggy believed to contain marijuana, was an abuse of discretion. This evidence was \u201chighly prejudicial,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>there was no suggestion that it was part and parcel of the transaction or necessary for the prosecutor to tell a coherent story. <em>United States v. Vizcarra-Martinez, </em>66 F.3d 1006, 1012-13, 1017 (9th Cir.1995). However, the district court\u2019s error was harmless because 1) the baggy and pipe evidence was not heavily relied on by the prosecution; 2) the evidence was used only to challenge Auble\u2019s credibility; and 3) the evidence against Auble, including driving a car containing over sixty-four pounds of marijuana and her outlandish testimony, was strong. <em>See id. </em>at 1017.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">3. Because no manifest prejudice resulted from the joint trial, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Auble\u2019s motion to sever. <em>See United States v. Fernandez, </em>388 F.3d 1199, 1241 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">4. Sufficient evidence supported Auble\u2019s conviction, as a rational trier of fact could have found that Auble had dominion over the car and knew marijuana was in the gas tank. <em>See United States v. Hursh, </em>217 F.3d 761, 767-68 (9th Cir.2000); <em>see also United States v. Rubio-Villareal, </em>927 F.2d 1495, 1499 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">5. The district court did not clearly err in denying Auble\u2019s motion for a minor-role sentence reduction because the court evaluated her culpability relative to the other participants, she \u201cwas the driver ... of a vehicle in which a substantial amount of marijuana was hidden,\u201d and the evidence adequately indicated that she knew marijuana was in the gas tank. <em>Hursh, </em>217 F.3d at 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">6. The sentence imposed by the district court was not unreasonable: the court committed no error in applying the Guidelines, considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and sentenced Auble to the low end of the Guidelines range. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b999-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
