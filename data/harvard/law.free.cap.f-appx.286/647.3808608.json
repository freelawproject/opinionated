On appeal, Ward contends the ALJ\u2019s determination that her depression was not a severe impairment was not supported by substantial evidence. Ward also claims the ALJ improperly discounted the medical opinions of Dr. Pino, a treating physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-14\">In Social Security appeals, we review <em>de novo </em>the legal principles upon which the ALJ\u2019s decision is based. <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). However, the ultimate decision is reviewed only to determine whether it was supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>\u201cSubstantial evidence is less than a preponderance, but rather such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-16\">In a Social Security case, the claimant bears the burden of proving she has a severe impairment or combination of impairments. <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999). This is a threshold inquiry where only the most trivial impairments are rejected. <em>McDaniel v. Bowen, </em>800 F.2d 1026, 1031 (11th Cir. 1986). The claimant\u2019s burden of showing a severe impairment is mild. <em>Id. </em>An impairment is severe if it significantly limits the claimant\u2019s physical or mental ability to do basic work activities. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1521(a). \u201cBasic work activities\u201d involve the \u201cabilities and aptitudes necessary to do most jobs\u201d and include the mental functions of understanding, carrying out, and remembering simple instructions; use of judgment; responding appropriately to supervision, coworkers, and usual work situations; and dealing with changes in a routine work setting. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1521(b). \u201cAn impairment is not severe only if the abnormality is so slight and its effect so minimal that it would clearly not be expected to interfere with the individual\u2019s ability to work, irre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>spective of age, education or work experience.\u201d <em>McDaniel, </em>800 F.2d at 1031.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Before the ALJ was substantial evidence of Ward\u2019s regular activities. Ward testified she cared for herself and her three pets, maintained her hygiene, went grocery shopping, did laundry and the dishes, and interacted with friends and relatives. In addition, during interviews with Dr. Mhatre and Dr. Amiel in 2000, Ward indicated she taught master gardener classes, led a Bible study group, and became an ordained minister. According to a 2001 medical progress note, Ward had begun attending classes for up to six hours a week as part of her training to become a phone counselor for a crisis center. These undertakings are evidence of Ward\u2019s ability to perform basic work activities. Moreover, Dr. Mhatre\u2019s report labeled Ward\u2019s ability to do most work-related activities as \u201cexcellent\u201d (Ward\u2019s abilities to travel in unfamiliar places and use public transportation were rated as only \u201cfair\u201d). This assessment mirrors the determinations of two state agency psychologists, Dr. Bates and Dr. Wise, who concluded Ward\u2019s mental impairment was not severe. The evaluations of these three physicians, coupled with the evidence of Ward\u2019s regular activities, provided substantial evidence upon which the ALJ was entitled to find Ward\u2019s depression was not a severe impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">In assessing the medical evidence in a Social Security case, the ALJ is \u201crequired to state with particularity the weight [s]he gave the different medical opinions and the reasons therefor.\u201d <em>Sharfarz v. Bowen, </em>825 F.2d 278, 279 (11th Cir.1987). An ALJ may reject any medical opinion if the evidence supports a contrary finding. <em>Id. </em>at 280. A treating physician\u2019s testimony must be given substantial or considerable weight unless good cause not to do so is shown. <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1159 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cThis Court has concluded \u2018good cause\u2019 exists when the: (1) treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician\u2019s opinion was conclu-sory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240-41 (11th Cir.2004). An ALJ need not give a treating physician\u2019s opinion considerable weight if the claimant\u2019s own testimony regarding her daily activities contradicts that opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">Dr. Pino treated Ward on numerous occasions up until April 1998. In his report following Ward\u2019s final treatment, Dr. Pino described Ward as having a virtual lack of functioning and gave her a Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) score of 41, which indicates Ward had \u201cserious symptoms OR any serious impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning.\u201d This report was identical to the reports prepared by Dr. Pino at the conclusion of each of Ward\u2019s prior treatments, which had begun some seven months earlier. In August 2000, Dr. Pino conducted a Social Security assessment of Ward\u2019s ability to do work-related activities. In this report, Dr. Pino labeled as \u201cpoor\u201d Ward\u2019s ability to perform activities within a schedule, maintain regular attendance, sustain an ordinary routine -without special supervision, work with or near others without being distracted by them, complete a normal workday or workweek, and perform at a consistent pace.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">The ALJ articulated legitimate reasons for giving less weight to Dr. Pino\u2019s medical opinions, and its decision to discount the opinions is supported by substantial evidence. The ALJ correctly noted Dr. Pino\u2019s statements following his final treatment of Ward in 1998 were supported by only Ward\u2019s subjective complaints, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>diagnostic analysis or testing. This supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Dr. Pino\u2019s statements were entitled to less weight. Similarly, the ALJ did not err in affording less weight to Dr. Pino\u2019s 2000 assessment, based on her finding that the assessment was not supported by current medical evidence, since it was conducted more than two years after Dr. Pino last treated Ward. Further supporting the ALJ\u2019s decision to discount Dr. Pino\u2019s medical opinions is the fact that Ward\u2019s own testimony and the record evidence show Ward was less impaired than the opinions might otherwise indicate. As discussed above, the ALJ was presented with evidence of Ward\u2019s caring for herself and pets, maintaining her hygiene, teaching master gardening classes, leading a bible study, becoming an ordained minister, and attending classes each week as part of training to become a phone counselor. This evidence of Ward\u2019s activities and the shortcomings in Dr. Pino\u2019s opinions provided substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision to place less than controlling weight behind Dr. Pino\u2019s medical reports.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Based on a thorough review of the administrative and district court records, upon consideration of the briefs of the parties, and for the reasons stated above, we discern no error in the ALJ\u2019s determination. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b676-8\">. The ALJ also afforded Dr. Amiel\u2019s medical opinion less weight because it was supported solely by Ward's subjective complaints. This was not error. Even if it were, the error would be harmless. Dr. Amiel's report does nol support the conclusion that Ward\u2019s depression was a severe impairment. Dr. Amiel gave Ward a GAF score of 60, which indicates only \"moderate symptoms OR any moderate difficulty in social, occupational, or school functioning.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
