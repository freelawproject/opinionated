We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law, including due process claims. <em>Agyeman v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 871, 876 (9th Cir.2002). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">We agree with the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Alvarez-Ornelas is ineligible for cancellation of removal because he lacked five years of lawful permanent residence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(1); <em>Monet v. INS, </em>791 F.2d 752, 753 (9th Cir.1986) (defining the term \u201clawfully\u201d to denote \u201ccompliance with substantive legal requirements, not mere procedural regularity\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The BIA determined that because Alvarez-Ornelas testified he first entered the United States in 1987, he could not have lawfully adjusted his status under the Special Agricultural Worker (\u201cSAW\u201d) statute. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1160(a)(1)(B) (a SAW applicant must establish that he performed at least 90 days of seasonal agricultural service during the twelve-month period ending May 1, 1986). Contrary to Alvarez-Ornelas\u2019 contentions, the IJ did not redetermine Alvarez-Orne-las\u2019 adjustment of status, instead concluding that he was ineligible for relief. <em>See Monet, </em>791 F.2d at 754-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-17\">Alvarez-Ornelas\u2019 contention that he was denied a full and fair hearing is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b551-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
