Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief. <em>Lanza v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 917, 933, 936 (9th Cir.2004). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-25\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s determination that Singh failed to timely file his asylum application because the underlying facts are disputed. <em>Cf. Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 650 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>With respect to withholding of removal, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial based on her finding that Singh may relocate to Bombay. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(3); <em>see also Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 999, 1001 n. 5 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Singh failed to establish that internal relocation is not possible. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b397-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
