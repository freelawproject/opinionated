Inman appeals from an order of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, which granted Continental Airlines, Inc.\u2019s motion to dismiss his appeal of the July 24, 2006 order of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The Bankruptcy Court had denied, <em>inter alia, </em>Inman\u2019s motion to compel compliance with a January 31, 2002 settlement agreement, and his motion to reopen the bankruptcy proceeding to add certain claimants. We will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">As we write primarily for the parties, we need not set forth an involved history of this case. Pertinent to this appeal, on January 31, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court approved a settlement between Continental and the LPP <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claimants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Inman and others filed appeals to the District Court. In orders entered March 31, 2003, the District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s settlement order, found the appeals of the order moot, and granted the appellees\u2019 motions to dismiss the appeals. The Court also found that Inman\u2019s appeal was untimely.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Inman did not appeal the decision to this Court, but two other pilots did appeal. This Court affirmed the District Court judgment. <em>See O\u2019Neill v. Continental Airlines, Inc. (In re: Continental Airlines), </em>Nos. 03-2374 and 03-2375, 94 Fed.Appx. 968 (Table) (3d Cir. March 9, 2004) (not precedential); and <em>Adams v. Continental Airlines, Inc. (In re: Continental Airlines), No. </em>03-2376, 94 Fed. Appx. 968 (Table) (3d Cir. March 5, 2004) (not precedential).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-15\">Years later, in the summer of 2006, In-man filed a \u201cMotion of Objection to the Class Action Plaintiffs Stipulations for Motion to Reopen\u201d (Appendix at Tab R; Bankr. Dkt. #440); and a \u201cMotion to Compel and Compliance with January 31, 2002 Order\u201d (Appendix at Tab R; Bankr. Dkt. # 432).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The latter motion requested payment of stock and monetary benefits under the settlement, and asked that the parties produce a seniority list so that \u201call 1300 deliberately overlooked pilots can receive their settlements.\u201d The \u201cMotion of Objection\u201d similarly complained that certain pilots had been excluded from the class action settlement, and asked that the matter be reopened.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-16\">The Bankruptcy Court denied the motions after a hearing, ruling that the inclusiveness of the class had been litigated years earlier, and noting that certain pilots <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>had opted to not file a timely claim. On appeal, the District Court found \u201cno error in the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision,\u201d noted that the appellants<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> had no standing to assert the rights of others, and that the appellants had waived their right to participate in the settlement by failing to timely file a claim. Inman timely appealed the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">We construe Inman\u2019s brief to raise the following issues or requests: (1) Inman asks that some 1500 \u201cviable LPP claims\u201d be recognized, and that the claimants be allowed either arbitration or inclusion in the Class Settlement; (2) Inman asks the Court to affirm his right to participate in arbitration or in the Class Settlement; (3) Inman claims that pilots hired on or after March 3, 1989 (including Inman) were improperly eliminated from participating in the settlement; (4) certain other claimants were \u201cillegally eliminated\u201d from the list of those eligible to participate in the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The District Court properly held that Inman lacked standing to raise claims pertaining to the rights of pilots other than himself. <em>In re: PWS Holding Corp., </em>228 F.3d 224, 248-49 (3d Cir.2000). Thus, In-man lacks standing to raise the first and fourth issues listed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Inman\u2019s second and third claims also fail. First, this Court has ruled that any right an Eastern pilot had to arbitration regarding an LPP claim was extinguished when the claims were discharged, settled or waived. <em>The Eastern Pilots Merger Committee, Inc. v. Continental Airlines, Inc. (In re Continental Airlines, Inc.), </em>484 F.3d 173, 180-81 (3d Cir.2007). Second, to the extent Inman asks to be included in the Settlement, he has waived the right to do so, as he failed to timely file a claim. Thus, Inman\u2019s argument that \u201cnew hires\u201d such as himself, were improperly eliminated from the settlement, is also foreclosed; even if Inman could prove that \u201cnew hires\u201d were improperly eliminated, he lacks standing to do so because he failed to file a claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b812-10\">. \u201c 'LPP Claimants' refers to a group of former Eastern pilots [including Inman] whose claims in this appeal are based on certain 'labor protective provisions' (LPPs) contained in the collective bargaining agreement.\u201d <em>In re Continental Airlines, </em>125 F.3d 120, 124 n. 1 (3d Cir. 1997) <em>(\"Continental </em>/\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b812-11\">. Claimants were required to file a claim by April 3, 2002 in order to receive money from the settlement. Inman did not file a claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b812-17\">. Appellees characterize the District Court\u2019s decision as a decision on the merits. However, an untimely appeal deprives the District Court of jurisdiction to consider the merits of an appeal. <em>In re: Flanagan, </em>999 F.2d 753, 756 (3d Cir. 1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b812-18\">. Pilots Trigg Adams and Ramon O\u2019Neill filed similar motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b813-7\">. Adams, O\u2019Neill, and Inman all appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b813-8\">. This claim fails for the additional reasons that the claim was not raised until approximately four years after Inman alleges the \"elimination\u201d occurred, and because Inman does not appear to have raised the issue in the Bankruptcy Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b813-22\">. As we have considered the briefs and appendices of the parties, the motion for summary affirmance is denied as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
