The district court imposed sentencing enhancements after making factual findings based upon a preponderance of the evidence and sentenced Snowden to a 360-month term of imprisonment, the bottom of the advisory guideline range. On appeal, Snowden contends that the district court\u2019s use of the preponderance of the evidence standard to find that he intended to distribute child pornography and engaged in a pattern of prohibited conduct violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. We reject his claim. <em>See United States v. Grier, </em>475 F.3d 556, 565-66 (3d Cir.) (en banc) (holding that \u201c[t]he Due Process Clause ... affords no right to have the[ ] facts [relevant to sentencing enhancements] proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d and collecting cases adopting rule), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 106, 169 L.Ed.2d 77 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-23\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
