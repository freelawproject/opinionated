The district court held that Chang\u2019s state habeas petition filed with the trial court and rejected as untimely was not properly filed for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) statutory tolling and dismissed the federal petition as untimely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 and review de novo. <em>Thorson v. Palmer, </em>479 F.3d 643, 644 (9th Cir.2007). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-24\">If a state court rejects a state post-conviction petition as untimely, the petition is not properly filed and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) will not toll the limitations period. <em>Allen v. Siebert, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2, 4-5, 169 L.Ed.2d 329 (2007); <em>Evans v. Chavis, </em>546 U.S. 189, 194, 126 S.Ct. 846, 163 L.Ed.2d 684 (2006). An untimely state petition is not \u201cproperly filed,\u201d even if the state court also addresses the merits of the claim or the timeliness ruling is \u201centangled with the merits.\u201d <em>Pace v. DiGuglielmo, </em>544 U.S. 408, 413-15, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 161 L.Ed.2d 669 (2005); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number><em>Carey v. Saffold, </em>536 U.S. 214, 226, 122 S.Ct. 2134, 153 L.Ed.2d 260 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">The California trial court expressly found that Chang waited an unreasonable time after direct review to file his state habeas petition and that the petition was untimely filed. As a result, the state trial court petition was not properly filed and did not statutorily toll the limitations period. <em>Siebert, </em>128 S.Ct. at 2-4. The fact that the trial court ruled in the alternative on the merits is irrelevant. <em>Saffold, </em>536 U.S. at 225-26, 122 S.Ct. 2134.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b441-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
