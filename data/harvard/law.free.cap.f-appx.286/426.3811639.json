Appellant has now paid the fees and responded to the court\u2019s order to show cause. Accordingly, the court grants appellant\u2019s motion to reinstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-25\">The Clerk is directed to file appellant\u2019s opening brief, received March 17, 2008, and appellant\u2019s supplemental response, received May 1, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-26\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s orders for abuse of discretion. <em>See Hearns v. San Bernardino Police Dept., </em>530 F.3d 1124, 1130-31 (9th Cir.2008) (Rule 41(b) dismissal); <em>McDonald v.

Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per cu-riam) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Accordingly, we summarily affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">All pending motions are denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b452-27\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
