While servicing this loan SNS sent two letters to the Walckers: one introducing itself as the loan servicer, and one discussing options for the Walckers to pay off their loan. The Walckers filed an action against SNS, SNC, and the other appellees alleging, inter alia, that they violated the Washington Collection Agency Act (\u201cWCAA\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 19.16, <em>et seq., </em>and the Washington Consumer Protection Act (\u201cWCPA\u201d), Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 19.86, when they sent the Walck-ers the above-referenced letters.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">On January 31, 2006, Defendants, prior to filing an answer, moved for summary judgment. After conducting a hearing on the matter, the district court held that: (1) SNS was not subject to the provisions of the WCAA; (2) the Notices sent by SNS to the Walckers did not violate the WCAA; and (3) because the Walckers\u2019 claims against SNC, SN Trust, and Christiana were based on SNS\u2019s violation of the WCAA, the Walckers\u2019 claims against the same also failed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Walckers appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of their claims. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm the dismissal, but for different reasons than those stated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-15\">The WCAA requires licensees<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to provide certain information to debtors when giving or sending any notice, letter, message, or form which \u201crepresents or implies that a claim exists.\u201d Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 19.16.250(8). All notices which represent or imply that a claim exists must provide the name of the original creditor, Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 19.16.250(8)(b), and if the notice is the first such communication to a debtor, an itemization of the claim must be made, detailing the amount owed on the original obligation at the time it was received by the licensee for collection, Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 19.16.250(8)(c)(i). Neither of the letters sent out by SNS detailed the amount owed on the original obligation. The second letter also failed to provide the name of the original creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 19.16.450 provides the penalty for violations of Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 19.16.250. Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 19.16.450 states that if an act or practice in violation of Wash. Rev.Code 19.16.250 is committed by a licensee in the collection of a claim, the licensee shall never be allowed to recover any interest, service charge, attorneys\u2019 fees, collection costs, delinquency charge, or any other fees or charges otherwise legally chargeable to the debtor on such claim. Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 19.16.450. As clearly stated in Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 19.16.450, penalties are warranted only if a violation of Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 19.16.250 occurs in the \u201ccollection of a claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">In a case involving the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\u201cFDCPA\u201d), the Seventh Circuit held that a letter, similar to the letters in this case, did not violate the FDCPA because it did not demand payment. <em>Bailey v. Sec. Nat\u2019l Servicing Corp., </em>154 F.3d 384, 388-89 (7th Cir.1998) (\u201cUnder the law only communications \u2018in connection with the collection of any debt\u2019 (see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692e, 1692g) fall under the ambit of the Act, and the defendants\u2019 letters cannot reasonably be placed in that category. The important letter dated January 4 does not \u2018demand\u2019 any payment whatsoever, but merely informs the Baileys about \u2018the current status\u2019 of their account.\u201d). While the FDCPA imposes penalties for \u201ccommunications in the collection of any debt,\u201d the WCAA imposes penalties for communications \u201cin the collection of a claim.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692e, 1692g; Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 19.16.450. \u201cDebt\u201d is defined in the FDCPA as \u201cany obligation or alleged obligation of a consumer to pay money arising out of a transaction in which the money, property, insurance, or services which are the subject of the transaction are primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, whether or not such obligation has been reduced to judgment.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(5). A claim under the WCAA is defined as \u201cany obligation for the payment of money or thing of value arising out of any agreement or contract, express or implied.\u201d Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 19.16.100(5). Despite the fact that the court in <em>Bailey </em>was dealing with the FDCPA, the Seventh Circuit\u2019s reasoning can easily be applied to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">Even though the letters sent by SNS to the Walckers may have violated Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 19.16.250, the Walckers are not entitled to penalties as neither of the letters is a communication \u201cin the collection of a claim.\u201d The first letter sent by SNS informed the Walckers that their loan had been transferred from KeyBank to SNS. The second letter offered the Walckers options for getting a fresh new start with their outstanding payments. These are informational letters regarding the current status of the Walckers\u2019 account, not demands for payment; therefore, penalties are not warranted under Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 19.16.450.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">Assuming that the letters SNS sent violated Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 19.16.250, the Walckers\u2019 WCPA claim still fails. The Washington Consumer Protection Act, Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 19.86.020, states that \u201c[ujnfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.\u201d An individual who is injured in his or her business or property by a violation of Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 19.86.020 may bring a civil action to recover the actual damages sustained by him together with the costs of the suit. Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 19.86.090. To prevail on a WCPA claim on the basis of a per se violation, the Walckers must show \u201c(1) the existence of a pertinent statute; (2) its violation; (3) that such violation was the proximate cause of damages sustained and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>(4) that they were within the class of people the statute sought to protect.\u201d <em>Keyes v. Bollinger, </em>31 Wash.App. 286, 640 P.2d 1077, 1080-81 (1982). A violation of Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 19.16.250 is a per se unfair and deceptive trade practice, thereby satisfying the first and second prongs for a WCPA violation. Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 19.16.440. Nevertheless, the Walekers cannot meet the third requirement; that is, to show that they have suffered an injury as a result of the Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 19.16.250 violation. The Walekers argue that they were \u201cforced to pay a debt, pursuant to the Tender Agreement, which was legally unenforceable after the violation of the WCAA in question.\u201d The Walekers are relying on Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 19.16.450 to argue that they did not owe interest and other charges. As discussed above, however, Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 19.16.450 does not apply to this case because letters in question were not sent \u201cin the collection of a claim\u201d; thus the Walekers did not pay a debt which was legally unenforceable. Therefore, as the Walekers cannot show that they have sustained any damages as a result of the Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 19.16.250 violation, their WCPA claim fails as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Although the district court dismissed the action for different reasons, the ultimate judgment of dismissal was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b482-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-10\">. The Walckers also alleged an independent violation of the WCAA by SNC which the district court dismissed. The Walckers have not assigned error to the district court's decision as it regards that decision, and it is not part of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b482-11\">. KeyBank National Association, Mortgage Electronic Registrations Systems, Inc., and Wells Fargo Foothill, Inc. were also named as party defendants in the original action. The Walckers claims against these additional parties were dismissed by separate order of the court and/or stipulation of the parties and are not the subject of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b482-17\">. The district court did not rule on the Walck-ers\u2019 claims for violation of the WCPA because the Walckers\u2019 claims for the WCPA violation flowed from their claims for WCAA violations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b482-18\">. SNS obtained a license under the prior version of the Washington debt collection legislation. It continues to maintain that license even though it was argued that such was no longer required. We assume for the purpose of this appeal that SNS was a licensee.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
