He was sentenced to 108 months in prison. On appeal, counsel has filed an Anders<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brief, stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. Lingham has not filed a pro se brief. The Government has moved to dismiss the appeal, based on a waiver provision in Lingham\u2019s plea agreement. We affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-22\">A defendant may waive the right to appeal if that waiver is knowing and intelligent. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 169 (4th Cir.2005). Generally, if the district court fully questions a defendant at his Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 proceeding regarding the waiver of his right to appeal, the waiver is both valid and enforceable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>410 F.3d 137, 151 (4th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167-68 (4th Cir.1991). Whether a defendant validly waives his right to appeal is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>Blick, </em>408 F.3d at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-23\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that Lingham knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence, retaining only his right to appeal \u201cany sentence imposed using a base offense level 35 or higher.\u201d The district court calculated Lingham\u2019s advisory guideline range using base offense level 31. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>under the terms of Lingham\u2019s valid waiver, he retained no appellate rights with respect to his sentence. We therefore grant, in part, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss and dismiss this portion of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The waiver provision does not prevent our review of any errors in Lingham\u2019s conviction, however. After reviewing the entire record in accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we conclude that there are no meritorious issues for appeal. We note in particular that the district court complied with the mandates of Rule 11 in accepting Ling-ham\u2019s guilty plea. Thus, we deny, in part, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss and affirm Lingham\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues not covered by the waiver. We affirm Lingham\u2019s conviction and dismiss the appeal of his sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy of the motion was served on his client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b28-16\">. <em>Anders </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
