Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We dismiss the petition for review in No. 06-72229, and deny the petition for review in No. 06-73308.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-24\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s dismissal of Barrios-Candido\u2019s direct appeal. <em>See Vargas-Hernandez v. Gonzales, </em>497 F.3d 919, 923 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201cDiscretionary decisions, including whether or not to grant \u00a7 212(c) relief, are not reviewable. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Reviewing de novo, <em>Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002), we conclude that Barrios-Candido did not establish prejudice resulting from the BIA\u2019s failure to send his prior counsel a briefing schedule. The BIA therefore correctly-denied Barrios-Candido\u2019s motion to reconsider. <em>See id. </em>at 965 (in addition to demonstrating a due process violation, a petitioner must show that the violation was prejudicial and potentially affected his proceedings\u2019 outcome).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Barrios-Candido\u2019s counsel is reminded that unpublished dispositions filed before January 1, 2007 may not be cited to this court. <em>See </em>9th Cir.
