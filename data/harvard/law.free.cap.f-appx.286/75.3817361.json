Harrison appeals his conviction on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to convict him because the Government offered only circumstantial evidence that he possessed the firearm and that such possession occurred after he became a convicted felon. Counsel also questions, pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), whether the district court erred by classifying Harrison as an armed career criminal but states that there are no meritorious sentencing issues for appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to deny a Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 motion. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>451 F.3d 209, 216 (4th Cir.2006). A jury\u2019s verdict must be upheld on appeal if there is substantial evidence in the record to support it. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). \u201c[A]n appellate court\u2019s reversal of a conviction on grounds of insufficient evidence should be confined to cases where the prosecution\u2019s failure is clear.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>735 F.2d 735, 791 (4th Cir.1984) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In determining whether the evidence in the record is substantial, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and inquire whether there is \u201cevidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc). \u201cA defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence ... bears a heavy burden.\u201d <em>United States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence, we do not review the credibility of the witnesses and assume that the jury resolved all contradictions in the testimony in favor of the government. <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>510 F.3d 433, 440 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">With these standards in mind, we have carefully considered Harrison\u2019s claims. Our review of the trial testimony convinces us that the evidence was sufficient to convict Harrison of being a felon in possession of a firearm. <em>See United States v. Langley, </em>62 F.3d 602, 606 (4th Cir.1995) (en banc) (setting forth elements of \u00a7 922(g)(1) offense). Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Harrison\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">Harrison also asserts, pursuant to <em>An-ders, </em>that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by sentencing him as an armed career criminal because his prior convictions were not submitted to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. This claim is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Cheek, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>415 F.3d 349, 351-53 (4th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 282 (4th Cir.2005). Thus, we find no error in the district court\u2019s classification of Harrison as an armed career criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Harrison\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Harrison, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Harrison requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Harrison.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b102-10\"> We have reviewed the claims raised in Harrison\u2019s pro se supplemental brief and find them to be without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
