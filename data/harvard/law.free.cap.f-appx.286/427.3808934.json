The district court entered summary judgment in favor of Mutual of Omaha on all claims. We review the district court\u2019s decision de novo, <em>Buono v. Norton, </em>371 F.3d 543, 545 (9th Cir.2004), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-27\">Appellants claim that Mutual of Omaha breached their insurance contracts by prematurely reentering the California insurance market in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-42 (\u201cFederal HIPAA\u201d) and California Insurance Code \u00a7\u00a7 10273.4 and 10273.6 (\u201cCalifornia HIPAA\u201d). We disagree. No rational trier of fact could find that Mutual of Omaha reentered the Cali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>fornia market by issuing insurance to the Washington, D.C.-based National Association of Service and Conservation Corps, and there is no evidence of any other reentry. Because Mutual of Omaha did not violate Federal or California HIPAA, the contract claim necessarily fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Appellants argue that Mutual of Omaha also violated the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by violating Federal and California HIPAA. This claim fails because it is predicated on the erroneous assumption that a breach of contract occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Finally, Appellants contend that Mutual of Omaha engaged in unfair competition by violating Federal and California HIPAA. We reject the portion of the claim that rests on Federal HIPAA and \u00a7 10273.6 of California HIPAA because Mutual of Omaha did not violate those statutes. <em>See supra </em>\u00a7 I. The portion that rests on \u00a7 10199.1 of California HIPAA fails because that statute requires only notice of the termination of coverage to the \u201cappropriate insurance producer ... <em>if any.\u201d </em>Cal. Ins.Code \u00a7 10199.1(a) (emphasis added). There is no genuine dispute that no such producer existed for Appellants\u2019 policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b453-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
