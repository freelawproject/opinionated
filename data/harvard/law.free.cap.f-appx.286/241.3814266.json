Blevins argues that the district court erred by adopting the drug quantity set forth in the presentence report (PSR) because the quantity was based on an unreliable source, Teresa Dibrell. Blevins contends that Dibrell is unreliable because she was interviewed on several occasions, and on each occasion, Dibrell reported that she purchased a different quantity of methamphetamine from Blevins. In support of this argument, Blevins offered at sentencing the testimony of an investigator who interviewed Dibrell on two occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Our review of the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cNeither <em>Gall, Rita v. United States, </em>[\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) ], nor <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>[-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) ] purport to alter our review of the district court\u2019s construction of the Guidelines or findings of fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). A district court\u2019s determination of the amount of drugs attributable to a defendant for sentencing purposes is a finding of fact that we review for clear error. <em>United States v. Posada-Rios, </em>158 F.3d 832, 878 (5th Cir.1998); <em>see United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2005). Under the clear error standard of review, if the finding is plausible in light of the record viewed as a whole, we may not reverse even if we are convinced that we would have made a different finding. <em>Burton v. United States, </em>237 F.3d 490, 500 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-15\">The investigator\u2019s testimony at sentencing did not establish that the PSR information was materially untrue, inaccurate, or unreliable. <em>See United States v. Parker, </em>133 F.3d 322, 329 (1998). Because the district court\u2019s finding on drug quantity was plausible in light of the record viewed as a whole, the district court did not clearly err by adopting the drug quantity set forth in PSR. <em>See Burton v. United States, </em>237 F.3d 490, 500 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b268-13\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
