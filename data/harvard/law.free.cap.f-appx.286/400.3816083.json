Bertelsman, Senior United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Kentucky, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b427-15\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-16\">Neither the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) nor the Immigration Judge (IJ) erred in their determination that Juan Jose Cazares Miramontes, a native and citizen of Mexico, faded to satisfy his burden of proof to show that he was entitled to discretionary cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.8(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-17\">The problem lies in admissions Mira-montes made in his testimony before the IJ. He testified that he had been convicted of burglary, which the government later confirmed was for receiving stolen property. Miramontes admitted that he and others broke into a car and stole its radio. That concession is sufficient to permit the IJ to conclude that Miramontes had engaged in a crime of moral turpitude. Although the parties do not seriously contest that his state court conviction records reflect that some charge related to that offense was dismissed, Miramontes conceded not only that he spent time in jail, but also that he participated in a work furlough program for the criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-18\">The IJ subsequently presented Mira-montes the opportunity to submit additional evidence so that he might clarify whether his conviction fell within the petty offense exception, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II), to what otherwise appeared to be a crime involving moral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>turpitude. <em>See Patel v. INS, </em>542 F.2d 796, 797-98 (9th Cir.1976) (reasoning that a conviction under CaLPenal Code \u00a7 496 for receiving stolen property constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude). However, Miramontes did not produce sufficient documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Despite the IJ\u2019s finding that Miramontes had been physically present in the United States for ten years, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(A), and that hardship would enure to certain family members, <em>see id. </em>at \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(B), we cannot say that the IJ\u2019s ultimate denial of relief was unsupported by substantial evidence. Mira-montes bore the burden to show, after admitting to a conviction for receiving stolen property, that he committed a petty offense, not a crime involving moral turpitude compelling his removal. He failed to meet that burden. The record of the testimony at the hearing coupled with the available records of his criminal history support the IJ\u2019s finding of conduct amounting to a crime of moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">In addition, the BIA and IJ properly concluded that notwithstanding the lack of clarity in the record as to the gravity of his conviction, Miramontes could not demonstrate good moral character. Miramontes testified that he, his wife, and his sister planned his alien wife\u2019s crossing into the United States. Miramontes\u2019s wife crossed on foot and was admitted after falsely claiming she was a U.S. citizen. Although the final plan differed from the one initially conceived \u2014 only the alien wife was picked up by Miramontes\u2019s sister once in the United States because Miramontes decided for some reason to take a cab\u2014 Miramontes admitted to facts sufficient to permit the IJ to conclude that he had \u201cknowingly encouraged, induced, assisted, abetted, or aided any other alien to enter or try to enter the United States in violation of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Miramontes\u2019s testimony thus established that he lacked good moral character, rendering him ineligible for discretionary cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f)(3); <em>Altamirano v. Gonzales, </em>427 F.3d 586, 592 (9th Cir.2005) (explaining that an \u201caffirmative act of ... assistance or encouragement\u201d supports a finding under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)). Substantial evidence supports the BIA and IJ\u2019s denial of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Finally, we lack jurisdiction to consider Miramontes\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because he failed to exhaust that assertion before the BIA. <em>On-tiveros-Lopez v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1121, 1124 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cWe therefore require an alien who argues ineffective assistance of counsel to exhaust his administrative remedies by first presenting the issue to the BIA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">PETITION DENIED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b427-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
