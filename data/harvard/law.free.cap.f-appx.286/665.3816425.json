After turning eighteen and graduating from high school, Saint Cyr applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture. In his application he alleged that in 1998 members of the Haitian political party Famni Lavalas came to his home looking for his mother, who had resisted the Lavalas\u2019 efforts to get her to join their party\u2019s demonstrations. Allegedly, when he refused to disclose his mother\u2019s whereabouts the Lava-las beat and threatened him and other members of his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-14\">At his asylum hearing Saint Cyr and his brother, who also came to the United States in 1999 and had been granted asylum, testified about these events. Saint Cyr also testified that in 2005 \u201csome people\u201d came to his aunt and uncle\u2019s house in Haiti looking for him. Saint Cyr introduced documents supporting his testimony, including a letter from his uncle stating that \u201cevery so often there are people who\u201d came to the family\u2019s house to make death threats. After considering the evidence and noting discrepancies between Saint\u2019s Cyr\u2019s testimony and his asylum application, his uncle\u2019s letter, and his brother\u2019s testimony, the immigration judge found Saint Cyr to be removable because: (1) the 1998 beating was an isolated incident, not part of a pattern of persecution; (2) the Lavalas were not attempting to get Saint Cyr\u2019s mother to join the party, just participate in mass rallies, so no political opinion was involved; and (3) the testimony about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>the beating was not credible because of the inconsistencies between the brothers\u2019 stories.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Saint Cyr timely appealed the denial of asylum and withholding to the BIA. The BIA dismissed his appeal, holding that the IJ did not clearly err in finding the evidence of the 1998 beating to be not credible and that Saint Cyr had not presented sufficient evidence to show that he would still be targeted by Lavalas supporters eight years after leaving Haiti. Saint Cyr then appealed the BIA\u2019s decision on his asylum application, contending that the BIA erred by: (1) affirming the IJ\u2019s credibility finding; and (2) affirming the IJ\u2019s finding that he had not established a well-founded fear of future persecution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">When the BIA issues its own decision, our review is limited to that decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cA factual determination by the BIA that an alien is statutorily ineligible for asylum or withholding is reviewed under the substantial evidence test.\u201d <em>Perlera-Escobar v. Executive Office for Immigration, </em>894 F.2d 1292, 1296 (11th Cir.1990). \u201cThis means we must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[T]o conclude the BIA\u2019s decision should be reversed, we must find that the record not only supports the conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Additionally, \u201cwe view the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1029 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">To be eligible for asylum, the alien must establish by credible evidence that: (1) he suffered past persecution because of a protected ground; or (2) that he has a well-founded fear that, if returned, he will be persecuted because of a protected ground. <em>Silva v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006). \u201c[persecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and ... mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">The BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s finding that Saint Cyr\u2019s testimony regarding the 1998 beating was not credible was supported by substantial evidence. There were numerous inconsistencies between Saint Cyr\u2019s testimony and his brother\u2019s, including whether the Lavalas had a gun, how it was used, where the brothers were located in their house, the order of the beatings, and what the family did after the beatings. There were also inconsistencies between Saint Cyr\u2019s testimony and his asylum application. Taking this \u201cevidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw[ing] all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision,\u201d we conclude that there was substantial evidence supporting the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s finding that the testimony about the 1998 beatings was not credible. <em>See Adefemi, </em>386 F.3d at 1029. Because Saint Cyr failed to produce credible evidence of past persecution, the BIA did not err in affirming the denial of his application on that ground. <em>See Sepulveda v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>We also conclude that the BIA\u2019s holding that Saint Cyr had not proven an objectively reasonable fear of future prosecution was supported by substantial evidence. Saint Cyr testified to only a single incident in 2005 in which \u201csome people\u201d came looking for him at his aunt and uncle\u2019s house. This conflicted with his uncle\u2019s letter, which stated that there were death threats \u201cevery so often.\u201d Given Saint Cyr\u2019s failure to introduce evidence that compels us to conclude that he will suffer persecution on account of his political beliefs if he is returned to Haiti, we must affirm the BIA\u2019s finding on the matter. <em>See Ruiz, </em>479 F.3d at 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">In addition, to be entitled to asylum based on either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, an alien must prove that the persecution is on account of a protected ground. <em>Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1236. Even had Saint Cyr shown past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, his asylum claim would still fail because he has failed to allege or prove that a protected ground was or would be the reason for it. The refusal to join a political faction is not a political opinion, <em>see INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), and he has not presented any evidence of any other protected grounds that would make him eligible for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b693-7\">. Saint Cyr has not appealed the denial of his application for withholding of removal. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that issues not briefed on appeal are deemed abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
