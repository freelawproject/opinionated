He argues that the district court erred in enhancing his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">We review the procedural soundness and substantive reasonableness of Bolton\u2019s sentence under the abuse-of-discretion standard of review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court\u2019s determination that, pursuant to \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(l), Bolton\u2019s conduct evidenced an intent to carry out his threats is a factual finding and must be reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Goynes, </em>175 F.3d 350, 353 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-19\">Because Bolton solicited another person to assassinate the President and because he attempted to travel to the President\u2019s ranch for reconnaissance purposes, the district court did not clearly err in applying the \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(l) enhancement. <em>See Goynes, </em>175 F.3d at 355. In addition, Bolton points to nothing in the Guidelines that precludes application of the \u00a7 2A6.1 enhancement if the defendant could not have ultimately carried out his threat. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in applying the \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(l) enhancement. Moreover, because the district court imposed a sentence within the properly calculated guidelines range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Bolton\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b207-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
