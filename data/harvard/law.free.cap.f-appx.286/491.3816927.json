Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo claims of constitutional violations in immigration proceedings, <em>Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001), and review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review in No. 05-74233, and we deny the petition for review in No. 06-74055.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-23\">We reject petitioners\u2019 contention that their children\u2019s constitutional rights are being violated. <em>See Urbano de Malaluan v. INS, </em>577 F.2d 589, 594 (9th Cir.1978) (observing that the argument that \u201cthe deportation order would amount to a de facto deportation of the child and thus violate the constitutional rights of the child ... has been authoritatively rejected in numerous cases.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-24\">Petitioners contend the IJ violated due process by disregarding an expert report regarding the psychological impact on their United States citizen children of a move to Mexico. Contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention, the proceedings were not \u201cso fundamentally unfair that [they were] prevented from reasonably presenting [their] case.\u201d <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Moreover, petitioners failed to demonstrate that consideration of the report may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. <em>See id. </em>(requiring prejudice to prevail on a due process challenge). Contrary to petition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>ers\u2019 contention, the BIA did not disregard evidence they presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen as untimely because it was filed more than a year after the BIA\u2019s final order of removal, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1008.2(c)(2) (motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of final order of removal), and petitioners did not show they were entitled to equitable tolling, <em>see Iturribarria, </em>321 F.3d at 897 (deadline for filing motion to reopen can be equitably tolled \u201cwhen a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">No. 05-74233: PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">No. 06-74055: PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b517-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
