The district court sentenced him to 324 months of imprisonment. Randall\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging the adequacy of the plea colloquy but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Randall was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-23\">Counsel raises as a potential issue the adequacy of the plea colloquy in light of the district court\u2019s failure to inform Randall that he had a right to persist in his plea of not guilty under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(B) and that he would be protected from compelled self-incrimination at a jury trial, Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(E). Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Randall did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea on the grounds raised on appeal, any error in the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002) (discussing standard of review). Our careful review of the record on appeal convinces us that the district court\u2019s omissions did not affect Randall\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See id.; United States v. Goins, </em>51 F.3d 400, 402 (4th Cir.1995) (discussing factors courts should consider in determining whether substantial rights affected in decision to plead guilty).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm Randall\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Randall, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Randall requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Randall. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
