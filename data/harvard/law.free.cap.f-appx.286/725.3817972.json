The sole issue on appeal is whether the government breach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>ed the plea agreement by arguing against a sentencing reduction for acceptance of responsibility and by failing to voice a recommendation for a sentence at the low end of the applicable guideline range. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">\u201cWhether the government has breached a plea agreement is a question of law that [we] review[] <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Mahique, </em>150 F.3d 1330, 1332 (11th Cir. 1998). However, when there was no objection below, \u201cany objections to the sentence are barred absent manifest injustice,\u201d which equates with review for plain error. <em>Id. </em>A reversal under plain error review requires (1) error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Romano, </em>314 F.3d 1279, 1281 (11th Cir.2002). For an error to affect substantial rights, \u201cin most cases it means that the error must have been prejudicial: It must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Plea agreements are interpreted like contracts, and are viewed \u201cagainst the background of the negotiations.\u201d <em>United States v. Jefferies, </em>908 F.2d 1520, 1523 (11th Cir.1990) (citation omitted). Thus, where a plea agreement conditioned the government\u2019s non-opposition to the acceptance of responsibility reduction on the defendant\u2019s full and accurate disclosure to probation, we have found no breach of the agreement when the government opposed the reduction based on the defendant\u2019s failure to fully disclose. <em>Mahique, </em>150 F.3d at 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">We are not persuaded by Lazo\u2019s argument. The agreement at issue provided that the government would recommend a reduction for acceptance of responsibility for Lazo, but expressly conditioned this obligation on Lazo not making any \u201cfalse statements or misrepresentations to any governmental entity or official\u201d after entering into the plea agreement. In light of this condition, Lazo\u2019s testimony at his sentencing hearing, which was inconsistent with that of the victim and the surveillance tapes, and which the district court found not to be credible, released the government from its obligations to recommend both an acceptance-of-responsibility adjustment and a low-end sentence. <em>Ma-hique, </em>150 F.3d at 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">Moreover, even if the government\u2019s change in position regarding an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility did constitute a breach of the plea agreement, Lazo has not shown plain error \u2014 the standard applicable here because Lazo did not voice any objection below to the government\u2019s alleged breach of the plea agreement. <em>See Romano, </em>314 F.3d at 1281. First, the government\u2019s argument against a reduction for acceptance of responsibility did not have a prejudicial effect on Lazo, as the district court granted the reduction, despite the government\u2019s argument against it. Second, the district court acknowledged the government\u2019s recommendation of a low-end sentence, and the government\u2019s failure actually to voice such a recommendation was not prejudicial to Lazo. Because neither of the government\u2019s alleged breaches affected Lazo\u2019s substantial rights, there was no plain error. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
