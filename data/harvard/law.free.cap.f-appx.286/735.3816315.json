Cantu, Jr. (Mr. Cantu) petitions for review of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 (Veterans Court) final order in <em>Cantu v. Mansfield, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>No. 05-3661, \u2014 Vet.App. -, 2007 WL 4981207 (Vet.App. Nov. 13, 2007). The Veterans Court affirmed-in-part the September 23, 2005 decision of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (Board), which denied Mr. Cantu\u2019s claim for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and remanded to the Board his claim for compensation under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151 for residuals of radiation experimentation. We <em>dismiss </em>the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">In October 2000, Mr. Cantu sought to reopen his previously denied claims of service connection for PTSD and compensation under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151. In December 2000, the regional office denied entitlement to VA benefits for both claims. Mr. Cantu appealed the decision to the Board. The Board remanded Mr. Cantu\u2019s claims for additional development in September 2004. In September 2005, the Board reopened Mr. Cantu\u2019s previously denied claim for entitlement to VA benefits for PTSD and denied the claim on the merits. The Board declined to reopen Mr. Cantu\u2019s claim for benefits under \u00a7 1151, finding that new and material evidence had not been received. Mr. Cantu appealed to the Veterans Court, which affirmed the Board\u2019s decision regarding Mr. Cantu\u2019s claim for PTSD, but reversed and remanded Mr. Cantu\u2019s claim for compensation under \u00a7 1151. Mr. Cantu submitted a motion for reconsideration, the Veterans Court entered judgment on January 24, 2008, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">The scope of our review of a Veterans Court decision is limited by statute. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292. Under \u00a7 7292(a), we may review a decision by the Veterans Court with respect to the validity of \u201cany statute or regulation ... or any interpretation thereof (other than a determination as to a factual matter) that was relied on by the [Veterans] Court in making the decision.\u201d Absent a constitutional issue, we may not review challenges to factual determinations or challenges to the application of a law or regulation to facts. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">Our jurisdiction is further limited to final judgments of the Veterans Court. <em>See Joyce v. Nicholson, </em>443 F.3d 845, 849 (Fed.Cir.2006) (citations omitted). \u201cWe have repeatedly made clear that a decision by the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims remanding to the Board is non-final and not reviewable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We only depart from the strict rule of finality if three conditions are satisfied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-11\">(1) there must have been a clear and final decision of a legal issue that (a) is separate from the remand proceedings, (b) will directly govern the remand proceedings, or (c) if reversed by this court, would render the remand proceedings unnecessary; (2) <em>the resolution of the legal issues must adversely affect the party seeking review; </em>and (3) there must be a substantial risk that the decision would not survive such a remand, i.e., that the remand proceeding may moot the issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-12\"><em>Williams v. Principi, </em>275 F.3d 1361, 1363 (Fed.Cir.2002) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">Because there was no final judgment on Mr. Cantu\u2019s claim for compensation under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151, the rule of finality bars that aspect of Mr. Cantu\u2019s appeal, unless the three <em>Williams </em>conditions have been satisfied. Here, the resolution of the \u00a7 1151 claim was not adverse to Mr. Cantu. The matter was remanded to provide Mr. Cantu with appropriate notice regarding the evidence required to reopen his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>appeal on that claim. Accordingly, we cannot review the aspect of Mr. Cantu\u2019s appeal regarding his claim for compensation for residuals of radiation experimentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Mr. Cantu\u2019s PTSD claim, however, involves a different alleged injury from his \u00a7 1151 claim regarding radiation experimentation, and the judgment on Mr. Cantu\u2019s PTSD claim is final and reviewable. <em>See Elkins v. Gober, </em>229 F.3d 1369 (Fed.Cir.2000) (\u201cThis Court has consistently recognized that the various claims of a veteran\u2019s overall \u2018case\u2019 may be treated as distinct for jurisdictional purposes.\u201d). Nonetheless, our limited jurisdiction precludes review of the judgment on Mr. Cantu\u2019s PTSD claim. Mr. Cantu has not raised any issue concerning the validity or interpretation of any statute, regulation, or rule of law. Nor has Mr. Cantu raised any constitutional issue that could provide a basis for our jurisdiction. His destruction of records argument, although framed as a constitutional issue, Pet.\u2019r Br., Answer to Question No. 3, is a challenge to a factual issue concerning the merits of the petition, which we are without jurisdiction to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">We have considered, but reject, the remainder of Mr. Cantu\u2019s arguments. For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss Mr. Cantu\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
