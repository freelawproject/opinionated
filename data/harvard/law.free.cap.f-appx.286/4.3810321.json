Based on his prior convictions for either violent or drug trafficking felonies, as noticed by the 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000) information filed by the government, Ga-ston was found to be an armed career criminal. The district court imposed a life sentence as mandated by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), 851 (2000). Gaston appeals his sentence, arguing that his constitutional rights were violated because his sentence was increased based on a prior conviction not alleged in the indictment, found by the jury, or stipulated to by him. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">Gaston concedes that the Supreme Court ruled, in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), that the penalty provision of a statute enhancing a sentence based on recidivism is not an element of the crime and prior convictions need not be alleged in the indictment and found by the jury. However, he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was called into question by the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and its progeny and should no longer be considered binding precedent. Although <em>Apprendi </em>expressed some uncertainty regarding the future vitality of <em>AlmendarezTorres, </em>we subsequently concluded that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was not overruled by <em>Apprendi, </em>and remains the law. <em>United States v. Sterling, </em>283 F.3d 216, 220 (4th Cir.2002); <em>see also United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352-53 (4th Cir.2005) (reaffirming continuing validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)). We therefore conclude that Gaston\u2019s claim is without merit. Moreover, as this court noted in <em>Cheek, </em>even if we were to agree with Gaston\u2019s forecast that the Supreme Court will overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>\u201cwe are not free to overrule or ignore the Supreme Court\u2019s precedents.\u201d <em>Cheek, </em>415 F.3d at 352-53 (citing <em>State Oil Co. v. Khan, </em>522 U.S. 3, 20, 118 S.Ct. 275, 139 L.Ed.2d 199 (1997) (\u201c[I]t is [the Supreme] Court\u2019s prerogative alone to overrule one of its precedents.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-13\">Accordingly, we affirm Gaston\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
