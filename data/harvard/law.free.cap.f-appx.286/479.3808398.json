Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal, <em>Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816 (9th Cir.2001). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal because Siregar has not demonstrated that it is more likely than not that she will be persecuted if removed to Indonesia. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">To the extent Siregar contends she is eligible for withholding of removal because she and her children would be especially exposed to the threat of violence due to her children\u2019s needs, we lack jurisdiction to review this contention because she failed to raise this to the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">To the extent Siregar challenges the agency\u2019s discretionary determination that she failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to her children, we lack jurisdiction to review this determination. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 929-30 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b506-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
