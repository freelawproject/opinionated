We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Luong v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., </em>368 F.3d 1109, 1111 n. 2 (9th Cir.2004), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">The district court properly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over Ms. S.\u2019s \u201cPetition for Review\u201d because the Petition challenges a new administrative decision rendered after judgment in the underlying action and thus Ms. S. was required to bring a new civil action. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A) (providing that a party may bring a civil action to challenge an administrative decision under the IDEA); Fed. R.Civ.P. 3 (\u201cA civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">To the extent the \u201cPetition for Review\u201d may be construed as a motion for relief from judgment based on newly discovered evidence under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(2), the district court properly denied the motion because it was filed more than one year after entry of judgment. <em>See Nevitt v. United States, </em>886 F.2d 1187, 1188 (9th Cir.1989) (holding that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider a Rule 60(b)(2) motion that was not filed within one year of entry of judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-14\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Ms. S.\u2019s request for appointment of counsel. <em>See Terrell v. Brewer, </em>935 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-15\">Ms. S.\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b402-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
