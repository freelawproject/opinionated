Morales therefore appears eligible for relief under <em>Lujan-Armendariz v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 728 (9th Cir.2000). Moreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>administrative record indicates that Morales may be eligible to adjust his status to that of lawful permanent resident through his U.S. citizen wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">We grant petitioner\u2019s unopposed motion to refer this case to the Circuit Mediator\u2019s Office for mediation. In the event that mediation fails, this panel will retain jurisdiction over the petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
