Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen, finding that the request for reopening was not supported by evidence showing eligibility for relief under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See Iturri-barria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Ordonez v. INS, </em>345 F.3d 777, 784 (9th Cir.2003). Accordingly, this petition for review is denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-14\">Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss this petition for review for lack of jurisdiction with respect to the motion to reopen based on new evidence of hardship is granted. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 601 (9th Cir. 2006) (concluding that the court lacks jurisdiction to review the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 denial of motion to reopen for failure to establish a prima facie case if a prior adverse discretionary decision was made by the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-15\">The temporary stay of removal shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate. The motion for stay of voluntary departure, filed after the departure period had expired, is denied. <em>See Garcia v. Ashcroft, </em>368 F.3d 1157 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b445-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
