Rose, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b955-9\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">A tow-motor accident injured Johnnie Edwards\u2019s knee at work. Edwards received disability payments, as well as a safety-violation (\u2018VSSR\u201d) award for $3,310.72 because the tow motor lacked a working horn to warn Edwards as it approached.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">Instead of seeking Ohio judicial review, his employer, Avalon Precision Casting Company (\u201cAvalon\u201d), filed this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action asking the court to declare that: OSUA preempts Ohio\u2019s VSSR scheme; the Ohio Administrative Code section requiring a working horn is imper-missibly vague; and Ohio\u2019s prohibition on cross-examining a claimant\u2019s personal physician in workers\u2019 compensation proceedings violates due process. The district court, in a thorough and thoughtful opinion with which we agree, rejected each of Avalon\u2019s claims, and we adopt the district court\u2019s Opinion as the opinion of this panel. <em>See Avalon Precision Casting Co. v. Indus. Comm\u2019n of Ohio, </em>No. 1:04-cv-02292, 2006 WL 3332212 (N.D.Ohio Nov. 15, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-16\">In a separate Order the district court denied Avalon default judgment against Edwards. Avalon\u2019s appeal also targets that decision, relying on the compulsory phrasing of the default-judgment rule that the clerk <em>\u201cmust </em>enter the party\u2019s default\u201d if that party \u201chas failed to plead or otherwise defend,\u201d as did Edwards. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ P. 55(a) (emphasis added). But \u00a7 1983 confers jurisdiction only \u201c[t]o redress the deprivation, <em>under color of any State law </em>... of any right, privilege, or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States....\u201d <em>See Watson v. Kenlick Coal Co., </em>498 F.2d 1183, 1185 (6th Cir.1974); <em>see also Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, </em>523 U.S. 83, 89, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998); <em>Bell v. Hood, </em>327 U.S. 678, 682-83, 66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946). The district court thus lacked jurisdiction to grant a judgment against Edwards, a defendant who indisputably is not a state actor and who cannot be traced to any of these alleged constitutional violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-17\">We affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
