R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b413-23\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-24\">Manuel Salazar-Cruz appeals from the district court\u2019s imposition of a 57-month sentence. Salazar-Cruz pled guilty to violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 for being an illegal alien found in the United States following deportation. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-25\">Salazar-Cruz argues that the district court plainly erred when it increased his Offense Level by sixteen points for a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d on account of his California voluntary manslaughter conviction. This argument fails because that offense is indeed \u201ca \u2018crime of violence\u2019 for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2.\u201d <em>United States v. Bonilla-Montenegro, </em>331 F.3d 1047, 1052 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>(9th Cir.2003). Furthermore, the Sentencing Guidelines state that \u201c[p]rior convictions of offenses counted under subsection (b)(1) include the offenses of aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting, to commit such offenses.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 5 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Salazar-Cruz also asserts that the district court erroneously applied the guideline range as \u201ca presumptive sentence\u201d and did not adequately review the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors or detail its sentencing decision. We disagree. The district court in this case discussed Salazar-Cruz\u2019s request for a downward departure, noted that the Guidelines were \u201cadvisory,\u201d stated it \u201cbelieve[d]\u201d the guideline range to be \u201creasonable\u201d under \u00a7 3553, and imposed a sentence at the low-end of that range. Further, as in <em>United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 996 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, Zavala v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2491, 171 L.Ed.2d 780 (2008), the court mentioned that it had \u201cconsidered\u201d the sentencing memoranda of the parties, which included Salazar-Cruz\u2019s \u00a7 3553(a) arguments. There was no error committed by the district court in these respects. <em>See United States v. Rivera, </em>527 F.3d 891, 911 (9th Cir.2008); <em>Carty, </em>520 F.3d at 996.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Salazar-Cruz correctly acknowledges that his argument that \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional is foreclosed by Ninth Circuit case law. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Nar-vaez-Gomez, </em>489 F.3d 970, 977-78 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b413-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
