Lin argues that the BIA erred in determining that he was not eligible for asylum or withholding of removal on account of a protected ground. He also argues that the immigration judge (IJ) violated his due process rights by failing to admit evidence regarding the persecution of Falun Gong adherents and prison conditions in China. Finally, Lin challenges the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and the IJ\u2019s denial of his application for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">The record does not compel reversal of the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Jukic v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 747, 749 (5th Cir.1994). Lin\u2019s testimony concerning his interaction with Chinese police does not establish a sufficient nexus between his mistreatment and a ground protected by the Immigration and Nationality Act. <em>See id. </em>The BIA\u2019s conclusion that Lin\u2019s mistreatment was motivated by the desire to stop Lin\u2019s sale of Falun Gong material and to learn the names of his suppliers, rather than because of any political opinion imputed to Lin, is supported by Lin\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">Lin\u2019s arguments concerning the excluded documentary evidence likewise fail because Lin has failed to demonstrate that he suffered substantial prejudice by the exclusion of those documents. <em>See Anwar v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir.1997). Finally, Lin\u2019s challenges to the IJ\u2019s credibility determinations and the IJ\u2019s denial of relief are not properly before this court. <em>Hongyok v. Gonzales, </em>492 F.3d 547, 549 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, Lin\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b156-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
