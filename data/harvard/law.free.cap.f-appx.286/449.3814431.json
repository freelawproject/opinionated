Pittman appeals the district court\u2019s order granting a Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss Pittman\u2019s claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-18\">The basis of Pittman\u2019s claim is that defendants\u2019 agents intentionally concealed evidence\u2014specifically, a videotape and a recorded statement\u2014to delay proceedings in her workers\u2019 compensation appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-22\">We briefly review the pertinent factual and procedural history. On November 12, 2008, Pittman requested a hearing to appeal the denial of her workers\u2019 compensation claim. The hearing was scheduled for February 9, 2004. On February 4, 2004, the defendants\u2019 attorney, who believed that his clients did not possess any evidence alerting them to the nature of Pittman\u2019s claim, requested a continuance so that the defendants could respond to Pittman\u2019s repetitive work injury claim. During that conference, the defendants\u2019 attorney, apparently on the basis of the clients\u2019 statements to the attorney, represented to the ALJ that the defendants did not possess a videotape or recorded statement. The ALJ indefinitely postponed the hearing. On February 17, 2004, the defendants proposed a low settlement offer, which Pittman declined despite her financial difficulties. The parties conducted further discovery, and the defendants eventually turned over the videotape and recorded statement, which they had possessed all along. On May 15, 2004, the defendants agreed to accept Pittman\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim and awarded her the benefits she had requested. The case was ultimately resolved in Pittman\u2019s favor in less than seven months.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-23\">Pittman contends that it was an extraordinary transgression of the bounds of socially tolerable conduct to conceal evidence for the purpose of engineering an indefinite set-over of the hearing date to coerce Pittman into accepting an unreasonably low settlement offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>On a motion to dismiss under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), Pittman is entitled to all reasonable inferences from the facts alleged in the Complaint. <em>Usher v. Los Angeles, </em>828 F.2d 556, 561 (9th Cir.1987). To state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, Pittman must show: (1) the defendant intended to inflict severe emotional distress on Pittman; (2) the defendant\u2019s acts were the cause of Pittman\u2019s severe emotional distress; and (3) the defendant\u2019s acts constituted an extraordinary transgression of the bounds of socially tolerable conduct. <em>McGanty v. Staudenrans, </em>321 Or. 532, 901 P.2d 841, 849 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Initially, the determination whether a plaintiffs allegations amount to an extraordinary transgression of the bounds of socially tolerable conduct is a question of law. <em>Harris v. Pameco Corp., </em>170 Or.App. 164, 12 P.3d 524, 529 (2000). The court undertakes a fact-specific inquiry, on a case-by-case basis. <em>Delaney v. Clifton, </em>180 Or.App. 119, 41 P.3d 1099, 1106 (2002), <em>rev. denied, </em>334 Or. 631, 54 P.3d 1041 (Or.2002). Conduct that is merely \u201crude, boorish, tyrannical, churlish and mean\u201d does not satisfy the high standard that the defendant\u2019s acts must constitute an extraordinary transgression of the bounds of socially tolerable conduct. <em>Watte v. Edgar Maeyens, Jr., M.D., P.C., </em>112 Or.App. 234, 828 P.2d 479, 481 (1992), <em>rev. denied, </em>314 Or. 176, 836 P.2d 1345 (Or.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">After reviewing the facts of this case, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the alleged misconduct by defendants, while reproachful, does not constitute \u201can extraordinary transgression of the bounds of socially tolerable conduct.\u201d <em>McGanty, </em>901 P.2d at 849. The defendants\u2019 alleged misconduct in this case is not nearly as egregious as in the cases relied upon by Pittman. <em>Cf. Green v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>667 F.2d 22 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">Our review of Pittman\u2019s allegations reveals no basis for an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. Because we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Pittman\u2019s action, we need not address the other issues raised on appeal. Accordingly, we dismiss Pittman\u2019s Motion to Strike Appellee\u2019s Brief as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b475-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
