The district court dismissed all federal and state claims except for Nagy\u2019s employment-related claims against his former employer, Affiliated Computer Services, Inc. (\u201cACS\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nagy, a <em>pro se </em>litigant, appealed. We have jurisdiction because the district court explicitly entered partial final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b). For the reasons below, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-23\">Nagy\u2019s claims against the various defendants stem from several seemingly unrelated events that occurred around the time of Nagy\u2019s divorce. First, Nagy alleges that Kathleen Kennedy, Judge H.G. Andrews, Blakely Hall, and Eliana I. George conspired to deprive him of his due process protections, thereby making his state divorce decree \u201cfraudulent\u201d and unconstitutional.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, Nagy contends that Wells Fargo, N.A. (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d) and its legal counsel, Barrett Burke Wilson Castle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Daffin &amp; Frappier, L.L.P. (\u201cBarrett Burke\u201d), violated his rights when Wells Fargo foreclosed on his property. Third, Nagy argues that Galen Ray Sumrow, the Rockwall County Criminal District Attorney, improperly prosecuted him for domestic violence and other offenses. Fourth, Nagy claims that David Sanducci, his securities broker, mismanaged his IRA account. Finally, Nagy asserts that ACS, his former employer, discriminated against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">On appeal, Nagy contends that: (1) his divorce decree is unconstitutional and fraudulent; (2) the district court erred when it did not enter default judgments against Sumrow, Wells Fargo, Barrett Burke, George, ACS, and Kennedy; (8) the district court had diversity jurisdiction over his claims against Wells Fargo; (4) conflicts of interest arose when Barrett Burke represented Wells Fargo, and the Attorney General of Texas represented both Judge Andrews and George in this litigation; and (5) the district court improperly dismissed his conspiracy claims against Kennedy, Judge Andrews, Blakely, and George.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">After reviewing Nagy\u2019s brief, we find that Nagy has waived his first, fourth, and fifth arguments. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28 requires appellants to support their contentions with reasons along with \u201ccitation to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellants] rel[y].\u201d Thus, \u201c[although we liberally construe the briefs of pro se appellants, we also require that arguments must be briefed to be preserved.\u201d <em>Price v. Digital Equip. Corp., </em>846 F.2d 1026, 1028 (5th Cir.1988). In this case, Nagy\u2019s con-clusory argument that the district court erred when it dismissed his conspiracy claims and his claims regarding the divorce decree under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine fails to meet the requirements of Rule 28.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Similarly, Nagy\u2019s perfunctory, one-sentence allegation of a conflict of interest-unaccompanied by any citation to authorities-does not preserve this issue for review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">Nagy\u2019s remaining arguments lack merit. Nagy contends that the district court erred when it failed to enter default judgments against Sumrow, Wells Fargo, Barrett Burke, George, ACS, and Kennedy because they did not answer within twenty days of service. Nagy served defendants by personally sending them the summons and complaint via certified mail. This method of service did not conform to either the established federal or state methods of service. Fed.R.Civ.P. 4; Tex.R. Civ. P. 106(a)(2). Therefore, Nagy\u2019s argument is unpersuasive because service was improper. Finally, Nagy alleges that federal diversity jurisdiction exists over his state law claims against Wells Fargo. This argument fails because some defendants in this case are Texas citizens and, therefore, complete diversity is absent. <em>See Breaux v. Dilsaver, </em>254 F.3d 533, 536 (5th Cir.2001) (\u201cFederal jurisdiction ordinarily exists over lawsuits that could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>been brought in a state court, so long as complete diversity of citizenship and the requisite amount in controversy are present.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b162-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b162-15\">. Applying the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, the district court dismissed Nagy\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985, 1986, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The district court also dismissed Nagy\u2019s claims under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 372 and 1514 because these statutes do not permit private causes of action. Finally, the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Nagy's state law claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b162-25\">. George is Nagy's ex-wife. Kennedy represented George and Hall represented Nagy in the divorce proceeding over which Judge Andrews presided.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b163-7\">. In addressing the district court\u2019s application of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, Nagy claims only that he \"maintains his right to appeal\u201d and that he \"believes the United States Supreme Court will uphold Appellant\u2019s unconstitutional allegations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b163-8\">. In the \"Statement of the Issues\u201d section of his brief, Nagy presents his fourth issue as \"the conflict of interest created when Defendant Barrett represented Wells Fargo, a named co-defendant and the Attorney General represented both Judge H.G. Andrews and Eliana.\u201d But the \"Argument\u201d section of his brief contains only one sentence as to a purported conflict of interest: \"The Appellant presents there is a conflict of interest created when Defendant Barrett represented Wells Fargo, a named co-defendant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
