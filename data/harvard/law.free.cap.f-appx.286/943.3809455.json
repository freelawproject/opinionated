Grayson pleaded guilty to one count of distributing a controlled substance in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), but he put the government to its burden of proof at sentencing regarding whether the drugs he sold were, as the government charged, 58 grams of the crack form of cocaine base. After an evidentiary hearing, the district court found that Grayson did in fact sell 58 grams of crack and sentenced him to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, the statutory mandatory minimum. See <em>id. </em>\u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-14\">Grayson filed a notice of appeal, but his appointed counsel now seeks to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), because he is unable to discern a nonfrivo-lous issue to pursue. Because counsel\u2019s supporting brief is facially adequate and Grayson has not responded to his attorney\u2019s motion, see CIR. R. 51(b), we review only the potential issues that counsel has identified. See <em>United States v. Tabb, </em>125 F.3d 583, 584 (7th Cir.1997) (per curiam). Grayson does not wish to withdraw his guilty plea, so counsel appropriately avoids any analysis of the voluntariness of the plea or the adequacy of the colloquy. See <em>United States v. Knox, </em>287 F.3d 667, 671-72 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-15\">Counsel first considers whether Grayson could challenge the district court\u2019s factual finding that the bag of drugs he sold to the informant contained 58 grams of crack. The government had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it did. See <em>United States v. Soto-Piedra, </em>525 F.3d 527, 529 (7th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Padilla, </em>520 F.3d 766, 769 (7th Cir.2008). We review the district court\u2019s determination that the government met that burden for clear error, see <em>Soto-Piedra, </em>525 F.3d at 529; <em>Padilla, </em>520 F.3d at 769; <em>United States v. Artley, </em>489 F.3d 813, 821 (7th Cir.2007), and will affirm absent \u201ca definite and firm conviction that a mistake has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>been made,\u201d <em>United States v. Fudge, </em>325 F.3d 910, 919-20 (7th Cir.2003); see also <em>Padilla, </em>520 F.3d at 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">No forensic test can determine whether a substance is \u201ccrack,\u201d because crack is the street name for a type of cocaine base, not a chemical term. See, <em>e.g., United States v. Booker, </em>260 F.3d 820, 823 (7th Cir.2001) (\u201c[S] cientifically,\u2019cocaine base\u2019 includes other forms of the drug besides crack cocaine.\u201d); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>144 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir.1998) (\u201c[C]raek and all other forms of cocaine base are identical at the molecular level.\u201d). There are several ways to convert powder cocaine into cocaine base, but the most common method is to dissolve powder cocaine (cocaine hydrochloride) and baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) in boiling water. See <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>397 F.3d 570, 574 (7th Cir.2005); <em>cf. </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c), note (D). The baking soda separates the hydrochloride molecule from the cocaine, leaving cocaine base \u2014 a solid, rocklike substance that can be smoked\u2014 behind. See <em>Edwards, </em>397 F.3d at 574. Trace amounts of sodium bicarbonate <em>may </em>be detectable in some samples of crack, but its presence is not required. See <em>United States v. Lake, </em>500 F.3d 629, 634 (7th Cir.2007); see also <em>United States v. Waters, </em>313 F.3d 151, 155 (3d Cir.2002) (\u201c[I]t is <em>not </em>necessary for the government to show that a substance contains sodium bicarbonate in order to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the drugs in question are crack.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">At his four-day sentencing hearing, Grayson called Dr. Michael Evans, a toxicologist, to testify regarding the composition of the drugs Grayson sold. Evans testified that adding baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) to powder cocaine is \u201cthe only method\u201d for making crack. He further testified that trace amounts of sodium bicarbonate will always be present in street-dealt crack, because only a chemist in a laboratory can remove all sodium bicarbonate from the finished product. Evans never tested the drugs Grayson sold, but after reviewing the government chemist\u2019s report, Evans opined that the drugs were not crack because there was no \u201cforen-sieally acceptable evidence\u201d of sodium bicarbonate in Grayson\u2019s sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">The government\u2019s expert chemist, Dr. Camala Dubach, testified that the drugs were cocaine base. She also testified that crack is typically \u201coff-white\u201d and \u201crock-like\u201d in appearance and that Grayson\u2019s sample was both. According to Dubach, Dr. Evans\u2019s testimony concerning the absence of sodium bicarbonate in the sample was based on a misreading of her report. The report stated that the sample contained \u201csodium bicarbonate (possibly another substance).\u201d Dubach explained that the notation was not, as Evans believed, an equivocation on the presence of sodium bicarbonate. Rather, the notation meant that sodium bicarbonate was definitely present and <em>another </em>insoluble additive was possibly present as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">Finally, the government called a DEA agent, who testified that Grayson and the informant used code words for crack\u2014 such as \u201chard\u201d and \u201cbutter\u201d \u2014 during recorded conversations that preceded the controlled buy. He also testified that the amount the informant asked to buy from Grayson, \u201ctwo and a cutie hard,\u201d is a distribution quantity much more commonly associated with crack than powder cocaine. Finally, he testified that the drugs were a \u201cwhite, rocky substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">\u201c[T]he testimony of both a forensic chemist and a veteran police officer is sufficient proof that a substance is crack.\u201d <em>Lake, </em>500 F.3d at 634; see also <em>United States v. Buchanan, </em>362 F.3d 411, 413 (7th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Linton, </em>235 F.3d 328, 329-30 (7th Cir.2000). The dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>trict court was properly skeptical of Dr. Evans\u2019s testimony that the sample was not crack because it did not contain sodium bicarbonate; that testimony is factually inaccurate. See <em>Lake, </em>500 F.3d at 634. Because the government presented substantial evidence that Grayson distributed crack, counsel is correct that it would be frivolous for Grayson to challenge the drug-type finding on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">Likewise futile would be any argument challenging the district court\u2019s finding that the quantity of crack was at least 50 grams. The DEA agent testified that the informant arranged to buy \u201ctwo and a cutie hard,\u201d a reference to 2.25 ounces of crack, or 63.78 grams. At the time of the sale, Grayson told the informant that the bag \u201cmight be a little light,\u201d and to contact him \u201cif it\u2019s short a gram or anything.\u201d Dr. Dubach testified that when she performed her tests less than two weeks after the sale, the crack weighed 58.2 grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Grayson attempted to contradict this finding by presenting testimony from June Henderson, the Director of Human Resources at Dr. Evans\u2019s laboratory. Henderson minored in chemistry at college and weighed drug samples at the lab \u201cover a hundred\u201d times, but she has no specialized knowledge or experience with testing controlled substances. Henderson admitted that she did not know the chemical composition of cocaine base, nor did she know how crack is manufactured. Nevertheless, after the drugs were sent to Evans\u2019s laboratory for independent testing, they were examined not by Evans or by any other forensic chemist on staff, but by Henderson. Henderson testified merely as a fact witness to having weighed the sample. According to her measurements, the sample weighed only 22.4 grams, not 58 grams as claimed by the government. On cross-examination, the government probed potential explanations for the discrepancy. The package sent to the lab consisted of an evidence bag containing two smaller baggies, which contained the drugs. Henderson testified that when she weighed the crack \u2014 almost two-and-a-half years after Grayson sold it \u2014 she discarded liquid and paste that clung to the sides of the baggies, \u201cpatted\u201d the baggies dry, and then dried the remaining substance in an oven before putting it on the scale.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">The district court was entitled to disregard Henderson\u2019s unpersuasive testimony in determining the weight of the drugs Grayson sold. Henderson weighed the sample <em>more </em>than two years after the sale, and crack weighs less over time, because it releases moisture that evaporates. <em>Cf. United States v. Dean, </em>59 F.3d 1479, 1494-95 &amp; n. 28 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>20 F.3d 242, 243 (7th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>11 F.3d 620, 631-32 (6th Cir.1993). Henderson discarded as much of the moisture in the sample as she could, then dried the rest in an oven before weighing it. According to Grayson, that methodology was reasonable because \u201cwaste water\u201d left over after production of crack should not be used to calculate drug weight. See <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>999 F.2d 1192, 1194, 1196 (7th Cir.1993). In <em>Johnson, </em>we ruled that water left over after the manufacture of crack should not be included in determining a defendant\u2019s guidelines range \u2014 even though the water contained trace amounts of cocaine \u2014 because the waste water was not ingestible and therefore not marketable. <em>Id. </em>at 1196. The moisture in the drugs Sanders\u2019s sold, on the other hand, was a component of fully processed, consumable, marketable crack. Recognizing this difference, the district court rejected Sanders\u2019s \u201cwaste water\u201d argument and relied instead on Dr. Dubach\u2019s weight of 58 grams. We concur with counsel that it would be frivolous to challenge that ruling on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>The fact that the district court\u2019s drug-type and quantity findings are unassailable dooms the final argument considered by counsel: whether Grayson could argue that he should have received a lower prison sentence. Because Grayson sold at least 50 grams of crack, the district court could not impose anything less than the ten-year sentence it did. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii); <em>cf. United States v. Duncan, </em>479 F.3d 924, 930 (7th Cir.2007). With a criminal history category of III, Grayson is ineligible for the safety valve, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(1); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a)(1), and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kimbrough v. United </em>States\u2014 authorizing a district court to sentence a defendant below the guidelines range if it disagrees with the policy of punishing crack offenses more harshly than those involving powder cocaine \u2014 does not help him either. See \u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 558, 572, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (sentencing courts \u201cneed not adhere to the 100-to-1 ratio for crack cocaine quantities other than those that trigger the statutory mandatory minimum sentences\u201d); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>517 F.3d 1020, 1023-24 (8th Cir.2008). We thus agree with counsel that it would be frivolous for Grayson to argue that the sentence the district court imposed \u2014 the lowest permissible by law \u2014 is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"A9N\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is Granted, and the appeal is Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
