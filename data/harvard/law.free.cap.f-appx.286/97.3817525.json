Following a jury trial, Borodyonok was convicted of both counts. He now appeals, alleging he was denied a fair trial because the trial court\u2019s interjections clearly conveyed to the jury the court\u2019s belief that Borodyonok was guilty and because the court essentially directed a guilty verdict through its biased jury instructions. We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-16\">Borodyonok failed to object to the district court\u2019s interjections and questions. Accordingly, his claim is reviewed for plain error. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). As support for his claim that the court\u2019s interruptions deprived him of a fair trial, Borodyonok notes that the district court sua sponte interrupted defense counsel sixteen times, told defense counsel to move along eight times, and held three sidebars in the presence of the jury where he criticized defense counsel. We have independently reviewed the record and determined that the interjections complained of by Borodyonok were well within the district court\u2019s discretion to efficiently manage the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>presentation of admissible evidence. Accordingly, Borodyonok fails to demonstrate the district court erred, much less committed plain error.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Moreover, when the transcript is viewed as a whole, the record reveals no bias on the part of the district court as the district court also told the Government\u2019s attorney to \u201cmove along,\u201d corrected and criticized the Government\u2019s attorney in front of the jury, and took an active role in the questioning of at least one of the Government\u2019s witnesses. <em>United States v. Parodi, </em>703 F.2d 768, 776 (4th Cir.1983). The transcript shows at most a trial judge\u2019s ordinary efforts to control the mode and order of the presentation of evidence and to prevent Borodyonok\u2019s trial from unnecessarily consuming judicial resources. <em>United States v. Castner, </em>50 F.3d 1267, 1274 (4th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>452 F.3d 323, 332 (4th Cir.2006). Accordingly, Borodyonok\u2019s claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Borodyonok next claims the district court exhibited a lack of impartiality in charging the jury that, to sustain a conviction on Count One, the Government had to prove either conspiracy to evade immigration laws <em>or </em>conspiracy to make a false statement to immigration officials, even though the two clauses were joined by the word \u201cand\u201d in the indictment. As the evidence was sufficient on either of the acts charged, the instruction was proper, and Borodyonok\u2019s claim is without merit. <em>United States v. Hawkes, </em>753 F.2d 355, 357 (4th Cir.1985) (citing <em>Turner v. United States, </em>396 U.S. 398, 420, 90 S.Ct. 642, 24 L.Ed.2d 610 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Borodyonok also claims the district court\u2019s lack of impartiality was demonstrated in charging the jury that the Government need only prove that at least one of Borodyonok\u2019s purposes in marrying Ashley Farrell, a U.S. citizen, was to evade the immigration laws and that it did not have to be his sole purpose. That Borodyonok may have married Farrell with the additional intent of having consensual sex with her, as he claimed, or raping her, as she alleged, does not somehow mitigate his intent to violate the immigration laws. Accordingly, his claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">Borodyonok also claims the district court\u2019s bias was exhibited in instructing the jury that \u201cit did not matter which two people entered into the illegal agreement or conspiracy.\u201d The district court properly instructed the jury twice that the Government had to prove Borodyonok knowingly, willfully and voluntarily became a participant in or member of the conspiracy. Accordingly, Borodyonok\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">Finally, Borodyonok claims the district court demonstrated its lack of impartiality in instructing the jury that \u201c[tjhere isn\u2019t any issue about overt acts in this case. We need not spend a whole lot of time on it, because the marriage actually took place, and that\u2019s an overt act if you find there was an agreement.\u201d The district court also provided detailed instruction as to a number of other facts as to which there was no dispute, and emphasized that the primary issue for the jury\u2019s consideration was the defendant\u2019s intent in entering into the marriage and whether an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>agreement existed sufficient to support the conspiracy charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Any error by the district court in instructing the jury was harmless as defense counsel admitted during closing argument several of the overt acts occurred; counsel informed the jury that the issue for them to decide was Borodyonok\u2019s intent in marrying Farrell; the district court gave the jury a cautionary instruction related to its comments on the evidence; and the evidence of Borodyonok\u2019s guilt was overwhelming. <em>Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 18, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument as the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b125-7\"> To the extent Borodyonok claims bias by the district court in threatening defense counsel with sanctions in front of the jury, his claim is without merit as the record clearly shows the jury was outside the courtroom when counsel was threatened with a fine for asking repetitious questions. Also, Borodyonok suffered no prejudice in being initially prevented from questioning his girlfriend on why he was sent to Los Angeles because, immediately following a sidebar, counsel was permitted to question the witness on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
