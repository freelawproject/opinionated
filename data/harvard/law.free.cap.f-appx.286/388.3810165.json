Following Judge Ferguson\u2019s death, Judge Silverman was substituted for Judge Ferguson. Judge Silver-man has read the briefs and reviewed the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b415-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Appellant T.K.N. (\u201cJuvenile\u201d), was accused in an information of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1153(a) and 81. After Juvenile pleaded true (guilty) to arson as an act of juvenile delinquency, the district court ordered that Juvenile \u201cshall comply with Sexual Offender Registration requirements for convicted offenders in any state in which the Juvenile resides,\u201d based on the district court\u2019s knowledge that Juvenile had previously pleaded true to one count of abusive sexual contact. Juvenile\u2019s counsel objected, contending that the court ordered Juvenile to actually register as a sex offender. On appeal, Juvenile challenges the court\u2019s imposition of the special conditions of probation to comply with local sex offender registration and violent offender registration statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">This court reviews the conditions of supervised release for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. T.M., </em>330 F.3d 1235, 1240 n. 2 (9th Cir.2003). \u201cThe district court has broad discretion in setting conditions of supervised release, including restrictions that infringe on fundamental rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Bee, </em>162 F.3d 1232, 1234 (9th Cir.1998). Errors that counsel failed to object to at sentencing are reviewed for plain error and relief will be granted only if the error \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>441 F.3d 767, 772 (9th Cir .2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">A special condition of supervised release \u201cis a part of the district court\u2019s sentence, which is a final judgment subject to immediate appeal.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 771-72. A defendant may facially challenge a condition of supervised release upon direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>356 F.3d 1045, 1051 (9th Cir.2004). To the extent Juvenile challenges the legality or constitutionality of the imposition of the requirements that he comply with local registration statutes, his claims are ripe.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">In this case, the district court did not order Juvenile to register as a sex offender or register as a violent offender. Instead, the district court ordered Juvenile to <em>comply </em>with any state registration requirements if they applied. Compliance with state offender registration requirements is reasonably related to the sentencing goals of protecting the public from further crimes of the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C); <em>see also </em>Mont.Code Ann. \u00a7 46-23-508(l)(b) (providing for disclosure of registration information relevant to the public if agency determines that a registered offender is a risk to safety and dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>closure may protect the public). Ordering compliance with state law is no different than imposing a condition that the defendant not commit another Federal, state, or local crime while on supervised release, and does not restrict Juvenile\u2019s liberty any more than is reasonably necessary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Mont.Code Ann. \u00a7 46-23-507 (making failure to register a felony); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d). Therefore, the district court\u2019s imposition of special conditions directing compliance with state registration laws was proper, and Juvenile\u2019s facial challenges to the special conditions fail.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b415-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b416-14\">. Because ordering compliance with state sexual offender registration is proper, it follows that it is not plain error to order compliance with local violent offender registration requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b416-28\">. If the court later revokes Juvenile's supervised release based on these conditions.
