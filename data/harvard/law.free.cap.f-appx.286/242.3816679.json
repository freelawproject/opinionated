Bunton argues that (1) he was injured as a result of being housed under constitutionally inadequate prison conditions when he slipped in a puddle caused by a roof leak and (2) he received constitutionally inadequate medical care for his injury. By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Bunton is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-18\">Bunton, however, has not shown that the district court\u2019s summary judgment dismissal presents a nonfrivolous issue. The summary judgment evidence did not objectively establish that Bunton\u2019s prison conditions were inhumane or constituted an \u201cextreme deprivation of any minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities.\u201d <em>See Gates v. Cook, </em>376 F.3d 323, 332 (5th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Even if it is assumed arguendo that the leaking roof constituted a condition that posed a substantial risk of serious harm to Bunton, the evidence established that the defendants took reasonable remedial measures and, thus, did not act with deliberate indifference. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Bunton\u2019s prison conditions did not, as a matter of law, rise to the level of inhumane treatment such that his Eighth Amendment rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-19\">Bunton\u2019s contention that his injury was met with deliberate indifference and constitutionally inadequate medical care is refuted by evidence that his medical complaints were not ignored, he was seen by members the medical staff on numerous occasions, and he was treated for those complaints with various medications. <em>See Domino v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Bunton\u2019s allegations that the pain medication he was given was inadequate and that he should have received a bone scan to better diagnose his injury are merely disagreements over the type of care provided, which are not actionable under \u00a7 1988. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991). The summary judgment evidence establishes that Bunton\u2019s medical care also was not violative of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">In light of the foregoing, Bunton\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is dismissed. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Our dismissal of Bunton\u2019s appeal counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir. 1996). Bunton previously earned one strike in <em>Bunton v. Hinds County Sheriff\u2019s Dep\u2019t, </em>No. 3:01-CV-684 (S.D.Miss. Feb. 20, 2003). Bunton is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will no longer be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is detained or incarcerated in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b269-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
