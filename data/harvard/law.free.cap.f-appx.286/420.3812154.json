INS, </em>282 F.3d 1218, 1222 (9th Cir.2002). Moreover, although petitioner does not challenge the BIA\u2019s determination that he failed to submit material evidence of changed country conditions in support of his motion, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in making that determination. Accordingly, the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-17\">Finally, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider petitioner\u2019s unexhausted claims that could have been corrected by the Board of Immigration Appeals. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004). This court also lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary decision to decline to exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reopen petitioner\u2019s case. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-18\">Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion for summary disposition, in part, and for dismissal, in part, is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-19\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-20\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED, in part; DISMISSED, in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b447-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
