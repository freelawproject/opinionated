Arroyos challenges two upward sentence adjustments imposed by the district court. Finding no error in Arroyos\u2019s sentence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-17\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b908-18\">Arroyos was charged, along with his brother and another co-conspirator, in a one-count superseding indictment, with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute fifty kilograms or more of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), and 841(b)(1)(C). Arroyos pleaded guilty without a plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) began with a base level of twenty-four, subtracted three levels for acceptance of responsibility, and added two levels for Arroyos\u2019s role as a manager/superviser, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). This resulted in a total offense level of 23. For criminal history, the PSR applied one point for Arroyos\u2019s 1991 state drug conviction and one point for a 2006 federal misdemeanor fraud conviction, resulting in a criminal history category of II. Combining these metrics, Arroyos\u2019s Guidelines sentence range was 51 to 63 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Arroyos filed written objections to the manager/supervisor role enhancement and the scoring of his 2006 fraud conviction, and he renewed these objections at the sentencing hearing. The district court overruled Arroyos\u2019s objections and imposed a sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment plus 3 years of supervised release and a $100 special assessment. Arroyos brought this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">We have jurisdiction to hear a direct appeal of a final judgment in a criminal case pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">II. DISCUSSION A. Role Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">\n<em>i. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">We review a district court\u2019s factual finding that a defendant was a manager or supervisor under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(c) for clear error. <em>United States v. Powell, </em>124 F.3d 655, 667 (5th Cir.1997). Such a finding is not clearly erroneous as long as it is plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>United States v. Fullwood, </em>342 F.3d 409, 415 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">\n<em>ii Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a two-level upward adjustment upon a finding that the defendant was \u201can organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\u201d of the crime. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). To qualify for this adjustment,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-13\">the defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants. An upward departure may be warranted, however, in the case of a defendant who did not organize, lead, manage, or supervise another participant, but who nevertheless exercised management responsibility over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-14\"><em>Id. </em>at cmt. n. 2. The sentencing court may consider any relevant information \u201cwithout regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6A1.3(a). We have held that, for sentencing purposes, \u201ceven uncorroborated hearsay evidence is sufficiently reliable.\u201d <em>United States v. West, </em>58 F.3d 133, 138 (5th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe defendant bears the burden of showing that the information in the PSR relied on by the district court is materially untrue.\u201d <em>United States v. Valencia, </em>44 F.3d 269, 274 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-15\">In this case, the district court relied on statements by Arroyos\u2019s co-conspirators as support for the manager/supervisor adjustment. In a post-arrest statement referenced in the PSR, one of Arroyos\u2019s co-defendants, Alberto Bueno-Gorena (\u201cBue-no-Gorena\u201d), stated that Arroyos was \u201cthe organization\u2019s head in Tucson, Arizona,\u201d and that Arroyos and his wife were involved in laundering the proceeds from the sale of illegal drugs and storing large amounts of currency in their house. Another co-conspirator, Adimando Penaloza-Aguilar, stated in his post-arrest statement that Arroyos and Arroyos\u2019s brother, Ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>mando, were \u201chigh level members of the organization\u201d and that the marijuana seized in this offense belonged to them. The district court also took note of recorded phone conversations in which co-conspirators referenced Arroyos, as well as the fact of Arroyos\u2019s 1991 conviction for possession of two kilos of cocaine, which suggests that he had long been involved in the drug trade.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">On appeal, Arroyos contends that the co-conspirators\u2019 statements are insufficient to support the district court\u2019s role adjustment. For example, Arroyos cites several of the co-conspirators\u2019 descriptions of drug operations that make no mention of Arroyos. However, these statements do not directly rebut the co-conspirators\u2019 own statements that Arroyos was a supervisor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Arroyos also notes that the co-conspirator statements are unaccompanied by corroborating evidence. For example, despite Bueno-Gorena\u2019s allegations that Arroyos and his wife laundered and stashed money, Arroyos asserts that after a two-year federal investigation, the government has found no evidence to support those allegations. However, corroborating evidence is not required. We have explicitly held that the district court may rely on uncorroborated hearsay evidence in sentencing. <em>See West, </em>58 F.8d at 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">In light of other evidence, such as phone conversations and Arroyos\u2019s prior conviction, the district court chose to credit the co-conspirators\u2019 statements. This was largely a credibility determination, and we give deference to the credibility determinations of the district court. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>217 F.3d 323, 332 (5th Cir.2000) (\u201cWe defer to the trial court\u2019s superior position in making such credibility calls.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">Because Arroyos has failed to carry his burden of showing that these facts lacked sufficient indicia of reliability, we cannot conclude that the district court clearly erred in its factual finding supporting the role adjustment in this case. The district court\u2019s factual finding that Arroyos was a manager/supervisor is plausible in light of the record as a whole, and therefore it is not clearly erroneous. <em>See Fullwood, </em>342 F.3d at 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">B. Criminal History Calculation</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">\n<em>i. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b910-14\">We review a district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Cerverizzo, </em>74 F.3d 629, 630 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-15\">\n<em>ii. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b910-16\">The district court added a criminal history point for Arroyos\u2019s prior federal misdemeanor conviction for an incident in Arizona in 2006. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents came to Arroyos\u2019s door and asked him to identify himself. Arroyos showed them an Arizona driver\u2019s license issued in a name other than his own in an attempt to show that he was in the United States legally. Arroyos was in fact a Mexican citizen in the United States without a lawful visa.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-17\">Arroyos pleaded guilty to a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(4). That statute makes it a crime to \u201cknowingly possess[ ] an identification document (other than one issued lawfully for the use of the possessor), authentication feature, or a false iden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>tification document, with the intent such document or feature be used to defraud the United States.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(4). Arroyos served a twenty-day sentence in Arizona before he was moved to Texas for proceedings in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Under the federal Sentencing Guidelines, a prior misdemeanor conviction does not count toward a defendant\u2019s criminal history score if it is \u201csimilar to\u201d one of the offenses listed in \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l) or similar to another offense that itself is similar to one of the listed offenses. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1). An exception to this rule applies if \u201c(A) the sentence [in the prior offense] was a term of probation of at least one year or a term of imprisonment of at least thirty days, or (B) the prior offense was similar to an instant offense.... \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l). Because Arroyos served only a twenty-day term of imprisonment for his prior crime, and that crime was not similar to the instant offense, the only relevant issue here is whether the prior crime was \u201csimilar to\u201d one of the offenses listed in \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">In determining whether a prior offense is \u201csimilar to\u201d one of the offenses listed in \u00a7 4A1.2(c), this court follows \u201ca common sense approach which relies on all possible factors of similarity.\u201d <em>United States v. Hardeman, </em>933 F.2d 278, 281 (5th Cir.1991). Such factors include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmSi\">a comparison of punishments imposed for the listed and unlisted offenses, the perceived seriousness of the offense as indicated by the level of punishment, the elements of the offense, the level of culpability involved, and the degree to which the commission of the offense indicates a likelihood of recurring criminal conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-8\"><em>Id. </em>If the factors, \u201ctaken as a whole, indicate that the offense is, like the listed offenses, neither particularly serious nor likely to indicate recurring criminal conduct, then the defendant\u2019s prior offense should be excluded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 282. \u201cA court employing the <em>Hardeman </em>factors should do so cognizant of the fact that the criminal history factors are designed to take into account the relative severity of a prior offense as well as the degree to which it indicates the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\u201d <em>United States v. Gadison, </em>8 F.3d 186, 193 (5th Cir.1993). In this case we must decide whether, under the <em>Harde-man </em>factors, Arroyos\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 1028(a)(4) is \u201csimilar to\u201d the listed crime of false information to a police officer or a crime similar to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">We look to the state \u201cfailure to identify\u201d offense under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 38.02(b) for guidance on defining the generic offense. <em>See United States v. Reyes-Maya, </em>305 F.3d 362, 367-68 (5th Cir.2002) (noting that the Texas failure to identify offense is similar to the generic offense of \u201c[f]alse information to a police officer\u201d listed in the Guidelines); <em>see also United States v. Lopez-Pastrana, </em>244 F.3d 1025, 1028 n. 4 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cFor purposes of comparison, we use the federal definitions of the listed offenses. Where there is no federal law on point ... we may look to either state law or the Model Penal Code.\u201d (citation omitted)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under the failure to identify statute, \u201c[a] person commits an offense if he intentionally gives a false or fictitious name, residence address, or date of birth to a peace officer who has ... lawfully detained the person.\u201d Tex Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 38.02(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">Regarding the range of possible punishments, Arroyos\u2019s prior conviction carried a possible punishment range of up to one year imprisonment, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>\u00a7 1028(b)(6), while the maximum punishment under \u00a7 38.02(b) is 180 days, <em>see </em>Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 12.22, 38.02(c)(2). However, in terms of \u201cperceived seriousness,\u201d we consider the actual punishment range given rather than the statutory range: \u201cMore important than the statutory range of punishments is the actual punishment given, as \u2018[t]he level of punishment imposed for a particular offense serves as a reasonable proxy for the perceived severity of the crime.\u2019\u201d <em>Reyes-Maya, </em>305 F.3d at 367 (quoting <em>Harde-man, </em>933 F.2d at 282). Arroyos received only a twenty-day sentence for his crime, which suggests a level of seriousness similar to or lower than the generic state crime. The elements of the two crimes, on the other hand, are dissimilar. A conviction under \u00a7 1028(a)(4) requires a showing that the defendant (1) knowingly possessed a false identification document, (2) \u201cwith intent ... to defraud the United States.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(4). By contrast, the state failure to identify statute does not involve the possession of false documents, but merely makes it a crime to \u201cintentionally give[ ] a false or fictitious name, residence address, or date of birth to a peace officer.\u201d Tex Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 38.02(b). This is a significant difference because, under \u00a7 1028(a)(4), an individual must have undertaken a prior act to obtain a false document, possibly in anticipation of using it fraudulently. Merely giving false information verbally, as described by the Texas statute, requires no forethought. The Seventh Circuit has endorsed such a distinction in this context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-4\">The giving of false [oral] information, as where a person arrested for speeding claims not to have known the speed limit or to have a malfunctioning speedometer, is often spontaneous; and the human proclivity for self-exculpation, which is what usually triggers a tender of false information to a police officer, is well-nigh universal. The element of calculation is greater when an individual goes to the bother of obtaining a false document in advance of any confrontation with an officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-7\"><em>United States v. Caputo, </em>978 F.2d 972, 978 (7th Cir.1992). We find this analysis persuasive. Because seriousness of the offenses is a relevant factor under <em>Harde-man, </em>it is important to recognize that the crime of using a false identification document carries a greater level of seriousness than the generic failure to identify or false information offense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">Therefore, we are convinced that the elements required for a conviction under \u00a7 1028 indicate a level of seriousness higher than the generic offenses of false information to a police officer or failure to identify. Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not err in applying a criminal history point for Arroyos\u2019s prior \u00a7 1028(a)(4) conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">Because the district court properly applied upward adjustments to Arroyos\u2019s sentence for his manager/supervisor role and his prior misdemeanor conviction, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b908-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b910-7\">. According to the government, this large quantity of drugs indicates Arroyos was \"clearly not a street-level dealer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b910-18\">. In fact, at sentencing, the government implied that Arroyos's lack of involvement in low-level trafficking operations actually supports a finding that he was a manager/supervisor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b911-7\">. Because neither party argues that federal law provides a definition for the listed offense at issue here, we do not consider that possibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b912-5\">. The parties rely on our decision in <em>United States v. McDonald, </em>106 F.3d 1218 (5th Cir. 1997). However, <em>McDonald </em>does not bear directly on this case because it involved comparing a prior conviction under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 38.02(b)(1) with an actual offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(3). <em>See McDonald, </em>106 F.3d at 1220. By contrast, our task in this case is to decide whether a prior conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(4) is \"similar to\u201d the generic offense of \"[f]alse information to a police officer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
