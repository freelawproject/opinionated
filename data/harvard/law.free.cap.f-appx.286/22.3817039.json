On appeal, Greene claims that, but for the ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to object to the application of enhancements to his sentence, his sentence would have be lower.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-23\">As Greene acknowledges, his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be brought in a collateral proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), unless it conclusively appears from the face of the record that his counsel was ineffective. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-24\">Greene can make no such showing in this case. Evidence supports the district court\u2019s enhancements pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) (2004), based on Greene\u2019s possession of a firearm during the course of the conspiracy, and to USSG <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(6)(B), based on his having created a substantial risk of harm to the environment as a result of his methamphetamine manufacturing conduct. Thus, Greene cannot prove prejudice in his attorney\u2019s failure to object to the enhancements,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> based on the face of the record, such that we would entertain Greene\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance on direct appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Greene\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b48-16\">. Greene does not otherwise challenge his conviction, or the knowing and voluntary nature of his plea, nor does he challenge his admitted responsibility for an amount of methamphetamine of more than 35 grams but less than 50 grams, placing him at an attendant base offense level of 30, pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2D 1.1 (c)(5) (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b49-15\">. <em>See Strickland v.
