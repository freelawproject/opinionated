We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004), <em>amended by </em>404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2005), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Rodriguez\u2019s motion, because he failed to present material evidence of changed country conditions, and the general evidence attached to his motion did not establish prima facie eligibility for relief. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>see also Nuru v.
