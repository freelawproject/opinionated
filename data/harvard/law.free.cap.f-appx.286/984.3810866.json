Rodriguez-Macias makes two challenges to his removal and one due process claim. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-13\">First, Rodriguez-Macias argues that the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) erred in finding that he committed two crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal conduct, and was therefore removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii). We agree with this argument. Rodriguez-Macias pleaded guilty and was convicted of indecent exposure in violation of CaLPenal Code \u00a7 314(1) in November 1997. He then pleaded guilty and was convicted of child annoyance in violation of CaLPenal Code \u00a7 647.6(a) in May 2004. We recently ruled that a violation of \u00a7 647.6(a) is not categorically a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>See Nicanor-Romero v. Mukasey, </em>523 F.3d 992, 1007 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-17\">Since Rodriguez-Macias\u2019 crime was not necessarily morally turpitudinous, we turn to a modified categorical approach to determine whether Rodriguez-Macias\u2019 actual offense involved moral turpitude. <em>Id. </em>Under the modified categorical approach, we look beyond the mere language of the statute to the record of conviction to determine whether the government has shown by clear and convincing evidence that Rodriguez-Macias\u2019 actual crime involved moral turpitude. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-18\">The relevant documents in this case are insufficient to determine whether Rodriguez-Macias\u2019 \u00a7 647.6(a) conviction rises to the level of a crime involving moral turpitude. The record of conviction does not speak sufficiently to the actual facts of his crime, and therefore does not \u201cnarrow his offense or show that he pled guilty to elements that constitute a crime involving moral turpitude.\u201d <em>Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 1159, 1168 (9th Cir. 2006) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). There is no factual basis for concluding that Rodriguez-Macias\u2019 \u00a7 647.6(a) conviction is a crime involving moral turpitude and, therefore, he is not removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>Second, Rodriguez-Macias argues that the BIA erred in finding that his conviction under Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 647.6(a) constituted a crime of child abuse, making him removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i). The government argues that this issue was waived. It was not waived. Rodriguez-Macias raised the issue in his <em>pro se </em>cross-appeal to the BIA, but the BIA did not address it in its May-25, 2005 decision. <em>See </em>CAR 247 (\u201cAlthough[ ] it is uncommon to talk to a stranger[,] such verbal conduct which has been enhanced by [the] Prosecutor\u2019s technical translation [i]nto the crime of Annoyance [ ] does not amount to a crime of Abuse, Neglect, or Abandonment as it has been considered by the government.\u201d); 449 (\u201c[CaLPenal Code \u00a7 ] 647.6(a) [] CHILD ANNOYANCE [is] a misdemean- or, compare[d] to \u00a7 273(d) CHILD MOLEST [is] a felony.... CHILD ABUSE is of a higher category than CHILD ANNOY.\u201d); 413 and 866 (\u201cChild abuse, neglect, and abandon is not equal to Child annoyance.\u201d). We will therefore grant Rodriguez-Macias\u2019 petition to allow the BIA to rule in the first instance on whether his conviction under Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 647.6(a) constituted a crime of child abuse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">Accordingly, we GRANT the petition for review in part and remand to the BIA.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1011-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1011-15\">. Because we conclude that the record of conviction is insufficient to establish that Rodriguez-Macias\u2019 \u00a7 647.6(a) conviction was a crime involving moral turpitude, we need not decide whether his conviction for indecent exposure was a crime involving moral turpitude.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">. Because we grant Rodriguez-Macias\u2019 petition concerning \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), and remand for the BIA to rule on the \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i) issue in the first instance, we need not address Rodriguez-Macias\u2019 due process argument. If the BIA concludes that Rodriguez-Macias\u2019 conviction under \u00a7 647.6(a) is a crime of child abuse, it retains its discretion to grant or deny cancellation of removal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
