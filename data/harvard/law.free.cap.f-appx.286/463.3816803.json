R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b489-21\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-22\">Joel Solis appeals from the. 77-month sentence imposed following his guilty-plea conviction for being a deported alien found in the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-23\">As a threshold matter, we reject the government\u2019s contention that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal of a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Plouffe, </em>445 F.3d 1126, 1128-29 (9th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-24\">Solis contends that the sentence is unreasonable because the district court stated that it gave \u201cextra weight\u201d to the Guidelines. We note that Solis preserved this contention by disputing at sentencing the Government\u2019s characterization of the Guidelines as presumptively reasonable. The district court did not have benefit of our recent holding in <em>United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 991 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc), that a district court may not give the Guidelines more or less weight than any of the factors that are to be taken into account under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See id. </em>(\u201cIt would have been error had the judge actually attached a presumption of reasonableness to the Guidelines range or weighted the Guidelines range <em>more heavily </em>than the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>see also Rita. v. United </em>States,-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Therefore, we vacate and remand for proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-27\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b489-29\">This disposition is not appropriate i'or publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
