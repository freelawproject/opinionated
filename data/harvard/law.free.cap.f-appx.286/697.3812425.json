The Board held in its order that the Respondent, Rome Electrical Systems, Inc., did not give timely notice of its intent to withdraw from the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (\u201cIBEW\u2019 or \u201cthe union\u201d) and the Atlanta Electrical Contractors Association (\u201cAECA\u201d). The Respondent was thus found to have violated Section 8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), which makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer to refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of its employees. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(5). The Respondent contends here, as it did before the Board, that IBEW and AECA are estopped from arguing that its withdrawal was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">IBEW is an electrical industry labor union. AECA is an Atlanta-based trade association which, <em>inter alia, </em>represents electrical construction employers in collective bargaining in the state of Georgia. The Respondent is a small family business engaged as an electrical contractor in the building and construction industry. It is owned and operated by Danny and Ruby Bollen, and, at all times relevant, it employed four electricians who worked in and around Rome, Georgia. It appears that Rome is much smaller and in a different economic market than Atlanta.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">In or about December 1989, while working on a union site, Ruby Bollen signed a \u201cLetter of Assent-A,\u201d which authorized AECA to be the Respondent\u2019s collective bargaining representative \u201cfor all matters contained in or pertaining to the current and any subsequently approved labor agreement between [AECA] and [IBEW].\u201d The Respondent was not then \u2014 nor did it later become \u2014 an actual member of AECA. The letter of assent contained an automatic-renewal provision (a so-called \u201cevergreen clause\u201d), which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-10\">This authorization ... shall remain in effect until terminated by the undersigned employer giving <em>written notice </em>to [AECA] <em>and, </em>to [IBEW] <em>at least one hundred fifty (150) days </em>prior to the then current anniversary date of the applicable approved labor agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">(Emphasis added). As the above emphasized language indicates, if the Respondent desired to withdraw AECA\u2019s collective bargaining authority, it was required under the letter of assent to give 150 days written notice to both AECA and the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">After signing the letter of assent, the Respondent was covered by a series of collective bargaining agreements that AECA negotiated with IBEW on its behalf. The pertinent agreements are: (i) a 3-year contract, effective from September 1, 2000, through August 31, 2003, and (ii) a 1-year extension of that contract, effective from September 1, 2003, through August 31, 2004 (\u201cthe CBA\u201d). At the heart of this dispute is an alleged conflict created by the evergreen clause in the letter of assent and a separate evergreen clause in the CBA. Specifically, Section 1.02(a) of the CBA provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-13\">Either party or an Employer withdrawing representation from the Chapter or not represented by the Chapter, desiring to change or terminate this Agreement must provide written notification at least 90 days prior to the expiration date of the Agreement or any anniversa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>ry date occurring thereafter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">On September 28, 2003, the Respondent wrote to IBEW that it was going to terminate its affiliation with the union \u201cas a Signatory Contractor\u201d on November 1, 2003. This letter was sent only to IBEA; not to AECA. On October 21, 2003, IBEW\u2019s business manager, Lonnie Plott, responded that \u201c[u]nder the terms of the [CBA], the September 28, 2003 notice was not timely. Pursuant to Section 102(a), your firm should have given at least 90 days notice prior to the expiration date of the agreement for termination.\u201d The Respondent wrote back to IBEW, rescinded its notice, and stated its intent to remain with the union as a signatory contractor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">On May 27, 2004 \u2014 which was 97 days before expiration of the one-year extension of the CBA \u2014 the Respondent wrote to both IBEW <em>and </em>AECA and stated its intent to terminate its affiliation with the union <em>and </em>withdraw from AECA on August 31, 2004. The Respondent asserts that this action was taken due to economic necessity, and each of its four electrician employees signed a petition asking to be relieved of any union obligations. By letter of June 1, 2004, however, AECA informed the Respondent that \u201cAtlanta Electrical Contractors Association is a voluntary association of which you are not a member\u201d and, therefore, the Respondent\u2019s relationship with AECA was \u201cgoverned by the Letter of Assent signed by your Company.\u201d According to AECA, the withdrawal notice was untimely under the letter of assent because written notice was required \u201cat least one hundred fifty (150) days prior to the then current anniversary of the applicable approved labor agreement.\u201d AECA explained that the 90-day notice provision in the CBA applied to the termination of that particular labor agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">The Respondent honored the CBA until August 31, 2004, at which point it withdrew from AECA; attempted to bargain with IBEW on an individual basis; and unilaterally altered its employees\u2019 terms and conditions of employment, including changes to pay rates and contributions to IBEW\u2019s fringe benefit funds. On September 1, 2004, AECA and IBEW signed a 3-year extension of the CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">IBEW filed charges with the Board, seeking to keep the Respondent bound by the CBA and subsequent extension and to have it pay benefit contributions in accordance therewith. The Respondent protested the charges, arguing merger and estoppel. It also argued that its first notice of withdrawal from the union (which was sent to IBEW in September 2003 and subsequently rescinded) gave IBEW and AECA adequate and timely notice of its intent to withdraw. A three-member panel of the Board ruled in favor of the union and AECA.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Specifically, with respect to the Respondent\u2019s estoppel argument, the Board explained that there were two separate and distinct matters to be \u201cborne in mind,\u201d to wit: \u201cthe contract between the Respondent and the Union, and the agency relationship between the Respondent and the AECA. The former had a 90-day cancellation provision, and the latter had a 150-day cancellation provision.\u201d The Board noted that the Respondent\u2019s letter of September 2003, \u201creasonably read, referred only to the contract. It spoke of a termination of its affiliation with the Union as a signatory contractor. Further, the letter was sent only to the Union, not to the AECA.\u201d These facts, according to the Board, reasonably implied that \u201conly the contract was involved;\u201d and since IBEW\u2019s response dated October 21 likewise referred only to the CBA, \u201cit was unreasonable and incorrect for the Respondent to treat the union\u2019s letter of October 21 as an indication that the 90-day period applied to the agency relationship between the Respondent and AECA.\u201d Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agy\">given the imprecision of the Respondent\u2019s own 2003 notice, it would be highly unfair to read the statements in Plott\u2019s letter ... as referring to the required notice period for terminating AECA\u2019s agency. Moreover, as the General Counsel points out, Plott\u2019s statements were accurate. It would therefore be even less fair to treat the Plott letter as an affirmative representation, on which the Respondent reasonably could have relied, that the notice period for terminating the agency was 90 rather than 150 days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The Board now seeks to have its order enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">We have jurisdiction under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) to review and enforce orders issued by the Board, but our role in this context is a \u201cnarrow\u201d and \u201climited\u201d one. <em>See, e.g., Georgia Power Co. v. NLRB, </em>427 F.3d 1354, 1357-58 (11th Cir.2005); <em>accord NLRB v. Hayden Elec., Inc., </em>693 F.2d 1358, 1362 n. 4 (11th Cir.1982) (recognizing that there is \u201climited judicial review\u201d of orders issued by the Board and that courts should be \u201cslow to overturn\u201d them). \u201cTraditionally, we accord considerable deference to the Board\u2019s expertise in applying [the Act] to the labor controversies that come before it.\u201d <em>Visiting Nurse Health System, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>108 F.3d 1358, 1360 (11th Cir.1997). We will sustain the Board\u2019s decision if it is \u201crational, consistent with [the Act], and supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Georgia Power, supra, </em>427 F.3d at 1357-58; <em>see also Int\u2019l Bhd. of Boilermakers v. NLRB, </em>127 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">At the outset, we recognize that the \u201cLetter of Assent-A\u201d and the CBA are two very distinct documents that address different subject matters and serve different purposes. The letter of assent \u201cis the standard form used by [IBEW] for the delegation of bargaining rights by employers.\u201d <em>Local 257, IBEW v. Grimm, </em>786 F.2d 342, 344 (8th Cir.1986). Several courts, including this one, have noted that under the terms of the same or substantially similar letters of assent, an employer seeking to reclaim its bargaining authority must give written notice to the union <em>and </em>to the bargaining unit to whom the authority was given at least 150 days before the then current anniversary date of the labor agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 346; <em>see also Hayden, supra, </em>693 F.2d at 1363 <em>&amp; </em>n. 6. In the absence of timely and proper notice, the delegation of bargaining authority will continue. <em>See NLRB v. Black, </em>709 F.2d 939, 941 (5th Cir.1983) (the failure to timely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>withdraw authority under the Letter of Assent-A bound employer to subsequent agreement); <em>Grimm, supra, </em>786 F.2d at 345 (\u201cemployer\u2019s assignment of bargaining authority under the Letter of Assent-A is an ongoing delegation, ending only on formal termination\u201d). This result only makes sense. Because multi-employer bargaining units like AECA \u201care creatures of mutual consent,\u201d the ability to withdraw from such a unit is necessarily \u201climited by the agreement of the parties.\u201d <em>See Sheet Metal Workers Int\u2019l Assoc., Local 104 v. Simpson Sheet Metal, Inc., </em>954 F.2d 554, 555 (9th Cir.1992). Thus, to be effective, \u201cwithdrawal must be carried out <em>as specified in the agreement </em>\u201d of the parties. <em>See id. </em>(emphasis added) (citing cases); <em>see also, e.g., Grimm, supra, </em>786 F.2d at 345-46 (termination of letter of assent requires strict compliance with the terms set out in that document); <em>NLRB v. Hartman, </em>774 F.2d 1376, 1384 (9th Cir.1985) (withdrawal from bargaining unit was timely where the withdrawal notice was sent to association \u201cwithin the time, period set forth in the contract\u201d); <em>Black, supra, </em>709 F.2d at 941 (order of the Board enforced where \u201cthe Company failed to provide the requisite notice to withdraw its designation of \u00d1ECA as its bargaining representative\u201d 150 days before the agreement expired); <em>Hayden, supra, 693 F.2d </em>at 1363-65 (employer may withdraw bargaining authority \u201cfor any reason prior to the date set for renegotiation of an existing contract [if] adequate written notice\u201d is given under the contract; it must \u201ctimely withdraw ... in accordance with the terms of the letters of assent\u201d); <em>Nelson Elec. v. NLRB, </em>638 F.2d 965, 967-68 (6th Cir.1981) (employer may withdraw from bargaining unit \u201conly at an appropriate time\u201d as set forth in letter of assent, that is, \u201c150 days prior to the current anniversary date of the agreement\u201d). <em>Cf. Haas Elec., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>299 F.3d 23, 27 (1st Cir.2002) (\u201c[A] stated intent to withdraw from multiemployer bargaining is effective only if it is both timely and unequivocal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The CBA, by contrast, establishes the terms and conditions of employment, such as union wages, fringe benefits, and hours. The 90-day notice period contained in Section 1.02(a) of the CBA governs the act of changing or terminating the CBA itself\u2014 not the separate and distinct act of withdrawing AECA\u2019s bargaining authority. As the Board noted in its order, Section 1.02(a) does not refer to, or make any mention of, how an employer may withdraw representation from AECA, and it presumably would have done so if the CBA were intended to govern that issue. Indeed, it is notable that Section 1.02(a) is satisfied by 90 days notice to the union alone. If it were intended to apply to the withdrawal of AECA\u2019s agency authority, one would reasonably expect that it would have required notice to AECA as well. The 90-day notice provision in the CBA was obviously not intended to apply to the withdrawal of bargaining authority from AECA.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Therefore, in order to withdraw from AECA, the Respondent was required to give 150 days notice under the letter of assent, even though there was a separate 90 day notice provision in the CBA. <em>See, e.g., Sheet Metal Workers, Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n, Local Union No. 24 v. Architectural Metal Works, Inc., </em>259 F.3d 418, 427 n. 9 (6th Cir.2001) (employer\u2019s attempt to withdraw from CBA was ineffective because it \u201cdid not give proper notice to the Union and the Association at least 150 days\u201d in advance as required by the letter of assent, notwithstanding that there was a separate 90 day notice provision in the CBA); <em>IBEW, Local 26 v. AdVin Electric, Inc., </em>98 F.3d 161, 162-64 (4th Cir.1996) (applying letter of assent\u2019s 150-day period to determine the timeliness of employer\u2019s with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>drawal, while noting the separate 90-day period for contract termination in the CBA).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The Respondent does not appear to dispute that its actions \u2014 withdrawing from AECA, attempting to directly bargain with the union individually, and changing the terms and conditions of its workers\u2019 employment \u2014 were improper <em>if </em>its withdrawal was untimely. Nor does it dispute that it gave only 97 days notice to AECA and the union. The Respondent contends, however, that IBEW and AECA should be estopped from contending that its notice was untimely because IBEW gave \u201cwritten representation and directive\u201d that in order to terminate the CBA it need only give 90 days notice in accordance with Section 1.02(a). Because estoppel is the only defense properly raised by the Respondent, resolution of this case depends on whether estoppel is available on the facts presented.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">\u201cEstoppel is an equitable doctrine invoked to avoid injustice in particular cases.\u201d <em>Heckler v. Community Health Services of Crawford County, </em>467 U.S. 51, 59, 104 S.Ct. 2218, 81 L.Ed.2d 42 (1984). To be invoked, it must be shown that the person against whom it is asserted made a \u201cdefinite misrepresentation of fact,\u201d that was detrimentally relied upon and caused another to change position, and such reliance \u201cmust have been reasonable in that the party claiming the estoppel did not know nor should it have known that its adversary\u2019s conduct was misleading.\u201d <em>Heckler, supra, </em>467 U.S. at 59, 104 S.Ct. 2218. The doctrine is based on the maxim that \u201cno man may take advantage of his own wrong.\u201d <em>Glus v. Brooklyn Eastern Dist. Terminal, </em>359 U.S. 231, 232, 79 S.Ct. 760, 3 L.Ed.2d 770 (1959). This presupposes, therefore, that the party to be es-topped acted intentionally or, at the very least, with knowledge that his actions were wrong. <em>Cf. National Cos. Health Benefit Plan v. St. Joseph\u2019s Hosp. of Atlanta, Inc. </em>929 F.2d 1558, 1572 (11th Cir. 1991) (explaining that the elements of estoppel include that the party to be estopped \u201cmisrepresented material facts\u201d even though he was \u201caware of the true facts\u201d), <em>abrogated on other grounds by, Geissal v. Moore Medical Corp., </em>524 U.S. 74, 118 S.Ct. 1869, 141 L.Ed.2d 64 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-14\">Preliminarily, the letter upon which the Respondent bases its estoppel claim came from IBEW, <em>not </em>AECA. The Respondent has not explained why AECA is responsible for IBEW\u2019s letter, nor has it identified any alleged misrepresentation by AECA. Regardless, estoppel is unavailable here because what IBEW advised the Respondent in October 2003 was not a \u201cdefinite misrepresentation of fact,\u201d but rather it was a true statement and was appropriate under the circumstances. The Respondent indicated in its September 2003 letter that it wanted to withdraw \u201cas a Signatory Contractor,\u201d and the letter was sent to the union directly. There was no mention of AECA or of its existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>agency relationship. Reasonably interpreted, therefore, the Respondent was attempting to withdraw only from the CBA. Under the terms of that agreement, the Respondent was required to give the union at least 90 days notice, which it plainly did not do in its letter of September 28, 2003. The Board explained that because the statement from IBEW was true and accurate based on the wording of the specific agreement issue, it would be unfair \u201cto treat the [IBEW] letter as an affirmative representation, on which the Respondent reasonably could have relied, that the notice period for terminating the agency was 90 rather than 150 days.\u201d The Board thus concluded that estoppel could not lie, and this conclusion is reasonable and supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Moreover, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that there was a definite misrepresentation of fact, there is no evidence (nor does the Respondent even suggest) that IBEW acted intentionally or with knowledge that what it told the Respondent was wrong or misleading. Again, the Respondent sent its original notice only to the union, and it spoke of withdrawing as a \u201csignatory contractor.\u201d It did not mention or reference AECA or its bargaining authority. IBEW responded and cited the 90-day provision in the CBA. The ambiguity in both letters is perhaps unfortunate, but, as indicated by the Board, it would be unfair to allow the Respondent to capitalize on its own imprecision. And in any event, estoppel is available only where the party seeking relief did not know, <em>nor could have reasonably known, </em>of the \u201ctrue facts.\u201d Here, the Respondent could have learned of the 150-day notice requirement merely by reviewing the letter of assent that it signed and, presumably, still had in its possession. Therefore, the Board did not err in rejecting the Respondent\u2019s estoppel defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"Aqz\">For the foregoing reasons, the order is ENFORCED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b726-6\">. The Board explained in its order that the notice language in Section 1.02(a) of the CBA was different from the notice language in prior labor contracts. The Board further explained that while it was well-settled law that withdrawal of bargaining authority under a letter of assent was \"an action distinct from\u201d terminating those prior contracts, it was an issue of first impression whether the recent version of Section 1.02(a) superceded or merged with the letter of assent, which would mean that the two actions were not distinct. In other words, the Respondent was \"an Employer withdrawing representation from [AECA] or not represented by [AECA], desiring to change or terminate this agreement,\u201d and only required to give at least 90 days notice under the CBA. As will be shown, this argument has not been properly raised on appeal and, even if it had been properly raised, it would still fail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b726-12\"><em>. </em>The record reflects that only AECA and IBEW were signatory parties to the CBA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b729-7\">. The Respondent only raises the estoppel argument in its brief, but, during the course of presenting that argument, it states in passing that it also \"renews the <em>defenses </em>it raised in the Board case.\" <em>See </em>Resp. Brief at 9 (emphasis added). To the extent that this single statement is intended to put the merger and \"timely notice\u201d issues before the court, it is plainly insufficient. <em>See, e.g., Marek v. Single-tary, </em>62 F.3d 1295, 1298 n. 2 (11th Cir.1995) (\"Issues not clearly raised in the briefs are considered abandoned.\u201d); <em>see also Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines, Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004) (issues on appeal \"should be specifically and clearly identified in the brief;\u201d they must be \"plainly and prominently\u201d indicated; and if an argument is not \"fully briefed,\u201d then \"evaluating its merits would be improper\u201d) (citation and some quotation marks omitted). In any event, those arguments are without merit, as fully discussed above.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
