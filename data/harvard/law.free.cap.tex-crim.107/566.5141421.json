The sentence is now reformed so as to read that the appellant shall be confined in the penitentiary for not less than five nor more than twelve years.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Finding no reversible error in the record, the judgment of the trial court, as reformed, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b583-8\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b583-9\">LATTIMORE, Judge. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"AuaH\">Appellant renews complaint of the overruling of his application for continuance. We have again examined the record. While there appears in same an application for continuance, there is nothing to show that said application was ever presented to the court below, nor is there any order overruling such application, nor any bill of exceptions complaining of such refusal. In order for this court to consider the supposed error of the refusal of a continuance, it must appear that the same was presented, refused, and such refusal excepted to.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">Appellant presented a motion for new trial, which was overruled. The order of the court overruling said motion recites that the court heard said motion \u201cand the evidence thereon submitted,\u201d and is of the opinion that same should be overruled. We fail to find in the record any bill of exceptions setting out the testimony that was heard by the court upon the presentation of said motion. In the absence of such testimony being brought before us in some way, we are unable to decide whether the court erred in overruling said motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahjz\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
