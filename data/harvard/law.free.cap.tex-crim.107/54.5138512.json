Exception must be reserved in one form or the other. Linder v. State, 94 Tex. Crim. Rep. 316, 250 S. W. 703; Nichols v. State, 91 Tex. Crim. Rep. 277, 238 S. W. 232; Thomas v. State, 100 Tex. Crim. Rep. 288, 273 S. W. 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-14\">In two bills appellant complains because witnesses were permitted to describe the liquor and other articles found in the shed-room of a vacant building known as the old \u201cDowning store,\u201d which was situated between seventy-five and one hundred feet from the building occupied by appellant. Objection was urged on the ground that the search warrant did not include the Downing store. This was shown to be a vacant store building with a shed-room extending along one side. It was accessible to the public. A vacant lot was between it and the building occupied by appellant. He could not complain because the officers had no warrant to search the \u201cDowning store.\u201d None of his property rights was invaded in doing so. He disclaimed the property found there. Craft v. State (9859, decided April 6, 1927, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>not yet reported); Wright v. State, 103 Tex. Crim. Rep. 534, 281 S. W. 864; Dozier v. State, 289 S. W. 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\">If we understand bill No. 8 it presents complaint because a witness was permitted to testify that a certain five-gallon bottle of whiskey was found in the old Downing store, the objection being based on two grounds, one being that said store was not described in the search warrant. This objection has already been disposed of. The other ground of objection was that appellant had made a motion to exclude the testimony of finding liquor at any other place than that described in the search warrant. It has been held that a preliminary motion to suppress evidence is not recognized in our procedure. Foster v. State, 104 Tex. Crim. Rep. 120, 282 S. W. 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Appellant makes serious complaint that certain argument of the District Attorney found no support in the evidence. The objectionable statement was in substance, that appellant claimed to be in the restaurant business in Crystal Falls, when there was as much necessity for a restaurant at that place as \u201cthere is for an ice factory at the north pole.\u201d The statement of facts shows that at Crystal Falls there was only a store or two, a filling station and the restaurant, which appellant claimed to be operating. It was evidently the state\u2019s contention that appellant\u2019s claim of operating a restaurant was only a blind to cover a business of selling whiskey. The observations of the District Attorney seem justified under the facts. From the court\u2019s qualification to another bill complaining of argument it appears to have been invited by counsel for appellant and presents no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The sufficiency of the evidence is challenged. Officers-armed with a warrant to search appellant\u2019s place of business hurriedly drove up in front of it. Appellant ran into the back of the building and was followed by one of the officers who found him with an empty whiskey bottle in his hand. Upon a search of the kitchen several half-gallon fruit jars were found, some of them having the smell of whiskey in them, and also one or two whiskey glasses were there. No whiskey was found in the kitchen except a very small quantity in one of the fruit jars. A well-used. and freshly beaten path was found leading from the kitchen door of appellant\u2019s building across a vacant lot to the shed-room of what was' called the old \u201cDowning store.\u201d In this shed-room the officers found two or three sacks of bottled beer and also found some in a five-gallon lard can in water which was still cold, but the ice had melted. Several cases of fruit jars were also found, in one of them was a half-gallon jar about half full of whiskey, and another half-gallon jar about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>half full of coloring matter; also there was found a five-gallon water bottle full of whiskey. The whiskey found in the kitchen of appellant\u2019s restaurant appeared to be of the same kind, color, and quality as that found in the shed-room. The fruit jars in the shed-room were the same kind as the few found in appellant\u2019s kitchen. The Downing store and shed-room in question were unoccupied and open in many places to the public. Evidence was noticeable that it had been used for \u201ctoilet\u201d purposes by some, but the only plain or beaten path leading to this shed-room was from appellant\u2019s kitchen. Other signs indicated that parties had been in the shed-room coming from other directions, but no well-defined path was discoverable except the one mentioned. It was developed by appellant himself upon cross-examination of the state\u2019s witnesses that a former raid had been made upon his place by the officers, at which time appellant\u2019s conduct in running from the front of his restaurant to the back of it was the same as on the present occasion. In response to appellant\u2019s own question to one of the officers to state the exact reason he had gotten the search warrant for appellant\u2019s premises the officer answered that they had been getting lots of complaints against appellant and on the place from different parties, and this together with appellant\u2019s conduct on the previous raid was what caused him to ask for the search warrant. To hold that the jury was not justified in reaching the conclusion that appellant was in possession of the whiskey and articles found in the shed-room of the Downing store would be to discard the finding of the jury upon an issue which has support in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b73-7\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b73-8\">LATTIMORE, Judge. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"AoI\">Appellant renews his complaint of the argument of the District Attorney. We have given the matter careful consideration and can add nothing to what we said in our original opinion on this point. There is also complaint of the fact that the court below failed to charge on what is thought to be the affirmative theory of the defense. The exception to the court\u2019s charge on this particular point is as follows: \u201cFurther, the court does not instruct the jury relative to the law and facts governing the possession in this case.\u201d This is not specific, does not point out any particular part of the charge which is error by reason of incorrect expression or omission. Our statute requires that the exception to the court\u2019s charge, in order to call for review at our hands, must be in writing and it must dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>tinctly specify each ground of objection. The exception referred to appears to us insufficient to call the court\u2019s attention to what we understand is now being urged as appellant\u2019s defense, viz.: that he did not possess the liquor found in the old Downing house. Neither one of the three special charges requested presented any affirmative theory that would call the attention of the court or the jury to the fact that appellant was contending that he did not have possession of said liquor. The refusal of the special charges asked by appellant appears to have been satisfactory to him as he made no exception to such refusals in any case, and no exception thereto appears in the record either by notation on the refused charges or by separate bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\">Being unable to agree with any of the contentions made by appellant, the motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
