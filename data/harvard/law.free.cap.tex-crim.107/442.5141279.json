In this bill appellant questions the sufficiency of the affidavit and search warrant, and complains of the admission of the state\u2019s evidence thereunder, showing that the officers found intoxicating liquor in his residence. The appellant contends that such evidence was illegally obtained because the affidavit was made upon information and belief and without stating any facts authorizing the issuance of a search warrant based thereon. This part of the affidavit states:</p>\n<p id=\"b459-14\">\u201cA. K. Neeley and N. T. Goodwin * * * being duly sworn, on his oath deposes and says that he has good reason to believe and does believe that intoxicating liquor,\u201d etc., and the search warrant shows upon its face that it was issued upon an affidavit setting forth the belief of the affiants. The appellant\u2019s contention on this issue is correct and must be sustained, under the doctrine announced by this court in Chapin v. State, No. 10670, decided June 22, 1927, yet unreported, and the numerous author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>ities therein cited. This court, in the Chapin case, supra, held that a search warrant issued upon an affidavit based wholly on information and belief was invalid, and would not authorize the search of a private residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">For the error above discussed the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
