In addition to the filing of his license, said practitioner must also file with said clerk an affidavit containing certain specified statutory requisites. Appellant was charged with a violation of this statute. The statement of facts is not approved by the trial court, and we find ourselves unable to appraise the complaints appearing in the various bills of exception relating to objections as to the admission or rejection of facts. There is a bill of exceptions complaining of the court\u2019s action in overruling appellant\u2019s motion to quash. We have carefully examined the information and do not believe same open to the objection made. The pleader was attempting to state, and does state, though rather awkwardly, that appellant neither filed her license nor the affidavit required. We do not think it possible for appellant to have been misled. All the elements of the offense appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b34-7\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b34-8\">LATTIMORE, Judge. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"ANE\">Appellant makes an earnest attempt to establish the fact that she was without fault in the matter of her failure to get the statement of facts approved by the trial court. No statement of the trial judge appears in the record in this connection, nor is there anything showing any reason why the approval of the trial court was not obtained. In examining this matter our attention was attracted to the fact that the statement of facts was filed one day too late. The motion for new trial was overruled and notice of appeal given on June 5, 1926. The statement of facts appears to have been filed in the office of the clerk of the court below September 4, 1926. This filing was ninety-one days after notice of appeal. We are unable, in this condition of the record, to consider the statement of facts, and the motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">Morrow, P.
