Appellant contends that said testimony was inadmissible because the witness had previously testified that it was a dark night and that he could not recognize the man who robbed him, and further contends that the question was leading and\" suggested the desired answer. The objection raised to this testimony went more to the weight than to the admissibility of same, and the contention to the effect that the question was leading, if true, is not of such a nature as would authorize this court to reverse the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-15\">Bill No. 2 complains of the action of the court in permitting the state to prove by appellant on cross-examination that there was another and different\" felony indictment pending against him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>The appellant contends that this testimony was prejudicial and inadmissible. We are not in accord with this contention. It has been the uniform holding of this court for many years that a defendant may be interrogated on cross-examination relative to other charges of felonies or misdemeanors involving moral turpitude pending against him, for the purpose of affecting his credibility as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\">Bills 3 and 4 complain of the action of the District Attorney in addressing two of the jurors by name in his closing argument, stating in effect that unless the jury did their duty robberies would be encouraged and some good citizen would be the next victim. It is contended by appellant that the attorney\u2019s action in personally appealling to the jurors was inflammatory and prejudicial. These bills, as presented, show no reversible error. This-court has heretofore held that such a practice was improper, but we know of no decisions, and are cited none by appellant, where this court has ever held that the mere addressing of a juror by name was reversible error. We are furthermore of the opinion that such a practice is more likely to be detrimental than beneficial to the state, in that the balance of the jurors might be inclined to resent such conduct upon the part of the District Attorney in appealing directly to certain jurors and ignoring the remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">In bill No. 5 is set out in full the amended motion for new trial, embracing 11 paragraphs, and there is included an order of the court overruling same and the notice of appeal to this court. This bill is multifarious and insufficient to apprise this court specificially of what particular paragraphs or grounds in the motion the appellant relies on for a reversal, and is contrary to the doctrine announced by this court in Nugent v. State, 273 S. W. 598, and Kitchen v. State, 276 S. W. 259. Such a bill adds nothing to the exception and notice of appeal set out in the order of the court overruling said motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Finding no reversible error in the record, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b624-8\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b624-9\">MORROW, Presiding Judge. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"ABk\">The document designated as bill of exceptions No. 5 was in fact a motion for new trial. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>'contains eleven subdivisions complaining of various matters occurring upon the trial. To invoke a review on appeal of the rulings of the court of which complaint is made in the present motion for new trial, they should have been challenged at the time the rulings were made and bills of exception preserved as required by Art. 667, C. C. P., 1925, and the civil statutes to which it refers. A motion for new trial cannot be made the substitute for a bill of exceptions. Many announcements of this law will be found in Vernon\u2019s Tex. C. C. P., 1925, Vol. 2, p. 362, note 22. Among them will be mentioned Morse v. State, 83 Tex. Crim. Rep. 153; Watson v. State, 87 Tex. Crim. Rep. 189; Wilson v. State, 87 Tex. Crim. Rep. 538; Reid v. State, 88 Tex. Crim. Rep. 364; Claybrook v. State, 95 Tex. Crim. Rep. 88; Madison v. State, 95 Tex. Crim. Rep. 439; Flowers v. State, 98 Tex. Crim. Rep. 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Deeming the other matters to which the motion for rehearing relates, properly decided and sufficiently discussed in the original hearing, further reference to them is omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The motion is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"Abr\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
