E. McVey, C. J. Ginn and E. K. Vollette, but was granted a severance. A jury having been waived, trial was had in the County Court at Law before the Hon. Ben F. Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-17\">There are in the record no bills of exception. We do find, however, \u201cDefendant\u2019s Exceptions to Indictment,\u201d at the terminus of which appears the following notation: \u201cDefendant O. L. Hubbard\u2019s Exceptions to Indictment, Overruled.\u201d The trial judge\u2019s signature of authentication does not appear in connection with this notation, and there are no exceptions bringing this matter forward for our review. We are therefore not authorized to consider same.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-19\">The questions raised in the motion to quash not relating to the substance of the indictment and not being properly presented to this court, there remains'nothing further for our con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>sideration except the sufficiency of the evidence.

We find in the record a motion to quash, but no order of the court appears showing that it was acted on or that it was ever called to the court\u2019s attention. There does appear the notation mentioned in the original opinion, but it is not over the trial judge\u2019s- signature and is in no other way authenticated by him. In such condition of the record this court cannot take cognizance of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">Appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
