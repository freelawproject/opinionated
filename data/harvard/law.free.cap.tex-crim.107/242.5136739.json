In view of the fact that a number of other witnesses testified without any contradiction that deceased was under the influence of liquor and drunk at the time he was killed, we are not at all inclined to think that the rejection of the testimony was of such materiality as to call for a reversal of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Appellant admitted that he cut deceased, from the result of which deceased name to his death.
