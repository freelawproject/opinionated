Wheeler testified to the breaking into of his store and to the theft of a number of articles, including bolts of checks, overalls, ginghams and shoes. The witness testified that about the premises he saw the tracks of four persons. However, he was not able to identify the tracks as those of the appellant. He also saw the tracks of an automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">\u25a0 The sheriff testified that there had been a shower of rain on the night on which the burglary took place; that on the following morning he examined the premises and found tracks of a Ford automobile. He afterward found the car and some of the stolen goods in it; that he later made efforts to find the appellant. He went to various places endeavoring to locate him. He also testified to the finding of some of the stolen articles in Hale\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">Appellant introduced no evidence save that of one witness, sixty-seven years of age, who testified that the appellant had never been convicted of a felony. On cross-examination he was asked the following question:</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">\u201cYou heard about him breaking into Wash Wheeler\u2019s store and leaving the county after that, didn\u2019t you, and being gone two or three years?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">The defendant\u2019s objection was overruled, and the witness answered:</p>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">\u201cYes, I heard of some one breaking into the store, and that is who they said it was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-13\">This was not competent to prove the offense. It was hearsay. State\u2019s counsel before this court concedes that its receipt was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>error, and in this we concur, especially in view of the fact that penalty assessed was far above the minimum. We will add that we fail to find any testimony corroborative of the accomplice Hale. To sustain the conviction the law requires corroboration. Art. 718, C. C. P., 1925.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
