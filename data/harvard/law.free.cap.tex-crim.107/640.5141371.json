He was denied bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">Relator and deceased lived immediately across the street from each other, separated by a distance of about thirty feet. On the morning of the tragedy a row had been in progress between deceased and others in and about the house occupied by relator prior to his return home. Deceased and his wife, it appears, became engaged in an altercation that aroused the neighborhood, followed by a fight between one Charlie Williams and deceased, at which time Charlie Williams appears to have used the premises of relator to throw missies from towards the house of deceased. During this time relator was absent from home and upon his return he seems to have accosted Williams about raising a row about his premises and in an altercation shot Williams. This was followed by a controversy between deceased and relator which terminated in relator\u2019s shooting and killing deceased with a shotgun, relator firing the shot from a point near his own premises at deceased, who stood on his own porch a few feet away.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">The evidence is sharply conflicting as to the facts immediately preceding this tragedy. The testimony for the state would make an unprovoked killing upon express malice. For the relator evidence was introduced that he accused deceased, his wife and Williams of raising 'a disturbance about his premises in his absence, charged Reasby and his wife with running a honkytonk joint and of bootlegging. Some evidence was introduced that their residence was kept open all night, with cars coming and going all night some nights.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">Pearl Washington, one of relator\u2019s neighbors, testified that she heard the Reasby woman cursing relator. She said: \u201cYou G- d- s-b-, when you get down to the foot of Capitol you will learn to attend to your own business.\u201d He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>said: \u201cI am not talking to you.\u201d She began cursing. She continued to curse, just continued, \u201cYou G-d-s-b \u2014 \u2014,\u201d continued just cursing for everything she could think of. I heard Reasby say something too. I heard him say to Stockton, \u201cYou G-d-s-b-, I will get you if life lasts.\u201d Reasby said that to Stockton. When he made that remark he was standing on his porch, just standing with his hand down like this, the right hand down something like this. Behind his leg, like that. When Reasby said \u201cYou G-d-s-b-, I will get you if life lasts\u201d he started up at this end and he started toward the steps. They were at the west end of the porch and they started in this direction \u2014 started toward the steps. Reasby\u2019s wife was still cursing. She started with Reasby; she started right in just by the side of him. He cursed him again, \u201cYou G-d-s-b-, and at that time I began to see him fall. I heard the shot, yes, a very light report, and he fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-13\">Ernest Washington, another neighbor of relator\u2019s, and not related to Pearl Washington, testified in part as follows: \u201cThe first thing I heard was Robert Stockton was out talking concerning of the negroes raising cain around the place there at night. He came out and was talking about negroes raising hell every Saturday night and Sunday night when he was gone, didn\u2019t show a bit of respect to his women folks, and he didn\u2019t like it at all. By that time Reasby walks out and went to a fern bucket and picks up something and went and sat down. Reasby walked put of his house and went to a fern bucket and went back and sat down on the front porch. Then Charlie Williams walks out of Reasby\u2019s house and sat down on the front porch at Reasby\u2019s house and commenced talking, cursing back and forward to Robert Stockton; said he didn\u2019t give a G- d- about his respect for the women folks over there, he didn't -care whether he liked it or not, it .was just up to him whether he wanted to take it or not, he didn\u2019t give a damn about him or his women folks either.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-16\">Of the facts immediately surrounding the killing he testified in part: \u201cBy that time Reasby spoke and said, \u2018You yellow s-of a b-, look out there, I will get you,\u2019 and made an attempt to move off the porch at the time with his hand behind him. He said, \u2018You G- d-yellow s- of a b-, I\u2019ll get you, look out.\u2019 When he said that he made a move toward the steps and at that time the report of the gun. The report of the gun came when he moved toward the steps.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-22\">It was further shown that these parties had had previous dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Acuities and much ill-feeling existed between them. It was shown by one witness for relator that he bore a good reputation. The chief witness for the state was the wife of the deceased. The quoted testimony on behalf of relator unquestionably raises- defensive issues which, if believed, would not. result in capital punishment. Coming from the neighbors of relator, we do not feel at liberty to hold that their testimony would be disregarded. .Considering the testimony altogether, we are unable to assume that mitigating circumstances and defensive evidence, if introduced on the trial of the case, would be entirely rejected by a jury. The rules governing cases of this character have been so ofttimes stated, and we feel are so thoroughly understood by the profession, that a restatement would be useless.
