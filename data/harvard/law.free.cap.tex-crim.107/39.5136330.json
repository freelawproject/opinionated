Melson.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-15\">Under the statute, only the judge who tried a criminal case is authorized to approve the bill of exception and statement of fact, except where the trial judge dies before the time for said approval or filing, in which event the bill of exception and statement of facts may be approved or filed by the deceased judge\u2019s successor, as provided in Art. 2288, Revised Civil Statutes, 1925. The record does not disclose the death of the trial judge, J. M. Melson, nor is any reason shown why Judge Melson did not approve the bill of exception and the statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-16\">With the record in this condition, we are not authorized to consider the statement of facts and bill of exception.
