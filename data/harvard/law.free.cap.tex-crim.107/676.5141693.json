The testimony of Maudell Jones shows there was a difficulty between Maudell Jones and Olivia Matthews on the night preceding the killing and that the deceased, Estelle Reado, and appellant were both present at that time. The killing occurred in the early part of the night; the moon was shining brightly. Appellant and Olivia Matthews were sitting on the steps of a house with the witness Parlee Butler as the deceased and Maudell Jones approached. Olivia Matthews and the appellant jumped up off the steps and went toward deceased and Maudell Jones. Olivia Matthews was armed with a knife and appellant with a pistol. Some words passed between the parties. Appellant told deceased that she, appellant, would not allow deceased to do anything. Appellant urged Olivia Matthews to go on and fight, at which time appellant had a gun in her hand pointed toward deceased, who had her hands up. While deceased had her hands up, Olivia Mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>thews cut her with a knife several times. In about five or ten minutes deceased was carried to the hospital in an ambulance, where she died within a few minutes after her arrival.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The learned trial judge gave a very able charge to the jury on murder, manslaughter, - and aggravated assault, and a special charge on circumstantial evidence, which charge covered every issue raised by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The court properly refused appellant\u2019s two special charges, same being fully covered by the main charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">We find in the record two unnumbered bills of exception complaining of the argument of the Assistant County Attorney, wherein he said:</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">\u201cMay Easton, the defendant, grabbed the deceased by her hand and threw a gun in her face.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">\u201cMay Easton held Estelle Reado by the hand while Olivia Matthews cut her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">We are unable to consider these two bills of exception. The bills do not sufficiently recite the specific grounds which form the basis of appellant\u2019s objection. A general objection is insufficient to bring the matter forward for review. Sanchez v. State, 233 S. W. 982; Houser v. State, 222 S. W. 240; Reynolds v. State, 274 S. W. 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-11\">Appellant\u2019s bill of exception No. 1 complains of the action of the learned trial judge in refusing to instruct a verdict of \u201cnot guilty.\u201d We are not in accord with appellant\u2019s contention, the facts being amply sufficient to warrant the court in submitting the issues to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-12\">Bills of exception Nos. 2 and 3 complain of the refusal of the court to give special charges Nos. 1 and 3. The court in his main charge ably and fully charged the law applicable to the facts, and we do not think the court erred in refusing to give said special charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-13\">Bills of exception Nos. 4 and 5, as qualified by the learned trial judge, present no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-14\">Bill of exception No. 6 complains of the closing argument of the special prosecutor, wherein he used the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b694-15\">\u201cThat the defendant, May Easton, was sitting on the steps of a house of prostitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-16\">In our opinion, the argument was clearly within the record. However, the learned trial judge instructed the jury to disregard the remarks, and further instructed them that if' they found appellant was sitting on the steps of a house of prostitution, they should not allow that fact to influence their verdict in any way. This bill presents no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Finding no errors in the record, and the facts being sufficient to support the verdict, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b695-7\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b695-8\">HAWKINS, Judge. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"AAqc\">Appellant urges that we were wrong in holding that her bills of exception complaining of argument of the District Attorney present no error. She argues in her motion for rehearing that the evidence did not justify state\u2019s counsel in making the argument complained of. The bills do not certify that no testimony was before the jury upon which such argument could be predicated; they only show that appellant \u201cobjected\u201d to the argument. No ground of objection is stated, but if the ground of objection had been stated to be that no evidence supported the argument it would not have been equivalent to a certificate of such fact but would have been a ground of objection only.

C., and note 21, p. 537, Vol. 2, Vernon\u2019s 1916 Criminal Statutes.)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">Appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
