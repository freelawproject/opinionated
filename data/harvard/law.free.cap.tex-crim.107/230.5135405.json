There are two bills of exception. The complaint in the first is that the state was permitted to prove an oral statement made by appellant to a witness to the effect that he was driving the car in question: This was objected to on the ground that it was not in writing and signed and did not show that appellant was warned, etc., as is required of a statutory confession. The testimony was not offered as a confession. Appellant was not under arrest, and we perceive nothing in the surroundings which would make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>his statement inadmissible unless in writing and appellant warned.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The other bill of exceptions complains of. a statement made by the Assistant District Attorney in his argument to the jury. There is not a particle of showing made in the bill of any reason why the statement by the Assistant District Attorney was not appropriate and entirely within the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
